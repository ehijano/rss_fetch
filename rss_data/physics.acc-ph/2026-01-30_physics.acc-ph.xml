      <title>From Beam to Bedside: Reinforcing Domestic Supply of $^{99}$Mo/$^{99m}$Tc using Novel High-Current D+ Cyclotrons for Compact Neutron Generation and $^{99}$Mo Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Technetium-99m ($^{99m}$Tc) is essential to more than 16 million diagnostic procedures performed annually in the United States. It is typically acquired on-site from generators containing $^{99}$Mo, in turn produced at nuclear reactor facilities. This supply chain involves multiple points of vulnerability, which can lead to shortages and delays with potentially negative patient outcomes. We report on the development of a new family of cyclotrons originally designed for the IsoDAR neutrino experiment, capable of operating at much higher current than typical cyclotrons. When operated with deuterons at 1.5 MeV/amu and an anticipated continuous beam current of 5 mA, simulations project that such a system would yield $\sim$10$^{13}$ neutrons per second using a thin beryllium target. This neutron yield is sufficient, in principle, to support $^{99}$Mo production without the use of highly enriched uranium or reliance on foreign reactors. Simulations and conceptual design studies suggest that the system's beam dynamics could make it a viable pathway toward decentralized, hospital-based isotope generation. The relatively low energy of the deuterons minimizes activation and safety concerns. This work presents the physics motivation, technical design considerations, and projected neutron yields, outlining a pathway from a neutrino-physics prototype to a biomedical isotope production platform.</description>

      <title>Description of electromagnetic fields in inhomogeneous accelerating sections. IV couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new approach to incorporating coupling elements into a generalized coupled mode theory is presented. The simplest model of coupling of a structured waveguide with an external RF power source and load through loops and transmission lines was used. Even such a simple model significantly complicated the system of coupled equations. It turned into a coupled integro-differential system of the Barbashin type with degenerate kernels. Since the integral kernels are degenerate, this system is reduced to three independent systems of differential equations. Instead of solving a system of coupled integro-differential equations, we need to find solutions to three systems of ordinary differential equations. Two systems describe the distribution of the field excited by one loop and the specified value of the excitation current in it. In the first system the loop is located at the section's input, and in the second, at the section's output. The third system does not depend on the loop parameters at all. It describes the distribution of the field excited by an electron beam in a section without loops. Based on the developed analytical model, the computer code was developed for matching the loop couplers for the uniform accelerating sections of X-band. The calculation results were used to simulate the non-uniform section. Without additional matching, we obtained an input reflection coefficient of 8E-3.</description>

      <title>A general framework for interactions between electron beams and quantum optical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework to describe the dynamics of a free-electron beam interacting with quantized bound systems in arbitrary electromagnetic environments. This expands the quantum optics toolbox to incorporate free-electron beams for applications in highly tunable quantum control, imaging, and spectroscopy at the nanoscale. The framework recovers previously studied results and shows that electromagnetic environments can amplify the intrinsically weak coupling between a free-electron and a bound electron to reach previously inaccessible interaction regimes. We leverage this enhanced coupling for experimentally feasible protocols in coherent qubit control and towards the nondestructive readout and projective control of the electron beam's quantum-number statistics. Our framework is broadly applicable to microwave-frequency qubits, optical nanophotonics, cavity quantum electrodynamics, and emerging platforms at the interface of electron microscopy and quantum information.</description>

      <title>Knock Out Slow Extraction Using Betatron Sidebands at High Harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11285v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio frequency knock out resonant slow extraction is a standard method for extracting stored particle beams from synchrotrons by transverse excitation. Excitation signals comprising many betatron sidebands have shown to reduce intensity fluctuations of the extracted beam spill and are used at several facilities. In this contribution, the effect of individual sidebands at different harmonics on the spill quality is systematically studied using efficient noise excitation signals fully covering the respective sidebands. Particle tracking simulations show a clear correlation between the chosen excitation frequency and the spill quality. This relation is attributed to the spectrum of particle motion shortly before their extraction, and an empiric relation between the spectrum, the excitation frequency, and the resulting spill quality is given. Experiments show an additional reduction of pile-up when using higher excitation frequencies. These insights have implications for an optimal design of excitation waveforms and hardware for Knock Out extraction systems.</description>

      <title>Comment on "Monochromatization interaction region optics design for direct s-channel Higgs production at FCC-ee"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The original article [1] can be logically divided into two parts: 1) the selection of main parameters for monochromatization and 2) interaction region optics design; the comment pertains only to the first part. The authors of [1] state that "The purpose of this paper is to report on the development of realistic IR optics designs for monochromatization at the FCC-ee". However, the proposed parameters do not seem very realistic and raise many questions; due to space limitations, we will only consider the most important ones.</description>
