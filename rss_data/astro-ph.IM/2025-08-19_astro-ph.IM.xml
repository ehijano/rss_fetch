      <title>Characterizing, correcting, and repairing the effects of radiation damage in the COSI germanium cross-strip detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a gamma-ray survey telescope utilizing a compact Compton imager design, enabled by an array of 16 high-resolution germanium cross-strip detectors. After its launch into an equatorial Low Earth Orbit (LEO) in 2027, COSI will experience radiation damage primarily due to energetic protons, with the proton fluence dominated by the passage of COSI through the edge of the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) for a few minutes each orbit. We have developed a comprehensive program focused on the modeling, characterization, data correction, and physical repair of radiation damage effects in the COSI detectors. We have performed energetic proton beam irradiations of a spare COSI detector at a proton synchrotron, with proton fluences consistent with multiple years of exposure to the COSI space radiation environment. These exposures allow us to characterize the relationship between proton fluence and induced charge trapping. We demonstrate our techniques to correct for trapping effects, as well as characterize the effectiveness of high-temperature annealing on correcting this damage, as characterized by the resulting spectral performance of the detector. We will present our efforts to characterize the effects of radiation damage in the COSI detectors, as well as our techniques for correcting these effects in the data analysis pipeline and ultimately repairing the detectors on orbit every few years through high-temperature annealing.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Two Astrometric Measuring Methods on Five Known Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data on five Washington Double Star catalog binaries were collected from the Dimension Point Observatory (Mayhill, New Mexico) and Las Cumbres Observatory (Cerro Tololo, Chile) on February 19, 2025, and March 5, 2025, respectively. Student researchers participating in the Four Corners Research Seminar measured the position angle (theta/deg) and separation (rho/arcsec) of each target using AstroImageJ and an author-created script utilizing the Astropy module in Python3. Each target was imaged using a variety of instruments, filters, and exposure times. Compared to the extrapolated 6th Orbit Catalog estimates, measurements using AstroImageJ were within 1.52% of theta and 14.87% of rho, while the author's automated code method provided measurements within 4.09% of theta and 16.59% of rho.</description>

      <title>The Design and Performance Characteristics of the NRL4 ASIC Developed for the COSI Small Explorer Gamma-ray Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation gamma-ray observatories aim to enable precision measurements in high-energy astrophysics using advanced semiconductor detector technologies. Meeting the scientific requirements of modern instruments demands detector systems that provide high spatial and spectral resolution across large detection areas, with strict limits on power consumption and mass. These needs drive innovation in front-end electronics and mixed-signal processing to support compact detector electrode geometries. Application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) are essential in front-end readout electronics, enabling high-channel-density and low-power systems, while maintaining low-noise performance suitable for space-based instruments and balloon-borne payloads. The NRL4 (Naval Research Laboratory 4) is a recently developed 32-channel front-end ASIC featuring low-power, low-noise channels consisting of charge-sensitive preamplifiers, 4 configurable gain settings, dual configurable shapers for optimized timing and energy resolution, trimmable per-channel discrimination, time-to-analog conversion, and peak-detect output. The NRL4 has been integrated with a high-purity germanium (HPGe) dual-sided strip detector with a 1.16 mm strip pitch. Energy resolution of 3 keV full width at half maximum (FWHM) at 59.54 keV was achieved with a gain of 18.4 mV/fC and a slow shaper peaking time of 2 {\mu}s. Preliminary results from ongoing research demonstrate the suitability of the NRL4 for high-resolution, low-power gamma-ray spectroscopy for ground and space-based missions.</description>

      <title>Scalable and robust wide-field facet calibration with LOFAR's longest baselines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work has successfully achieved sub-arcsecond wide-field imaging with high-band observations from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR). However, the scalability of this work remains limited due to the need for manual intervention, poor calibration solutions for the Dutch LOFAR stations, and high computational costs. We address these issues by: (1) improving automated self-calibration using a signal-to-noise metric and a neural network for image artefact detection; (2) implementing a refined calibration strategy for the Dutch LOFAR stations; and (3) cutting computational costs by optimising the data processing strategy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our automated processing strategy by reprocessing one previously reduced dataset and a new dataset from the ELAIS-N1 deep field, which features more severe ionospheric conditions. We find calibration artefacts across facet boundaries to be reduced with our improved automated calibration strategy and achieve a computational cost reduction of about a factor of 4 to 6 compared to previous work, where the exact factor depends on whether a single observation is processed or multiple observations of the same sky area are combined. Further optimisation and improved handling of data with baseline-dependent averaging could reduce this in the near future by another factor of two, bringing the total cost for an 8-hour observation below 30,000 CPU core hours. This work enables ultra-deep imaging at sensitivities on the order of a few $\mu$Jy/beam. Furthermore, it also lays the foundation for a fully automated survey pipeline for sub-arcsecond wide-field imaging of the northern sky with LOFAR.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Uniform Weighting: Pre-conditioning to Improve Image Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "dirty" image made by direct Fourier inversion of visibility data is an important first step in inteferometric imaging. This is where the "deconvolution problem" is defined and the degree to which that problem is either well- or ill-conditioned has direct consequences for the ultimate image fidelity that is achieved in practise. An under-utilised degree of freedom during Fourier imaging is the relative weights that are assigned to the visibility data. We explore the circumstances under which some adjustment of the relative weights might provide improvements to the "dirty" image, and consequently the ultimate post-deconvolution image fidelity. We develop a method to calculate a distinct effective local density estimate for each data point. When used in conjunction with a "uniform" weight correction and the desired clean beam (eg. Gaussian) tapering, it provides a significant improvement in the image quality over that provided by the current pixel-based density estimate. In many cases, particularly spectral-line observations and those with only limited sidereal tracking, this adaptive approach improves the beam quality by a factor of 2 to 10, as measured by the RMS residual relative to the best-fitting clean beam, providing an improvement in final image fidelity that is similar in magnitude.</description>

      <title>The Wrath of KAN: Enabling Fast, Accurate, and Transparent Emulation of the Global 21 cm Cosmology Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), we present a novel emulator of the global 21 cm cosmology signal, $\texttt{21cmKAN}$, that provides extremely fast training speed while achieving nearly equivalent accuracy to the most accurate emulator to date, $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$. The combination of enhanced speed and accuracy facilitated by $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ enables rapid and highly accurate physical parameter estimation analyses of multiple 21 cm models, which is needed to fully characterize the complex feature space across models and produce robust constraints on the early universe. Rather than using static functions to model complex relationships like traditional fully-connected neural networks do, KANs learn expressive transformations that can perform significantly better for low-dimensional physical problems. $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ predicts a given signal for two well-known models in the community in 3.7 ms on average and trains about 75 times faster than $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$, when utilizing the same typical GPU. $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ is able to achieve these speeds because of its learnable, data-driven transformations and its relatively small number of trainable parameters compared to a memory-based emulator. We show that $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ required less than 30 minutes to train and fit these simulated signals and obtain unbiased posterior distributions. We find that the transparent architecture of $\texttt{21cmKAN}$ allows us to conveniently interpret and further validate its emulation results in terms of the sensitivity of the 21 cm signal to each physical parameter. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of KANs and their ability to more quickly and accurately mimic expensive physical simulations in comparison to other types of neural networks.</description>

      <title>The BSN Application-I: Photometric Light Curve Solutions of Contact Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light curve analysis of W UMa-type contact binary systems using MCMC or MC methods can be time-consuming, primarily because the repeated generation of synthetic light curves tends to be relatively slow during the fitting process. Although various approaches have been proposed to address this issue, their implementation is often challenging due to complexity or uncertain performance. In this study, we introduce the BSN application, whose name is taken from the BSN project. The application is designed for analyzing contact binary system light curves, supporting photometric data, and employing an MCMC algorithm for efficient parameter estimation. The BSN application generates synthetic light curves more than 40 times faster than PHOEBE during the MCMC fitting process. The BSN application enhances light curve analysis with an expanded feature set and a more intuitive interface while maintaining compliance with established scientific standards. In addition, we present the first light curve analyses of four contact binary systems based on the TESS data, utilizing the BSN application version 1.0. We also conducted a light curve analysis using the PHOEBE Python code and compared the resulting outputs. Two of the target systems exhibited asymmetries in the maxima of their light curves, which were appropriately modeled by introducing a cold starspot on one of the components. The estimated mass ratios of these total-eclipse systems place them within the category of low mass ratio contact binary stars. The estimation of the absolute parameters for the selected systems was carried out using the $P-a$ empirical relationship. Based on the effective temperatures and masses of the components, three of the target systems were classified as A-subtype, while TIC 434222993 was identified as a W-subtype system.</description>

      <title>Wavelets for power spectral density estimation of gravitational wave data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power spectral density (PSD) estimation is a critical step in gravitational wave (GW) detectors data analysis. The Welch method is a typical non-parametric spectral estimation approach that estimates the PSD of stationary noise by averaging periodograms of several time segments, or by taking the median of periodograms to adapt to non-stationary noise. In this work, we propose a wavelet-based approach for fast PSD estimation of both stationary and non-stationary noise. For stationary noise, we apply wavelet smoothing to the periodogram, avoiding the segmentation step in the Welch method, and enabling PSD estimates with high frequency resolution and low variance. The wavelet smoothing PSD outperforms Welch PSD in matched filtering and parameter estimation. For non-stationary noise, we estimate the PSD by taking the median of wavelet packet coefficients in each frequency bin, which offers greater robustness than the traditional median periodogram method. This work introduces a new PSD estimation approach for GW data analysis and expands the application of wavelet methods in this field.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-based classification of variable stars using phase-folded light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifying variable stars is crucial for advancing our understanding of stellar evolution and dynamics. As large-scale surveys generate increasing volumes of light curve data, the demand for automated and reliable classification techniques continues to grow. Traditional methods often rely on manual feature extraction and selection, which can be labor-intensive and less effective for managing extensive datasets. In this study, we present a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method for classifying variable stars using raw light curve data and their known periods. Our approach eliminates the need for manual feature extraction and preselected preprocessing steps. By applying phase-folding and interpolation to structure the light curves, the model learns variability patterns critical for accurate classification. Trained and evaluated on the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN) dataset, our model achieves an average accuracy of 90% and an F1 score of 0.86 across six well-known classes of variable stars. The CNN effectively handles the diverse shapes and sampling cadences of light curves, offering a robust, automated, data-driven solution for classifying variable stars. This automated, data-driven method provides a robust solution for classifying variable stars, enabling the efficient analysis of large datasets from both current and future sky surveys.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}&gt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.063_{-0.047}^{+0.058}$ or $0.134_{-0.040}^{+0.050}$ for $7\text{ or }8$ binaries with $g_{\rm N}&lt;10^{-9}$m s$^{-2}$ (depending on one system) showing tension with Newton. The Newtonian ``outlier'' is at the boundary set by the Newtonian escape velocity, but can be consistent with modified gravity. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm in measuring gravity at low acceleration with future samples of wide binaries.</description>

      <title>A Neural-Network Framework for Tracking and Identification of Cosmic-Ray Nuclei in the RadMap Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a neural-network framework designed to reconstruct the properties of cosmic-ray nuclei traversing the scintillating-fiber tracking calorimeter of the RadMap Telescope. Employing the Geant4 simulation toolkit and a simplified model of the detector to generate training and test data, we achieve the spectroscopic capabilities required for an accurate determination of the biologically relevant dose that astronauts receive in space. We can reconstruct a particle's trajectory with an angular resolution of better than $1.4^\circ$ and achieve a charge separation of better than $95\%$ for nuclei with $Z\leq8$; specifically, we reach an accuracy of $99.8\%$ for hydrogen. The energy resolution is $&lt;20\%$ for energies below 1 GeV/n and elements up to iron. We also discuss the limitations of our detector, the reconstruction framework, and this feasibility study, as well as possible improvements.</description>

      <title>Morphological classification of eclipsing binary stars using computer vision methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an application of computer vision methods to classify the light curves of eclipsing binaries (EB). We have used pre-trained models based on convolutional neural networks ($\textit{ResNet50}$) and vision transformers ($\textit{vit\_base\_patch16\_224}$), which were fine-tuned on images created from synthetic datasets. To improve model generalisation and reduce overfitting, we developed a novel image representation by transforming phase-folded light curves into polar coordinates combined with hexbin visualisation. Our hierarchical approach in the first stage classifies systems into detached and overcontact types, and in the second stage identifies the presence or absence of spots. The binary classification models achieved high accuracy ($&gt;96\%$) on validation data across multiple passbands (Gaia~$G$, $I$, and $TESS$) and demonstrated strong performance ($&gt;94\%$, up to $100\%$ for $TESS$) when tested on extensive observational data from the OGLE, DEBCat, and WUMaCat catalogues. While the primary binary classification was highly successful, the secondary task of automated spot detection performed poorly, revealing a significant limitation of our models for identifying subtle photometric features. This study highlights the potential of computer vision for EB morphological classification in large-scale surveys, but underscores the need for further research into robust, automated spot detection.</description>

Abstract: Doppler Imaging (DI) is a well-established technique to map a physical field at a stellar surface from a time series of high-resolution spectra. In this proof-of-concept study, we aim to show that traditional DI algorithms, originally designed for rapidly-rotating stars, have also the ability to model the activity of Sun-like stars, when observed with new-generation highly-stable spectrographs, and search for low-mass planets around them. We used DI to retrieve the relative brightness distribution at the surface of the Sun from radial velocity (RV) observations collected by HARPS-N between 2022 and 2024. The brightness maps obtained with DI have a typical angular resolution of about 36 degrees and are a good match to low-resolution disc-resolved Dopplergrams of the Sun at epochs when the absolute, disc-integrated RV exceeds ~2 m/s. The RV residuals after DI correction exhibit a dispersion of about 0.6 m/s, comparable with existing state-of-the-art activity correction techniques. Using planet injection-recovery tests, we also show that DI can be a powerful tool for blind planet searches, so long as the orbital period is larger than ~100days (i.e. 3 to 4 stellar rotation periods), and that it yields planetary mass estimates with an accuracy comparable to, for example, multi-dimensional Gaussian process regression. Finally, we highlight some limitations of traditional DI algorithms, which should be addressed to make DI a reliable alternative to state-of-the-art RV-based planet search techniques.</description>

      <title>In-Flight Performance of Spider's 280 GHz Receivers</title>

Abstract: SPIDER is a balloon-borne instrument designed to map the cosmic microwave background at degree-angular scales in the presence of Galactic foregrounds. SPIDER has mapped a large sky area in the Southern Hemisphere using more than 2000 transition-edge sensors (TESs) during two NASA Long Duration Balloon flights above the Antarctic continent. During its first flight in January 2015, SPIDER observed in the 95 GHz and 150 GHz frequency bands, setting constraints on the B-mode signature of primordial gravitational waves. Its second flight in the 2022-2023 season added new receivers at 280 GHz, each using an array of TESs coupled to the sky through feedhorns formed from stacks of silicon wafers. These receivers are optimized to produce deep maps of polarized Galactic dust emission over a large sky area, providing a unique data set with lasting value to the field. We describe the instrument's performance during SPIDER's second flight, focusing on the performance of the 280 GHz receivers. We include details on the flight, in-band optical loading at float, and an early analysis of detector noise.</description>

Abstract: Vela is a package for performing Bayesian pulsar timing &amp; noise analysis written in Julia and Python. In the wideband paradigm of pulsar timing, simultaneous time of arrival and dispersion measure measurements are derived from a radio observation using frequency-resolved integrated pulse profiles and templates without splitting the observation into multiple frequency sub-bands. We describe the implementation of the wideband timing paradigm in Vela, and demonstrate its usage using the NANOGrav 12.5-year wideband data of PSR J1923+2515. Vela is the first software package to provide this functionality.</description>

      <title>Direct High-Resolution Imaging of Earth-Like Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have surveyed all conventional methods proposed or conceivable for obtaining resolved images of an Earth-like exoplanet. Generating a 10 x 10 pixel map of a 1 R_E world at 10 pc demands ~0.85 uas angular resolution and photon-collection sufficient for SNR &gt;= 5 per "micro-pixel." We derived diffraction-limit and photon-budget requirements for: (1) large single-aperture space telescopes with internal coronagraphs; (2) external-starshades; (3) space-based interferometry (nulling and non-nulling); (4) ground-based ELTs with extreme AO; (5) pupil-densified "hypertelescopes"; (6) indirect reconstructions (rotational light-curve inversion, eclipse mapping, intensity interferometry); and (7) diffraction-occultation by Solar System bodies. Even though these approaches serve their primary goals-exoplanet discovery and initial coarse characterization--each remains orders of magnitude away from delivering a spatially resolved image. In every case, technology readiness falls short, and fundamental barriers leave them 2-5 orders of magnitude below the angular resolution and photon-budget thresholds needed to map an Earth analog even on decadal timescales. Ultimately, an in-situ platform delivered to &lt;= 0.1 AU of the target could, in principle, overcome both diffraction and photon-starvation limits--but such a mission far exceeds current propulsion, autonomy, and communications capabilities. By contrast, the Solar Gravitational Lens--providing on-axis gain of ~1e10 and inherent uas-scale focusing once an imaging spacecraft reaches beyond &gt;=550 AU--appears uniquely capable of simultaneously meeting both the resolution and photon-budget requirements. The SGL thus enables true, resolved surface images and spatially resolved spectroscopy of Earth-like exoplanets in our stellar neighborhood, provided several mission-specific risks (coronal calibration, focal-plane scanning, deconvolution) are retired.</description>

      <title>First release of LiteBIRD simulations from an end-to-end pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07122v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The LiteBIRD satellite mission aims at detecting Cosmic Microwave Background $B$ modes with unprecedented precision, targeting a total error on the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ of $\delta r \sim 0.001$. Operating from the L2 Lagrangian point of the Sun-Earth system, LiteBIRD will survey the full sky across 15 frequency bands (34 to 448 GHz) for 3 years.The current LiteBIRD baseline configuration employs 4508 detectors sampling at 19.1 Hz to achieve an effective polarization sensitivity of $ 2 \mu\mathrm{K-arcmin}$ and an angular resolution of 31 arcmin (at 140 GHz).We describe the first release of the official LiteBIRD simulations, realized with a new simulation pipeline developed using the LiteBIRD Simulation Framework, see https://github.com/litebird/litebird_sim . This pipeline generates 500 full-sky simulated maps at a Healpix resolution of nside=512. The simulations include also one year of Time Ordered Data for approximately one-third of LiteBIRD's total detectors.</description>

      <title>New black hole mergers in the LIGO-Virgo O3 data from a gravitational wave search including higher-order harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nearly all of the previous gravitational wave (GW) searches in the LIGO-Virgo data included GW waveforms with only the dominant quadrupole harmonic, i.e., omitting higher-order harmonics which are predicted by general relativity. We improved the IAS pipeline by efficiently introducing higher harmonics in the GW templates using the techniques in Wadekar et al. [1, 2]. Using the IAS-HM pipeline on the public LIGO-Virgo data from the O3 run, we find 11 new candidate BBH mergers with $0.52\leq p_\mathrm{astro}\leq 0.88$ (we use the detection threshold as the astrophysical probability, $p_\mathrm{astro}$, being over 0.5, following the approach of other pipelines). We broadly recover the high-significance events from earlier catalogs, except a few which were vetoed. We also find that including higher harmonics in our search raises the significance of a few previously reported marginal events (e.g., GW190711_030756).
  A few notable properties of our new candidate events are as follows. At $&gt;95$% credibility, 4 candidates have primary masses in the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) range (i.e., above $\sim$100 $M_\odot$). 5 candidates have median mass ratio $q \leq 0.5$. 5 candidates have median redshift $z \geq 0.8$. 3 candidates have non-zero $\chi_{\rm eff}$ at $&gt;95\%$ credibility. While our new candidate events have modest false alarm rates ($\gtrsim 1.5 $/yr), a population inference study including these can better inform the parameter space of BHs corresponding to the pair instability mass gap, high redshifts and asymmetric mass ratios.</description>

      <title>NutMaat: A Python package for stellar spectral classification on the MK system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar spectral classification according to the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system remains fundamental to astrophysical studies, yet modern surveys require automated, scalable tools. We present NutMaat, an open-source Python-based package inspired by MKCLASS, designed to automate MK classification while addressing scalability and usability limitations. It employs modern computational tools for batch processing and offers a modular architecture that enables efficient, platform-independent analysis of large spectral datasets. It also includes modules for detecting classical chemically peculiar stars, such as Am, Ap, and $\lambda$ Boo types, using internal consistency checks between different line diagnostics. Tested on the CFLIB and MILES libraries, NutMaat achieved spectral and luminosity classification accuracies comparable to MKCLASS, with minimal systematic offsets and a robust performance down to S/N $\le$ 10. NutMaat successfully identified chemically peculiar stars, tested on LAMOST DR7 ACV variables, and processed the SDSS-IV MaStar library -- which lacks native MK classifications -- to produce a stellar catalog, demonstrating survey readiness. Future development of NutMaat will focus on extending wavelength coverage beyond the 3800--5600 $\r{A}$ range, computational acceleration via Cython, and refining peculiarity classification. Beyond its technical design, NutMaat can provide consistent, MK-standard classification across large-scale spectroscopic surveys, facilitating reliable stellar population analyses, identification of rare objects, and the construction of high-quality spectral catalogs essential for galactic archaeology and stellar evolution studies. As an open-source tool, NutMaat bridges traditional MK methods with modern data workflows, offering a scalable solution for current and future spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Exploring lensing signatures through spectrotemporal correlations: implications for black hole parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme gravitational lensing and relativistic frequency shifts, combined together, imply that radiation emitted from a black hole's vicinity can echo at different frequencies and times, leading to spectrotemporal correlations in observed signals. If such correlations are uncovered by future observations, they could provide a probe of the spacetime geometry in the strong-field region near black holes. Here, motivated by these prospects, we numerically compute the two-point correlation function of specific flux fluctuations in a simple model of line emission by a hotspot in an equatorial circular orbit. We make use of the Adaptive Analytical Ray Tracing (AART) code to generate the light curves we then correlate. Our results for the correlation maps show a clear decomposition into direct emission-dominated, and lensing-dominated contributions. The computation transcends past analytical approximations, studying the main contribution to the correlation function, which is not deep in the universal regime. We compute correlation maps for many combinations of black hole mass, spin, inclination, hotspot width, and orbital radius, and study their dependence on these parameters. The correlation maps are then used to train convolutional neural networks which can be used to estimate source parameters, achieving promisingly low evaluation errors within the model. Our results could be relevant for future X-ray spectroscopic missions, offering insights into black hole parameter inference.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings-induced CMB anisotropies in light of Weighted Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the morphological measures in assessing the geometrical and topological properties of a generic cosmological stochastic field, we propose an extension of the weighted morphological measures, specifically the $n$th conditional moments of derivative (cmd-$n$). This criterion assigns a distinct weight to each excursion set point based on the associated field. We apply the cmd-$n$ on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to identify the cosmic string networks (CSs) through their unique Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins effect on the temperature anisotropies. We also formulate the perturbative expansion of cmd-$n$ for the weak non-Gaussian regime up to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma_0^3)$. We propose a comprehensive pipeline designed to analyze the morphological properties of string-induced CMB maps within the flat sky approximation. To evaluate the robustness of our proposed criteria, we employ string-induced high-resolution flat-sky CMB simulated patches of $7.2$ deg$^2$ size with a resolution of $0.42$ arc-minutes. Our results demonstrate that the minimum detectable value of cosmic string tension is $G\mu\gtrsim 1.9\times 10^{-7}$ when a noise-free map is analyzed with normalized cmd-$n$. Whereas for the ACT, CMB-S4, and Planck-like experiments at 95.45\% confidence level, the normalized cmd-$n$ can distinguish the CSs network for $G\mu\gtrsim2.9 \times 10^{-7}$, $G\mu\gtrsim 2.4\times 10^{-7}$ and $G\mu\gtrsim 5.8\times 10^{-7}$, respectively. The normalized cmd-$n$ exhibits a significantly enhanced capability in detecting CSs relative to the Minkowski Functionals.</description>

      <title>XL-Calibur measurements of polarised hard X-ray emission from the Crab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report measurements of the linear polarisation degree (PD) and angle (PA) for hard X-ray emission from the Crab pulsar and wind nebula. Measurements were made with the XL-Calibur ($\sim$15-80 keV) balloon-borne Compton-scattering polarimeter in July 2024. The polarisation parameters are determined using a Bayesian analysis of Stokes parameters obtained from X-ray scattering angles. Well-constrained ($\sim$8.5$\sigma$) results are obtained for the polarisation of the $\sim$19-64 keV signal integrated over all pulsar phases: PD=(25.1$\pm$2.9)% and PA=(129.8$\pm$3.2)$^\circ$. In the off-pulse (nebula-dominated) phase range, the PD is constrained at $\sim$4.5$\sigma$ and is compatible with the phase-integrated result. The PA of the nebular hard X-ray emission aligns with that measured by IXPE in the 2-8 keV band for the toroidal inner region of the pulsar wind nebula, where the hard X-rays predominantly originate. For the main pulsar peak, PD=(32.8$^{+18.2}_{-28.5}$)% and PA=(156.0 $\pm$ 21.7)$^\circ$, while for the second peak (inter-pulse), PD=(0.0$^{+33.6}_{-0.0}$)% and PA=(154.5 $\pm$ 34.5)$^\circ$. A low level of polarisation in the pulsar peaks likely does not favour emission originating from the inner regions of the pulsar magnetosphere. Discriminating between Crab pulsar emission models will require deeper observations, e.g. with a satellite-borne hard X-ray polarimeter.</description>

      <title>A Distribution-Free Approach to Testing Models for Angular Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel goodness-of-fit strategy is introduced for testing models of angular power spectra with unknown parameters. Using this strategy, it is possible to assess the validity of such models without specifying the distribution of the angular power spectrum estimators. This holds under general conditions, ensuring the method's applicability in diverse applications. Moreover, the proposed solution overcomes the need for case-by-case simulations when testing different models, leading to notable computational advantages.</description>

      <title>Starobinsky in Stereo: SKA-CMB Synergy in SBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning techniques can unlock the vast cosmological information encoded in forthcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) observations. We show that tomographic 21 cm data from the reionisation era can yield stringent tests of inflationary models - here illustrated with Starobinsky $R+R^2$ inflation. Using a simulation-based inference (SBI) framework, we compare neural summaries (convolutional network and vision transformer) with a traditional power spectrum summary and perform a fully joint SBI analysis combining 21 cm data with data of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Forecasts based on realistic mock observations indicate that SKA alone will achieve constraints competitive with Planck, and that the combined SKA + CMB dataset will tighten bounds on both inflationary and $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ parameters considerably while improving precision on key astrophysical quantities.</description>
