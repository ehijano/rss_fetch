      <title>Localization for Random Schr\"odinger Operators Defined by Block Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider discrete one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators with random potentials obtained via a block code applied to an i.i.d. sequence of random variables. It is shown that, almost surely, these operators exhibit spectral and dynamical localization, the latter away from a finite set of exceptional energies. We make no assumptions beyond non-triviality, neither on the regularity of the underlying random variables, nor on the linearity, the monotonicity, or even the continuity of the block code. Central to our proof is a reduction to the non-stationary Anderson model via Fubini.</description>

      <title>On eigenvibrations of branched structures with heterogeneous mass density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We deal with a spectral problem for the Laplace-Beltrami operator posed on a stratified set $\Omega$ which is composed of smooth surfaces joined along a line $\gamma$, the junction. Through this junction we impose the Kirchhoff-type vertex conditions, which imply the continuity of the solutions and some balance for normal derivatives, and Neumann conditions on the rest of the boundary of the surfaces. Assuming that the density is $O(\varepsilon^{-m})$ along small bands of width $O(\varepsilon)$, which collapse into the line $\gamma$ as $\varepsilon$ tends to zero, and it is $O(1)$ outside these bands, we address the asymptotic behavior, as $\varepsilon\to 0$, of the eigenvalues and of the corresponding eigenfunctions for a parameter $m\geq 1$. We also study the asymptotics for high frequencies when $m\in(1,2)$.</description>

      <title>On the problem of recovery of Sturm--Liouville operator with two frozen arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse spectral problems consist in recovering operators by their spectral characteristics. The problem of recovering the Sturm-Liouville operator with one frozen argument was studied earlier in works of various authors. In this paper, we study a uniqueness of recovering operator with two frozen arguments and different coefficients p, q by the spectra of two boundary value problems. The case considered here is significantly more difficult than the case of one frozen argument, because the operator is no more a one-dimensional perturbation. We prove that the operator with two frozen arguments, in general case, can not be recovered by the two spectra. For the uniqueness of recovering, one should impose some conditions on the coefficients. We assume that the coefficients p and q equal zero on certain segment and prove a uniqueness theorem. As well, we obtain regularized trace formulae for the two spectra. The result is formulated in terms of convergence of certain series, which allows us to avoid restrictions on the smoothness of the coefficients.</description>

      <title>Smooth linear eigenvalue statistics on random covers of compact hyperbolic surfaces -- A central limit theorem and almost sure RMT statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study smooth linear spectral statistics of twisted Laplacians on random $n$-covers of a fixed compact hyperbolic surface $X$. We consider two aspects of such statistics. The first is the fluctuations of such statistics in a small energy window around a fixed energy level when averaged over the space of all degree $n$ covers of $X$. The second is the energy variance of a typical surface.
  In the first case, we show a central limit theorem. Specifically, we show that the distribution of such fluctuations tends to a Gaussian with variance given by the corresponding quantity for the Gaussian Orthogonal/Unitary Ensemble (GOE/GUE). In the second case, we show that the energy variance of a typical random $n$-cover is that of the GOE/GUE. In both cases, we consider a double limit where first we let $n$, the covering degree, go to $\infty$ then let $L\to \infty$ where $1/L$ is the window length.</description>

      <title>Uniform stability for the inverse Sturm-Liouville problem with eigenparameter-dependent boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of self-adjoint Sturm-Liouville problems with rational functions of the spectral parameter in the boundary conditions. The uniform stability for direct and inverse spectral problems is proved for the first time for Sturm-Liouville operator pencils with boundary conditions depending on the eigenparameter. Furthermore, we obtain stability estimates for finite data approximations, which are important from the practical viewpoint. Our method is based on Darboux-type transforms and proving of their Lipschitz continuity.</description>

      <title>On the optimal sets in P\'olya and Makai type inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine some shape functionals, introduced by P\'olya and Makai, involving the torsional rigidity and the first Dirichlet-Laplacian eigenvalue for bounded, open and convex sets of $\mathbb{R}^n$. We establish new quantitative bounds, which give us key properties and information on the behavior of the optimizing sequences. In particular, we consider two kinds of reminder terms that provide information about the structure of these minimizing sequences, such as information about the thickness.</description>
