      <title>Investigating Student Participation in Quantum Workforce Initiatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the focus of quantum science shifts from basic research to development and implementation of applied quantum technology, calls for a robust, diverse quantum workforce have increased. However, little research has been done on the design and impact on participants of workforce preparation efforts outside of R1 contexts. In order to begin to answer the question of how program design can or should attend to the needs and interests of diverse groups of students, we performed interviews with students from two Colorado-based quantum education/workforce development programs, one in an undergraduate R1 setting and one in a distributed community setting and serving students largely from two-year colleges. Through analysis of these interviews, we were able to highlight differences between the student populations in the two programs in terms of participation goals, prior and general awareness of quantum science, and career interest and framing of career trajectories. While both groups of students reported benefits from program participation, we highlight the ways in which students' different needs and contexts have informed divergent development of the two programs, framing contextual design of quantum education and workforce efforts as an issue of equity and representation for the burgeoning quantum workforce.</description>

      <title>Achieving Human Level Partial Credit Grading of Written Responses to Physics Conceptual Question using GPT-3.5 with Only Prompt Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language modules (LLMs) have great potential for auto-grading student written responses to physics problems due to their capacity to process and generate natural language. In this explorative study, we use a prompt engineering technique, which we name "scaffolded chain of thought (COT)", to instruct GPT-3.5 to grade student written responses to a physics conceptual question. Compared to common COT prompting, scaffolded COT prompts GPT-3.5 to explicitly compare student responses to a detailed, well-explained rubric before generating the grading outcome. We show that when compared to human raters, the grading accuracy of GPT-3.5 using scaffolded COT is 20% - 30% higher than conventional COT. The level of agreement between AI and human raters can reach 70% - 80%, comparable to the level between two human raters. This shows promise that an LLM-based AI grader can achieve human-level grading accuracy on a physics conceptual problem using prompt engineering techniques alone.</description>

      <title>Comparing student performance on a multi-attempt asynchronous assessment to a single-attempt synchronous assessment in introductory level physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current paper examines the possibility of replacing conventional synchronous single-attempt exam with more flexible and accessible multi-attempt asynchronous assessments in introductory-level physics by using large isomorphic problem banks. We compared student's performance on both numeric and conceptual problems administered on a multi-attempt, asynchronous quiz to their performance on isomorphic problems administered on a subsequent single-attempt, synchronous exam. We computed the phi coefficient and the McNemar's test statistic for the correlation matrix between paired problems on both assessments as a function of the number of attempts considered on the quiz. We found that for the conceptual problems, a multi-attempt quiz with five allowed attempts could potentially replace similar problems on a single-attempt exam, while there was a much weaker association for the numerical questions beyond two quiz attempts.</description>

      <title>Navigating Socio-Emotional Risk through Comfort-Building in a Physics Teaching Community of Practice: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In teacher professional development (PD), grouping teachers with varying levels of experience can be a productive and empowering way to stimulate the exchange and co-generation of content and pedagogical knowledge. However, less experienced teachers can face socio-emotional risks when engaging in collaborative science content reasoning tasks with more experienced colleagues (Finkelstein, Jaber, &amp; Dini, 2018), and these risks may impact the collaborative experience of both parties and the learning environment in teacher PD. This descriptive case study examines the process of productively navigating socio-emotional risks and interpersonal tensions encountered by a veteran and pre-service physics teacher during one episode of discussing physics content. We use a single term, comfort-building, to encapsulate discursive moves that result in increased feelings of comfort and safety by the participants. Comfort-building includes moves that serve to mitigate social risk, ease tension, and avoid discomfort, as well as those geared toward finding common ground and co-navigating challenges. These moves can carve out conversational space for teachers to more confidently face risks associated with being accountable to the physics content knowledge and engage in discipline-based conversations more deeply. The presented episode in this study was followed by video-stimulated individual interviews to determine how consciously the teachers connected their participation to explicit risk and comfort. This case study highlights an affective dimension for consideration in the continued study and facilitation of science teaching communities of practice, especially ones that bring together teachers with a variety of backgrounds and skill sets.</description>
