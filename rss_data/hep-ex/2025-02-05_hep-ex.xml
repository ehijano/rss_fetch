      <title>Measurement of jet track functions in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of jet substructure are key to probing the energy frontier at colliders, and many of them use track-based observables which take advantage of the angular precision of tracking detectors. Theoretical calculations of track-based observables require `track functions', which characterize the transverse momentum fraction $r_q$ carried by charged hadrons from a fragmenting quark or gluon. This letter presents a direct measurement of $r_q$ distributions in dijet events from the 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector. The data are corrected for detector effects using machine-learning methods. The scale evolution of the moments of the $r_q$ distribution is sensitive to non-linear renormalization group evolution equations of QCD, and is compared with analytic predictions. When incorporated into future theoretical calculations, these results will enable a precision program of theory-data comparison for track-based jet substructure observables.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic operation of silicon photomultiplier arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHCb experiment at CERN has been upgraded for the Run 3 operation of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A new concept of tracking detector based on Scintillating Fibres (SciFi) read out with multichannel silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) was installed during its upgrade. One of the main challenges the SciFi tracker will face during the Run 4 operation of the LHC is the higher radiation environment due to fast neutrons, where the SiPMs are located. To cope with the increase in radiation, cryogenic cooling with liquid nitrogen is being investigated as a possible solution to mitigate the performance degradation of the SiPMs induced by radiation damage. Thus, a detailed performance study of different layouts of SiPM arrays produced by Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) and Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. is being carried out. These SiPMs have been designed to operate at cryogenic temperatures. Several SiPMs have been tested in a dedicated cryogenic setup down to 100 K. Key performance parameters such as breakdown voltage, dark count rate, photon detection efficiency, gain and direct cross-talk are characterized as a function of the temperature. The main results of this study are going to be presented here.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of FPGA and GPU Performance for Machine Learning-Based Track Reconstruction at LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-energy physics, the increasing luminosity and detector granularity at the Large Hadron Collider are driving the need for more efficient data processing solutions. Machine Learning has emerged as a promising tool for reconstructing charged particle tracks, due to its potentially linear computational scaling with detector hits. The recent implementation of a graph neural network-based track reconstruction pipeline in the first level trigger of the LHCb experiment on GPUs serves as a platform for comparative studies between computational architectures in the context of high-energy physics. This paper presents a novel comparison of the throughput of ML model inference between FPGAs and GPUs, focusing on the first step of the track reconstruction pipeline$\unicode{x2013}$an implementation of a multilayer perceptron. Using HLS4ML for FPGA deployment, we benchmark its performance against the GPU implementation and demonstrate the potential of FPGAs for high-throughput, low-latency inference without the need for an expertise in FPGA development and while consuming significantly less power.</description>

      <title>Impact of Seismic Activities on the Optical Synchronization System of the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of seismic activities on the optical synchronization system of the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser. We analyze the controller I/O data of phase-locked-loops in length-stabilized links, focusing on the response to earthquakes, ocean-generated microseism and civilization noise. By comparing the controller data with external data, we were able to identify disturbances and their effects on the control signals. Our results show that seismic events influence the stability of the phase-locked loops. Even earthquakes that are approximately \qty{5000}{\km} away cause remarkable fluctuations in the in-loop control signals. Ocean-generated microseism in particular has an enormous influence on the in-loop control signals due to its constant presence. The optical synchronization system is so highly sensitive that it can even identify vibrations caused by civilization, such as road traffic or major events like concerts or sport events. The phase-locked loops manages to eliminate more than 99% of the existing interference.</description>

      <title>Particle Trajectory Representation Learning with Masked Point Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have been key to unlocking large datasets for representation learning. While many promising methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs, their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized knowledge, remains in its early stages. We present a self-supervised masked modeling framework for 3D particle trajectory analysis in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). These detectors produce globally sparse (&lt;1% occupancy) but locally dense point clouds, capturing meter-scale particle trajectories at millimeter resolution. Starting with PointMAE, this work proposes volumetric tokenization to group sparse ionization points into resolution-agnostic patches, as well as an auxiliary energy infilling task to improve trajectory semantics. This approach -- which we call Point-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE) -- achieves 99.4% track and 97.7% shower classification F-scores, matching that of supervised baselines without any labeled data. While the model learns rich particle trajectory representations, it struggles with sub-token phenomena like overlapping or short-lived particle trajectories. To support further research, we release PILArNet-M -- the largest open LArTPC dataset (1M+ events, 5.2B labeled points) -- to advance SSL in high energy physics (HEP).

      <title>Direct Dark Matter searches with Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar materials with optical phonons in the meV range are excellent candidates for both dark matter direct detection (via dark photon-mediated scattering) and light dark matter absorption. In this study, we propose, for the first time, the metal halide perovskites MAPbI$_3$, MAPbCl$_3$, and CsPbI$_3$ for these purposes. Our findings reveal that CsPbI$_3$ is the best material, significantly improving exclusion limits compared to other polar materials. For scattering, CsPbI$_3$ can probe dark matter masses down to the keV range. For absorption, it enhances sensitivity to detect dark photon masses below $\sim 10~{\rm meV}$. The only material which has so far been investigated and that could provide competitive bounds is CsI, which, however, is challenging to grow in kilogram-scale sizes due to its considerably lower stability compared to CsPbI$_3$. Moreover, CsI is isotropic while the anisotropic structure of CsPbI$_3$ enables daily modulation analysis, showing that a significant percentage of daily modulation exceeding 1% is achievable for dark matter masses below $40~{\rm keV}$.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Detector Optimization with Diffusion models: A Case Study in Sampling Calorimeters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have opened new avenues for optimizing detector designs in high-energy physics, where the complex interplay of geometry, materials, and physics processes has traditionally posed a significant challenge. In this work, we introduce the $\textit{end-to-end}$ optimization framework AIDO that leverages a diffusion model as a surrogate for the full simulation and reconstruction chain, enabling gradient-based design exploration in both continuous and discrete parameter spaces. Although this framework is applicable to a broad range of detectors, we illustrate its power using the specific example of a sampling calorimeter, focusing on charged pions and photons as representative incident particles. Our results demonstrate that the diffusion model effectively captures critical performance metrics for calorimeter design, guiding the automatic search for layer arrangement and material composition that aligns with known calorimeter principles. The success of this proof-of-concept study provides a foundation for future applications of end-to-end optimization to more complex detector systems, offering a promising path toward systematically exploring the vast design space in next-generation experiments.</description>

      <title>Measured gain suppression in FBK LGADs with different active thicknesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the gain suppression mechanism has been studied for large localized charge deposits in Low-Gain Avalanche Detectors (LGADs). LGADs are a thin silicon detector with a highly doped gain layer that provides moderate internal signal amplification. Using the CENPA Tandem accelerator at the University of Washington, the response of LGADs with different thicknesses to MeV-range energy deposits from a proton beam were studied. Three LGAD prototypes of 50~$\mu$m, 100~$\mu$m, 150~$\mu$m were characterized. The devices' gain was determined as a function of bias voltage, incidence beam angle, and proton energy. This study was conducted in the scope of the PIONEER experiment, an experiment proposed at the Paul Scherrer Institute to perform high-precision measurements of rare pion decays. LGADs are considered for the active target (ATAR) and energy linearity is an important property for particle ID capabilities.</description>

      <title>Characterization of CMOS sensor using X-ray irradiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in particle physics demand pixel detectors that can withstand increased luminosity in the future collider experiments. In response, MALTA, a novel monolithic active pixel detector, has been developed with a cutting-edge readout architecture. This new class of monolithic pixel detectors is found to have exceptional radiation tolerance, superior hit rates, higher resolution and precise timing resolution, making them ideally suited for experiments at the LHC. To optimize the performance of these sensors before their deployment in actual detectors, comprehensive electrical characterization has been conducted. This study also includes comparative DAC analyses among sensors of varying thicknesses, providing crucial insights for performance enhancement. For the further understanding of the effect of radiation, the sensors are being exposed to different fluence using high intensity X-ray source.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Induced Charged Current Coherent Pion Production for Constraining the Muon Neutrino Flux at DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study neutrino induced charge current coherent pion production ($\nu_\mu\text{CC-Coh}\pi$) as a tool for constraining the neutrino flux at the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). The neutrino energy and flavor in the process can be directly reconstructed from the outgoing particles, making it especially useful to specifically constrain the muon neutrino component of the total flux. The cross section of this process can be obtained using the Adler relation with the $\pi$-Ar elastic scattering cross section, taken either from external data or, as we explore, from a simultaneous measurement in the DUNE near detector. We develop a procedure that leverages $\nu_\mu\text{CC-Coh}\pi$ events to fit for the neutrino flux while simultaneously accounting for relevant effects in the cross section. We project that this method has the statistical power to constrain the uncertainty on the normalization of the flux at its peak to a few percent. This study demonstrates the potential utility of a $\nu_\mu\text{CC-Coh}\pi$ flux constraint, though further work will be needed to determine the range of validity and precision of the Adler relation upon which it relies, as well as to measure the $\pi$-Ar elastic scattering cross section to the requisite precision. We discuss the experimental and phenomenological developments necessary to unlock the $\nu_\mu\text{CC-Coh}\pi$ process as a "standard candle'' for neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Search for light long-lived particles decaying to displaced jets in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13.6 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search for light long-lived particles decaying to displaced jets is presented, using a data sample of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 34.7 fb$^{-1}$, collected with the CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2022. Novel trigger, reconstruction, and machine-learning techniques were developed for and employed in this search. After all selections, the observations are consistent with the background predictions. Limits are presented on the branching fraction of the Higgs boson to long-lived particles that subsequently decay to quark pairs or tau lepton pairs. An improvement by up to a factor of 10 is achieved over previous limits for models with long-lived particle masses smaller than 60 GeV and proper decay lengths smaller than 1 m. The first constraints are placed on the fraternal twin Higgs and folded supersymmetry models, where the lower bounds on the top quark partner mass reach up to 350 GeV for the fraternal twin Higgs model and 250 GeV for the folded supersymmetry model.</description>

Abstract: We present results from a state-of-the-art fit of electroweak precision observables and Higgs-boson signal-strength measurements performed using 7 and 8 TeV data from the Large Hadron Collider. Based on the HEPfit package, our study updates the traditional fit of electroweak precision observables and extends it to include Higgs-boson measurements. As a result we obtain constraints on new physics corrections to both electroweak observables and Higgs-boson couplings. We present the projected accuracy of the fit taking into account the expected sensitivities at future colliders.</description>

      <title>A New Determination of the (Z,A) Dependence of Coherent Muon-to-Electron Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Should muon-to-electron conversion in the field of a nucleus be found in the current generation of experiments, the measurement of the atomic number dependence of the process will become an important experimental goal. We present a new treatment of the (Z,A) dependence of coherent muon-to-electron conversion in 236 isotopes. Our approach differs from previous treatments in several ways. Firstly, we include the effect of permanent quadrupole deformation on the charged lepton flavor violating matrix elements, using the method of Barrett moments. This method also enables the addition of muonic X-ray nuclear size and shape determinations of the charge distribution to the electron scattering results used previously. Secondly, we employ a Hartree-Bogoliubov model to calculate neutron-related matrix elements for even-even nuclei. This takes into account the quadrupole deformation of the neutron distributions and the fact that neutrons are, in general, in different shell model orbits than protons. The calculated conversion rates differ from previous calculations, particularly in the region of large permanent quadrupole deformation. Finally, we propose an alternative normalization of the muon-to-electron conversion rated, which related more closely to what a given experiment acturally measures, and better separate lepton physics from nuclear physics effects.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay: long range quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02602v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We re-introduce, in light of our modern understanding of neutrinos, the concept of ``macroscopic neutrinoless double beta decay" (MDBD) for Majorana neutrinos. In this process an antineutrino produced by a nucleus undergoing beta decay, $X\to Y + e^- + \bar \nu_e$, is absorbed as a neutrino by another identical $X$ nucleus via the inverse beta decay reaction, $\nu_e + X \to e^-+Y$. The distinct signature of MDBD is that the total kinetic energy of the two electrons equals twice the endpoint energy of single beta decay. The amplitude for MDBD, a coherent sum over the contribution of different mass states of the intermediate neutrinos, reflects quantum coherence over macroscopic distances, and is a new macroscopic quantum effect. We evaluate the rate of MDBD for a macroscopic sample of ``$X$" material, e.g., tritium, acting both as the source and the target. The accidental background for MDBD originating from two separate single beta decays, which contains two final state neutrinos, can be readily rejected by measuring the energy of the detected two electrons. We discuss the similarities and differences between the MDBD and conventional neutrinoless double beta decay.</description>

      <title>Solar Neutrinos and the Strongest Oscillation Constraints on Scalar NSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalar non-standard neutrino interactions (sNSI) is a scenario where neutrinos can develop a medium dependent contribution to their mass due to a new scalar mediator. This scenario differs from the commonly discussed vector mediator case in that the oscillation effect scales with density rather than density and neutrino energy. Thus the strongest oscillation constraint comes from solar neutrinos which experience the largest density in a neutrino oscillation experiment. We derive constraints on all the sNSI parameters as well as the absolute neutrino mass scale by combining solar and reactor data and find solar neutrinos to be $&gt;1$ order of magnitude more sensitive to sNSI than terrestrial probes such as long-baseline experiments.</description>

      <title>Moments of Axial-Vector GPD from Lattice QCD: Quark Helicity, Orbital Angular Momentum, and Spin-Orbit Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the Mellin moments of the twist-2 axial-vector generalized parton distribution (GPD), $\widetilde{H}(x,\xi,t)$, at zero skewness, $\xi$, with multiple values of the momentum transfer, $t$. Our analysis employs the short-distance factorization framework on ratio-scheme renormalized quasi-GPD matrix elements. The calculations are based on an $N_f=2+1+1$ twisted mass fermions ensemble with clover improvement, a lattice spacing of $a = 0.093$ fm, and a pion mass of $m_\pi = 260$ MeV. We consider both the iso-vector and iso-scalar cases, utilizing next-to-leading-order perturbative matching while omitting the disconnected contributions and gluon mixing in the iso-scalar case. For the first time, we determine the Mellin moments of $\widetilde{H}$ up to the fifth order. From these moments, we discuss the quark helicity and orbital angular momentum contributions to the nucleon spin, as well as the spin-orbit correlations of the quarks. Additionally, we perform a Fourier transform over the momentum transfer, which allows us to explore the spin structure in the impact-parameter space.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Propagation within Chained Models for Machine Learning Reconstruction of Neutrino-LAr Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09864v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequential or chained models are increasingly prevalent in machine learning for scientific applications, due to their flexibility and ease of development. Chained models are particularly useful when a task is separable into distinct steps with a hierarchy of meaningful intermediate representations. In reliability-critical tasks, it is important to quantify the confidence of model inferences. However, chained models pose an additional challenge for uncertainty quantification, especially when input uncertainties need to be propagated. In such cases, a fully uncertainty-aware chain of models is required, where each step accepts a probability distribution over the input space, and produces a probability distribution over the output space. In this work, we present a case study for adapting a single model within an existing chain, designed for reconstruction within neutrino-Argon interactions, developed for neutrino oscillation experiments such as MicroBooNE, ICARUS, and the future DUNE experiment. We test the performance of an input uncertainty-enabled model against an uncertainty-blinded model using a method for generating synthetic noise. By comparing these two, we assess the increase in inference quality achieved by exposing models to upstream uncertainty estimates.</description>

      <title>Beam test results of a fully 3D-printed plastic scintillator particle detector prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plastic scintillators are widely used for the detection of elementary particles, and 3D reconstruction of particle tracks is achieved by segmenting the detector into 3D granular structures. In this study, we present a novel prototype fabricated by additive manufacturing, consisting of a 5 x 5 x 5 array of 1 cm3 plastic scintillator cubes, each optically isolated. This innovative approach eliminates the need to construct complex monolithic geometries in a single operation and gets rid of the traditional time-consuming manufacturing and assembling processes. The prototype underwent performance characterization during a beam test at CERN's Proton-Synchrotron facility. Light yield, optical crosstalk, and light response uniformity, were evaluated. The prototype demonstrated a consistent light yield of approximately 27 photoelectrons (p.e.) per channel, similar to traditional cast scintillator detectors. Crosstalk between adjacent cubes averaged 4-5%, and light yield uniformity within individual cubes exhibited about 7% variation, indicating stability and reproducibility. These results underscore the potential of the novel additive manufacturing technique, for efficient and reliable production of high-granularity scintillator detectors.</description>

      <title>Bottom quark forward-backward asymmetry at the future electron-positron collider FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) prediction for the \PZ-boson pole $b$-quark forward-backward (FB) asymmetry is: $(A_{FB}^{0,b})_{th} = 0.1030 \pm 0.0002$. The LEP electron-positron collider measured instead $A_{FB}^{0,b} = 0.0992 \pm 0.0016$, value which presents the largest discrepancy with any of the SM predictions as of today. All the $A_{FB}^b$ measurements performed at LEP suffered however of an important statistical uncertainty and of different sources of systematic uncertainties. This study shows that the proposed high-luminosity electron-positron collider FCC-ee, collecting orders of magnitude more data at the \PZ-pole than LEP, will significantly reduce the statistical uncertainties on the measurement of $A_{FB}^{0,b}$, thus allowing us to shed further light on this tension.</description>
