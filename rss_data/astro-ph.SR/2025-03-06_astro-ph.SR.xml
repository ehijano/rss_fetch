      <title>Gaia Net: Towards robust spectroscopic parameters of stars of all evolutionary stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new processing of XP spectra for 220 million stars released in Gaia DR3. The new data model is capable of handling objects with Teff between 2000 and 50,000 K, and with log g between 0 and 10, including objects of multitude of masses and evolutionary stages. This includes for the first time ever robust processing of spectroscopic parameters for pre-main sequence stars, with log g sensitivity towards their age. Through this analysis we examine the distribution of young low mass stars with ages of up to 20 Myr in the solar neighborhood, and we identify a new massive (&gt;1000 stars) population, Ophion, which is found east of Sco Cen. This population appears to be fully disrupted, with negligible kinematic coherence. Nonetheless, due its young age it appears to still persist as a spacial overdensity. Through improved determination of ages of the nearby stars, it may be possible to better recover star forming history of the solar neighborhood outside of the moving groups.</description>

      <title>CORINOS. III. Outflow Shocked Regions of the Low-mass Protostellar Source IRAS 15398-3359 with JWST and ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While molecular outflows have been studied in details with radio interferometry, observations of the hotter gas in protostellar outflows at a comparable physical scale is often challenging. Combined with ALMA, JWST allows us to investigate the cold and hot gas with unprecedented spatial resolution and sensitivity. We present a detailed comparison between the gas distributions probed with ALMA and JWST in the primary outflow of IRAS 15398$-$3359. At 2000 au scale, the southwestern outflow shows four shell structures in 5--10 micron continuum, whereas the submillimeter H$_2$CO emission traces two of the four shells closest to the protostar. Submillimeter emission from CS, CCH, c-C$_3$H$_2$, and CH$_3$OH shows the same two shells, and the $^{12}$CO emission covers most of the outflow region. SO and SiO only trace a condensation at the edge of the shell closest to the protostar. None of these lines observed with ALMA show the outermost shell. At 500 au scale, we find hot H$_2$ gas inside the outflow cavity with JWST. The derived temperature of H$_2$ is 1147$\pm$198 K within a 0\farcs5 aperture at the protostar. The foreground mass column density of dust is (1.4--2.0)$\times$10$^{-3}$ g$\cdot$cm$^{-2}$ (A$_{\rm v}$ = 47--66 mag) in the outflow, using the dust model from Weingartner &amp; Draine (2001). We also find an 8$^{\circ}$ difference between the directions toward the [Fe II] knot and the outermost shell in the MIRI image, which may be interpreted as the precession of the [Fe II] jet. The dynamical timescale of the [Fe II] knot is 10 yrs, suggesting a current event.</description>

      <title>StarFlow: Leveraging Normalizing Flows for Stellar Age Estimation in SDSS-V DR19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the ages of stars is crucial for unraveling the formation history and evolution of our Galaxy. Traditional methods for estimating stellar ages from spectroscopic data often struggle with providing appropriate uncertainty estimations and are severely constrained by the parameter space. In this work, we introduce a new approach using normalizing flows, a type of deep generative model, to estimate stellar ages for evolved stars with improved accuracy and robust uncertainty characterization. The model is trained on stellar masses for evolved stars derived from asteroseismology and predicts the relationship between the carbon and nitrogen abundances of a given star and its age. Unlike standard neural network techniques, normalizing flows enable the recovery of full likelihood distributions for individual stellar ages, offering a richer and more informative perspective on uncertainties. Our method yields age estimations for 378,720 evolved stars and achieves a typical absolute age uncertainty of approximately 2 Gyr. By intrinsically accounting for the coverage and density of the training data, our model ensures that the resulting uncertainties reflect both the inherent noise in the data and the completeness of the sampled parameter space. Applying this method to data from the SDSS-V Milky Way Mapper, we have produced the largest stellar age catalog for evolved stars to date.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Halo Coronal Mass Ejections Using SDO/HMI Vector Magnetic Data Products and a Transformer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a transformer model, named DeepHalo, to predict the occurrence of halo coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Our model takes as input an active region (AR) and a profile, where the profile contains a time series of data samples in the AR that are collected 24 hours before the beginning of a day, and predicts whether the AR would produce a halo CME during that day. Each data sample contains physical parameters, or features, derived from photospheric vector magnetic field data taken by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). We survey and match CME events in the Space Weather Database Of Notification, Knowledge, Information (DONKI) and Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) CME Catalog, and compile a list of CMEs including halo CMEs and non-halo CMEs associated with ARs in the period between November 2010 and August 2023. We use the information gathered above to build the labels (positive versus negative) of the data samples and profiles at hand, where the labels are needed for machine learning. Experimental results show that DeepHalo with a true skill statistics (TSS) score of 0.907 outperforms a closely related long short-term memory network with a TSS score of 0.821. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the transformer model has been used for halo CME prediction.</description>

      <title>The spectra of solar magnetic energy and helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous studies have used magnetic energy and helicity spectra, the latter computed using the two-scale method, to search for signatures of mean-field dynamos. In this study, we compare cotemporal HMI and SOLIS magnetograms to illustrate the instrument-dependence of even qualitative features of the energy and helicity spectra. Around the minimum between solar cycles 24 and 25, we find that the magnetic energy spectrum computed from HMI observations exhibits two distinct peaks. One of these peaks is only present near the cycle minimum, and corresponds to large-scale magnetic fields at high latitudes. Nevertheless, such magnetic fields are not present in contemporaneous synoptic vector magnetograms from SOLIS. Further, even when magnetograms from both the instruments are apodized, the helicity spectra calculated using the two-scale method disagree (on both the sign and the value of the fractional helicity). This suggests that currently available synoptic magnetograms are not reliable enough for such studies.</description>

      <title>Photometric-Metallicity and Distance Estimates for $\sim$70,000 RR Lyrae Stars from the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data and existing RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) catalogs, this study achieves the first calibration of the $P - \phi_{31} - R_{21} - \text{[Fe/H]}$ and $P-\phi_{31}-A_{2}-A_{1}-\text{[Fe/H]}$ relations in the ZTF photometric system for RRab and RRc stars. We also re-calibrate the period-absolute magnitude-metallicity (PMZ) and period-Wesenheit-metallicity (PWZ) relations in the ZTF $gri$-bands for RRab and RRc stars. Based on nearly 4100 stars with precise measurements of $P$, $\phi_{31}$, $A_{2}$, and $A_{1}$, and available spectroscopic-metallicity estimates, the photometric-metallicity relations exhibit strong internal consistency across different bands, supporting the use of a weighted averaging method for the final estimates. The photometric-metallicity estimates of globular clusters based on RR Lyrae members also show excellent agreement with high-resolution spectroscopic measurements, with typical scatter of 0.15 dex for RRab stars and 0.14 dex for RRc stars, respectively. Using hundreds of local RRLs with newly derived photometric metallicities and precise Gaia Data Release 3 parallaxes, we establish the PMZ and PWZ relations in multiple bands. Validation with globular cluster RR Lyrae members reveals typical distance errors of 3.1% and 3.0% for the PMZ relations, and 3.1% and 2.6% for the PWZ relations for RRab and RRc stars, respectively. Compared to PMZ relations, the PWZ relations are tighter and almost unbiased, making them the recommended choice for distance calculations. We present a catalog of 73,795 RRLs with precise photometric metallicities; over 95% of them have accurate distance measurements. Compared to Gaia DR3, approximately 25,000 RRLs have precise photometric metallicities and distances derived for the first time.</description>

      <title>Chemical abundance inventory in phosphorus-rich stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an overview of the latest advances in the study of phosphorus-rich stars, covering their detailed chemical abundance analyses and innovative mining approaches. Following the discovery of 16 low-mass and low-metallicity stars rich in P, we expanded this sample by demonstrating that a recently identified group of Si-rich giants is also P-rich. A detailed abundance analysis was conducted on the nearinfrared spectra from APOGEE-2 DR17, encompassing 13 elements. Subsequently, a similar analysis was performed on the optical UVES spectra of four P-rich stars, resulting in the abundance determination of 48 light and heavy elements. This comprehensive analysis further refined the chemical fingerprint of these peculiar stars, which was employed to evaluate the plausibility of various nucleosynthetic formation scenarios. In order to obtain a statistically more reliable chemical fingerprint in the future, we explored the use of unsupervised machine learning algorithms to identify additional P-rich stars in extensive spectroscopic surveys, such as APOGEE-2. The primary objective of this research is to identify the progenitor of these stars and determine whether current nucleosynthetic models require revision or if a completely new source of P in the Galaxy is responsible for the existence of the P-rich stars.</description>

      <title>Abundance analysis of stars hosting gas-rich debris disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion from protoplanetary or debris disks can contaminate the stellar photosphere, which is detectable in stars with radiative envelopes due to relatively slower photospheric mixing. The contaminated photosphere reflects ongoing disk processes, detectable through stellar spectroscopy. We investigate the composition of six gas-rich debris disk-hosting A-type stars to understand possible links with their debris disk or earlier accretion stages. We used archival spectra to estimate the stellar parameters and abundances of our sample. We also estimated the stellar photospheric accretion contamination parameter, fph which indicates the fraction of accreting material on the stellar photosphere. The oxygen abundance in intermediate-mass stars decreases with age until the debris disk stage (&lt; 20 Myr). The downward trend could result from H2O ice accumulating in dust traps or the formation of hydrated asteroids in the protoplanetary disk, locking oxygen in solids and reducing its accretion onto the star. All stars have similar volatile abundances (C, O), but HD 110058 and HD 32297 show refractory depleted abundances. The near-zero fph values in the six stars suggest that any currently accreted gas would not overwhelm mixing in the photosphere and would not impact the observed composition. The refractory depleted abundances in HD 110058 and HD 32297 suggest residual, or even chronic, accretion contamination from their earlier protoplanetary stages when the accretion rates were about five orders of magnitude higher. For HD 110058, with the highest refractory depletion, we estimated a lower limit on its earlier protoplanetary accretion rate of 9 x 10^(-8) Msun/yr, similar to other Herbig stars and equal to the Herbig star - HD 100546. This supports our hypothesis that refractory depletion in HD 110058 originates from a prior phase of higher accretion of dust-poor material.</description>

      <title>Study of an active region prominence using spectropolarimetric data in the He I D3 multiplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prominences are cool overdensities of plasma supported by magnetic fields that levitate in the solar corona. The physical characterization of these structures is key for understanding the magnetic field in the corona. Our work attempts to shed light on the properties of prominences by using observations at high polarimetric sensitivity in the He I D3 multiplet taken with the Zurich Imaging Polarimeter-3 instrument at the Istituto ricerche solari Aldo e Cele Dacco observatory. We used the HAZEL inversion code to infer the thermodynamic and magnetic properties of an active region prominence, assuming one- and two-component models. Our observations unveil a great diversity of physical conditions in the prominence. The observed Stokes profiles are usually broad and show interesting features, which can be described assuming a two-component model. The contribution of each component and the trends inferred for some parameters vary with the distance to the solar limb. While both components have analogous properties and contribute similarly close to the limb, a major component mainly describes the properties inferred at 10-40 arcsecs away from the limb. Moreover, both components usually show significant differences in thermal broadening, which is essential for ensuring a good fit quality between observations and synthetic profiles. Summarizing, the observed region of the prominence shows line-of-sight velocities of 1-3 km/s and rather horizontal fields of 20-80 gauss. We also report hints of a twist close to a prominence foot and changes in the magnetic configuration at specific locations. Our results indicate a mainly horizontal magnetic field of a few tens of gauss in the prominence. A model of two components with different thermal broadenings and filling factors, depending on the limb distance, is crucial for providing a consistent solution across most of the observed prominence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02919v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is vast evidence from observations of multiple stellar populations (MPs) in globular clusters (GCs). To explore the issue theoretically, this work considers two subsolar metallicities, two ages, and two initial abundance patterns: a first population of standard $\alpha$-enhanced metal mixture stars and a second stellar population displaying C-N and Na-O anticorrelations chemical abundance patterns, along with an enhanced helium fraction. Analysing the predictions for these extreme compositions, we provide insights into the observability of not-resolved MPs into individual stars of GCs. We use colours and spectrophotometric indices measurable with modern facilities (e.g. Euclid, LSST, DES, JWST).</description>

      <title>Cluster Ages to Reconstruct the Milky Way Assembly (CARMA). III. NGC 288 as the first Splashed globular cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The globular clusters (GCs) system of the Milky Way (MW) comprises a mixture of both in situ and accreted clusters. Tracing the origin of GCs provides invaluable insights into the formation history of the MW. However, reconciling diverse strands of evidence is often challenging: a notable example is NGC 288, where despite significant efforts in the literature, the available chrono-chemodynamical data have yet to provide a definitive conclusion regarding its origin. On one side, all post-Gaia dynamical studies indicate an accreted origin for NGC 288 from in the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE) dwarf galaxy. On the other, NGC 288 has been found to be 2.5 Gyr older than other GSE GCs at the same metallicity, this suggesting a different, possibly in situ origin. In this work, we address the unresolved question on the origin of NGC 288 by analyzing its chrono-chemical properties in an unprecedentedly homogeneous framework. First, we compare the location of NGC 288 in the age-metallicity plane with that of other two in situ GCs at similar metallicity, namely NGC 6218 and NGC 6362. The age estimates obtained within the homogeneous framework of the CARMA collaboration show that the three clusters are coeval, this reinforcing the contrast with the dynamical interpretation. Then, we compare the abundances with the sample of in situ and accreted clusters at similar metallicity presented in Ceccarelli et al. 2024, finding again consistency with the chemistry of in situ systems. To reconcile these results with its orbital properties, we propose a scenario where NGC 288 formed in the proto-disc of the MW, and then was dynamically heated by the interaction with the GSE merger, a fate similar to that of proto-disc stars experiencing the so-called Splash event. NGC 288 therefore demonstrates the importance of a homogeneous chrono-chemodynamical information in the interpretation of the origin of MW GCs.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Radio Recombination Lines from Proplyds in the Orion Nebula Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations that, for the first time, detect hydrogen and helium radio recombination lines from a protoplanetary disk. We imaged the Orion Nebula Cluster at 3.1 mm with a spectral setup that covered the $n=42 \rightarrow 41$ transitions of hydrogen (H41$\alpha$) and helium (He41$\alpha$). The unprecedented sensitivity of these observations enables us to search for radio recombination lines toward the positions of ${\sim}200$ protoplanetary disks. We detect H41$\alpha$ from 17 disks, all of which are HST-identified `proplyds.' The detected H41$\alpha$ emission is spatially coincident with the locations of proplyd ionization fronts, indicating that proplyd H41$\alpha$ emission is produced by gas that has been photoevaporated off the disk and ionized by UV radiation from massive stars. We measure the fluxes and widths of the detected H41$\alpha$ lines and find line fluxes of ${\sim}30-800$ mJy km s$^{-1}$ and line widths of ${\sim}30-90$ km s$^{-1}$. The derived line widths indicate that the broadening of proplyd H41$\alpha$ emission is dominated by outflowing gas motions associated with external photoevaporation. The derived line fluxes, when compared with measurements of 3.1 mm free-free flux, imply that the ionization fronts of H41$\alpha$-detected proplyds have electron temperatures of ${\sim}6,000-11,000$ K and electron densities of ${\sim}10^6-10^7$ cm$^{-3}$. Finally, we detect He41$\alpha$ towards one H41$\alpha$-detected source and find evidence that this system is helium-rich. Our study demonstrates that radio recombination lines are readily detectable in ionized photoevaporating disks, providing a new way to measure disk properties in clustered star-forming regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate thermal convection in a two-dimensional square box using the no-slip condition on all boundaries, and isothermal bottom and top walls and adiabatic sidewalls. We choose 0.1 and 1 for the Prandtl number and vary the Rayleigh number between $10^6$ and $10^{12}$. We particularly study the temporal evolution of integral transport quantities towards their steady states. Perhaps not surprisingly, the velocity field evolves more slowly than the thermal field. Its steady state is nominal in the sense that large-amplitude low-frequency oscillations persist around plausible averages. We study these oscillation characteristics.</description>

      <title>The hot accretion flow evolution in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MAXI J1348-630 as a low-mass black hole binary system in the Galaxy showed an X-ray outburst in 2019. We analyzed the Insight-HXMT spectral data in the low hard state (LHS) and intermediate state (IS) during the outburst from MJD 58510 to 58519 at the energy band from 2 keV to 100 keV. During the entire process, a thin disk extending to the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) from a large truncated disk (truncated radius $&gt; 5$ ISCO) suggests the corona geometry evolution. There exist time lags between radio and hard X-ray flux peaks: the 30 - 100 keV flux about 5 days ahead of radio flux, 11-30 keV flux about 4 days ahead, and reflection fraction about 2 days ahead, the accretion disk approaching the ISCO about 1 day before radio peak. This disk-corona-jet coupling and evolution suggest the corona containing two phases of cold dense material and hot gas, with high temperature region of corona cooling fast. The strong radio emission accompanying with a thin accretion disk of a relatively high accretion rate favors magnetic tower jet mechanism.</description>

      <title>The dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 6822. II. Young, intermediate and old stellar populations: comparison between theory and observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the stellar content in the Local Group dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 6822 by comparing stellar evolution models and observations in color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and color-color diagrams (CC-Ds). Our analysis is based on optical ground-based g,r,i photometry, and deep archive HST photometry of two fields in the galaxy disk. We compared young, intermediate-age, and old stellar populations with isochrones from the BaSTI-IAC library and found that NGC 6822 hosts a quite metal-rich ([Fe/H] = -0.7 to -0.4) young component with an age ranging from 20 to 100 Myr. The intermediate-age population experienced a modest chemical enrichment between 4 and 8 Gyr ago while stars older than 11 Gyr have a low metal abundance ([Fe/H] ~ -1.70). We also identified the AGB clump population with a luminosity peak at i ~ 23.35 mag. Our analysis of both the CMD and the optical-NIR-MIR CC-Ds of AGB oxygen- and carbon-rich stars, using the PARSEC+COLIBRI isochrones with and without circumstellar dust, reveal that this stellar component exhibits a spread in age from 1 to 2 Gyr and in metallicity between [Fe/H]=-1.30 and -1.70. The stellar models we used reproduce very well the two distinct color sequences defined by AGB O- and C-rich stars in the various optical-NIR-MIR CC-Ds, suggesting that they are reliable diagnostics to identify and characterise intermediate-age stellar populations. However, we also find that evolutionary prescriptions in the optical i-(r-i) CMDs predict, at fixed color, systematically lower luminosities than observed AGB stars.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Primordial Alignment II: Insights from Stellar Obliquity Measurements for Hot Jupiters in Compact Multiplanet Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant fraction of hot Jupiters have orbital axes misaligned with their host stars' spin axes. The large stellar obliquities of these giants have long been considered potential signatures of high-eccentricity migration, which is expected to clear out any nearby planetary companions. This scenario requires that only isolated hot Jupiters be spin-orbit misaligned while those with nearby companions, which must have more quiescent histories, maintain low-obliquity orbits, assuming they formed aligned within their primordial protoplanetary disks. Investigations of this stellar obliquity-companionship connection, however, have been severely limited by the lack of hot Jupiters found in compact multi-planet systems. Here we present the sky-projected stellar obliquity ($\lambda$) of a hot Jupiter with a nearby inner companion recently discovered by NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite: TOI-5143 c. Specifically, we utilize the Doppler shadow caused by the planet's transit, enabled by the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, to find that the planet is aligned with $\lambda=2.1 ^{+2.8}_{-2.7} \circ$. Of the exoplanets with RM measurements, TOI-5143 c becomes just the third hot Jupiter with a nearby companion, and is part of the 19th compact multi-planet single-star system, with an RM measurement. The spin-orbit alignment of these 19 systems provides strong support for primordial alignment, and thus implies that large obliquities are gained primarily due to post-disk dynamical interactions such as those inherent to high-eccentricity migration. As such, the observed spin-orbit alignment of hot Jupiters with nearby companions affirms that some fraction of these giants instead have quiescent origins.</description>

      <title>Recovering Ion Distribution Functions: I. Slepian Reconstruction of VDFs from MMS and Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma velocity distribution functions (VDFs) constitute a fundamental observation of numerous operational and future missions. An efficient parameterization of VDFs is crucial for (1) preserving enough information to investigate macroscopic moments along with kinetic effects, (2) producing smooth distributions whereby it is possible to perform derivatives in phase space to support numerical solvers, and (3) economic data management and its storage. Previous studies have used spherical harmonics as an efficient basis for representing electron VDFs. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm targeted towards decomposing ion VDFs measured by electrostatic analyzers onboard Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) spacecrafts. We use Slepian functions, custom-designed bases providing compact support in phase space, initially developed in information theory and later used for terrestrial and planetary applications. In this paper, we choose well-studied, well-measured, and complex intervals from MMS and SolO containing a range of simpler gyrotropic and agyrotropic distributions to benchmark the robustness of our reconstruction method. We demonstrate the advantages of using Slepian functions over spherical harmonics for solar wind plasma distributions. We also demonstrate that our choice of basis representation efficiently preserves phase space complexities of a 3D agyrotropic distribution function. This algorithm shown in this study will be extended to Parker Solar Probe and future missions such as Helioswarm.</description>

      <title>A Spectroastrometric Study of the Low-velocity Wind from DG Tau A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtained high spectral resolution spectra ($\Delta v$ $\sim$ 2.5 km s$^{-1}$) for DG Tau A from 4800 \r{A} to 7500 \r{A} using Subaru High Dispersion Spectrograph (HDS) for the first time. The low-velocity components (LVCs, |$v$| &lt; 100 km s$^{-1}$) were observed in the [O I] 5577, 6300, 6364 \r{A}, [S II] 6716, 6731 \r{A} lines. The offset position spectra observed in the LVCs show a "negative velocity gradient", supporting the presence of a wide-angled wind associated with the LVC emission. The offset position spectra observed in a component within the LVC velocity range between -16 km s$^{-1}$ to -41 km s$^{-1}$, namely, LVC-M, show a "negative velocity gradient'', supporting the presence of a wide-angled wind. With 12-70 au wind lengths measured using spectroastrometry, we estimate a lower limit to the wind mass-loss rate of $\sim$10$^{-8}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. In addition to the LVCs, we identify two high-velocity components (HVCs, |$v$| &gt; 100 km s$^{-1}$) associated with the collimated jet in 26 lines ([N I], [N II], [O I], [O II], [O III], [S II], [Ca II], [Fe II], H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, He I). The one with a clear spatial offset from the star ($n_e$ $\sim$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$, HVC1) is associated with an internal shock surface of the jet, while the other at the base ($n_e$ $\sim$10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$, HVC2) may be a stationary shock component. We find that the observed line profiles and the spatial scales of the LVC emission do not agree with the existing predictions for photoevaporative or magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) disk winds. These could be explained by the X-wind model, but synthetic observations are required for detailed comparisons.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen transport in protoplanetary disks by ammonium salts: a possible origin of Jupiter's nitrogen enrichment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric compositions preserve the history of planet formation processes. Jupiter has the remarkable feature of being uniformly enriched in various elements compared to the Sun, including highly volatile elements such as nitrogen and noble gases. Radial transport of volatile species by amorphous ice in the solar nebula is one mechanism that explains Jupiter's volatile enrichment, but the low entrapment efficiency of nitrogen into amorphous ice is an issue. We propose an alternative mechanism of delivering nitrogen to Jupiter: radial transport of semi-volatile ammonium salts in the solar nebula. Ammonium salts have been identified in 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko and can potentially compensate for the comet's nitrogen depletion compared to the Sun. We simulate the radial transport and dissociation of ammonium salts carried by dust in a protoplanetary disk, followed by the accretion of the gas and NH$_3$ vapor by a protoplanet, as well as the delivery of nitrogen to the planetary atmosphere from the salt-containing planetary core that undergoes dilution. We find that when the dust contains 10-30 wt% ammonium salts, the production of NH$_3$ vapor in the inner disk (~ 3 au) by dissociated salts and the incorporation of the salt-derived NH$_3$ through core formation and subsequent gas accretion by the protoplanet result in a planetary nitrogen enrichment consistent with the observations of Jupiter. Ammonium salts may thus play a vital role in developing the atmospheric composition of planets forming in the inner disk. Combining our model with future observations of the bulk compositions and isotopes of comets and other primordial bodies will help to further elucidate the elemental transport to the gas giants and ice giants in the solar system.</description>

      <title>Strong nebular HeII emission induced by He$^+$ ionizing photons escaping through the clumpy winds of massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of nebular HeII-emission in both local and high-redshift galaxies remains an unsolved problem. Various theories have been proposed to explain it, including HeII-ionization by high mass X-ray binaries, ultra-luminous X-ray sources, or "stripped" He stars, shock ionization, and hidden AGNs. All these theories have shortcomings, however, leaving the cause of nebular HeII emission unclear. We investigate the hypothesis that the photons responsible for driving nebular HeII emissions are produced by the evolution of single massive stars and/or WR stars. We combine models of stellar evolution with population synthesis and nebular models to identify the most favorable scenarios for producing nebular HeII via this channel. We find that, if WR winds are clumpy enough to become close to optically thin, stellar populations with a wide range of metallicities and rotation rates can produce HeII ionizing photons at rates sufficient to explain the observed nebular $I(HeII)/I(\mathrm{H}\beta)$ ratio $\sim 0.004-0.07$ found in HeII-emitting galaxies. Metal-poor, rapidly rotating stellar populations ($[\mathrm{Fe}/\mathrm{H}]=-2.0$, $v/v_\mathrm{crit}=0.4$) also reach these levels of HeII production even for partially clumpy winds. These scenarios also yield HeII, H$\beta$, and "Blue-Bump" line equivalent widths comparable to those observed in HeII emitters. Only for laminar, non-clumpy winds, do we fail to find combinations of metallicity and stellar rotation rate that yield $I(HeII)/I(\mathrm{H}\beta)$ values as high as those observed in HeII-emitters. Contrary to previous findings, we conclude that single WR stars can be a strong source for nebular HeII emission if their winds are sufficiently clumpy allowing significant escape of hard ionizing photons.</description>
