      <title>Gauging Centrifugal Instabilities in Compressible Free-Shear Layers Via Nonlinear Boundary Region Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curved free shear layers emerge in many engineering problems involving complex flow geometries, such as the flow over a backward facing step, flows with wall injection in a boundary layer, the flow inside side-dump combustors, or wakes generated by vertical axis wind turbines, among others. Previous studies involving centrifugal instabilities have mainly focused on wall-flows where Taylor instabilities between two rotating concentric cylinders or G\"{o}rtler vortices in boundary layers, resulting from the imbalance between the centrifugal forces and the radial pressure gradients, are generated. Curved free shear layer flows, however, have not received sufficient attention, especially in the nonlinear regime. The present work investigates the development of centrifugal instabilities evolving in a curved free shear layer flow in the nonlinear compressible regime. The compressible Navier-Stokes equations are reduced to the nonlinear boundary region equations (BRE) in a high Reynolds number asymptotic framework wherein the streamwise wavelengths of the disturbances are assumed to be much larger than the spanwise and wall-normal counterparts. We study the effect of the freestream Mach number $\boldsymbol{M_\infty}$, the shear layer thickness $\boldsymbol{\delta}$, the amplitude of the incoming disturbance $\boldsymbol{A}$, and the relative velocity difference across the shear layer $\boldsymbol{\Delta V}$ on the development of these centrifugal instabilities.</description>

      <title>Spectral effects of radiating gases on the ignition in a multiswirl staged model combustor using full-spectrum k distribution method -- A Large Eddy Simulation Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative heat transfer has been proven to be important during the ignition process in gas turbine. Those radiating gases (CO2, H2O, CO) generated during combustion may display strong spectral, or nongray behavior, which is difficult to both characterize and calculate. In this work, both the full-spectrum k-distribution (FSK) and weighted-sum-of-gray-gases (WSGG) method, along with the Dynamic-thickened-flame (DTF) and Large-Eddy-Simulation (LES) methods, are used to analyze how spectral behavior affects the ignition process in an experimental gas turbine. Results show that radiation affects the ignition process by heating the relatively low temperature regions. Consequently, each ignition phase is differently affected by different spectral treatments. During the initial kernel phase, spectral properties have minimal influence on flame structures and the ignition delay time due to the negligible radiation and optically-thin scenario. However, during the flame growth phase, significant differences appear in the flame structure and the flame propagation speed among different spectral treatments. After the flame fill the combustor and during the stable combustion phase, differences in flame structures calculated by different models become less, but radiation still play an important role in combustion. Therefore, high-fidelity spectral models are recommended during the modelling of the ignition process in the gas turbine.</description>

      <title>Periodically activated physics-informed neural networks for assimilation tasks for three-dimensional Rayleigh-Benard convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply physics-informed neural networks to three-dimensional Rayleigh-Benard convection in a cubic cell with a Rayleigh number of Ra=10^6 and a Prandtl number of Pr=0.7 to assimilate the velocity vector field from given temperature fields and vice versa. With the respective ground truth data provided by a direct numerical simulation, we are able to evaluate the performance of the different activation functions applied (sine, hyperbolic tangent and exponential linear unit) and different numbers of neuron (32, 64, 128) for each of the five hidden layers of the multi-layer perceptron. The main result is that the use of a periodic activation function (sine) typically benefits the assimilation performance in terms of the analyzed metrics, correlation with the ground truth and mean average error. The higher quality of results from sine-activated physics-informed neural networks is also manifested in the probability density function and power spectra of the inferred velocity or temperature fields. Regarding the two assimilation directions, the assimilation of temperature fields based on velocities appeared to be more challenging in the sense that it exhibited a sharper limit on the number of neurons below which viable assimilation results could not be achieved.</description>

      <title>Generalization of composite dynamics for the lattice Boltzmann method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized composite dynamics (GCD) framework is presented for the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). It leverages synergies of various simple collision operators to model complex physical processes. The framework is validated by recovering semi-permeable fluid flow methods. It provides mathematical justification for the incorporation of forces, addressing a gap in the literature. The versatility of this framework is demonstrated by analyzing a flux boundary condition. The GCD framework opens innovative possibilities for simulating complex physical processes using LBM.</description>

      <title>Prediction of turbulent channel flow using Fourier neural operator-based machine-learning strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and accurate predictions of turbulent flows are of great importance in the science and engineering field. In this paper, we investigate the implicit U-Net enhanced Fourier neural operator (IUFNO) in the stable prediction of long-time dynamics of three-dimensional (3D) turbulent channel flows. The trained IUFNO models are tested in the large-eddy simulations (LES) at coarse grids for three friction Reynolds numbers: $Re_{\tau}\approx180$, $395$ and $590$. The adopted near-wall mesh grids are tangibly coarser than the general requirements for wall-resolved LES. The numerical experiments show that the IUFNO framework outperforms the traditional dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) and the wall-adapted local eddy-viscosity (WALE) model in the predictions of a variety of flow statistics and structures, including the mean and fluctuating velocities, the probability density functions (PDFs) and joint PDF of velocity fluctuations, the Reynolds stress profile, the kinetic energy spectrum, and the Q-criterion (vortex structures). Meanwhile, the trained IUFNO models are computationally much faster than the traditional LES models. Thus, the IUFNO is a promising approach for the fast prediction of wall-bounded turbulent flow.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of rigid fibers interacting with triangular obstacles in microchannel flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fiber suspensions flowing in structured media are encountered in many biological and industrial systems. Interactions between fibers and the transporting flow as well as fiber contact with obstacles can lead to complex dynamics. In this work, we combine microfluidic experiments and numerical simulations to study the interactions of a rigid fiber with an individual equilateral triangular pillar in a microfluidic channel. Four dominant fiber dynamics are identified: transport above or below the obstacle, pole vaulting and trapping, in excellent agreement between experiments and modeling. The dynamics are classified as a function of the length, angle and lateral position of the fibers at the channel entry. We show that the orientation and lateral position close to the obstacle are responsible for the fiber dynamics and we link those to the initial conditions of the fibers at the channel entrance. Direct contact between the fibers and the pillar is required to obtain strong modification of the fiber trajectories, which is associated to irreversible dynamics. Longer fibers are found to be more laterally shifted by the pillar than shorter fibers that rather tend to remain on their initial streamline. Our findings could in the future be used to design and optimize microfluidic sorting devices to sort rigid fibers by length.</description>

      <title>Viscous rebound of a quasi-2D cylinder on a solid wall</title>

Abstract: The purpose of the present study is to extend the simple concept of apparent coefficient of restitution, widely approached in the literature for the case of a single-contact-point between a sphere and a wall, to the case of bouncing whose complexity is increased due to the shape of the contacting object.
  Experiments are carried out with a finite-length cylinder, freely falling in a liquid at rest. Complex 3D motions of the cylinder with respect to the wall occur during bouncing, including multi-contact-points between the cylinder and the bottom as well as cavitation.
  We investigate numerical modelling of an idealized situation (2D infinite cylinder falling parallel to the wall) with 2D simulations where the fluid equations of motion were coupled to the particle equation of motion through an Immersed Boundary Method. The particle equation of motion is coupled to an elastic force to model bouncing, requiring a parameterization of the cut-off length (interpreted as a roughness) and the contact time (associated with the contact elasticity) used here to capture the experimental observations. The simulations confirmed that i) the departure of the coefficient of restitution from 0 is strictly dependent on the apparent roughness and ii) the coefficient of restitution depends on the contact time.
  Finally, we model the coefficient of restitution as the product of two contributions to the mechanical loss of energy: the collision-to-terminal velocity ratio ($V_c/V_t$) of the approach-phase and the rebound-to-collision velocity ratio ($-V_r/V_c$) of the contact-phase. This leads to a reasonably good prediction of the coefficient of restitution in the intermediate regime in $St$. This suggests the relevance of lumping the complex details of physical phenomena involved during contact into a simple concept based on the contact apparent roughness and elasticity.</description>

      <title>Turbulence induced by a swarm of rising bubbles from coarse-grained simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed numerical simulations of a homogeneous swarm of bubbles rising at large Reynolds number, Re = 760 with volume fractions ranging from 1% to 10%. We consider a simplified model in which the interfaces are not resolved, but which allows us to simulate flows with a large number of bubbles and to emphasize the interactions between bubble wakes. The liquid phase is described by solving, on an Eulerian grid, the Navier-Stokes equations, including sources of momentum which model the effect of the bubbles. The dynamics of each bubble is determined within the Lagrangian framework by solving an equation of motion involving the hydrodynamic forces exerted by the fluid accounting for the correction of the fictitious self-interaction of a bubble with its own wake. The comparison with experiments shows that this coarse-grained simulations approach can reliably describe the dynamics of the resolved flow scales. We use conditional averaging to characterize the mean bubble wakes and obtain in particular the typical shear imposed by the rising bubbles. On the basis of the spectral decomposition of the energy budget, we observe that the flow is dominated by production at large scales and by dissipation at small scales and we rule out the presence of an intermediate range in which the production and dissipation are locally in balance. We propose that the k-3 subrange of the energy spectra results from the mean shear rate imposed by the bubbles, which controls the rate of return to isotropy.</description>

      <title>A Moving Surface Drag Model for LES of Wind over Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical prediction of the interactions between wind and ocean waves is essential for climate modeling and a wide range of offshore operations. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of the marine atmospheric boundary layer is a practical numerical predictive tool but requires parameterization of surface fluxes at the air-water interface. Current momentum flux parameterizations primarily use wave-phase adapting computational grids, incurring high computational costs, or use an equilibrium model based on Monin-Obukhov similarity theory for rough surfaces that cannot resolve wave phase information. To include wave phase-resolving physics at a cost similar to the equilibrium model, the Moving Surface Drag (MOSD) model is introduced. It assumes ideal airflow over locally piece-wise planar representations of moving water wave surfaces. Horizontally unresolved interactions are still modeled using the equilibrium model. Validation against experimental and numerical datasets with known monochromatic waves demonstrates the robustness and accuracy of the model in representing wave-induced impacts on mean velocity and Reynolds stress profiles. The model is formulated to be applicable to a broad range of wave fields and its ability to represent cross-swell and multiple wavelength cases is illustrated. Additionally, the model is applied to LES of a laboratory-scale fixed-bottom offshore wind turbine model, and the results are compared with wind tunnel experimental data. The LES with the MOSD model shows good agreement in wind-wave-wake interactions and phase-dependent physics at a low computational cost. The model's simplicity and minimal computational needs make it valuable for studying turbulent atmospheric-scale flows over the sea, particularly in offshore wind energy research.</description>

      <title>An electromechanics-driven fluid dynamics model for the simulation of the whole human heart</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a multiphysics and geometric multiscale computational model, suitable to describe the hemodynamics of the whole human heart, driven by a four-chamber electromechanical model. We first present a study on the calibration of the biophysically detailed RDQ20 activation model (Regazzoni et al., 2020) that is able to reproduce the physiological range of hemodynamic biomarkers. Then, we demonstrate that the ability of the force generation model to reproduce certain microscale mechanisms, such as the dependence of force on fiber shortening velocity, is crucial to capture the overall physiological mechanical and fluid dynamics macroscale behavior. This motivates the need for using multiscale models with high biophysical fidelity, even when the outputs of interest are relative to the macroscale. We show that the use of a high-fidelity electromechanical model, combined with a detailed calibration process, allows us to achieve remarkable biophysical fidelity in terms of both mechanical and hemodynamic quantities. Indeed, our electromechanical-driven CFD simulations - carried out on an anatomically accurate geometry of the whole heart - provide results that match the cardiac physiology both qualitatively (in terms of flow patterns) and quantitatively (when comparing in silico results with biomarkers acquired in vivo). We consider the pathological case of left bundle branch block, and we investigate the consequences that an electrical abnormality has on cardiac hemodynamics thanks to our multiphysics integrated model. The computational model that we propose can faithfully predict a delay and an increasing wall shear stress in the left ventricle in the pathological condition. The interaction of different physical processes in an integrated framework allows us to faithfully describe and model this pathology, by capturing and reproducing the intrinsic multiphysics nature of the human heart.</description>

      <title>Collective motion in a sheet of microswimmers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-propelled micron-size particles suspended in a fluid, like bacteria or synthetic microswimmers, are strongly non-equilibrium systems where particle motility breaks the microscopic detailed balance, often resulting in large-scale collective motion. Previous theoretical work has identified long-range hydrodynamic interactions as the main driver of collective motion in unbounded dilute suspension of rear-actuated ("pusher") microswimmers. In contrast, most experimental studies of collective motion in microswimmer suspensions have been carried out in quasi-2-dimensional geometries such as in thin films or near solid or fluid interfaces, where both the swimmers' motion and their long-range flow fields become altered due to the proximity of a boundary. Here, we study numerically a minimal model of microswimmers in such a restricted geometry, where the particles move in the midplane between two no-slip walls. For pushers, we demonstrate collective motion with only short-ranged order, in contrast with the long-ranged flows observed in unbounded systems. For front-actuated ("puller") microswimmers, we discover a long-wavelength density instability resulting in the formation of dense microswimmer clusters. Both types of collective motion are fundamentally different from their previously studied counterparts in unbounded domains. Our results illustrate that hydrodynamic screening due to the presence of a wall is subdominant in determining the collective state of the suspension, which is instead dictated by the geometrical restriction of the swimmers' motion.</description>
