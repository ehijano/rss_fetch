      <title>Lov\'asz Theorems for Modal Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A famous result due to Lov\'asz states that two finite relational structures $M$ and $N$ are isomorphic if, and only if, for all finite relational structures $T$, the number of homomorphisms from $T$ to $M$ is equal to the number of homomorphisms from $T$ to $N$. Since first-order logic (FOL) can describe finite structures up to isomorphism, this can be interpreted as a characterization of FOL-equivalence via homomorphism-count indistinguishability with respect to the class of finite structures. We identify classes of labeled transition systems (LTSs) such that homomorphism-count indistinguishability with respect to these classes, where counting is done within an appropriate semiring structure, captures equivalence with respect to positive-existential modal logic, graded modal logic, and hybrid logic, as well as the extensions of these logics with either backward or global modalities. A novelty of our positive results is that they apply not only to finite structures, as with previous Lov\'asz-style theorems, but also to well-behaved infinite structures. We also show that equivalence with respect to positive modal logic and equivalence with respect to the basic modal language are not captured by homomorphism-count indistinguishability with respect to any class of LTSs, regardless of which semiring is used for counting.</description>

      <title>POLIMON: Checking Temporal Properties over Out-of-order Streams at Runtime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the monitoring tool POLIMON for checking system behavior at runtime against specifications expressed as formulas in the real-time logic MTL or its extension with the freeze quantifier. The tool's distinguishing feature is that POLIMON can receive messages describing the system events out of order. Furthermore, since POLIMON processes received messages immediately, it outputs verdicts promptly when a message's described system event leads to a violation of the specification. This makes the tool well suited, e.g., for verifying the behavior of distributed systems with unreliable channels at runtime.</description>

      <title>Constructive Interpolation and Concept-Based Beth Definability for Description Logics via Sequents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a constructive method applicable to a large number of description logics (DLs) for establishing the concept-based Beth definability property (CBP) based on sequent systems. Using the highly expressive DL RIQ as a case study, we introduce novel sequent calculi for RIQ-ontologies and show how certain interpolants can be computed from sequent calculus proofs, which permit the extraction of explicit definitions of implicitly definable concepts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first sequent-based approach to computing interpolants and definitions within the context of DLs, as well as the first proof that RIQ enjoys the CBP. Moreover, due to the modularity of our sequent systems, our results hold for any restriction of RIQ, and are applicable to other DLs by suitable modifications.</description>

      <title>Taking Bi-Intuitionistic Logic First-Order: A Proof-Theoretic Investigation via Polytree Sequents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that extending the Hilbert axiomatic system for first-order intuitionistic logic with an exclusion operator, that is dual to implication, collapses the domains in the model into a constant domain. This makes it a very challenging problem to find a sound and complete proof system for first-order bi-intuitionistic logic with non-constant domains, that is also conservative over first-order intuitionistic logic. We solve this problem by presenting the first sound and complete proof system for first-order bi-intuitionistic logic with increasing domains. We formalize our proof system in a labeled polytree sequent calculus (a notational variant of nested sequents), and prove that it enjoys cut-elimination and is conservative over first-order intuitionistic logic. A key feature of our calculus is an explicit eigenvariable context, which allows us to control precisely the scope of free variables in a polytree structure. Semantically this context can be seen as encoding a notion of Scott's existence predicate for intuitionistic logic. This turns out to be crucial to avoid the collapse of domains and to prove the completeness of our proof system. The explicit consideration of the variable context in a formula sheds light on a previously overlooked dependency between the residuation principle and the existence predicate in the first-order setting, that may help explain the difficulty in obtaining a complete proof system for first-order bi-intuitionistic logic.</description>

      <title>The Algebras for Automatic Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce "synchronous algebras", an algebraic structure tailored to recognize automatic relations (a.k.a. synchronous relations, or regular relations). They are the equivalent of monoids for regular languages, however they conceptually differ in two points: first, they are typed and second, they are equipped with a dependency relation expressing constraints between elements of different types.
  We first show that the three pillars of algebraic language theory hold for synchronous algebras: (a) any relation admits a syntactic synchronous algebra recognizing it, and moreover, the relation is synchronous if, and only if, its minimal algebra is finite; (b) classes of synchronous relations with desirable closure properties (called "pseudovarieties") correspond to pseudovarieties of synchronous algebras; and (c) pseudovarieties of synchronous algebras are exactly the classes of synchronous algebras defined by a generalization of profinite equations called "profinite dependencies".
  Building on these results, we show how algebraic characterizations of pseudovarieties of regular languages can be lifted to the pseudovarieties of synchronous relations that they induce. A typical (and running) example of such a pseudovariety is the class of "group relations", defined as the relations recognized by finite-state synchronous permutation automata.</description>

      <title>The Threshold Problem for Hypergeometric Sequences with Quadratic Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02447v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergeometric sequences are rational-valued sequences that satisfy first-order linear recurrence relations with polynomial coefficients; that is, $\langle u_n \rangle_{n=0}^\infty$ is hypergeometric if it satisfies a first-order linear recurrence of the form $p(n)u_{n+1} = q(n)u_{n}$ with polynomial coefficients $p,q\in\mathbb{Z}[x]$ and $u_0\in\mathbb{Q}$.
  In this paper, we consider the Threshold Problem for hypergeometric sequences: given a hypergeometric sequence $\langle u_n\rangle_{n=0}^\infty$ and a threshold $t\in\mathbb{Q}$, determine whether $u_n \ge t$ for each $n\in\mathbb{N}_0$. We establish decidability for the Threshold Problem under the assumption that the coefficients $p$ and $q$ are monic polynomials whose roots lie in an imaginary quadratic extension of $\mathbb{Q}$. We also establish conditional decidability results; for example, under the assumption that the coefficients $p$ and $q$ are monic polynomials whose roots lie in any number of quadratic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$, the Threshold Problem is decidable subject to the truth of Schanuel's conjecture. Finally, we show how our approach both recovers and extends some of the recent decidability results on the Membership Problem for hypergeometric sequences with quadratic parameters.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Hybrid Hoare Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deductive verification of hybrid systems (HSs) increasingly attracts more attention in recent years because of its power and scalability, where a powerful specification logic for HSs is the cornerstone. Often, HSs are naturally modelled by concurrent processes that communicate with each other. However, existing specification logics cannot easily handle such models. In this paper, we present a specification logic and proof system for Hybrid Communicating Sequential Processes (HCSP), that extends CSP with ordinary differential equations (ODE) and interrupts to model interactions between continuous and discrete evolution. Because it includes a rich set of algebraic operators, complicated hybrid systems can be easily modelled in an algebra-like compositional way in HCSP. Our logic can be seen as a generalization and simplification of existing hybrid Hoare logics (HHL) based on duration calculus (DC), as well as a conservative extension of existing Hoare logics for concurrent programs. Its assertion logic is the first-order theory of differential equations (FOD), together with assertions about traces recording communications, readiness, and continuous evolution. We prove continuous relative completeness of the logic w.r.t. FOD, as well as discrete relative completeness in the sense that continuous behaviour can be arbitrarily approximated by discretization. Besides, we discuss how to simplify proofs using the logic by providing a simplified assertion language and the corresponding inference rules for HCSP, especially those for ODEs and interrupts. Finally, we implement the above logic in Isabelle/HOL, and apply it to verify a simplified version of the cruise control system.</description>

      <title>Confluence of Logically Constrained Rewrite Systems Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13552v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that (local) confluence of terminating locally constrained rewrite systems is undecidable, even when the underlying theory is decidable. Several confluence criteria for logically constrained rewrite systems are known. These were obtained by replaying existing proofs for plain term rewrite systems in a constrained setting, involving a non-trivial effort. We present a simple transformation from logically constrained rewrite systems to term rewrite systems such that critical pairs of the latter correspond to constrained critical pairs of the former. The usefulness of the transformation is illustrated by lifting the advanced confluence results based on (almost) development closed critical pairs as well as on parallel critical pairs to the constrained setting.</description>

      <title>Local Computing By Partial Quantifier Elimination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localization of computations plays a crucial role in solving hard problems efficiently. We will refer to the techniques implementing such localization as ${\mathit local}$ ${\mathit computing}$. We relate local computing with $\mathit{partial}$ $\mathit{quantifier}$ $\mathit{elimination}$ (PQE). The latter is a generalization of regular quantifier elimination where one can take a $\mathit{part}$ of the formula out of the scope of quantifiers. The objective of this paper is to show that PQE can be viewed as a language of local computing and hence building efficient PQE solvers is of great importance. We describe application of local computing by PQE to three different problems of hardware verification: property generation, equivalence checking and model checking. Besides, we discuss using local computing by PQE for SAT solving. Finally, we relate PQE and interpolation, a form of local computing.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Meta-Theorems for Vertex Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.10333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertex Integrity is a graph measure which sits squarely between two more well-studied notions, namely vertex cover and tree-depth, and that has recently gained attention as a structural graph parameter. In this paper we investigate the algorithmic trade-offs involved with this parameter from the point of view of algorithmic meta-theorems for First-Order (FO) and Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic. Our positive results are the following: (i) given a graph $G$ of vertex integrity $k$ and an FO formula $\phi$ with $q$ quantifiers, deciding if $G$ satisfies $\phi$ can be done in time $2^{O(k^2q+q\log q)}+n^{O(1)}$; (ii) for MSO formulas with $q$ quantifiers, the same can be done in time $2^{2^{O(k^2+kq)}}+n^{O(1)}$. Both results are obtained using kernelization arguments, which pre-process the input to sizes $2^{O(k^2)}q$ and $2^{O(k^2+kq)}$ respectively.
  The complexities of our meta-theorems are significantly better than the corresponding meta-theorems for tree-depth, which involve towers of exponentials. However, they are worse than the roughly $2^{O(kq)}$ and $2^{2^{O(k+q)}}$ complexities known for corresponding meta-theorems for vertex cover. To explain this deterioration we present two formula constructions which lead to fine-grained complexity lower bounds and establish that the dependence of our meta-theorems on $k$ is the best possible. More precisely, we show that it is not possible to decide FO formulas with $q$ quantifiers in time $2^{o(k^2q)}$, and that there exists a constant-size MSO formula which cannot be decided in time $2^{2^{o(k^2)}}$, both under the ETH. Hence, the quadratic blow-up in the dependence on $k$ is unavoidable and vertex integrity has a complexity for FO and MSO logic which is truly intermediate between vertex cover and tree-depth.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of Monadic Second Order Definable Context-Free Sets of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04764v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a characterization of the sets of graphs that are both definable in Counting Monadic Second Order Logic (CMSO) and context-free, i.e., least solutions of Hyperedge-Replacement (HR) grammars introduced by Courcelle and Engelfriet. We prove the equivalence of these sets with:
(a) recognizable sets (in the algebra of graphs with HR-operations) of bounded tree-width; we refine this condition further and show equivalence with recognizability in a finitely generated subalgebra of the HR-algebra of graphs;
(b) parsable sets, for which there is an MSO-definable transduction from graphs to a set of derivation trees labelled by HR operations, such that the set of graphs is the image of the set of derivation trees under the canonical evaluation of the HR operations;
(c) images of recognizable unranked sets of trees under an MSO-definable transduction, whose inverse is also MSO-definable.
We rely on a novel connection between two seminal results, a logical characterization of context-free graph languages in terms of tree to graph MSO-definable transductions, by Courcelle and Engelfriet and a proof that an optimal-width tree decomposition of a graph can be built by an MSO-definable transduction, by Bojanczyk and Pilipczuk.</description>
