      <title>Quantum algorithm for the advection-diffusion equation and the Koopman-von Neumann approach to nonlinear dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an explicit algorithm based on the Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulations technique to simulate both the advection-diffusion equation and a nonunitary discretized version of the Koopman-von Neumann formulation of nonlinear dynamics. By including dissipation into the model, through an upwind discretization of the advection operator, we avoid spurious parasitic oscillations which usually accompany standard finite difference discretizations of the advection equation. In contrast to prior works on quantum simulation of nonlinear problems, we explain in detail how different components of the algorithm can be implemented by using the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) methods. In addition, we discuss the general method for implementing the block-encoding (BE) required for QSP and QSVT circuits and provide explicit implementations of the BE oracles tailored to our specific test cases. We simulate the resulting circuit on a digital emulator of quantum fault-tolerant computers and investigate its complexity and success probability. The proposed algorithm is universal and can be used for modeling a broad class of linear and nonlinear differential equations including the KvN and Carleman embeddings of nonlinear systems, the semiclassical Koopman-van Hove (KvH) equation, as well as the advection and Liouville equations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the role of diffusive coupling in spatiotemporal chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the chaotic dynamics of a large one-dimensional lattice of coupled maps with diffusive coupling of varying strength using the covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs). Using a lattice of diffusively coupled quadratic maps we quantify the growth of spatial structures in the chaotic dynamics as the strength of diffusion is increased. When the diffusion strength is increased from zero, we find that the leading Lyapunov exponent decreases rapidly from a positive value to zero to yield a small window of periodic dynamics which is then followed by chaotic dynamics. For values of the diffusion strength beyond the window of periodic dynamics, the leading Lyapunov exponent does not vary significantly with the strength of diffusion with the exception of a small variation for the largest diffusion strengths we explore. The Lyapunov spectrum and fractal dimension are described analytically as a function of the diffusion strength using the eigenvalues of the coupling operator. The spatial features of the CLVs are quantified and compared with the eigenvectors of the coupling operator. The chaotic dynamics are composed entirely of physical modes for all of the conditions we explore. The leading CLV is highly localized and the localization decreases with increasing strength of the spatial coupling. The violation of the dominance of Oseledets splitting indicates that the entanglement of pairs of CLVs becomes more significant between neighboring CLVs as the strength of the diffusion is increased.</description>

      <title>Learning Object Properties Using Robot Proprioception via Differentiable Robot-Object Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differentiable simulation has become a powerful tool for system identification. While prior work has focused on identifying robot properties using robot-specific data or object properties using object-specific data, our approach calibrates object properties by using information from the robot, without relying on data from the object itself. Specifically, we utilize robot joint encoder information, which is commonly available in standard robotic systems. Our key observation is that by analyzing the robot's reactions to manipulated objects, we can infer properties of those objects, such as inertia and softness. Leveraging this insight, we develop differentiable simulations of robot-object interactions to inversely identify the properties of the manipulated objects. Our approach relies solely on proprioception -- the robot's internal sensing capabilities -- and does not require external measurement tools or vision-based tracking systems. This general method is applicable to any articulated robot and requires only joint position information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a low-cost robotic platform, achieving accurate mass and elastic modulus estimations of manipulated objects with just a few seconds of computation on a laptop.</description>

      <title>Scaling Graph Neural Networks to Large Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) architectures have emerged as promising force field models, exhibiting high accuracy in predicting complex energies and forces based on atomic identities and Cartesian coordinates. To expand the applicability of GNNs, and machine learning force fields more broadly, optimizing their computational efficiency is critical, especially for large biomolecular systems in classical molecular dynamics simulations. In this study, we address key challenges in existing GNN benchmarks by introducing a dataset, DISPEF, which comprises large, biologically relevant proteins. DISPEF includes 207,454 proteins with sizes up to 12,499 atoms and features diverse chemical environments, spanning folded and disordered regions. The implicit solvation free energies, used as training targets, represent a particularly challenging case due to their many-body nature, providing a stringent test for evaluating the expressiveness of machine learning models. We benchmark the performance of seven GNNs on DISPEF, emphasizing the importance of directly accounting for long-range interactions to enhance model transferability. Additionally, we present a novel multiscale architecture, termed Schake, which delivers transferable and computationally efficient energy and force predictions for large proteins. Our findings offer valuable insights and tools for advancing GNNs in protein modeling applications.</description>

      <title>Gyrokinetic Electromagnetic Particle Simulations in Triangular Meshes with C1 Finite Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The triangular mesh-based gyrokinetic scheme enables comprehensive axis-to-edge studies across the entire plasma volume. Our approach employs triangular finite elements with first-derivative continuity (C1), building on previous work to facilitate gyrokinetic simulations. Additionally, we have adopted the mixed variable/pullback scheme for gyrokinetic electromagnetic particle simulations. The filter-free treatment in the poloidal cross-section with triangular meshes introduces unique features and challenges compared to previous treatments using structured meshes. Our implementation has been validated through benchmarks using ITPA-TAE (Toroidicity-induced Alfv\'en Eigenmode) parameters, showing its capability in moderate to small electron skin depth regimes. Additional examinations using experimental parameters confirm its applicability to realistic plasma conditions.</description>

      <title>High order ADER-DG method with local DG predictor for solutions of differential-algebraic systems of equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A numerical method ADER-DG with a local DG predictor for solving a DAE system has been developed, which was based on the formulation of ADER-DG methods using a local DG predictor for solving ODE and PDE systems. The basis functions were chosen in the form of Lagrange interpolation polynomials with nodal points at the roots of the Radau polynomials, which differs from the classical formulations of the ADER-DG method, where it is customary to use the roots of Legendre polynomials. It was shown that the use of this basis leads to A-stability and L1-stability in the case of using the DAE solver as ODE solver. The numerical method ADER-DG allows one to obtain a highly accurate numerical solution even on very coarse grids, with a step greater than the main characteristic scale of solution variation. The local discrete time solution can be used as a numerical solution of the DAE system between grid nodes, thereby providing subgrid resolution even in the case of very coarse grids. The classical test examples were solved by developed numerical method ADER-DG. With increasing index of the DAE system, a decrease in the empirical convergence orders p is observed. An unexpected result was obtained in the numerical solution of the stiff DAE system -- the empirical convergence orders of the numerical solution obtained using the developed method turned out to be significantly higher than the values expected for this method in the case of stiff problems. It turns out that the use of Lagrange interpolation polynomials with nodal points at the roots of the Radau polynomials is much better suited for solving stiff problems. Estimates showed that the computational costs of the ADER-DG method are approximately comparable to the computational costs of implicit Runge-Kutta methods used to solve DAE systems. Methods were proposed to reduce the computational costs of the ADER-DG method.</description>

      <title>Sinc Kolmogorov-Arnold Network and Its Applications on Physics-informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to use Sinc interpolation in the context of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks, neural networks with learnable activation functions, which recently gained attention as alternatives to multilayer perceptron. Many different function representations have already been tried, but we show that Sinc interpolation proposes a viable alternative, since it is known in numerical analysis to represent well both smooth functions and functions with singularities. This is important not only for function approximation but also for the solutions of partial differential equations with physics-informed neural networks. Through a series of experiments, we show that SincKANs provide better results in almost all of the examples we have considered.</description>

      <title>Neutral polymer conformations with attractive bridging crowder interactions: role of crowder size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive molecular dynamics simulations were conducted to explore the conformational phase diagram of a neutral polymer in the presence of attractive crowders of varying sizes. For weakly self-attractive polymers, larger crowders induce a transition from an extended state to a bridging-crowder-induced collapse (CB phase) at lower polymer-crowder interaction strengths. Similarly, for strongly self-attractive polymers, a transition from a crowder-excluded collapse (CI phase) to the CB phase occurs with larger crowders and stronger polymer-crowder attraction. The simulations reveal that the collapsed states in both weakly and strongly self-attractive polymers are identical when small bridging crowders are involved. Near the transition threshold for weakly self-attractive polymers, increasing crowder size leads to complex transitions, including collapse, extension, and re-collapse. Additionally, a confined collapse (CC phase) is observed, where the polymer is confined to interstitial spaces among large crowders. Strongly self-attractive polymers show similar transitions, but only with smaller crowders, as larger crowders suppress these changes. These findings underscore the crucial influence of crowder size on the conformational behavior of neutral polymers, especially under varying degrees of polymer-crowder interaction.</description>

      <title>WAVE-UNET: Wavelength based Image Reconstruction method using attention UNET for OCT images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose to leverage a deep-learning (DL) based reconstruction framework for high quality Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography (SS-OCT) images, by incorporating wavelength ({\lambda}) space interferometric fringes. Generally, the SS-OCT captured fringe is linear in wavelength space and if Inverse Discrete Fourier Transform (IDFT) is applied to extract depth-resolved spectral information, the resultant images are blurred due to the broadened Point Spread Function (PSF). Thus, the recorded wavelength space fringe is to be scaled to uniform grid in wavenumber (k) space using k-linearization and calibration involving interpolations which may result in loss of information along with increased system complexity. Another challenge in OCT is the speckle noise, inherent in the low coherence interferometry-based systems. Hence, we propose a systematic design methodology WAVE-UNET to reconstruct the high-quality OCT images directly from the {\lambda}-space to reduce the complexity. The novel design paradigm surpasses the linearization procedures and uses DL to enhance the realism and quality of raw {\lambda}-space scans. This framework uses modified UNET having attention gating and residual connections, with IDFT processed {\lambda}-space fringes as the input. The method consistently outperforms the traditional OCT system by generating good-quality B-scans with highly reduced time-complexity.</description>

      <title>Determining local mobility variation along recrystallization boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding recrystallization boundary migration mechanisms is crucial for materials design. However, the lack of comprehensive mobility data for high-angle grain boundaries in typical polycrystalline samples has impeded gaining insights into the factors that govern boundary migration. In this work, we develop a fitting methodology to determine mobility values for individual recrystallization boundaries in partially recrystallized samples. This methodology involves optimizing mobility inputs in a phase field model by aligning simulated microstructure with time-series recrystallization experiments. We first validate this method on synthetic data and then apply it to real experimental data. For the first time, we reveal a three-order-magnitude variation in local mobility along individual recrystallization boundaries. Additionally, we provide detailed analytical and computational analyses to explore the effect of this local mobility variation on boundary migration. The results show that mobility variation significantly influences boundary dynamics, shedding light on the interplay of factors that impact the observed boundary migration behavior. This methodology offers a new framework for interpreting experimental recrystallization behavior and can be broadly applied to other materials using in situ experiments.</description>

      <title>Beyond Language: Applying MLX Transformers to Engineering Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer Neural Networks are driving an explosion of activity and discovery in the field of Large Language Models (LLMs). In contrast, there have been only a few attempts to apply Transformers in engineering physics. Aiming to offer an easy entry point to physics-centric Transformers, we introduce a physics-informed Transformer model for solving the heat conduction problem in a 2D plate with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The model is implemented in the machine learning framework MLX and leverages the unified memory of Apple M-series processors. The use of MLX means that the models can be trained and perform predictions efficiently on personal machines with only modest memory requirements. To train, validate and test the Transformer model we solve the 2D heat conduction problem using central finite differences. Each finite difference solution in these sets is initialized with four random Dirichlet boundary conditions, a uniform but random internal temperature distribution and a randomly selected thermal diffusivity. Validation is performed in-line during training to monitor against over-fitting. The excellent performance of the trained model is demonstrated by predicting the evolution of the temperature field to steady state for the unseen test set of conditions.</description>

      <title>Spectral Densities, Structured Noise and Ensemble Averaging within Open Quantum Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although recent advances in simulating open quantum systems have lead to significant progress, the applicability of numerically exact methods is still restricted to rather small systems. Hence, more approximate methods remain relevant due to their computational efficiency, enabling simulations of larger systems over extended timescales. In this study, we present advances for one such method, namely the Numerical Integration of Schr\"odinger Equation (NISE). Firstly, we introduce a modified ensemble-averaging procedure that improves the long-time behavior of the thermalized variant of the NISE scheme, termed Thermalized NISE. Secondly, we demonstrate how to use the NISE in conjunction with (highly) structured spectral densities by utilizing a noise generating algorithm for arbitrary structured noise. This algorithm also serves as a tool for establishing best practices in determining spectral densities from excited state calculations along molecular dynamics or quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics trajectories. Finally, we assess the ability of the NISE approach to calculate absorption spectra and demonstrate the utility of the proposed modifications by determining population dynamics.</description>

      <title>Anomalous length dependent conductance of quasi-one-dimensional molecular wires assembled from metal superatoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular wires with high electrical conductance are desirable components for future molecular-scale circuitry. However, their conductance typically decays exponentially with increasing length. Here, we report a novel discovery that the conductivity of a nanoscale molecular wire assembled from metal superatoms increases with length. Specifically, high-precision first-principles calculations show that, while the conductance of quasi-one-dimensional superatomic assemblies formed with individual W@Cu12 superatoms as units exhibits a slow decay with increasing length, by extending the quasi-one-dimensional superatomic assemblies into bundle-like structures, their electrical conductivity increases with length, accompanied by a change in the corresponding decay factor from 1.25 nm-1 to -0.95 nm-1. This significant change in the decay factor originates from that the Fermi level of the superatomic assemblies shifts closer to the Fermi level of the electrodes, thereby reducing the tunneling barrier. Our findings highlight that molecular-scale devices exhibiting a negative decay factor are not an inherent characteristic, but rather can be regulated through structural modulation. This work not only provides theoretical references for modulating the performance of molecular-scale circuitry, but also opens up the application prospect of metal superatoms in electrical transport field.</description>

Abstract: The paper studies the possible interplay between matter and geometry in scalar tensor theories of gravitation where the energy--momentum tensor is directly coupled with the Einstein tensor. After obtaining the scalar tensor representation of the $f(R, G_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ gravity, the analysis continue with an approach based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes in open systems. To this regard, various thermodynamic properties are directly obtained in this manner, like the matter creation (annihilation) rate and the corresponding creation (annihilation) pressure. In the case of the Roberson--Walker metric several analytic and numerical solutions are found in the asymptotic regime. In the last part of the manuscript a specific parametrization for the Hubble rate is constrained using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms in the case of cosmic chronometers (CC) and BAO observations, obtaining an approximate numerical solution which can describe the cosmological model. For this model, we have obtained by fine--tuning some numerical solutions which exhibit creation mechanisms in different specific regimes.</description>

      <title>Robust Discontinuous Galerkin Methods Maintaining Physical Constraints for General Relativistic Hydrodynamics</title>

Abstract: Simulating general relativistic hydrodynamics (GRHD) presents challenges such as handling curved spacetime, achieving high-order shock-capturing accuracy, and preserving key physical constraints (positive density, pressure, and subluminal velocity) under nonlinear coupling. This paper introduces high-order, physical-constraint-preserving, oscillation-eliminating discontinuous Galerkin (PCP-OEDG) schemes with Harten-Lax-van Leer flux for GRHD. To suppress spurious oscillations near discontinuities, we incorporate a computationally efficient oscillation-eliminating (OE) procedure based on a linear damping equation, maintaining accuracy and avoiding complex characteristic decomposition. To enhance stability and robustness, we construct PCP schemes using the W-form of GRHD equations with Cholesky decomposition of the spatial metric, addressing the non-equivalence of admissible state sets in curved spacetime. We rigorously prove the PCP property of cell averages via technical estimates and the Geometric Quasi-Linearization (GQL) approach, which transforms nonlinear constraints into linear forms. Additionally, we present provably convergent PCP iterative algorithms for robust recovery of primitive variables, ensuring physical constraints are satisfied throughout. The PCP-OEDG method is validated through extensive tests, demonstrating its robustness, accuracy, and capability to handle extreme GRHD scenarios involving strong shocks, high Lorentz factors, and intense gravitational fields.</description>

      <title>Influence of the microstructure on the mechanical behavior of nanoporous materials under large strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoporous materials are characterized by their complex porous morphology illustrated by the presence of a solid network and voids. The fraction of these voids is characterized by the porosity of the structure, which influences the bulk mechanical properties of the material. Most literature on the mechanics of porous materials has focused on the density-dependence of their elastic properties. In addition to porosity, other pore characteristics, namely pore-size and shape described by the pore-size distribution, and pore-wall size and shape, also influence the bulk response of these materials. In this work, the mechanical structure-property relation of nanoporous materials is studied under large deformations using a computational framework. The interdependent microstructural parameters are identified. After a successful correlation between the synthesis and microstructural parameters, the synthesis of porous materials can be guided and optimized by controlling these parameters.</description>

      <title>Provably Positivity-Preserving Constrained Transport (PPCT) Second-Order Scheme for Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes a robust and efficient second-order positivity-preserving constrained transport (PPCT) scheme for ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on non-staggered Cartesian meshes. The PPCT scheme ensures two critical physical constraints: a globally discrete divergence-free (DDF) condition on the magnetic field and the positivity of density and pressure. The method is inspired by a novel splitting technique from [T.A. Dao, M. Nazarov and I. Tomas, J. Comput. Phys., 508:113009, 2024], which divides the MHD system into an Euler subsystem with steady magnetic fields and a magnetic subsystem with steady density and internal energy. To achieve these structure-preserving properties, the PPCT scheme combines a positivity-preserving (PP) finite volume method for the Euler subsystem with a finite difference constrained transport (CT) method for the magnetic subsystem via Strang splitting. The finite volume method employs a new PP limiter that retains second-order accuracy and enforces the positivity of density and pressure, with rigorous proof provided using the geometric quasilinearization (GQL) approach [K. Wu and C.-W. Shu, SIAM Review, 65:1031-1073, 2023]. For the magnetic subsystem, we develop an implicit finite difference CT method that conserves energy and maintains a globally DDF constraint. This nonlinear system is efficiently solved to machine precision using an iterative algorithm. Since the CT method is unconditionally energy-stable and conserves steady density and internal energy, the PPCT scheme requires only a mild CFL condition for the finite volume method to ensure stability and the PP property. While the focus is on 2D cases for clarity, the extension to 3D is discussed. Several challenging numerical experiments, including highly magnetized MHD jets with high Mach numbers, validate the PPCT scheme's accuracy, robustness, and high resolution.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by a heat radiative transport equation, we consider a particle undergoing collisions in a space-time domain and propose a method to sample its escape time, space and direction from the domain. The first step of the procedure is an estimation of how many elementary collisions is safe to take before chances of exiting the domain are too high; then these collisions are aggregated into a single movement. The method does not use any model nor any particular regime of parameters. We give theoretical results both under the normal approximation and without it and test the method on some benchmarks from the literature. The results confirm the theoretical predictions and show that the proposal is an efficient method to sample the escape distribution of the particle.</description>

      <title>Diff-PIC: Revolutionizing Particle-In-Cell Nuclear Fusion Simulation with Diffusion Models</title>

Abstract: The rapid development of AI highlights the pressing need for sustainable energy, a critical global challenge for decades. Nuclear fusion, generally seen as an ultimate solution, has been the focus of intensive research for nearly a century, with investments reaching hundreds of billions of dollars. Recent advancements in Inertial Confinement Fusion have drawn significant attention to fusion research, in which Laser-Plasma Interaction (LPI) is critical for ensuring fusion stability and efficiency. However, the complexity of LPI upon fusion ignition makes analytical approaches impractical, leaving researchers depending on extremely computation-demanding Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations to generate data, presenting a significant bottleneck to advancing fusion research. In response, this work introduces Diff-PIC, a novel framework that leverages conditional diffusion models as a computationally efficient alternative to PIC simulations for generating high-fidelity scientific LPI data. In this work, physical patterns captured by PIC simulations are distilled into diffusion models associated with two tailored enhancements: (1) To effectively capture the complex relationships between physical parameters and corresponding outcomes, the parameters are encoded in a physically-informed manner. (2) To further enhance efficiency while maintaining high fidelity and physical validity, the rectified flow technique is employed to transform our model into a one-step conditional diffusion model. Experimental results show that Diff-PIC achieves 16,200$\times$ speedup compared to traditional PIC on a 100 picosecond simulation, with an average reduction in MAE / RMSE / FID of 59.21% / 57.15% / 39.46% with respect to two other SOTA data generation approaches.</description>

      <title>Calculation of Photocarrier Generation from Optical Absorption for Time-domain Simulation of Optoelectronic Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.06702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photocarrier generation rate in optoelectronic materials is often calculated using the Poynting vector in the frequency domain. However, this approach is not accurate in time-domain simulations of photoconductive devices because the instantaneous Poynting vector does not distinguish between power flux densities of optical and low-frequency electromagnetic fields. The latter is generated by photocurrents and is not supposed to contribute to the photocarrier generation since the corresponding photon energy is smaller than the bandgap energy of the optoelectronic material. In this work, an optical absorption-based model is proposed to accurately calculate the generation rate in time-domain simulations. The proposed approach considers the material dispersion near the optical frequency corresponding to the bandgap energy of the optoelectronic material. The instantaneous optical absorption is calculated from the polarization current density associated with the dispersion model. Then, the optical absorption is used to calculate the generation rate. Numerical examples show that the proposed approach is more accurate than the Poynting vector-based method in calculating the instantaneous optical absorption. The proposed method is further validated against experimental results by modeling a photoconductive device. In the multiphysics simulation, the Poynting vector-based method overestimates the carrier generation rate and even generates divergent carrier densities when the low-frequency fields are strong, while the proposed method produces results that match with experimental measurements well.</description>

Abstract: The advent of quantum computers, operating on entirely different physical principles and abstractions from those of classical digital computers, sets forth a new computing paradigm that can potentially result in game-changing efficiencies and computational performance. Specifically, the ability to simultaneously evolve the state of an entire quantum system leads to quantum parallelism and interference. Despite these prospects, opportunities to bring quantum computing to bear on problems of computational mechanics remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate how quantum computing can indeed be used to solve representative volume element (RVE) problems in computational homogenisation with polylogarithmic complexity of $\mathcal{O}((\log N)^c)$, compared to $\mathcal{O}(N^c)$ in classical computing. Thus, our quantum RVE solver attains exponential acceleration with respect to classical solvers, bringing concurrent multiscale computing closer to practicality. The proposed quantum RVE solver combines conventional algorithms such as a fixed-point iteration for a homogeneous reference material and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). However, the quantum computing reformulation of these algorithms requires a fundamental paradigm shift and a complete rethinking and overhaul of the classical implementation. We employ or develop several techniques, including the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), quantum encoding of polynomials, classical piecewise Chebyshev approximation of functions and an auxiliary algorithm for implementing the fixed-point iteration and show that, indeed, an efficient implementation of RVE solvers on quantum computers is possible. We additionally provide theoretical proofs and numerical evidence confirming the anticipated $\mathcal{O} \left ((\log N)^c \right)$ complexity of the proposed solver.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06084v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present partial evolutionary tensor neural networks (pETNNs), a novel framework for solving time-dependent partial differential equations with high accuracy and capable of handling high-dimensional problems. Our architecture incorporates tensor neural networks and evolutional parametric approximation. A posterior error bounded is proposed to support the extrapolation capabilities. In the numerical implementations, we adopt a partial update strategy to achieve a significant reduction in computational cost while maintaining precision and robustness. Notably, as a low-rank approximation method of complex dynamical systems, the pETNNs enhance the accuracy of evolutional deep neural networks and empowers computational abilities to address high-dimensional problems. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the pETNNs in solving time-dependent complex equations, including the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, high-dimensional heat equations, highdimensional transport equations, and dispersive equations of higher-order derivatives.</description>

Abstract: A procedure to find optimal regimes for quantum thermal engines (QTMs) is described and demonstrated. The QTMs are modelled as the periodically-driven non-equilibrium steady states of open quantum systems, whose dynamics is approximated in this work with Markovian master equations. The action of the external agent, and the couplings to the heat reservoirs can be modulated with control functions, and it is the time-dependent shape of these control functions the object of optimisation. Those functions can be freely parameterised, which permits to constrain the solutions according to experimental or physical requirements.</description>

Abstract: Many claims of computational advantages have been made for quantum computing over classical, but they have not been demonstrated for practical problems. Here, we present algorithms for solving time-dependent PDEs, with particular reference to fluid equations. We build on an idea based on linear combination of unitaries to simulate non-unitary, non-Hermitian quantum systems, and generate hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that efficiently perform iterative matrix-vector multiplication and matrix inversion operations. Though these algorithms are end-to-end, they require relatively low-depth quantum circuits and protect quantum advantage, with the best-case asymptotic complexities, which we show} are near-optimal. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithms by conducting: (a) fully gate level, state-vector simulations using an in-house, high performance, quantum simulator called QFlowS; (b) experiments on a real quantum device; and (c) noisy simulations using Qiskit Aer. We also provide device specifications such as error-rates (noise) and state sampling (measurement) to accurately perform convergent flow simulations on noisy devices. The results offer evidence that the proposed algorithm is amenable for use on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the strong interactions within baryonic systems beyond the up and down quark sector is pivotal for a comprehensive description of nuclear forces. This study explores the interactions involving hyperons, particularly the $\Lambda$ particle, within the framework of nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT). By incorporating $\Lambda$ hyperons into the NLEFT framework, we extend our investigation into the $S = -1$ sector, allowing us to probe the third dimension of the nuclear chart. We calculate the $\Lambda$ separation energies ($B_{\Lambda}$) of hypernuclei up to the medium-mass region, providing valuable insights into hyperon-nucleon ($YN$) and hyperon-nucleon-nucleon ($YNN$) interactions. Our calculations employ high-fidelity chiral interactions at N${}^3$LO for nucleons and extend it to $\Lambda$ hyperons with leading-order S-wave $YN$ interactions as well as $YNN$ forces constrained only by the $A=4,5$ systems. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the SU(3) symmetry breaking and establish a foundation for future improvements in hypernuclear calculations.</description>

Though codes are widely available for the evolution of unpolarized and polarized PDFs, there are few codes publicly available for the transversity PDF. Here, we present Python code which implements two methods of solving the leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) approximations of the DGLAP equations for the transversity PDF, and we highlight the theoretical differences between the two.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Rossby number gap in rapidly rotating thermal convection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geophysical and astrophysical fluid flows are typically driven by buoyancy and strongly constrained at large scales by planetary rotation. Rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RRRBC) provides a paradigm for experiments and direct numerical simulations (DNS) of such flows, but the accessible parameter space remains restricted to moderately fast rotation rates (Ekman numbers $Ek \gtrsim 10^{-8}$), while realistic $Ek$ for astro-/geophysical applications are orders of magnitude smaller. On the other hand, previously derived reduced equations of motion describing the leading-order behaviour in the limit of very rapid rotation ($Ek\to 0$) cannot capture finite rotation effects, and the physically most relevant part of parameter space with small but finite $Ek$ has remained elusive. Here, we employ the rescaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (RiNSE) -- a reformulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $Ek\to 0$, recently introduced by Julien et al. (2024) -- to provide full DNS of RRRBC at unprecedented rotation strengths down to $Ek=10^{-15}$ and below, revealing the disappearance of cyclone-anticyclone asymmetry at previously unattainable Ekman numbers ($Ek \approx 10^{-9}$). We also identify an overshoot in the heat transport as $Ek$ is varied at fixed $\widetilde{Ra}= Ra Ek^{4/3}$, associated with dissipation due to ageostrophic motions in the boundary layers. The simulations validate theoretical predictions based on thermal boundary layer theory for RRRBC and show that the solutions of RiNSE agree with the reduced equations at very small $Ek$. These results represent a first foray into the vast, largely unexplored parameter space of very rapidly rotating convection rendered accessible by RiNSE.</description>

Abstract: Access to the potential energy Hessian enables determination of the Gibbs free energy, and certain approaches to transition state search and optimization. Here, we demonstrate that off-the-shelf pretrained Open Catalyst Project (OCP) machine learned potentials (MLPs) determine the Hessian with great success (58 cm$^{-1}$ mean absolute error (MAE)) for intermediates adsorbed to heterogeneous catalyst surfaces. This enables the use of OCP models for the aforementioned applications. The top performing model, with a simple offset correction, gives good estimations of the vibrational entropy contribution to the Gibbs free energy with an MAE of 0.042 eV at 300 K. The ability to leverage models to capture the translational entropy was also explored. It was determined that 94% of randomly sampled systems had a translational entropy greater than 0.1 eV at 300 K. This underscores the need to go beyond the harmonic approximation to consider the entropy introduced by adsorbate translation, which increases with temperature. Lastly, we used MLP determined Hessian information for transition state search and found we were able to reduce the number of unconverged systems by 65% to 93% overall convergence, improving on the baseline established by CatTSunami.</description>

      <title>Finite-element methods for noncollinear magnetism and spin-orbit coupling in real-space pseudopotential density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an efficient finite-element approach for large-scale real-space pseudopotential density functional theory (DFT) calculations incorporating noncollinear magnetism and spin-orbit coupling. The approach, implemented within the open-source DFT-FE computational framework, fills a significant gap in real-space DFT calculations using finite element basis sets, which offer several advantages over traditional DFT basis sets. In particular, we leverage the local reformulation of DFT electrostatics to derive the finite-element (FE) discretized governing equations involving two-component spinors. We subsequently utilize an efficient self-consistent field iteration approach based on Chebyshev filtered subspace iteration procedure exploiting the sparsity of local and non-local parts of FE discretized Hamiltonian to solve the underlying nonlinear eigenvalue problem based on a two-grid strategy. Furthermore, we propose using a generalized functional within the framework of noncollinear magnetism and spin-orbit coupling with a stationary point at the minima of the Kohn-Sham DFT energy functional to develop a unified framework for computing atomic forces and periodic unit-cell stresses. Validation studies against plane-wave implementations show excellent agreement in ground-state energetics, vertical ionization potentials, magnetic anisotropy energies, band structures, and spin textures. The proposed method achieves up to 8x-11x speed-ups for semi-periodic and non-periodic systems with $\sim$5000-7000 electrons in terms of minimum wall times compared to widely used plane-wave implementations on CPUs in addition to exhibiting significant computational advantage on GPUs.</description>
