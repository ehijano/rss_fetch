      <title>DiT-SGCR: Directed Temporal Structural Representation with Global-Cluster Awareness for Ethereum Malicious Account Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of malicious accounts on Ethereum - the preeminent DeFi platform - is critical for protecting digital assets and maintaining trust in decentralized finance. Recent advances highlight that temporal transaction evolution reveals more attack signatures than static graphs. However, current methods either fail to model continuous transaction dynamics or incur high computational costs that limit scalability to large-scale transaction networks. Furthermore, current methods fail to consider two higher-order behavioral fingerprints: (1) direction in temporal transaction flows, which encodes money movement trajectories, and (2) account clustering, which reveals coordinated behavior of organized malicious collectives. To address these challenges, we propose DiT-SGCR, an unsupervised graph encoder for malicious account detection. Specifically, DiT-SGCR employs directional temporal aggregation to capture dynamic account interactions, then coupled with differentiable clustering and graph Laplacian regularization to generate high-quality, low-dimensional embeddings. Our approach simultaneously encodes directional temporal dynamics, global topology, and cluster-specific behavioral patterns, thereby enhancing the discriminability and robustness of account representations. Furthermore, DiT-SGCR bypasses conventional graph propagation mechanisms, yielding significant scalability advantages. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate that DiT-SGCR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all benchmarks, achieving F1-score improvements ranging from 3.62% to 10.83%.</description>

      <title>Developing Artificial Mechanics Intuitions from Extremely Small Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans can possess good mechanics intuitions by learning from a few examples, which leads to the question of how to develop artificial mechanics intuitions that can be learned from small data, as we are eagerly entering the era of artificial intelligence. We propose in this Letter the sample-switchable training method, which successfully develops highly-accurate artificial mechanics intuitions that can master brachistochrone problem, catenary problem, and large nonlinear deformation problem of elastic plate by learning from no more than three samples. The model's intuitive prediction ability increases nonlinearly with respect to the number of training samples, suggesting that superb mechanics intuitions can be in-principle achieved based on a finite number of samples, reflecting how human brains form good mechanics intuitions just by learning a few cases. Our current work presents an alternative perspective for educating artificial intelligence capable of intuitively understand and predict how materials deform and move, a scenario that has been frequently seen in Science-Fiction movies.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics with Highly Oscillating Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opinion Dynamics (OD) models are a particular case of Agent-Based Models in which the evolution of opinions within a population is studied. In most OD models, opinions evolve as a consequence of interactions between agents, and the opinion fusion rule defines how those opinions are updated. In consequence, despite being simplistic, OD models provide an explainable and interpretable mechanism for understanding the underlying dynamics of opinion evolution. Unfortunately, existing OD models mainly focus on explaining the evolution of (usually synthetic) opinions towards consensus, fragmentation, or polarization, but they usually fail to analyze scenarios of (real-world) highly oscillating opinions. This work overcomes this limitation by studying the ability of several OD models to reproduce highly oscillating dynamics. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem which is further solved using Evolutionary Algorithms, providing both quantitative results on the performance of the optimization and qualitative interpretations on the obtained results. Our experiments on a real-world opinion dataset about immigration from the monthly barometer of the Spanish Sociological Research Center show that the ATBCR, based on both rational and emotional mechanisms of opinion update, is the most accurate OD model for capturing highly oscillating opinions.</description>

      <title>Ten simple rules for PIs to integrate Research Software Engineering into their research group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research Software Engineering (RSEng) is a key success factor in producing high-quality research software, which in turn enables and improves research outcomes. However, as a principal investigator or leader of a research group you may not know what RSEng is, where to get started with it, or how to use it to maximize its benefit for your research. RSEng also often comes with technical complexity, and therefore reduced accessibility to some researchers. The ten simple rules presented in this paper aim to improve the accessibility of RSEng, and provide practical and actionable advice to PIs and leaders for integrating RSEng into their research group. By following these rules, readers can improve the quality, reproducibility, and trustworthiness of their research software, ultimately leading to better, more reproducible and more trustworthy research outcomes.</description>

      <title>A Visualization Framework for Exploring Multi-Agent-Based Simulations Case Study of an Electric Vehicle Home Charging Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent-based simulations (MABS) of electric vehicle (EV) home charging ecosystems generate large, complex, and stochastic time-series datasets that capture interactions between households, grid infrastructure, and energy markets. These interactions can lead to unexpected system-level events, such as transformer overloads or consumer dissatisfaction, that are difficult to detect and explain through static post-processing. This paper presents a modular, Python-based dashboard framework, built using Dash by Plotly, that enables efficient, multi-level exploration and root-cause analysis of emergent behavior in MABS outputs. The system features three coordinated views (System Overview, System Analysis, and Consumer Analysis), each offering high-resolution visualizations such as time-series plots, spatial heatmaps, and agent-specific drill-down tools. A case study simulating full EV adoption with smart charging in a Danish residential network demonstrates how the dashboard supports rapid identification and contextual explanation of anomalies, including clustered transformer overloads and time-dependent charging failures. The framework facilitates actionable insight generation for researchers and distribution system operators, and its architecture is adaptable to other distributed energy resources and complex energy systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating Heterogeneity within Elastic and Inelastic Discrete Mechanical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two approaches to incorporate heterogeneity in discrete models are compared. In the first, standard approach, the heterogeneity is dictated by geometrical structure of the discrete system. In the second approach, the heterogeneity is imposed by randomizing material parameters of the contacts between the rigid bodies. A similar randomization strategy is often adopted in continuous homogeneous models. The study investigates both the elastic and fracture behaviors of these model types, and compares their local and macroscale responses. It is found that the stress oscillations present in the standard discrete models built on heterogeneous geometric structures cannot be replicated by randomization of the elastically homogeneous discrete system. The marginal distributions and dependencies between the stress tensor components cannot be adequately matched. Therefore, there is a fundamental difference between these two views on discrete models. The numerical experiments performed in the paper showed that an identical response can be achieved at the macroscale by tuning the material parameters. However, the local behavior, fracturing, and internal dependencies are quite different. These findings provide insight into the potential for controlled random assignment of heterogeneity in homogeneous models. They also demonstrate the need for experimental data capable of verifying the correctness of such an approach.</description>

      <title>LKA: Large Kernel Adapter for Enhanced Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the notable success of current Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods across various domains, their effectiveness on medical datasets falls short of expectations. This limitation arises from two key factors: (1) medical images exhibit extensive anatomical variation and low contrast, necessitating a large receptive field to capture critical features, and (2) existing PEFT methods do not explicitly address the enhancement of receptive fields. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Large Kernel Adapter (LKA), designed to expand the receptive field while maintaining parameter efficiency. The proposed LKA consists of three key components: down-projection, channel-wise large kernel convolution, and up-projection. Through extensive experiments on various datasets and pre-trained models, we demonstrate that the incorporation of a larger kernel size is pivotal in enhancing the adaptation of pre-trained models for medical image analysis. Our proposed LKA outperforms 11 commonly used PEFT methods, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 3.5% in top-1 accuracy across five medical datasets.</description>

      <title>Power-Capping Metric Evaluation for Improving Energy Efficiency in HPC Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With high-performance computing systems now running at exascale, optimizing power-scaling management and resource utilization has become more critical than ever. This paper explores runtime power-capping optimizations that leverage integrated CPU-GPU power management on architectures like the NVIDIA GH200 superchip. We evaluate energy-performance metrics that account for simultaneous CPU and GPU power-capping effects by using two complementary approaches: speedup-energy-delay and a Euclidean distance-based multi-objective optimization method. By targeting a mostly compute-bound exascale science application, the Locally Self-Consistent Multiple Scattering (LSMS), we explore challenging scenarios to identify potential opportunities for energy savings in exascale applications, and we recognize that even modest reductions in energy consumption can have significant overall impacts. Our results highlight how GPU task-specific dynamic power-cap adjustments combined with integrated CPU-GPU power steering can improve the energy utilization of certain GPU tasks, thereby laying the groundwork for future adaptive optimization strategies.</description>
