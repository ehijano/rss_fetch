      <title>An Aubin continuity path for asymptotically conical toric shrinking gradient K\"ahler-Ricci solitons: openness and a solution for $t=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any toric asymptotically conical shrinking gradient K\"ahler-Ricci soliton on an anti-canonically polarised resolution of a K\"ahler cone satisfies a complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation. We then set up an Aubin continuity path to solve the resulting equation and show that it has a solution at the initial value of the path parameter in the toric case. This we do by implementing another continuity method. Finally, we prove openness of the initial value of the path parameter independent of the toricity.</description>

      <title>On potentials for sub-Laplacians and geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the research on potential theory and its geometric applications from Euclidean spaces to homogeneous Carnot groups. We introduce a new approach to use the geometric completeness to estimate the Hausdorff dimension of polar sets of potentials of nonnegative Radon measures for sub-Laplacians in homogeneous Carnot groups. Our approach relies on inequalities that are analogous to the classic integral inequalities about Riesz potentials in Euclidean spaces. Our approach also uses extensions of some of geometric measure theory to homogeneous Carnot groups and the polar coordinates with horizontal radial curves constructed by Balogh and Tyson for polarizable Carnot groups. As consequences, we develop applications of potentials for sub-Laplacians in CR geometry, quaternionic CR geometry, and octonionic CR geometry.</description>

      <title>The chiral gyrating H'-T surface family: construction from the dual qtz--qzd nets and existence proof using a toroidal Weierstrass method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a construction and existence proof for a 1-parameter family of chiral unbalanced triply-periodic minimal surfaces of genus 4. We name these {\textit{gyrating H'-T} surfaces, because they are related to Schoen's H'-T surfaces in a similar way as the Gyroid is to the Primitive surface. Their chirality is manifest in a screw symmetry of order six. The two labyrinthine domains on either side of the surface are not congruent, rather one representing the quartz net (\texttt{qtz}) and the other one the dual of the quartz net (\texttt{qzd}). The family tends to the Scherk saddle tower in one limit and to the doubly periodic Scherk surface in the other. The motivation for the construction was to construct a chiral tunable unbalanced surface family, originally as a template for photonic materials. The numeric construction is based on reverse-engineering of the tubular surface of two suitably chosen dual nets, using the \textit{Surface Evolver}} to minimize area or curvature variations. The existence is proved using Weierstrass parametrizations defined on the branched torus.</description>

      <title>Explicit harmonic and wave maps into variable-curvature surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct explicit harmonic and wave maps between pseudo-Riemannian surfaces of variable curvature. For a broad class of target metrics, including nonconstant curvature surfaces such as ellipsoids, the harmonic and wave map equations admit a reduction to integrable ordinary differential equations under a natural ansatz. This yields explicit solutions beyond the classical constant-curvature and symmetric-space settings. The method applies uniformly in both elliptic and hyperbolic regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a mass function on asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds with continuous metrics via the normalized Ricci DeTurck flow.
  This definition coincides with the classical mass for smooth metrics. We also introduce the scalar curvature lower bound for continuous metrics a key component in establishing the well-definedness of the continuous mass.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Limit and Analytic Torsion of Vector Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a vector bundle $E^{n+k}$ over a closed manifold $M^n$ with $k$ even and $n$ odd, we equip the metric with an adiabatic parameter, and prove that the index of $E$ is the same as the index of $M$. We also introduce an analog of analytic torsion on $E$ using the Witten Laplacian. Moreover, we prove that the Quillen metric associated with this analytic torsion coincides with that of $M$.</description>

      <title>Critical metrics for the quadratic curvature functional on complete four-dimensional manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study critical metrics of the curvature functional $\A(g)=\int_M |R|^2\, \vol$, on complete four-dimensional Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ with finite energy, that is, $\A(g)&lt;\infty$. Under the natural inequality condition on the curvature operator of the second kind associated with the trace-free Ricci tensor, we prove that $(M,g)$ is either Einstein or locally isometric to a Riemannian product of two-dimensional manifolds of constant Gaussian curvatures $c$ and $-c$ $(c\ne 0)$. This extends the compact classification of four-dimensional $\mathcal{A}$-critical metrics obtained in earlier work to the complete setting.</description>

      <title>On the curvature operator in dimensions $4n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study oriented Riemannian $4n$-manifolds whose Thorpe $2n^{\text{th}}$ curvature operator $\hat{R}_{2n}\colon\Lambda^{2n} \longrightarrow \Lambda^{2n}$, or its Weyl analogue $\hat{W}_{2n}$, commutes with the Hodge star. For pure curvature operators this commuting condition becomes a finite system of hafnian identities in the eigenvalues of the curvature operator, which we analyze in two subclasses, including the locally conformally flat case. We further observe that $*\hat{W}_{2n} = \hat{W}_{2n}*$ is a new conformal invariant in dimensions $4n$, providing higher-dimensional analogues of self-duality. Finally, we give sufficient conditions ensuring nonnegativity of the Euler characteristic and relate these conditions to normal forms.</description>

      <title>Polyhedra of Constant Gaussian Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology and geometry are deeply intertwined in the study of surfaces, though their interaction manifests differently in smooth and discrete settings. In the smooth category, a classical result asserts that any closed smooth surface embedded in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with constant Gaussian curvature must be a sphere, reflecting the strong rigidity of differential geometry. In contrast, the discrete setting, where curvature is represented as an angular defect concentrated at vertices, admits far greater flexibility. For instance, a flat torus can be realised as a polyhedral surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ with zero curvature at every vertex. We establish a general result: any closed surface, whether orientable or non-orientable and of arbitrary genus, can be realised in $\mathbb{R}^3$ as a (possibly self-intersecting) polyhedral surface in which every vertex has the same angular defect. This highlights a fundamental distinction between discrete and smooth settings, showing that curvature constraints in the discrete realm impose fewer restrictions. Our proof is constructive and, once recognised, entirely elementary. Yet this fundamental fact appears to have gone unnoticed in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>The space-time-Grassmann measure of the Brakke flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a $k$-dimensional Brakke flow on an open subset $U \subset \mathbf{R}^{n}$, over an open time interval $J$, we prove the existence of a canonical space-time-Grassmann measure $\lambda$, over $J \times \mathbf{G}_{k} (U)$, and give a characterisation of the flow with respect to the space-time weight of this measure. This results in a new definition of the Brakke flow, as that of a space-time measure which satisfies the Brakke inequality in a distributional sense. Each such space-time measure corresponds to a class of equivalent (classical) Brakke flows, thus yielding an equivalence between the classical definitions of the Brakke flow, and this new definition. Moreover, we prove that the mean curvature vector, density, and tangent map along the flow, are all measurable with respect to this space-time weight measure.</description>

In the process, we extend the work of Colin de Verdi\`ere on the spectral theory of pseudo-Laplacians to hyperbolic surfaces with more than one cusp.</description>

      <title>Local Topological Constraints on Berry Curvature in Spin--Orbit Coupled BECs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a local topological obstruction to flattening Berry curvature in spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (SOC BECs), valid even when the global Chern number vanishes. For a generic two-component SOC BEC, the extended parameter space $M=T^{2}_{\mathrm{BZ}}\times S^{1}_{\phi_{+}}\times S^{1}_{\phi_{-}}$ carries a natural metric connection $\nabla^{C}$ whose torsion 3-form encodes the synthetic gauge fields. Its harmonic part defines a mixed cohomology class $
[\omega]\in\bigl(H^{2}(T^{2}_{\mathrm{BZ}})\otimes H^{1}(S^{1}_{\phi_{+}})\bigr)\oplus\bigl(H^{2}(T^{2}_{\mathrm{BZ}})\otimes H^{1}(S^{1}_{\phi_{-}})\bigr), $
whose mixed tensor rank equals one. Using a general geometric bound for metric connections with totally skew torsion on product manifolds, we show that the obstruction kernel $\mathcal{K}$ vanishes, yielding the sharp inequality $\dim\mathfrak{hol}^{\mathrm{off}}(\nabla^{C})\geq 1$. This forces at least one off-diagonal curvature operator, preventing complete gauging-away of Berry phases even when the total Chern number is zero. This provides the first cohomological lower bound certifying locally irremovable curvature in SOC BECs beyond the Chern-number paradigm.</description>

      <title>Spinorial Heat Flow and Geometric Singularities on 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a spinor-based geometric heat flow formulated within the Clifford algebra framework, exploring a continuous framework alternative to the surgery-dependent Ricci flow program for 3-manifolds. By taking the spinor field $\psi$ as the fundamental dynamical variable, we derive a linear parabolic evolution equation that remains well-defined even at metric degenerations. We demonstrate that neck-pinch singularities correspond to zero-amplitude nodes in the spinor field, suggesting a mechanism for analytic continuation without curvature blow-up. The flow minimizes a spinorial Dirichlet energy monotonically and distinguishes between spherical and toroidal topologies via the existence of parallel versus Killing spinors. This work provides an analytically regularized approach to geometric flows that aims to preserve topological information while navigating through metric singularities.</description>

      <title>Left invariant complex Finsler metrics on a complex Lie group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19353v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a left invariant complex Finsler metric $F$ on a complex Lie group. Using the technique of invariant frames, we prove the following properties for $(G,F)$. First, the metric $F$ must be a complex Berwald metric. Second, its complex spray $\chi=w^i\delta_{z^i}$ on $T^{1,0}G\backslash0$ can be extended to a holomorphic tangent field on $T^{1,0}G$. If we view $\chi$ as a real tangent field on $TG$, it coincides with the canonical bi-invariant spray structure on $G$. Third, we prove that the strongly K\"{a}hler, K\"{a}hler, and weakly K\"{a}hler properties for $F$ are equivalent. More over, $F$ is K\"{a}hler if and only if $G$ has an Abelian Lie algebra. Finally, we prove that the holomorphic sectional curvature vanishes.</description>

      <title>Yang-Mills energy quantization over non-collapsed degenerating Einstein manifolds and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a sequence of Yang-Mills connections $A_j$ lying in vector bundles $E_j$ over non-collapsed degenerating closed Einstein 4-manifolds $(M_j, g_ j)$ with uniformly bounded Einstein constants and bounded diameters. We establish a compactness theory modular three types of bubbles. As applications, we get some quantization results for several important topological number associated with the vector bundles, for instance, the first Pontrjagin numbers $p_1(E)$ of vector bundles over Einstein 4-manifolds and the Euler numbers $\chi(M;E)$ of holomorphic vector bundles over K\"{a}hler-Einstein surfaces. Furthermore, we get some quantization results about the volume $v(L_j)$ and certain cohomological numbers (e.g. $dim H^0(M_j;L_j)$) of holomorphic line bundles $L_j$ over non-collapsed degenerating K\"{a}hler-Einstein surfaces $(M_j,J_j,g_j)$ with the aid of the classical vanishing theorems, the classical Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch type theorems, and the profound convergence theory of K\"{a}hler-Einstein manifolds. In particular, we obtain some interesting identities involving non-collapsed degenerating compact K\"{a}hler-Einstein surfaces with non-zero scalar curvature, which indicate that we can know the Euler number of $M_j$ for large $j$ provided some topological information of the limit orbifold $M_\infty$. For K\"{a}hler-Einstein Del Pezzo surfaces, an interesting implication is that we can provide some preliminary estimates for the number of singularities of various types in $M_\infty$ in an effective way. As an unexpected surprise, we find an identity which connects Milnor numbers for singularities in $M_\infty$ and the correction terms in the Hirzebruch-Riemann-Roch theorem for orbifolds. Some quantization results can be extended to the case of higher dimensional $n$-manifolds.</description>

      <title>A Complete Characterization of Pythagorean Hodograph Preserving Mappings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19587v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fully characterize the mappings $\Phi$ that send every Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curve to a PH curve. We prove that in any dimension, such mappings are precisely the conformal functions whose dilation is the square of a real rational function. In the planar case, this implies (up to conjugation) that $\partial\Phi/\partial z = \Psi^{2}$, where $\Psi$ is meromorphic and satisfies $\operatorname{Res}(\Psi^{2}) = 0$ at every pole. In higher dimensions, PH preservation forces $\Phi$ to be a conformal map; for $n \ge 3$, Liouville's theorem then implies that any local diffeomorphism with this property is (anti-)M\"obius. These results subsume the previously known ``(scaled) PH-preserving'' constructions of mappings $\mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}^3$ and align with Ueda's conformal viewpoint on isothermal and spherical geometries. At the level of examples, we demonstrate how PH-preserving mappings relate to the construction of rational PH curves and minimal surfaces.</description>

      <title>A genus-zero surface with bounded curvature enclosing less volume than the unit sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We produce a family of bodies in $\mathbb R^3$ parameterized by $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, each bounded by a smooth topological sphere with principal curvatures in $[-1, 1]$, and having volume arbitrarily close to $ 16 - 4\sqrt 3 + \left(10 \sqrt 3 - 14\right) \pi - \left(\frac{10}{3} - \sqrt 3\right) \pi^2 \approx 3.70.$ Thus, in contrast to the two-dimensional case, the unit sphere (which bounds a ball of volume $\frac{4 }{ 3} \pi \approx 4.19$) does not enclose the minimal volume among all smooth spheres in $\mathbb R^3$ with principal curvatures in $[-1,1]$. This answers a folklore question of Dmitri Burago and Anton Petrunin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study reciprocity laws involving complex line bundles on fibrations in oriented circles. In particularly, we prove the following reciprocity law. Let $B$ be a complex manifold and $\pi_i : M_i \to B$ be a fibration in oriented circles, where $i$ runs through a finite set. Let $L_i$ and $N_i$ be complex line bundles on every $M_i$. The reciprocity law states that the sum of all $(\pi_i)_* \left(c_1(L_i) \cup c_1(N_i) \right)$, where $(\pi_i)_*$ is the Gysin map and $c_1$ is the first Chern class, equals zero in $H^3(B, {\mathbb Z})$ when the disjoint union of all $M_i$ is embedded into a holomorphic family of compact Riemann surfaces over the base $B$ such that in every fiber of this family the disjoint union of the embedded circles is the boundary of an embedded compact Riemann surface with boundary, and all $L_i$ and all $N_i$ are restrictions of holomorphic line bundles on this family.</description>

      <title>Group Contractions via Infinite-Dimensional Lie Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contractions are a procedure to construct a new Lie algebra out of a given one via a singular limit. Specifically, the \.In\"on\"u--Wigner construction starts with a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with Lie subalgebra $\mathfrak{h} \subseteq \mathfrak{g}$ and complement $\mathfrak{n}$. Then, the vectors in $\mathfrak{h}$ are rescaled by a formal parameter $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}_+$, which effectively turns the Lie bracket $[ \, \cdot \, , \cdot \, ]$ into a formal power series. Notably, the limit $\varepsilon \to 0$ trivialises certain relations, such that the complement $\mathfrak{n}$ becomes an abelian ideal. In the present article, we are not only interested in the limiting Lie algebras and groups, but also in the corresponding series expansions in $\varepsilon$ to understand the limiting behaviour. Particularly, we are interested in how to integrate the `power-series-expanded' Lie algebras to the Lie group level. To this end, we reformulate the above procedure using infinite-dimensional Lie algebras of analytic germs. Then, we apply their integration theory to obtain an extensive analysis of this expansion procedure. In particular, we obtain an explicit construction of the resulting Lie algebras and groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an intrinsic, heat-kernel based fractional Sobolev framework on closed Riemannian manifolds and study the critical fractional Sobolev embedding. We determine the optimal coefficient of the lower-order $L^{p}$ term and prove that the fully sharp $p$-power inequality cannot hold globally in the superquadratic range. We further establish an almost sharp inequality whose leading constant is arbitrarily close to the Euclidean best constant, and we derive improved inequalities under finitely many orthogonality constraints with respect to sign-changing test families.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The free boundary free elastic flow is the steepest descent gradient flow for the elastic energy of curves meeting parallel lines perpendicularly. In this article we prove that the straight line has, measured in Euler's scale-invariant bending energy, a basin of attraction at least to the level $1.9615\, \pi$. We show that our method of proof cannot be pushed to the previously conjectured level $2\pi$, and in addition present numerical evidence that this conjecture may in fact be false.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic Deformations of Hyperbolicity Notions on Compact Complex Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate deformation properties of balanced hyperbolicity, with particular emphasis on degenerate balanced manifolds and their behavior under modifications.
  In this context, we introduce two new notions of hyperbolicity for compact non-K\"ahler manifolds $X$ of complex dimension $\dim_{\mathbb{C}}X=n$ in degree $1 \leq p \leq n-1$, inspired by the work of F. Haggui and S. Marouani on $p$-K\"ahler hyperbolicity. The first notion, called \emph{p-SKT hyperbolicity}, generalizes the notions of SKT hyperbolicity and Gauduchon hyperbolicity introduced by S. Marouani. The second notion, called \emph{p-HS hyperbolicity}, extends the notion of sG hyperbolicity defined by Y. Ma.
  We investigate the relationship between these notions of analytic nature and their geometric counterparts, namely Kobayashi hyperbolicity and \emph{p-cyclic hyperbolicity} for $2 \leq p \leq n-1$, and we examine the openness under holomorphic deformations of both $p$-HS hyperbolicity and $p$-K\"ahler hyperbolicity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the overdetermined problem for the p-Laplacian equation on a compact Riemannian manifold with positive Ricci curvature. By introducing a new P-function which is related to the first nonzero eigenvalue for p-Laplacian, we obtain some integral identities. As their applications, the Heintze-Karcher type inequality and the Soap Bubble Theorem have been achieved.</description>

      <title>Graded supermanifolds and homogeneity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00537v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a homogeneity supermanifold, which is, roughly speaking, a supermanifold equipped with a privileged atlas whose coordinates carry prescribed (real) homogeneity degrees. This structure defines a sheaf of graded algebras on the supermanifold, regarded as an additional geometric structure. The guiding principle of this approach is that grading is ultimately related to homogeneity. Assigning homogeneity degrees to coordinates in a consistent way is equivalent to fixing a global vector field, the weight vector field. This approach is simple and substantially more general than most existing approaches to graded manifolds. In particular, the homogeneity degrees may be arbitrary real numbers, and the resulting category includes compact supermanifolds.
  We systematically study homogeneity submanifolds, homogeneity Lie supergroups, tangent and cotangent lifts of homogeneity structures, homogeneous distributions and codistributions, as well as related notions such as double homogeneity. The main achievements of this framework include proofs of the homogeneous Poincar\'e Lemma, the homogeneous Frobenius Theorem, and the homogeneous symplectic Darboux Theorem, results that are of independent interest even in the purely even case.</description>

Abstract: Mean curvature flows of isoparametric submanifolds in Euclidean spaces and spheres have been studied by Liu and Terng. In particular, it was proved that such flows always have ancient solutions. This is also true for mean curvature flows of isoparametric hypersurfaces in hyperbolic spaces by a result of Reis and Tenenblat. In this paper, we study mean curvature flows of isoparametric submanifolds in hyperbolic spaces with arbitrary codimension. In particular, we will show that they always have ancient solutions and study their limiting behaviors.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the geometry of holomorphic curves and complex surfaces from the perspective of singularity theory. We show that, with a suitable choice of a complex bilinear symmetric form, the families of functions and mappings that measure the contact between curves or surfaces and model objects become holomorphic. This allows the application of singularity theory, yielding analogues of classical results from the real case. Our approach enables the definition of geometric invariants of curves, which we call the $C$-curvature and $C$-torsion, as well as surface invariants such as the $C$-principal curvature and $C$-Gaussian curvature. It also gives geometric meaning to the complexification of of the families measuring contact of analytic surfaces in $\mathbb R^3$ with lines, planes and spheres.</description>

Abstract: For a one-parameter degeneration of compact Riemann surfaces endowed with the K\"ahler metric induced from the K\"ahler metric on the total space of the family, we determine the exact magnitude of the small eigenvalues of the Laplacian as a function on the parameter space, under the assumption that the singular fiber is reduced. The novelty in our approach is that we compute the asymptotic behavior of certain difference of (logarithm of) analytic torsions in the degeneration in two ways. On the one hand, via heat kernel estimates, it is shown that the leading asymptotic is determined by the product of the small eigenvalues. On the other hand, using Quillen metrics, the leading asymptotic is connected with the period integrals, which we explicitly evaluate.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Lie Algebroids: Taming Singular Carrollian Geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developments in Carrollian gravity and holography necessitate the use of singular Carroll vector fields, a feature that cannot be accommodated within standard Carrollian geometry. We introduce Carrollian Lie algebroids as a framework to study such singular Carrollian geometries. In this approach, we define the Carroll distribution as the image of the kernel of the degenerate metric under the anchor map. The Carroll distribution is, in general, a singular Stefan--Sussmann distribution that will fluctuate between rank-1 and rank-0, and so captures the notion of a singular Carroll vector field. As an example, we show that an invariant Carrollian structure on a principal bundle leads to a Carrollian structure on the associated Atiyah algebroid that will, in general, have a singular Carroll distribution. Mixed null-spacelike hypersurfaces, under some simplifying assumptions, also lead to examples of Carrollian Lie algebroids. Furthermore, we establish the existence of compatible connections on Carrollian Lie algebroids, and as a direct consequence, we conclude that Carrollian manifolds can always be equipped with compatible affine connections.</description>

An analogue of the Atiyah exact sequence for parabolic Lie algebroids is constructed. For any Lie algebroid whose underlying holomorphic vector bundle is stable, we give a complete characterization of all the parabolic vector bundles that admit a parabolic Lie algebroid connection.</description>

      <title>Constructing Riemannian metrics with prescribed nodal sets for Laplacian eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a configuration of $n$ ovals in $\mathbb{S}^2$. We show that there is a Riemannian metric $g$ over $\mathbb{S}^2$ with a Laplacian eigenfunction whose zero set is $C$, and the corresponding eigenvalue is the $k$-th eigenvalue for $n\leq k \leq \alpha_1 n$. We also have that $\lambda\operatorname{Vol}_g\left(\mathbb{S}^2\right) = \Theta(n)$.
  Additionally, assuming $C$ can be drawn as a topological minor of the $m\times m$ grid graph, we show that there is an infinitesimal perturbation of the round metric on $\mathbb{S}^2$ and a corresponding Laplacian eigenfunction $f$ with eigenvalue $\Theta(m^2)$ such that the zero set of $f$ is equivalent to $C$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01072v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a compact K\"ahler manifold $M$ containing a smooth connected divisor $D$ such that $M \setminus D$ is a homology cell, e.g., contractible, must be projective space with $D$ a hyperplane, provided $\dim M \not \equiv 3 \pmod 4$. This answers conjectures of Fujita in these dimensions.</description>

      <title>Intersection of Positive Closed Currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06964v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the intersection of positive closed currents in a general setting, employing tangent currents alongside King's residue formula. Our main result establishes a natural condition for the intersection--namely, the Dinh-Sibony product--of positive closed currents on domains and derives an integral representation of this intersection. In parallel, we study the existence, $h$-dimension, and shadow of tangent currents, extending our approach to the study of the self-intersection of analytic subsets. We also present a local version of superpotentials and a regularization of positive closed currents, explore the connections with slicing theory, and examine classical examples. Our work extends to general complex manifolds, including compact K\"ahler manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a Ma\~n\'e generic real-analytic $D$-Hamiltonian H, subjected to a totally non-holonomic real-analytic distribution $D$, has no non-trivial normal $D$-singular orbits of minimal rank. If $D$ has co-rank 1, this implies that $H + u$, where $u$ is a generic real-analytic potential, does not admit non-trivial normal $D$-singular orbits.</description>

      <title>Jacobi-Haantjes manifolds, integrability and dissipative mechanical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of Jacobi-Haantjes manifold, consisting of a Jacobi manifold endowed with an algebra of extended Haantjes operator fields, is proposed as a natural geometric framework which allows us to define the notion of integrability of both conservative and dissipative Hamiltonian systems, in a unified way. As a reduction, contact-Haantjes manifolds are defined. We prove that the integrability of a contact Hamiltonian system is equivalent to the existence of a suitable Abelian extended Haantjes algebra associated with the system. This result allows us to define a large class of new, completely integrable contact Hamiltonian systems from a given extended Haantjes algebra.
  Moreover, we propose a theory of separation of variables for dissipative systems. This result is achieved by lifting a dissipative system into a higher-dimensional manifold, obtained as the symplectization of the Jacobi-Haantjes structure associated with the system. This new manifold naturally acquires the structure of a symplectic-Haantjes manifold. We prove that the Darboux-Haantjes coordinates which separate the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of the higher-dimensional symplectic-Haantjes manifold are in fact separation variables for the Hamilton equations associated with the original dissipative system.</description>

      <title>An alternative solvability criterion for the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation and an application to the mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an alternative condition for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation that applies to non-mean convex domains. This condition is derived from a second-order ordinary differential equation whose solution produces a barrier that appears to be novel in the context of barrier constructions. It admits an explicit formulation and, in the setting of Hadamard manifolds, reveals a direct and transparent relationship between the geometry of the domain and the behavior of the boundary data required for solvability.The condition also extends naturally to unbounded domains.
  In the Euclidean case, it is not only more practical to verify but also less restrictive than the classical Jenkins-Serrin criterion, ensuring the existence of solutions in situations where that approach fails. Furthermore, unlike the Jenkins-Serrin condition, our approach separates the domain's geometric properties from its boundary data, providing a clearer and more manageable framework for solvability analysis.
  Beyond the stationary theory, the same ODE-generated barrier also yields natural sub- and supersolutions for the mean curvature flow of graphs, allowing one to initiate and control the short-time evolution from non-mean convex boundaries. As a consequence, our barrier construction extends a classical result of Ecker-Huisken on short-time existence of graphical mean curvature flow to domains with non-mean convex boundary; in the mean convex setting, their original result is recovered.</description>

      <title>Geometric Learning of Canonical Parameterizations of $2D$-curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most datasets encountered in computer vision and medical applications present symmetries that should be taken into account in classification tasks. A typical example is the symmetry by rotation and/or scaling in object detection. A common way to build neural networks that learn the symmetries is to use data augmentation. In order to avoid data augmentation and build more sustainable algorithms, we present an alternative method to mod out symmetries based on the notion of section of a principal fiber bundle. This framework allows the use of simple metrics on the space of objects in order to measure dissimilarities between orbits of objects under the symmetry group. Moreover, the section used can be optimized to maximize separation of classes. We illustrate this methodology on a dataset of contours of objects for the groups of translations, rotations, scalings and reparameterizations. In particular, we present a $2$-parameter family of canonical parameterizations of curves, containing the constant-speed parameterization as a special case, which we believe is interesting in its own right. We hope that this simple application will serve to convey the geometric concepts underlying this method, which have a wide range of possible applications. The code is available at the following link: $\href{https://github.com/GiLonga/Geometric-Learning}{https://github.com/GiLonga/Geometric-Learning}$. A tutorial notebook showcasing an application of the code to a specific dataset is available at the following link: $\href{https://github.com/ioanaciuclea/geometric-learning-notebook}{https://github.com/ioanaciuclea/geometric-learning-notebook}$</description>

      <title>On the distribution kernels of Toeplitz operators on CR manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution kernel of a Toeplitz operator associated with a classical pseudodifferential operator on a compact, embeddable, strictly pseudoconvex CR manifold. The main result consists of a formula for the values at the diagonal of the second coefficient in the expansion of the symbol of the kernel. We also establish asymptotic expansions for Toeplitz operators on the positive part of a compact not necessary strictly pseudoconvex CR orbifold under certain natural assumptions.</description>
