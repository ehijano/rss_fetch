      <title>Socially efficient mechanism on the minimum budget</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In social decision-making among strategic agents, a universal focus lies on the balance between social and individual interests. Socially efficient mechanisms are thus desirably designed to not only maximize the social welfare but also incentivize the agents for their own profit. Under a generalized model that includes applications such as double auctions and trading networks, this study establishes a socially efficient (SE), dominant-strategy incentive compatible (DSIC), and individually rational (IR) mechanism with the minimum total budget expensed to the agents. The present method exploits discrete and known type domains to reduce a set of constraints into the shortest path problem in a weighted graph. In addition to theoretical derivation, we substantiate the optimality of the proposed mechanism through numerical experiments, where it certifies strictly lower budget than Vickery-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanisms for a wide class of instances.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design for Locating Facilities with Capacities with Insufficient Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the Mechanism Design aspects of the $m$-Capacitated Facility Location Problem where the total facility capacity is less than the number of agents. Following the framework outlined by Aziz et al., the Social Welfare of the facility location is determined through a First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) game, in which agents compete once the facility positions are established. When the number of facilities is $m &gt; 1$, the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of the FCFS game is not unique, making the utility of the agents and the concept of truthfulness unclear. To tackle these issues, we consider absolutely truthful mechanisms, i.e. mechanisms that prevent agents from misreporting regardless of the strategies used during the FCFS game. We combine this stricter truthfulness requirement with the notion of Equilibrium Stable (ES) mechanisms, which are mechanisms whose Social Welfare does not depend on the NE of the FCFS game. We demonstrate that the class of percentile mechanisms is absolutely truthful and identify the conditions under which they are ES. We also show that the approximation ratio of each ES percentile mechanism is bounded and determine its value. Notably, when all the facilities have the same capacity and the number of agents is sufficiently large, it is possible to achieve an approximation ratio smaller than $1+\frac{1}{2m-1}$. Finally, we extend our study to encompass higher-dimensional problems. Within this framework, we demonstrate that the class of ES percentile mechanisms is even more restricted and characterize the mechanisms that are both ES and absolutely truthful. We further support our findings by empirically evaluating the performance of the mechanisms when the agents are the samples of a distribution.</description>

      <title>Discovering Consistent Subelections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how hidden interesting subelections can be discovered in ordinal elections. An interesting subelection consists of a reasonably large set of voters and a reasonably large set of candidates such that the former have a consistent opinion about the latter. Consistency may take various forms but we focus on three: Identity (all selected voters rank all selected candidates the same way), antagonism (half of the selected voters rank candidates in some order and the other half in the reverse order), and clones (all selected voters rank all selected candidates contiguously in the original election). We first study the computation of such hidden subelections. Second, we analyze synthetic and real-life data, and find that identifying hidden consistent subelections allows us to uncover some relevant concepts.</description>

      <title>With a little help from my friends: essentiality vs opportunity in group criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03565v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of the criticality of a player for simple monotone games based on cooperation with other players, either to form a winning coalition or to break a winning one, with an essential role for all the players involved. We compare it with the notion of differential criticality given by Beisbart that measures power as the opportunity left by other players. We prove that our proposal satisfies an extension of the strong monotonicity introduced by Young, assigns no power to null players and does not reward free riders, and can easily be computed from the minimal winning and blocking coalitions. An application to the Italian elections is presented. Our analysis shows that the measures of group criticality defined so far cannot weigh essential players while only remaining an opportunity measure. We propose a group opportunity test to reconcile the two views.</description>
