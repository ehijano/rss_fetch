      <title>Nursery function rehabilitation projects in port areas can support fish populations but they remain less effective than ensuring compliance to fisheries management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conservation measures are implemented to support biodiversity in areas that are degraded or under anthropogenic pressure. Over the past decade, numerous projects aimed at rehabilitating a fish nursery function in ports, through the installation of artificial structures, have emerged. While studies conducted on these solutions seem promising on a very local scale (e.g., higher densities of juvenile fish on artificial fish nurseries compared to bare port infrastructures), no evaluation has been undertaken yet to establish their contribution to the renewal of coastal fish populations or their performance compared to other conservation measures such as fishing regulation. Here, we used a coupled model of fish population dynamics and fisheries management, ISIS-fish, to describe the coastal commercial fish population, the white seabream (Diplodus sargus) in the highly artificialized Bay of Toulon. Using ISIS-Fish, we simulated rehabilitation and fisheries management scenarios. We provided the first quantitative assessment of the implementation of artificial structures in ports covering 10% and 100% of the available port area and compared, at population level and fishing fleets level, the quantitative consequences of these rehabilitation measures with fishing control measures leading to strict compliance with minimum catch sizes. The rehabilitation of the nursery function in ports demonstrated a potential to enhance the renewal of fish populations and catches. When the size of projects is small the outcomes they provide remain relatively modest in contrast to the impact of regulatory fishing measures. However, we have demonstrated that combining fishing reduction measures and rehabilitation projects has a synergistic effect on fish populations, resulting in increased populations and catches. This study is the first quantitative assessment of fish nursery rehabilitation projects in port areas, by evaluating their effectiveness in renewing coastal fish populations and fisheries and comparing their outcomes with fishing control measures. Small-scale port-area nursery rehabilitation projects can support fish populations, but are less effective than controlling fisheries.</description>

      <title>AOC: Analysis of Orthologous Collections -- an application for the characterization of natural selection in protein-coding sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation Modern molecular sequence analysis increasingly relies on automated and robust software tools for interpretation, annotation, and biological insight. The Analysis of Orthologous Collections (AOC) application automates the identification of genomic sites and species/lineages influenced by natural selection in coding sequence analysis. AOC quantifies different types of selection: negative, diversifying or directional positive, or differential selection between groups of branches. We include all steps necessary to go from unaligned homologous sequences to complete results and interactive visualizations that are designed to aid in the useful interpretation and contextualization. Results We are motivated by a desire to make evolutionary analyses as simple as possible, and to close the disparity in the literature between genes which draw a significant amount of interest and those that are largely overlooked and underexplored. We believe that such underappreciated and understudied genetic datasets can hold rich biological information and offer substantial insights into the diverse patterns and processes of evolution, especially if domain experts are able to perform the analyses themselves. Availability and implementation A Snakemake [M\"older et al., 2021] application implementation is publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/aglucaci/AnalysisOfOrthologousCollections and is accompanied by software documentation and a tutorial.</description>

      <title>Epidemic-induced local awareness behavior inferred from surveys and genetic sequence data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Behavior-disease models suggest that if individuals are aware and take preventive actions when the prevalence of the disease increases among their close contacts, then the pandemic can be contained in a cost-effective way. To measure the true impact of local awareness behavior on epidemic spreading, we propose an efficient approach to identify superspreading events and assign corresponding Event Containment Scores (ECSs) in clinical genetic sequence data. We validate ECS as a measure of local awareness in simulation experiments, and we find that ECS was correlated positively with policy stringency during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we observe a temporary drop in ECS during the Omicron wave in most European countries, matching a survey experiment we carried out at the same time. Our findings bring important insight into the field of awareness modeling through the analysis of large-scale genetic sequence data, one of the most promising data sources in epidemics research.</description>

      <title>Limits on the Evolutionary Rates of Biological Traits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.07533v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the maximum speed at which biological evolution can occur. I derive inequalities that limit the rate of evolutionary processes driven by natural selection, mutations, or genetic drift. These \emph{rate limits} link the variability in a population to evolutionary rates. In particular, high variances in the fitness of a population and of a quantitative trait allow for fast changes in the trait's average. In contrast, low variability makes a trait less susceptible to random changes due to genetic drift. The results in this article generalize Fisher's fundamental theorem of natural selection to dynamics that allow for mutations and genetic drift, via trade-off relations that constrain the evolutionary rates of arbitrary traits. The rate limits can be used to probe questions in various evolutionary biology and ecology settings. They apply, for instance, to trait dynamics within or across species or to the evolution of bacteria strains. They apply to any quantitative trait, e.g., from species' weights to the lengths of DNA strands.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear social evolution and the emergence of collective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Organisms from microbes to humans engage in a variety of social behaviors, which affect fitness in complex, often nonlinear ways. The question of how these behaviors evolve has consequences ranging from antibiotic resistance to human origins. However, evolution with nonlinear social interactions is challenging to model mathematically, especially in combination with spatial, group, and/or kin assortment. We derive a mathematical condition for natural selection with synergistic interactions among any number of individuals. This result applies to populations with arbitrary (but fixed) spatial or network structure, group subdivision, and/or mating patterns. In this condition, nonlinear fitness effects are ascribed to collectives, and weighted by a new measure of collective relatedness. For weak selection, this condition can be systematically evaluated by computing branch lengths of ancestral trees. We apply this condition to pairwise games between diploid relatives, and to dilemmas of collective help or harm among siblings and on spatial networks. Our work provides a rigorous basis for extending the notion of ``actor", in the study of social evolution, from individuals to collectives.</description>

      <title>Recombination enables higher numbers of recessive genes, contributing to the emergence of sexual mating in complex organisms</title>

Abstract: The drift-barrier hypothesis states that random genetic drift constrains the refinement of a phenotype under natural selection. The influence of effective population size and the genome-wide deleterious mutation rate were studied theoretically, and an inverse relationship between mutation rate and genome size has been observed for many species. However, the effect of the recessive gene count, an important feature of the genomic architecture, is unknown. In a Wright-Fisher model, we studied the mutation burden for a growing number of N completely recessive and lethal disease genes. Diploid individuals are represented with a binary $2 \times N$ matrix denoting wild-type and mutated alleles. Analytic results for specific cases were complemented by simulations across a broad parameter regime for gene count, mutation and recombination rates. Simulations revealed transitions to higher mutation burden and prevalence within a few generations that were linked to the extinction of the wild-type haplotype (least-loaded class). This metastability, that is, phases of quasi-equilibrium with intermittent transitions, persists over $100\,000$ generations. The drift-barrier hypothesis is confirmed by a high mutation burden resulting in population collapse. Simulations showed the emergence of mutually exclusive haplotypes for a mutation rate above 0.02 lethal equivalents per generation for a genomic architecture and population size representing complex multicellular organisms such as humans. In such systems, recombination proves pivotal, preventing population collapse and maintaining a mutation burden below 10. This study advances our understanding of gene pool stability, and particularly the role of the number of recessive disorders. Insights into Muller`s ratchet dynamics are provided, and the essential role of recombination in curbing mutation burden and stabilizing the gene pool is demonstrated.</description>
