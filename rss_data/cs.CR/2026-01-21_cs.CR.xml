      <title>Privacy-Preserving Black-Box Optimization (PBBO): Theory and the Model-Based Algorithm DFOp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on solving unconstrained privacy-preserving black-box optimization (PBBO), its corresponding least Frobenius norm updating of quadratic models, and the differentially privacy mechanisms for PBBO. Optimization problems with transformed/encrypted objective functions aim to minimize F(x), which is encrypted/transformed/encrypted to F_k(x) as the output at the k-th iteration. A new derivative-free solver named DFOp, with its implementation, is proposed in this paper, which has a new updating formula for the quadratic model functions. The convergence of DFOp for solving problems with transformed/encrypted objective functions is given. Other analyses, including the new model updating formula and the analysis of the transformation's impact to model functions are presented. We propose two differentially private noise-adding mechanisms for privacy-preserving black-box optimization. Numerical results show that DFOp performs better than compared algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, DFOp is the first derivative-free solver that can solve black-box optimization problems with step-encryption and privacy-preserving black-box problems exactly, which also tries to answer the open question about the combination of derivative-free optimization and privacy.</description>

      <title>Semantic Differentiation for Tackling Challenges in Watermarking Low-Entropy Constrained Generation Outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that while the current approaches for language model watermarking are effective for open-ended generation, they are inadequate at watermarking LM outputs for constrained generation tasks with low-entropy output spaces. Therefore, we devise SeqMark, a sequence-level watermarking algorithm with semantic differentiation that balances the output quality, watermark detectability, and imperceptibility. It improves on the shortcomings of the prevalent token-level watermarking algorithms that cause under-utilization of the sequence-level entropy available for constrained generation tasks. Moreover, we identify and improve upon a different failure mode we term region collapse, associated with prior sequence-level watermarking algorithms. This occurs because the pseudorandom partitioning of semantic space for watermarking in these approaches causes all high-probability outputs to collapse into either invalid or valid regions, leading to a trade-off in output quality and watermarking effectiveness. SeqMark instead, differentiates the high-probable output subspace and partitions it into valid and invalid regions, ensuring the even spread of high-quality outputs among all the regions. On various constrained generation tasks like machine translation, code generation, and abstractive summarization, SeqMark substantially improves watermark detection accuracy (up to 28% increase in F1) while maintaining high generation quality.</description>

      <title>Serverless AI Security: Attack Surface Analysis and Runtime Protection Mechanisms for FaaS-Based Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Serverless computing has achieved widespread adoption, with over 70% of AWS organizations using serverless solutions [1]. Meanwhile, machine learning inference workloads increasingly migrate to Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms for their scalability and cost-efficiency [2], [3], [4]. However, this convergence introduces critical security challenges, with recent reports showing a 220% increase in AI/ML vulnerabilities [5] and serverless computing's fragmented architecture raises new security concerns distinct from traditional cloud deployments [6], [7]. This paper presents the first comprehensive security analysis of machine learning workloads in serverless environments. We systematically characterize the attack surface across five categories: function-level vulnerabilities (cold start exploitation, dependency poisoning), model-specific threats (API-based extraction, adversarial inputs), infrastructure attacks (cross-function contamination, privilege escalation), supply chain risks (malicious layers, backdoored libraries), and IAM complexity (ephemeral nature, serverless functions). Through empirical assessments across AWS Lambda, Azure Functions, and Google Cloud Functions, we demonstrate real-world attack scenarios and quantify their security impact. We propose Serverless AI Shield (SAS), a multi-layered defense framework providing pre-deployment validation, runtime monitoring, and post-execution forensics. Our evaluation shows SAS achieves 94% detection rates while maintaining performance overhead below 9% for inference latency. We release an open-source security toolkit to enable practitioners to assess and harden their serverless AI deployments, advancing the field toward more resilient cloud-native machine learning systems.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Mapping Digital Systems with Bill of Materials: Development, Practices, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern digital ecosystems, spanning software, hardware, learning models, datasets, and cryptographic products, continue to grow in complexity, making it difficult for organizations to understand and manage component dependencies. Bills of Materials (BOMs) have emerged as a structured way to document product components, their interrelationships, and key metadata, improving visibility and security across digital supply chains. This survey provides the first comprehensive cross-domain review of BOM developments and practices. We start by examining the evolution of BOM frameworks in three stages (i.e., pre-development, initial, and accelerated) and summarizing their core principles, key stakeholders, and standardization efforts for hardware, software, artificial intelligence (AI) models, datasets, and cryptographic assets. We then review industry practices for generating BOM data, evaluating its quality, and securely sharing it. Next, we review practical downstream uses of BOM data, including dependency modeling, compliance verification, operational risk assessment, and vulnerability tracking. We also discuss academic efforts to address limitations in current BOM frameworks through refinements, extensions, or new models tailored to emerging domains such as data ecosystems and AI supply chains. Finally, we identify four key gaps that limit the usability and reliability of today's BOM frameworks, motivating future research directions.</description>

      <title>Attesting Model Lineage by Consisted Knowledge Evolution with Fine-Tuning Trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fine-tuning technique in deep learning gives rise to an emerging lineage relationship among models. This lineage provides a promising perspective for addressing security concerns such as unauthorized model redistribution and false claim of model provenance, which are particularly pressing in \textcolor{blue}{open-weight model} libraries where robust lineage verification mechanisms are often lacking. Existing approaches to model lineage detection primarily rely on static architectural similarities, which are insufficient to capture the dynamic evolution of knowledge that underlies true lineage relationships. Drawing inspiration from the genetic mechanism of human evolution, we tackle the problem of model lineage attestation by verifying the joint trajectory of knowledge evolution and parameter modification. To this end, we propose a novel model lineage attestation framework. In our framework, model editing is first leveraged to quantify parameter-level changes introduced by fine-tuning. Subsequently, we introduce a novel knowledge vectorization mechanism that refines the evolved knowledge within the edited models into compact representations by the assistance of probe samples. The probing strategies are adapted to different types of model families. These embeddings serve as the foundation for verifying the arithmetic consistency of knowledge relationships across models, thereby enabling robust attestation of model lineage. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness and resilience of our approach in a variety of adversarial scenarios in the real world. Our method consistently achieves reliable lineage verification across a broad spectrum of model types, including classifiers, diffusion models, and large language models.</description>

      <title>On Abnormal Execution Timing of Conditional Jump Instructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extensive line of work on modern computing architectures has shown that the execution time of instructions can (i) depend on the operand of the instruction or (ii) be influenced by system optimizations, e.g., branch prediction and speculative execution paradigms.
  In this paper, we systematically measure and analyze timing variabilities in conditional jump instructions that can be macro-fused with a preceding instruction, depending on their placement within the binary. Our measurements indicate that these timing variations stem from the micro-op cache placement and the jump's offset in the L1 instruction cache of modern processors. We demonstrate that this behavior is consistent across multiple microarchitectures, including Skylake, Coffee Lake, and Kaby Lake, as well as various real-world implementations. We confirm the prevalence of this variability through extensive experiments on a large-scale set of popular binaries, including libraries from Ubuntu 24.04, Windows 10 Pro, and several open-source cryptographic libraries. We also show that one can easily avoid this timing variability by ensuring that macro-fusible instructions are 32-byte aligned - an approach initially suggested in 2019 by Intel in an overlooked short report. We quantify the performance impact of this approach across the cryptographic libraries, showing a speedup of 2.15% on average (and up to 10.54%) when avoiding the timing variability. As a by-product, we show that this variability can be exploited as a covert channel, achieving a maximum throughput of 16.14 Mbps.</description>

      <title>DROIDCCT: Cryptographic Compliance Test via Trillion-Scale Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop DroidCCT, a distributed test framework to evaluate the scale of a wide range of failures/bugs in cryptography for end users. DroidCCT relies on passive analysis of artifacts from the execution of cryptographic operations in the Android ecosystem to identify weak implementations. We collect trillions of samples from cryptographic operations of Android Keystore on half a billion devices and apply severalanalysis techniques to evaluate the quality of cryptographic output from these devices and their underlying implementations. Our study reveals several patterns of bugs and weakness in cryptographic implementations from various manufacturers and chipsets. We show that the heterogeneous nature of cryptographic implementations results in non-uniform availability and reliability of various cryptographic functions. More importantly, flaws such as the use of weakly-generated random parameters, and timing side channels may surface across deployments of cryptography. Our results highlight the importance of fault- and side-channel-resistant cryptography and the ability to transparently and openly test these implementations.</description>

      <title>ARM MTE Performance in Practice (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first comprehensive analysis of ARM MTE hardware performance on four different microarchitectures: ARM Big (A7x), Little (A5x), and Performance (Cortex-X) cores on the Google Pixel 8 and Pixel 9, and on Ampere Computing's AmpereOne CPU core. We also include preliminary analysis of MTE on Apple's M5 chip. We investigate performance in MTE's primary application -- probabilistic memory safety -- on both SPEC CPU benchmarks and in server workloads such as RocksDB, Nginx, PostgreSQL, and Memcached. While MTE often exhibits modest overheads, we also see performance slowdowns up to 6.64x on certain benchmarks. We identify the microarchitectural cause of these overheads and where they can be addressed in future processors. We then analyze MTE's performance for more specialized security applications such as memory tracing, time-of-check time-of-use prevention, sandboxing, and CFI. In some of these cases, MTE offers significant advantages today, while the benefits for other cases are negligible or will depend on future hardware. Finally, we explore where prior work characterizing MTE performance has either been incomplete or incorrect due to methodological or experimental errors.</description>

      <title>SimFuzz: Similarity-guided Block-level Mutation for RISC-V Processor Fuzzing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) defines processor operations and serves as the interface between hardware and software. As an open ISA, RISC-V lowers the barriers to processor design and encourages widespread adoption, but also exposes processors to security risks such as functional bugs. Processor fuzzing is a powerful technique for automatically detecting these bugs. However, existing fuzzing methods suffer from two main limitations. First, their emphasis on redundant test case generation causes them to overlook cross-processor corner cases. Second, they rely too heavily on coverage guidance. Current coverage metrics are biased and inefficient, and become ineffective once coverage growth plateaus. To overcome these limitations, we propose SimFuzz, a fuzzing framework that constructs a high-quality seed corpus from historical bug-triggering inputs and employs similarity-guided, block-level mutation to efficiently explore the processor input space. By introducing instruction similarity, SimFuzz expands the input space around seeds while preserving control-flow structure, enabling deeper exploration without relying on coverage feedback. We evaluate SimFuzz on three widely used open-source RISC-V processors: Rocket, BOOM, and XiangShan, and discover 17 bugs in total, including 14 previously unknown issues, 7 of which have been assigned CVE identifiers. These bugs affect the decode and memory units, cause instruction and data errors, and can lead to kernel instability or system crashes. Experimental results show that SimFuzz achieves up to 73.22% multiplexer coverage on the high-quality seed corpus. Our findings highlight critical security bugs in mainstream RISC-V processors and offer actionable insights for improving functional verification.</description>

      <title>Taming Various Privilege Escalation in LLM-Based Agent Systems: A Mandatory Access Control Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agent systems are increasingly deployed for complex real-world tasks but remain vulnerable to natural language-based attacks that exploit over-privileged tool use. This paper aims to understand and mitigate such attacks through the lens of privilege escalation, defined as agent actions exceeding the least privilege required for a user's intended task. Based on a formal model of LLM agent systems, we identify novel privilege escalation scenarios, particularly in multi-agent systems, including a variant akin to the classic confused deputy problem. To defend against both known and newly demonstrated privilege escalation, we propose SEAgent, a mandatory access control (MAC) framework built upon attribute-based access control (ABAC). SEAgent monitors agent-tool interactions via an information flow graph and enforces customizable security policies based on entity attributes. Our evaluations show that SEAgent effectively blocks various privilege escalation while maintaining a low false positive rate and negligible system overhead. This demonstrates its robustness and adaptability in securing LLM-based agent systems.</description>

      <title>MongoDB Injection Query Classification Model using MongoDB Log files as Training Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NoSQL Injection attacks are a class of cybersecurity attacks where an attacker sends a specifically engineered query to a NoSQL database which then performs an unauthorized operation. To defend against such attacks, rule based systems were initially developed but then were found to be ineffective to innovative injection attacks hence a model based approach was developed. Most model based detection systems, during testing gave exponentially positive results but were trained only on the query statement sent to the server. However due to the scarcity of data and class imbalances these model based systems were found to be not effective against all attacks in the real world. This paper explores classifying NoSQL injection attacks sent to a MongoDB server based on Log Data, and other extracted features excluding raw query statements. The log data was collected from a simulated attack on an empty MongoDB server which was then processed and explored. A discriminant analysis was carried out to determine statistically significant features to discriminate between injection and benign queries resulting in a dataset of significant features. Several Machine learning based classification models using an AutoML library, "FLAML", as well as 6 manually programmed models were trained on this dataset , which were then trained on 50 randomized samples of data, cross validated and evaluated. The study found that the best model was the "FLAML" library's "XGBoost limited depth" model with an accuracy of 71%.</description>

      <title>Hybrid IDS Using Signature-Based and Anomaly-Based Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrusion detection systems (IDS) are essential for protecting computer systems and networks against a wide range of cyber threats that continue to evolve over time. IDS are commonly categorized into two main types, each with its own strengths and limitations, such as difficulty in detecting previously unseen attacks and the tendency to generate high false positive rates. This paper presents a comprehensive survey and a conceptual overview of Hybrid IDS, which integrate signature-based and anomaly-based detection techniques to enhance attack detection capabilities. The survey examines recent research on Hybrid IDS, classifies existing models into functional categories, and discusses their advantages, limitations, and application domains, including financial systems, air traffic control, and social networks. In addition, recent trends in Hybrid IDS research, such as machine learning-based approaches and cloud-based deployments, are reviewed. Finally, this work outlines potential future research directions aimed at developing more cost-effective Hybrid IDS solutions with improved ability to detect emerging and sophisticated cyberattacks.</description>

      <title>Less Is More -- Until It Breaks: Security Pitfalls of Vision Token Compression in Large Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual token compression is widely adopted to improve the inference efficiency of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), enabling their deployment in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained scenarios. However, existing work has mainly focused on efficiency and performance, while the security implications of visual token compression remain largely unexplored. In this work, we first reveal that visual token compression substantially degrades the robustness of LVLMs: models that are robust under uncompressed inference become highly vulnerable once compression is enabled. These vulnerabilities are state-specific; failure modes emerge only in the compressed setting and completely disappear when compression is disabled, making them particularly hidden and difficult to diagnose. By analyzing the key stages of the compression process, we identify instability in token importance ranking as the primary cause of this robustness degradation. Small and imperceptible perturbations can significantly alter token rankings, leading the compression mechanism to mistakenly discard task-critical information and ultimately causing model failure. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Compression-Aware Attack to systematically study and exploit this vulnerability. CAA directly targets the token selection mechanism and induces failures exclusively under compressed inference. We further extend this approach to more realistic black-box settings and introduce Transfer CAA, where neither the target model nor the compression configuration is accessible. We further evaluate potential defenses and find that they provide only limited protection. Extensive experiments across models, datasets, and compression methods show that visual token compression significantly undermines robustness, revealing a previously overlooked efficiency-security trade-off.</description>

Abstract: Personalized health analytics increasingly rely on population benchmarks to provide contextual insights such as ''How do I compare to others like me?'' However, cohort-based aggregation of health data introduces nontrivial privacy risks, particularly in interactive and longitudinal digital platforms. Existing privacy frameworks such as $k$-anonymity and differential privacy provide essential but largely static guarantees that do not fully capture the cumulative, distributional, and tail-dominated nature of re-identification risk in deployed systems.
  In this work, we present a privacy-preserving cohort analytics framework that combines deterministic cohort constraints, differential privacy mechanisms, and synthetic baseline generation to enable personalized population comparisons while maintaining strong privacy protections. We further introduce a stochastic risk modeling approach that treats re-identification risk as a random variable evolving over time, enabling distributional evaluation through Monte Carlo simulation. Adapting quantitative risk measures from financial mathematics, we define Privacy Loss at Risk (P-VaR) to characterize worst-case privacy outcomes under realistic cohort dynamics and adversary assumptions.
  We validate our framework through system-level analysis and simulation experiments, demonstrating how privacy-utility tradeoffs can be operationalized for digital health platforms. Our results suggest that stochastic risk modeling complements formal privacy guarantees by providing interpretable, decision-relevant metrics for platform designers, regulators, and clinical informatics stakeholders.</description>

      <title>CoSMeTIC: Zero-Knowledge Computational Sparse Merkle Trees with Inclusion-Exclusion Proofs for Clinical Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of clinical data is a cornerstone of biomedical research with applications in areas such as genomic testing and response characterization of therapeutic drugs. Maintaining strict privacy controls is essential because such data typically contains personally identifiable health information of patients. At the same time, regulatory compliance often requires study managers to demonstrate the integrity and authenticity of participant data used in analyses. Balancing these competing requirements, privacy preservation and verifiable accountability, remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we present CoSMeTIC, a zero-knowledge computational framework that proposes computational Sparse Merkle Trees (SMTs) as a means to generate verifiable inclusion and exclusion proofs for individual participants' data in clinical studies. We formally analyze the zero-knowledge properties of CoSMeTIC and evaluate its computational efficiency through extensive experiments. Using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and likelihood-ratio hypothesis tests, along with logistic-regression-based genomic analyses on real-world Huntington's disease datasets, we demonstrate that CoSMeTIC achieves strong privacy guarantees while maintaining statistical fidelity. Our results suggest that CoSMeTIC provides a scalable and practical alternative for achieving regulatory compliance with rigorous privacy protection in large-scale clinical research.</description>

      <title>SplittingSecrets: A Compiler-Based Defense for Preventing Data Memory-Dependent Prefetcher Side-Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional side-channels take advantage of secrets being used as inputs to unsafe instructions, used for memory accesses, or used in control flow decisions. Constant-time programming, which restricts such code patterns, has been widely adopted as a defense against these vulnerabilities. However, new hardware optimizations in the form of Data Memory-dependent Prefetchers (DMP) present in Apple, Intel, and ARM CPUs have shown such defenses are not sufficient. These prefetchers, unlike classical prefetchers, use the content of memory as well as the trace of prior accesses to determine prefetch targets. An adversary abusing such a prefetcher has been shown to be able to mount attacks leaking data-at-rest; data that is never used by the program, even speculatively, in an unsafe manner.
  In response, this paper introduces SplittingSecrets, a compiler-based tool that can harden software libraries against side-channels arising from DMPs. SplittingSecrets's approach avoids reasoning about the complex internals of different DMPs and instead relies on one key aspect of all DMPs: activation requires data to resemble addresses. To prevent secret data from leaking, SplittingSecrets transforms memory operations to ensure that secrets are never stored in memory in a manner resembling an address, thereby avoiding DMP activation on those secrets. Rather than disable a DMP entirely, SplittingSecrets can provide targeted hardening for only specific secrets entirely in software.
  We have implemented SplittingSecrets using LLVM, supporting both source-level memory operations and those generated by the compiler backend for the AArch64 architecture, We have analyzed the performance overhead involved in safeguarding secrets from DMP-induced attacks using common primitives in libsodium, a popular cryptographic library when built for Apple M-series CPUs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Privacy-Preserving Retrieval Augmented Generation with Distance-Preserving Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RAG has emerged as a key technique for enhancing response quality of LLMs without high computational cost. In traditional architectures, RAG services are provided by a single entity that hosts the dataset within a trusted local environment. However, individuals or small organizations often lack the resources to maintain data storage servers, leading them to rely on outsourced cloud storage. This dependence on untrusted third-party services introduces privacy risks. Embedding-based retrieval mechanisms, commonly used in RAG systems, are vulnerable to privacy leakage such as vector-to-text reconstruction attacks and structural leakage via vector analysis. Several privacy-preserving RAG techniques have been proposed but most existing approaches rely on partially homomorphic encryption, which incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving RAG framework (ppRAG) tailored for untrusted cloud environments that defends against vector-to-text attack, vector analysis, and query analysis. We propose Conditional Approximate Distance-Comparison-Preserving Symmetric Encryption (CAPRISE) that encrypts embeddings while still allowing the cloud to compute similarity between an encrypted query and the encrypted database embeddings. CAPRISE preserves only the relative distance ordering between the encrypted query and each encrypted database embedding, without exposing inter-database distances, thereby enhancing both privacy and efficiency. To mitigate query analysis, we introduce DP by perturbing the query embedding prior to encryption, preventing the cloud from inferring sensitive patterns. Experimental results show that ppRAG achieves efficient processing throughput, high retrieval accuracy, strong privacy guarantees, making it a practical solution for resource-constrained users seeking secure cloud-augmented LLMs.</description>

      <title>Zero-Permission Manipulation: Can We Trust Large Multimodal Model Powered GUI Agents?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large multimodal model powered GUI agents are emerging as high-privilege operators on mobile platforms, entrusted with perceiving screen content and injecting inputs. However, their design operates under the implicit assumption of Visual Atomicity: that the UI state remains invariant between observation and action. We demonstrate that this assumption is fundamentally invalid in Android, creating a critical attack surface.
  We present Action Rebinding, a novel attack that allows a seemingly-benign app with zero dangerous permissions to rebind an agent's execution. By exploiting the inevitable observation-to-action gap inherent in the agent's reasoning pipeline, the attacker triggers foreground transitions to rebind the agent's planned action toward the target app. We weaponize the agent's task-recovery logic and Android's UI state preservation to orchestrate programmable, multi-step attack chains. Furthermore, we introduce an Intent Alignment Strategy (IAS) that manipulates the agent's reasoning process to rationalize UI states, enabling it to bypass verification gates (e.g., confirmation dialogs) that would otherwise be rejected.
  We evaluate Action Rebinding Attacks on six widely-used Android GUI agents across 15 tasks. Our results demonstrate a 100% success rate for atomic action rebinding and the ability to reliably orchestrate multi-step attack chains. With IAS, the success rate in bypassing verification gates increases (from 0% to up to 100%). Notably, the attacker application requires no sensitive permissions and contains no privileged API calls, achieving a 0% detection rate across malware scanners (e.g., VirusTotal). Our findings reveal a fundamental architectural flaw in current agent-OS integration and provide critical insights for the secure design of future agent systems.

      <title>Zero-Shot Embedding Drift Detection: A Lightweight Defense Against Prompt Injections in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt injection attacks have become an increasing vulnerability for LLM applications, where adversarial prompts exploit indirect input channels such as emails or user-generated content to circumvent alignment safeguards and induce harmful or unintended outputs. Despite advances in alignment, even state-of-the-art LLMs remain broadly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, underscoring the urgent need for robust, productive, and generalizable detection mechanisms beyond inefficient, model-specific patches. In this work, we propose Zero-Shot Embedding Drift Detection (ZEDD), a lightweight, low-engineering-overhead framework that identifies both direct and indirect prompt injection attempts by quantifying semantic shifts in embedding space between benign and suspect inputs. ZEDD operates without requiring access to model internals, prior knowledge of attack types, or task-specific retraining, enabling efficient zero-shot deployment across diverse LLM architectures. Our method uses adversarial-clean prompt pairs and measures embedding drift via cosine similarity to capture subtle adversarial manipulations inherent to real-world injection attacks. To ensure robust evaluation, we assemble and re-annotate the comprehensive LLMail-Inject dataset spanning five injection categories derived from publicly available sources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that embedding drift is a robust and transferable signal, outperforming traditional methods in detection accuracy and operational efficiency. With greater than 93% accuracy in classifying prompt injections across model architectures like Llama 3, Qwen 2, and Mistral and a false positive rate of &lt;3%, our approach offers a lightweight, scalable defense layer that integrates into existing LLM pipelines, addressing a critical gap in securing LLM-powered systems to withstand adaptive adversarial threats.</description>

      <title>De-Anonymization at Scale via Tournament-Style Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As LLMs rapidly advance and enter real-world use, their privacy implications are increasingly important. We study an authorship de-anonymization threat: using LLMs to link anonymous documents to their authors, potentially compromising settings such as double-blind peer review.
  We propose De-Anonymization at Scale (DAS), a large language model-based method for attributing authorship among tens of thousands of candidate texts. DAS uses a sequential progression strategy: it randomly partitions the candidate corpus into fixed-size groups, prompts an LLM to select the text most likely written by the same author as a query text, and iteratively re-queries the surviving candidates to produce a ranked top-k list. To make this practical at scale, DAS adds a dense-retrieval prefilter to shrink the search space and a majority-voting style aggregation over multiple independent runs to improve robustness and ranking precision. Experiments on anonymized review data show DAS can recover same-author texts from pools of tens of thousands with accuracy well above chance, demonstrating a realistic privacy risk for anonymous platforms. On standard authorship benchmarks (Enron emails and blog posts), DAS also improves both accuracy and scalability over prior approaches, highlighting a new LLM-enabled de-anonymization vulnerability.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Federated Learning with Verifiable Fairness Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed institutions without centralizing sensitive data; however, ensuring algorithmic fairness across heterogeneous data distributions while preserving privacy remains fundamentally unresolved. This paper introduces CryptoFair-FL, a novel cryptographic framework providing the first verifiable fairness guarantees for federated learning systems under formal security definitions. The proposed approach combines additively homomorphic encryption with secure multi-party computation to enable privacy-preserving verification of demographic parity and equalized odds metrics without revealing protected attribute distributions or individual predictions. A novel batched verification protocol reduces computational complexity from BigO(n^2) to BigO(n \log n) while maintaining (\dparam, \deltap)-differential privacy with dparam = 0.5 and deltap = 10^{-6}. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic lower bounds on the privacy cost of fairness verification, demonstrating that the proposed protocol achieves near-optimal privacy-fairness tradeoffs. Comprehensive experiments across four benchmark datasets (MIMIC-IV healthcare records, Adult Income, CelebA, and a novel FedFair-100 benchmark) demonstrate that CryptoFair-FL reduces fairness violations from 0.231 to 0.031 demographic parity difference while incurring only 2.3 times computational overhead compared to standard federated averaging. The framework successfully defends against attribute inference attacks, maintaining adversarial success probability below 0.05 across all tested configurations. These results establish a practical pathway for deploying fairness-aware federated learning in regulated industries requiring both privacy protection and algorithmic accountability.</description>

      <title>AgenTRIM: Tool Risk Mitigation for Agentic AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI agents are autonomous systems that combine LLMs with external tools to solve complex tasks. While such tools extend capability, improper tool permissions introduce security risks such as indirect prompt injection and tool misuse. We characterize these failures as unbalanced tool-driven agency. Agents may retain unnecessary permissions (excessive agency) or fail to invoke required tools (insufficient agency), amplifying the attack surface and reducing performance. We introduce AgenTRIM, a framework for detecting and mitigating tool-driven agency risks without altering an agent's internal reasoning. AgenTRIM addresses these risks through complementary offline and online phases. Offline, AgenTRIM reconstructs and verifies the agent's tool interface from code and execution traces. At runtime, it enforces per-step least-privilege tool access through adaptive filtering and status-aware validation of tool calls. Evaluating on the AgentDojo benchmark, AgenTRIM substantially reduces attack success while maintaining high task performance. Additional experiments show robustness to description-based attacks and effective enforcement of explicit safety policies. Together, these results demonstrate that AgenTRIM provides a practical, capability-preserving approach to safer tool use in LLM-based agents.</description>

      <title>TrojanPraise: Jailbreak LLMs via Benign Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand of customized large language models (LLMs) has led to commercial LLMs offering black-box fine-tuning APIs, yet this convenience introduces a critical security loophole: attackers could jailbreak the LLMs by fine-tuning them with malicious data. Though this security issue has recently been exposed, the feasibility of such attacks is questionable as malicious training dataset is believed to be detectable by moderation models such as Llama-Guard-3. In this paper, we propose TrojanPraise, a novel finetuning-based attack exploiting benign and thus filter-approved data. Basically, TrojanPraise fine-tunes the model to associate a crafted word (e.g., "bruaf") with harmless connotations, then uses this word to praise harmful concepts, subtly shifting the LLM from refusal to compliance. To explain the attack, we decouple the LLM's internal representation of a query into two dimensions of knowledge and attitude. We demonstrate that successful jailbreak requires shifting the attitude while avoiding knowledge shift, a distortion in the model's understanding of the concept. To validate this attack, we conduct experiments on five opensource LLMs and two commercial LLMs under strict black-box settings. Results show that TrojanPraise achieves a maximum attack success rate of 95.88% while evading moderation.</description>

      <title>VR ProfiLens: User Profiling Risks in Consumer Virtual Reality Apps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) platforms and apps collect user sensor data, including motion, facial, eye, and hand data, in abstracted form. These data may expose users to unique privacy risks without their knowledge or meaningful awareness, yet the extent of these risks remains understudied. To address this gap, we propose VR ProfiLens, a framework to study user profiling based on VR sensor data and the resulting privacy risks across consumer VR apps. To systematically study this problem, we first develop a taxonomy rooted in the CCPA definition of personal information and expand it by sensor, app, and threat contexts to identify user attributes at risk. Then, we conduct a user study in which we collect VR sensor data from four sensor groups from real users interacting with 10 popular consumer VR apps, followed by a survey. We design and apply an analysis pipeline to demonstrate the feasibility of inferring user attributes using these data. Our results show that sensitive personal information can be inferred with moderately high to high risk (up to 90% F1 score) from abstracted sensor data. Through feature analysis, we further identify correlations among app groups and sensor groups in inferring user attributes. Our findings highlight risks to users, including privacy loss, tracking, targeted advertising, and safety threats. Finally, we discuss design implications and regulatory recommendations to enhance transparency and better protect users' privacy in VR.</description>

      <title>Abusing the Internet of Medical Things: Evaluating Threat Models and Forensic Readiness for Multi-Vector Attacks on Connected Healthcare Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individuals experiencing interpersonal violence (IPV), who depend on medical devices, represent a uniquely vulnerable population as healthcare technologies become increasingly connected. Despite rapid growth in MedTech innovation and "health-at-home" ecosystems, the intersection of MedTech cybersecurity and technology-facilitated abuse remains critically under-examined. IPV survivors who rely on therapeutic devices encounter a qualitatively different threat environment from the external, technically sophisticated adversaries typically modeled in MedTech cybersecurity research. We address this gap through two complementary methods: (1) the development of hazard-integrated threat models that fuse Cyber physical system security modeling with tech-abuse frameworks, and (2) an immersive simulation with practitioners, deploying a live version of our model, identifying gaps in digital forensic practice.
  Our hazard-integrated CIA threat models map exploits to acute and chronic biological effects, uncovering (i) Integrity attack pathways that facilitate "Medical gaslighting" and "Munchausen-by-IoMT", (ii) Availability attacks that create life-critical and sub-acute harms (glycaemic emergencies, blindness, mood destabilization), and (iii) Confidentiality threats arising from MedTech advertisements (geolocation tracking from BLE broadcasts). Our simulation demonstrates that these attack surfaces are unlikely to be detected in practice: participants overlooked MedTech, misclassified reproductive and assistive technologies, and lacked awareness of BLE broadcast artifacts. Our findings show that MedTech cybersecurity in IPV contexts requires integrated threat modeling and improved forensic capabilities for detecting, preserving and interpreting harms arising from compromised patient-technology ecosystems.</description>

      <title>The Cost of Convenience: Identifying, Analyzing, and Mitigating Predatory Loan Applications on Android</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital lending applications, commonly referred to as loan apps, have become a primary channel for microcredit in emerging markets. However, many of these apps demand excessive permissions and misuse sensitive user data for coercive debt-recovery practices, including harassment, blackmail, and public shaming that affect both borrowers and their contacts.
  This paper presents the first cross-country measurement of loan app compliance against both national regulations and Google's Financial Services Policy. We analyze 434 apps drawn from official registries and app markets from Indonesia, Kenya, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the Philippines. To operationalize policy requirements at scale, we translate policy text into testable permission checks using LLM-assisted policy-to-permission mapping and combine this with static and dynamic analyses of loan apps' code and runtime behavior.
  Our findings reveal pervasive non-compliance among approved apps: 141 violate national regulatory policy and 147 violate Google policy. Dynamic analysis further shows that several apps transmit sensitive data (contacts, SMS, location, media) before user signup or registration, undermining informed consent and enabling downstream harassment of borrowers and third parties. Following our disclosures, Google removed 93 flagged apps from Google Play, representing over 300M cumulative installs.
  We advocate for adopting our methodology as a proactive compliance-monitoring tool and offer targeted recommendations for regulators, platforms, and developers to strengthen privacy protections. Overall, our results highlight the need for coordinated enforcement and robust technical safeguards to ensure that digital lending supports financial inclusion without compromising user privacy or safety.</description>

      <title>BlocksecRT-DETR: Decentralized Privacy-Preserving and Token-Efficient Federated Transformer Learning for Secure Real-Time Object Detection in ITS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated real-time object detection using transformers in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) faces three major challenges: (1) missing-class non-IID data heterogeneity from geographically diverse traffic environments, (2) latency constraints on edge hardware for high-capacity transformer models, and (3) privacy and security risks from untrusted client updates and centralized aggregation. We propose BlockSecRT-DETR, a BLOCKchain-SECured Real-Time Object DEtection TRansformer framework for ITS that provides a decentralized, token-efficient, and privacy-preserving federated training solution using RT-DETR transformer, incorporating a blockchain-secured update validation mechanism for trustworthy aggregation. In this framework, challenges (1) and (2) are jointly addressed through a unified client-side design that integrates RT-DETR training with a Token Engineering Module (TEM). TEM prunes low-utility tokens, reducing encoder complexity and latency on edge hardware, while aggregated updates mitigate non-IID data heterogeneity across clients. To address challenge (3), BlockSecRT-DETR incorporates a decentralized blockchain-secured update validation mechanism that enables tamper-proof, privacy-preserving, and trust-free authenticated model aggregation without relying on a central server. We evaluated the proposed framework under a missing-class Non-IID partition of the KITTI dataset and conducted a blockchain case study to quantify security overhead. TEM improves inference latency by 17.2% and reduces encoder FLOPs by 47.8%, while maintaining global detection accuracy (89.20% mAP@0.5). The blockchain integration adds 400 ms per round, and the ledger size remains under 12 KB due to metadata-only on-chain storage.</description>

      <title>CellularSpecSec-Bench: A Staged Benchmark for Evidence-Grounded Interpretation and Security Reasoning over 3GPP Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular networks are critical infrastructure supporting billions of worldwide users and safety- and mission-critical services. Vulnerabilities in cellular networks can therefore cause service disruption, privacy breaches, and broad societal harm, motivating growing efforts to analyze 3GPP specifications that define required device and operator behavior. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the capability for reading technical documents, cellular specifications impose unique challenges: faithful interpretation of normative language, reasoning across cross-referenced clauses, and verifiable conclusions grounded in multimodal evidence such as tables and figures. To address these challenges, we propose CellSpecSec-ARI, a unified Adapt-Retrieve-Integrate framework for systematic understanding and standard-driven security analysis of 3GPP specifications; CellularSpecSec-Bench, a staged benchmark, containing newly constructed high-quality datasets with expert-verified and corrected subsets from prior open-source resources. Together, they establish an accessible and reproducible foundation for quantifying progress in specification understanding and security reasoning in the cellular network security domain.</description>

      <title>DUAP: Dual-task Universal Adversarial Perturbations Against Voice Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Voice Control Systems (VCS) rely on the collaboration of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Speaker Recognition (SR) for secure interaction. However, prior adversarial attacks typically target these tasks in isolation, overlooking the coupled decision pipeline in real-world scenarios. Consequently, single-task attacks often fail to pose a practical threat. To fill this gap, we first utilize gradient analysis to reveal that ASR and SR exhibit no inherent conflicts. Building on this, we propose Dual-task Universal Adversarial Perturbation (DUAP). Specifically, DUAP employs a targeted surrogate objective to effectively disrupt ASR transcription and introduces a Dynamic Normalized Ensemble (DNE) strategy to enhance transferability across diverse SR models. Furthermore, we incorporate psychoacoustic masking to ensure perturbation imperceptibility. Extensive evaluations across five ASR and six SR models demonstrate that DUAP achieves high simultaneous attack success rates and superior imperceptibility, significantly outperforming existing single-task baselines.</description>

      <title>PDFInspect: A Unified Feature Extraction Framework for Malicious Document Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of malicious Portable Document Format (PDF) files necessitates robust and comprehensive feature extraction techniques for effective detection and analysis. This work presents a unified framework that integrates graph-based, structural, and metadata-driven analysis to generate a rich feature representation for each PDF document. The system extracts text from PDF pages and constructs undirected graphs based on pairwise word relationships, enabling the computation of graph-theoretic features such as node count, edge density, and clustering coefficient. Simultaneously, the framework parses embedded metadata to quantify character distributions, entropy patterns, and inconsistencies across fields such as author, title, and producer. Temporal features are derived from creation and modification timestamps to capture behavioral signatures, while structural elements including, object streams, fonts, and embedded images, are quantified to reflect document complexity. Boolean flags for potentially malicious PDF constructs (e.g., JavaScript, launch actions) are also extracted. Together, these features form a high-dimensional vector representation (170 dimensions) that is well-suited for downstream tasks such as malware classification, anomaly detection, and forensic analysis. The proposed approach is scalable, extensible, and designed to support real-world PDF threat intelligence workflows.6</description>

      <title>SWORD: A Secure LoW-Latency Offline-First Authentication and Data Sharing Scheme for Resource Constrained Distributed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many resource-constrained networks, such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Internet of Vehicles (IoV), are inherently distributed, the majority still rely on central servers for fast authentication and data sharing. Blockchain-based solutions offer decentralized alternatives but often struggle to meet the stringent latency requirements of real-time applications. Even with the rollout of 5G, network latency between servers and peers remains a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce SWORD, a novel offline-first authentication and data-sharing scheme designed specifically for resource-constrained networks. SWORD utilizes a proximity-based clustering approach to enable offline authentication and data sharing, ensuring low-latency, secure operations even in intermittently connected scenarios. Our experimental results show that SWORD outperforms traditional blockchain-based solutions while offering similar resource efficiency and authentication latency to central-server-based solutions. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive security analysis, demonstrating that SWORD is resilient against spoofing, impersonation, replay, and man-in-the-middle attacks.</description>

      <title>Static Detection of Core Structures in Tigress Virtualization-Based Obfuscation Using an LLVM Pass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Malware often uses obfuscation to hinder security analysis. Among these techniques, virtualization-based obfuscation is particularly strong because it protects programs by translating original instructions into attacker-defined virtual machine (VM) bytecode, producing long and complex code that is difficult to analyze and deobfuscate. This paper aims to identify the structural components of virtualization-based obfuscation through static analysis. By examining the execution model of obfuscated code, we define and detect the key elements required for deobfuscation-namely the dispatch routine, handler blocks, and the VM region-using LLVM IR. Experimental results show that, in the absence of compiler optimizations, the proposed LLVM Pass successfully detects all core structures across major virtualization options, including switch, direct, and indirect modes.</description>

      <title>Your Privacy Depends on Others: Collusion Vulnerabilities in Individual Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Individual Differential Privacy (iDP) promises users control over their privacy, but this promise can be broken in practice. We reveal a previously overlooked vulnerability in sampling-based iDP mechanisms: while conforming to the iDP guarantees, an individual's privacy risk is not solely governed by their own privacy budget, but critically depends on the privacy choices of all other data contributors. This creates a mismatch between the promise of individual privacy control and the reality of a system where risk is collectively determined. We demonstrate empirically that certain distributions of privacy preferences can unintentionally inflate the privacy risk of individuals, even when their formal guarantees are met. Moreover, this excess risk provides an exploitable attack vector. A central adversary or a set of colluding adversaries can deliberately choose privacy budgets to amplify vulnerabilities of targeted individuals. Most importantly, this attack operates entirely within the guarantees of DP, hiding this excess vulnerability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates successful attacks against 62% of targeted individuals, substantially increasing their membership inference susceptibility. To mitigate this, we propose $(\varepsilon_i,\delta_i,\overline{\Delta})$-iDP a privacy contract that uses $\Delta$-divergences to provide users with a hard upper bound on their excess vulnerability, while offering flexibility to mechanism design. Our findings expose a fundamental challenge to the current paradigm, demanding a re-evaluation of how iDP systems are designed, audited, communicated, and deployed to make excess risks transparent and controllable.</description>

      <title>On the Evidentiary Limits of Membership Inference for Copyright Auditing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are trained on increasingly opaque corpora, membership inference attacks (MIAs) have been proposed to audit whether copyrighted texts were used during training, despite growing concerns about their reliability under realistic conditions. We ask whether MIAs can serve as admissible evidence in adversarial copyright disputes where an accused model developer may obfuscate training data while preserving semantic content, and formalize this setting through a judge-prosecutor-accused communication protocol. To test robustness under this protocol, we introduce SAGE (Structure-Aware SAE-Guided Extraction), a paraphrasing framework guided by Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) that rewrites training data to alter lexical structure while preserving semantic content and downstream utility. Our experiments show that state-of-the-art MIAs degrade when models are fine-tuned on SAGE-generated paraphrases, indicating that their signals are not robust to semantics-preserving transformations. While some leakage remains in certain fine-tuning regimes, these results suggest that MIAs are brittle in adversarial settings and insufficient, on their own, as a standalone mechanism for copyright auditing of LLMs.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility in Event-Log Research: A Parametrised Generator and Benchmark for Event-based Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-based datasets are crucial for cybersecurity analysis. A key use case is detecting event-based signatures, which represent attacks spanning multiple events and can only be understood once the relevant events are identified and linked. Analysing event datasets is essential for monitoring system security, but their growing volume and frequency create significant scalability and processing difficulties. Researchers rely on these datasets to develop and test techniques for automatically identifying signatures. However, because real datasets are security-sensitive and rarely shared, it becomes difficult to perform meaningful comparative evaluation between different approaches. This work addresses this evaluation limitation by offering a systematic method for generating event logs with known ground truth, enabling reproducible and comparable research. We present a novel parametrised generation technique capable of producing synthetic event datasets that contain event-based signatures for discovery. To demonstrate the capabilities of the technique, we provide a benchmark in signature detection. Our benchmarking demonstrated the suitability of DBSCAN, achieving a score greater than 0.95 Adjusted Rand Index on most generated datasets. This work enhances the ability of researchers to develop and benchmark new cybersecurity techniques, ultimately contributing to more robust and effective cybersecurity measures.</description>

      <title>KinGuard: Hierarchical Kinship-Aware Fingerprinting to Defend Against Large Language Model Stealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protecting the intellectual property of large language models requires robust ownership verification. Conventional backdoor fingerprinting, however, is flawed by a stealth-robustness paradox: to be robust, these methods force models to memorize fixed responses to high-perplexity triggers, but this targeted overfitting creates detectable statistical artifacts. We resolve this paradox with KinGuard, a framework that embeds a private knowledge corpus built on structured kinship narratives. Instead of memorizing superficial triggers, the model internalizes this knowledge via incremental pre-training, and ownership is verified by probing its conceptual understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate KinGuard's superior effectiveness, stealth, and resilience against a battery of attacks including fine-tuning, input perturbation, and model merging. Our work establishes knowledge-based embedding as a practical and secure paradigm for model fingerprinting.</description>

      <title>PrivFly: A Privacy-Preserving Self-Supervised Framework for Rare Attack Detection in IoFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Flying Things (IoFT) plays a vital role in modern applications such as aerial surveillance and smart mobility. However, it remains highly vulnerable to cyberattacks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data. Developing effective intrusion detection systems (IDS) for IoFT networks faces key challenges, including data imbalance, privacy concerns, and the limited capability of traditional models to detect rare but potentially damaging cyber threats. In this work, we propose PrivFly, a privacy-preserving IDS framework that integrates self-supervised representation learning and differential privacy (DP) to enhance detection performance in imbalanced IoFT network traffic. We propose a masked feature reconstruction module for self-supervised pretraining, improving feature representations and boosting rare-class detection. Differential privacy is applied during training to protect sensitive information without significantly compromising model performance. In addition, we conduct a SHapley additive explanations (SHAP)-based analysis to evaluate the impact of DP on feature importance and model behavior. Experimental results on the ECU-IoFT dataset show that PrivFly achieves up to 98% accuracy and 99% F1-score, effectively balancing privacy and detection performance for secure IoFT systems.</description>

      <title>Post-Quantum Secure Aggregation via Code-Based Homomorphic Encryption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secure aggregation enables aggregation of inputs from multiple parties without revealing individual contributions to the server or other clients. Existing post-quantum approaches based on homomorphic encryption offer practical efficiency but predominantly rely on lattice-based hardness assumptions. We present a code-based alternative for secure aggregation by instantiating a general framework based on key- and message-additive homomorphic encryption under the Learning Parity with Noise (LPN) assumption. Our construction employs a committee-based decryptor realized via secret sharing and incorporates a Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)-based optimization to reduce the communication costs of LPN-based instantiations. We analyze the security of the proposed scheme under a new Hint-LPN assumption and show that it is equivalent to standard LPN for suitable parameters. Finally, we evaluate performance and identify regimes in which our approach outperforms information-theoretically secure aggregation protocols.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput and Scalable Secure Inference Protocols for Deep Learning with Packed Secret Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most existing secure neural network inference protocols based on secure multi-party computation (MPC) typically support at most four participants, demonstrating severely limited scalability. Liu et al. (USENIX Security'24) presented the first relatively practical approach by utilizing Shamir secret sharing with Mersenne prime fields. However, when processing deeper neural networks such as VGG16, their protocols incur substantial communication overhead, resulting in particularly significant latency in wide-area network (WAN) environments. In this paper, we propose a high-throughput and scalable MPC protocol for neural network inference against semi-honest adversaries in the honest-majority setting. The core of our approach lies in leveraging packed Shamir secret sharing (PSS) to enable parallel computation and reduce communication complexity. The main contributions are three-fold: i) We present a communication-efficient protocol for vector-matrix multiplication, based on our newly defined notion of vector-matrix multiplication-friendly random share tuples. ii) We design the filter packing approach that enables parallel convolution. iii) We further extend all non-linear protocols based on Shamir secret sharing to the PSS-based protocols for achieving parallel non-linear operations. Extensive experiments across various datasets and neural networks demonstrate the superiority of our approach in WAN. Compared to Liu et al. (USENIX Security'24), our scheme reduces the communication upto 5.85x, 11.17x, and 6.83x in offline, online and total communication overhead, respectively. In addition, our scheme is upto 1.59x, 2.61x, and 1.75x faster in offline, online and total running time, respectively.</description>

      <title>Adversarial News and Lost Profits: Manipulating Headlines in LLM-Driven Algorithmic Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in the financial domain. Their exceptional capabilities to analyse textual data make them well-suited for inferring the sentiment of finance-related news. Such feedback can be leveraged by algorithmic trading systems (ATS) to guide buy/sell decisions. However, this practice bears the risk that a threat actor may craft "adversarial news" intended to mislead an LLM. In particular, the news headline may include "malicious" content that remains invisible to human readers but which is still ingested by the LLM. Although prior work has studied textual adversarial examples, their system-wide impact on LLM-supported ATS has not yet been quantified in terms of monetary risk. To address this threat, we consider an adversary with no direct access to an ATS but able to alter stock-related news headlines on a single day. We evaluate two human-imperceptible manipulations in a financial context: Unicode homoglyph substitutions that misroute models during stock-name recognition, and hidden-text clauses that alter the sentiment of the news headline. We implement a realistic ATS in Backtrader that fuses an LSTM-based price forecast with LLM-derived sentiment (FinBERT, FinGPT, FinLLaMA, and six general-purpose LLMs), and quantify monetary impact using portfolio metrics. Experiments on real-world data show that manipulating a one-day attack over 14 months can reliably mislead LLMs and reduce annual returns by up to 17.7 percentage points. To assess real-world feasibility, we analyze popular scraping libraries and trading platforms and survey 27 FinTech practitioners, confirming our hypotheses. We notified trading platform owners of this security issue.</description>

      <title>CODE: A Contradiction-Based Deliberation Extension Framework for Overthinking Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introducing reasoning models into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhances task performance through step-by-step reasoning, logical consistency, and multi-step self-verification. However, recent studies have shown that reasoning models suffer from overthinking attacks, where models are tricked to generate unnecessarily high number of reasoning tokens. In this paper, we reveal that such overthinking risk can be inherited by RAG systems equipped with reasoning models, by proposing an end-to-end attack framework named Contradiction-Based Deliberation Extension (CODE). Specifically, CODE develops a multi-agent architecture to construct poisoning samples that are injected into the knowledge base. These samples 1) are highly correlated with the use query, such that can be retrieved as inputs to the reasoning model; and 2) contain contradiction between the logical and evidence layers that cause models to overthink, and are optimized to exhibit highly diverse styles. Moreover, the inference overhead of CODE is extremely difficult to detect, as no modification is needed on the user query, and the task accuracy remain unaffected. Extensive experiments on two datasets across five commercial reasoning models demonstrate that the proposed attack causes a 5.32x-24.72x increase in reasoning token consumption, without degrading task performance. Finally, we also discuss and evaluate potential countermeasures to mitigate overthinking risks.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Driven Synthetic Tabular Data Generation for Enhanced DoS/DDoS Attack Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Class imbalance refers to a situation where certain classes in a dataset have significantly fewer samples than oth- ers, leading to biased model performance. Class imbalance in network intrusion detection using Tabular Denoising Diffusion Probability Models (TabDDPM) for data augmentation is ad- dressed in this paper. Our approach synthesizes high-fidelity minority-class samples from the CIC-IDS2017 dataset through iterative denoising processes. For the minority classes that have smaller samples, synthetic samples were generated and merged with the original dataset. The augmented training data enables an ANN classifier to achieve near-perfect recall on previously underrepresented attack classes. These results establish diffusion models as an effective solution for tabular data imbalance in security domains, with potential applications in fraud detection and medical diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Function Recovery Attacks in Gate-Hiding Garbled Circuits using SAT Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-Private Function Evaluation enables joint computation while protecting both input data and function logic. A practical instantiation is gate-hiding garbled circuits, which conceal gate functionalities while revealing the circuit topology. Existing security definitions intentionally exclude leakage through circuit topology, leaving the concrete impact of such leakage on function privacy insufficiently understood.
  We analyze the empirical security of gate hiding under two adversarial models that capture realistic computational capabilities. We present a SAT-based function-recovery attack that reconstructs hidden gate operations from a circuit's public topology. To enable recovery on larger and more complex circuits, we develop an incremental SAT-solving framework combined with a set of composable, topology-preserving simplification theorems. These techniques jointly reduce the SAT instance size and progressively constrain the search space across repeated solving iterations.
  We evaluate our attack on ISCAS benchmarks, representative secure computation circuits, and fault-tolerant sensor fusion circuits under a fixed 24-hour recovery budget. Compared to baseline approaches, our optimized attack achieves up to a 159-fold speedup in recovery time without increasing the number of oracle queries. Our results demonstrate that topology leakage alone can enable effective function recovery in practice.</description>

      <title>QERS: Quantum Encryption Resilience Score for Post-Quantum Cryptography in Computer, IoT, and IIoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is becoming essential for securing Internet of Things (IoT) and Industrial IoT (IIoT) systems against quantum-enabled adversaries. However, existing evaluation approaches primarily focus on isolated performance metrics, offering limited support for holistic security and deployment decisions. This paper introduces QERS (Quantum Encryption Resilience Score), a universal measurement framework that integrates cryptographic performance, system constraints, and multi-criteria decision analysis to assess PQC readiness in computer, IoT, and IIoT environments. QERS combines normalized metrics, weighted aggregation, and machine learning-assisted analysis to produce interpretable resilience scores across heterogeneous devices and communication protocols. Experimental results demonstrate how the framework enables comparative evaluation of post-quantum schemes under realistic resource constraints, supporting informed security design and migration planning. This work is presented as a preprint, with extended statistical validation planned as part of ongoing graduate research.</description>

      <title>Quantum Encryption Resilience Score (QERS) for MQTT, HTTP, and HTTPS under Post-Quantum Cryptography in Computer, IoT, and IIoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) introduces significant computational and communication overhead, which poses challenges for resource-constrained computer systems, Internet of Things (IoT), and Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of the Quantum Encryption Resilience Score (QERS) applied to MQTT, HTTP, and HTTPS communication protocols operating under PQC. Using an ESP32-C6 client and an ARM-based Raspberry Pi CM4 server, latency, CPU utilization, RSSI, energy consumption, key size, and TLS handshake overhead are measured under realistic operating conditions. QERS integrates these heterogeneous metrics into normalized Basic, Tuned, and Fusion scores, enabling systematic comparison of protocol efficiency and security resilience. Experimental results show that MQTT provides the highest efficiency under PQC constraints, while HTTPS achieves the highest security-weighted resilience at the cost of increased latency and resource consumption. The proposed framework supports informed protocol selection and migration planning for PQC-enabled IoT and IIoT deployments.</description>

      <title>A Scientific Data Integrity system based on Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In most High Performance Computing (HPC) projects nowadays, there is a lot of data obtained from different sources, depending on the project's objectives. Some of that data is very huge in terms of size, so copying such data sometimes is an unrealistic goal. On the other hand, science requires data used for different purposes to remain unaltered, so different groups of researchers can reproduce results, discuss theories, and validate each other. In this paper, we present a novel approach to help research groups to validate data integrity on such distributed repositories using Blockchain. Originally developed for cryptographic currencies, Blockchain has demonstrated a versatile range of uses. Our proposal ensures 1) secure access to data management, 2) easy validation of data integrity, and 3) an easy way to add new records to the dataset with the same robust integrity policy. A prototype was developed and tested using a subset of a public dataset from a real scientific collaboration, the Latin American Giant Observatory (LAGO) Project.</description>

      <title>Techniques of Modern Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The techniques used in modern attacks have become an important factor for investigation. As we advance further into the digital age, cyber attackers are employing increasingly sophisticated and highly threatening methods. These attacks target not only organizations and governments but also extend to private and corporate sectors. Modern attack techniques, such as lateral movement and ransomware, are designed to infiltrate networks and steal sensitive data. Among these techniques, Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a complex method of attack aimed at specific targets to steal high-value sensitive information or damage the infrastructure of the targeted organization. In this paper, I will investigate Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) as a modern attack technique, focusing on both the attack life cycle and cutting-edge detection and defense strategies proposed in recent academic research. I will analyze four representative papers to understand the evolution of APT detection mechanisms, including machine learning-driven behavioral analysis and network-level collaborative defense models. Through this comparative analysis, I aim to highlight the strengths and limitations of each approach and propose more adaptive APT mitigation strategies. The study seeks to analyze the key characteristics of APTs and provide a comprehensive high-level understanding of APTs along with potential solutions to the threats they pose.</description>

      <title>Automatic Adjustment of HPA Parameters and Attack Prevention in Kubernetes Using Random Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, HTTP status codes are used as custom metrics within the HPA as the experimental scenario. By integrating the Random Forest classification algorithm from machine learning, attacks are assessed and predicted, dynamically adjusting the maximum pod parameter in the HPA to manage attack traffic. This approach enables the adjustment of HPA parameters using machine learning scripts in targeted attack scenarios while effectively managing attack traffic. All access from attacking IPs is redirected to honeypot pods, achieving a lower incidence of 5XX status codes through HPA pod adjustments under high load conditions. This method also ensures effective isolation of attack traffic, preventing excessive HPA expansion due to attacks. Additionally, experiments conducted under various conditions demonstrate the importance of setting appropriate thresholds for HPA adjustments.</description>

      <title>Eliciting Harmful Capabilities by Fine-Tuning On Safeguarded Outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model developers implement safeguards in frontier models to prevent misuse, for example, by employing classifiers to filter dangerous outputs. In this work, we demonstrate that even robustly safeguarded models can be used to elicit harmful capabilities in open-source models through elicitation attacks. Our elicitation attacks consist of three stages: (i) constructing prompts in adjacent domains to a target harmful task that do not request dangerous information; (ii) obtaining responses to these prompts from safeguarded frontier models; (iii) fine-tuning open-source models on these prompt-output pairs. Since the requested prompts cannot be used to directly cause harm, they are not refused by frontier model safeguards. We evaluate these elicitation attacks within the domain of hazardous chemical synthesis and processing, and demonstrate that our attacks recover approximately 40% of the capability gap between the base open-source model and an unrestricted frontier model. We then show that the efficacy of elicitation attacks scales with the capability of the frontier model and the amount of generated fine-tuning data. Our work demonstrates the challenge of mitigating ecosystem level risks with output-level safeguards.</description>

      <title>When Reasoning Leaks Membership: Membership Inference Attack on Black-box Large Reasoning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have rapidly gained prominence for their strong performance in solving complex tasks. Many modern black-box LRMs expose the intermediate reasoning traces through APIs to improve transparency (e.g., Gemini-2.5 and Claude-sonnet). Despite their benefits, we find that these traces can leak membership signals, creating a new privacy threat even without access to token logits used in prior attacks. In this work, we initiate the first systematic exploration of Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) on black-box LRMs. Our preliminary analysis shows that LRMs produce confident, recall-like reasoning traces on familiar training member samples but more hesitant, inference-like reasoning traces on non-members. The representations of these traces are continuously distributed in the semantic latent space, spanning from familiar to unfamiliar samples. Building on this observation, we propose BlackSpectrum, the first membership inference attack framework targeting the black-box LRMs. The key idea is to construct a recall-inference axis in the semantic latent space, based on representations derived from the exposed traces. By locating where a query sample falls along this axis, the attacker can obtain a membership score and predict how likely it is to be a member of the training data. Additionally, to address the limitations of outdated datasets unsuited to modern LRMs, we provide two new datasets to support future research, arXivReasoning and BookReasoning. Empirically, exposing reasoning traces significantly increases the vulnerability of LRMs to membership inference attacks, leading to large gains in attack performance. Our findings highlight the need for LRM companies to balance transparency in intermediate reasoning traces with privacy preservation.</description>

      <title>Secure Multi-Path Routing with All-or-Nothing Transform for Network-on-Chip Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring Network-on-Chip (NoC) security is crucial to design trustworthy NoC-based System-on-Chip (SoC) architectures. While there are various threats that exploit on-chip communication vulnerabilities, eavesdropping attacks via malicious nodes are among the most common and stealthy. Although encryption can secure packets for confidentiality, it may introduce unacceptable overhead for resource-constrained SoCs. In this paper, we propose a lightweight confidentiality-preserving framework that utilizes a quasi-group based All-Or-Nothing Transform (AONT) combined with secure multi-path routing in NoC-based SoCs. By applying AONT to each packet and distributing its transformed blocks across multiple non-overlapping routes, we ensure that no intermediate router can reconstruct the original data without all blocks. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method effectively mitigates eavesdropping attacks by malicious routers with negligible area and performance overhead. Our results also reveal that AONT-based multi-path routing can provide 7.3x reduction in overhead compared to traditional encryption for securing against eavesdropping attacks.</description>

      <title>PINA: Prompt Injection Attack against Navigation Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigation agents powered by large language models (LLMs) convert natural language instructions into executable plans and actions. Compared to text-based applications, their security is far more critical: a successful prompt injection attack does not just alter outputs but can directly misguide physical navigation, leading to unsafe routes, mission failure, or real-world harm. Despite this high-stakes setting, the vulnerability of navigation agents to prompt injection remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose PINA, an adaptive prompt optimization framework tailored to navigation agents under black-box, long-context, and action-executable constraints. Experiments on indoor and outdoor navigation agents show that PINA achieves high attack success rates with an average ASR of 87.5%, surpasses all baselines, and remains robust under ablation and adaptive-attack conditions. This work provides the first systematic investigation of prompt injection attacks in navigation and highlights their urgent security implications for embodied LLM agents.</description>

      <title>ORCA -- An Automated Threat Analysis Pipeline for O-RAN Continuous Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) integrates numerous software components in a cloud-like deployment, opening the radio access network to previously unconsidered security threats. With the ever-evolving threat landscape, integrating security practices through a DevSecOps approach is essential for fast and secure releases. Current vulnerability assessment practices often rely on manual, labor-intensive, and subjective investigations, leading to inconsistencies in the threat analysis. To mitigate these issues, we establish an automated pipeline that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) to minimize human intervention and associated biases. By mapping real-world vulnerabilities to predefined threat lists with a standardized input format, our approach is the first to enable iterative, quantitative, and efficient assessments, generating reliable threat scores for both individual vulnerabilities and entire system components within O-RAN. We illustrate the effectiveness of our framework through an example implementation for O-RAN, showcasing how continuous security testing can integrate into automated testing pipelines to address the unique security challenges of this paradigm shift in telecommunications.</description>

      <title>The Limits of Conditional Volatility: Assessing Cryptocurrency VaR under EWMA and IGARCH Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The application of the standard static Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model for cryptocurrency risk management resulted in a systemic failure, evidenced by a 80.67% chance of loss in the 5% value-at-risk benchmark. This study addresses a critical literature gap by comparatively testing three conditional volatility models the EWMA/IGARCH baseline, an IGARCH model augmented with explicit mean reversion (IGARCH + MR), and a modified EGARCH-style asymmetric shock model within a correlated Monte Carlo VaR framework. Crucially, the analysis is applied specifically to high-beta altcoins (XRP, SOL, ADA), an asset class largely neglected by mainstream GARCH literature. Our results demonstrate that imposing stationarity (IGARCH + MR) drastically underestimates downside risk (5 percent value-at-risk reduced by 50%), while the asymmetric model (Model 3) leads to severe over-penalization. The EWMA/IGARCH baseline, characterized by infinite volatility persistence (alpha + beta = 1), provided the only robust conditional volatility estimate. This finding constitutes a formal rejection of the conventional financial hypotheses of volatility mean reversion and the asymmetric leverage effect in the altcoin asset class, establishing that non-stationary frameworks are a prerequisite for regulatory-grade risk modeling in this domain.</description>

      <title>MirageNet:A Secure, Efficient, and Scalable On-Device Model Protection in Heterogeneous TEE and GPU System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As edge devices gain stronger computing power, deploying high-performance DNN models on untrusted hardware has become a practical approach to cut inference latency and protect user data privacy. Given high model training costs and user experience requirements, balancing model privacy and low runtime overhead is critical. TEEs offer a viable defense, and prior work has proposed heterogeneous GPU-TEE inference frameworks via parameter obfuscation to balance efficiency and confidentiality. However, recent studies find partial obfuscation defenses ineffective, while robust schemes cause unacceptable latency. To resolve these issues, we propose ConvShatter, a novel obfuscation scheme that achieves low latency and high accuracy while preserving model confidentiality and integrity. It leverages convolution linearity to decompose kernels into critical and common ones, inject confounding decoys, and permute channel/kernel orders. Pre-deployment, it performs kernel decomposition, decoy injection and order obfuscation, storing minimal recovery parameters securely in the TEE. During inference, the TEE reconstructs outputs of obfuscated convolutional layers. Extensive experiments show ConvShatter substantially reduces latency overhead with strong security guarantees; versus comparable schemes, it cuts overhead by 16% relative to GroupCover while maintaining accuracy on par with the original model.</description>

      <title>Robust Reversible Watermarking in Encrypted Images Based on Dual-MSBs Spiral Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust reversible watermarking in encrypted images (RRWEI) faces an inherent challenge in simultaneously achieving robustness, reversibility, and content privacy under severely constrained embedding capacity. Existing RRWEI schemes often exhibit limited robustness against noise, lossy compression, and cropping attacks due to insufficient redundancy in the encrypted domain. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel RRWEI framework that couples dual most significant bit-plane (dual-MSBs) embedding with spatial redundancy and error-correcting coding. By compressing prediction-error bit-planes, sufficient embedding space and auxiliary information for lossless reconstruction are reserved. The dual-MSBs are further reorganized using a spiral embedding strategy to distribute multiple redundant watermark copies across spatially dispersed regions, enhancing robustness against both noise and spatial loss.Experimental results on standard test images demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms under evaluated settings robustness against Gaussian noise, JPEG compression, and diverse cropping attacks, while maintaining perfect reversibility and high embedding capacity. Compared with state-of-the-art RRWEI schemes, the proposed framework achieves substantially lower bit-error rates and more stable performance under a wide range of attack scenarios.</description>

      <title>HardSecBench: Benchmarking the Security Awareness of LLMs for Hardware Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly integrated into practical hardware and firmware development pipelines for code generation. Existing studies have primarily focused on evaluating the functional correctness of LLM-generated code, yet paid limited attention to its security issues. However, LLM-generated code that appears functionally sound may embed security flaws which could induce catastrophic damages after deployment. This critical research gap motivates us to design a benchmark for assessing security awareness under realistic specifications. In this work, we introduce HardSecBench, a benchmark with 924 tasks spanning Verilog Register Transfer Level (RTL) and firmware-level C, covering 76 hardware-relevant Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) entries. Each task includes a structured specification, a secure reference implementation, and executable tests. To automate artifact synthesis, we propose a multi-agent pipeline that decouples synthesis from verification and grounds evaluation in execution evidence, enabling reliable evaluation. Using HardSecBench, we evaluate a range of LLMs on hardware and firmware code generation and find that models often satisfy functional requirements while still leaving security risks. We also find that security results vary with prompting. These findings highlight pressing challenges and offer actionable insights for future advancements in LLM-assisted hardware design. Our data and code will be released soon.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Cyber Threat Intelligence by Network Forensic Analysis for Ransomware as a Service(RaaS) Malwares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current era of interconnected cyberspace, there is an adverse effect of ransomware on individuals, startups, and large companies. Cybercriminals hold digital assets till the demand for payment is made. The success of ransomware upsurged with the introduction of Ransomware as a Service(RaaS) franchise in the darknet market. Obfuscation and polymorphic nature of malware make them more difficult to identify by Antivirus system. Signature based intrusion detection is still on role suffering from the scarcity of RaaS packet signatures. We have analysed RaaS samples by network forensic approach to investigate on packet captures of benign and malicious network traffic. The behavior analysis of RaaS family Ransomwares, Ryuk and Gandcrab have been investigated to classify the packets as suspicious, malicious, and non-malicious which further aid in generating RaaS packet signatures for early detection and mitigation of ransomwares belonging to RaaS family. More than 40\% of packets are found malicious in this experiment. The proposed method is also verified by Virus Total API Approach. Further, the proposed approach is recommended for integration into honeypots in the present scenario to combat with data scarcity concerned with malware samples(RaaS). This data will be helpful in developing AI-based threat intelligence mechanisms. In turn enhance detection, prevention of threats, incident response and risk assessment.</description>

      <title>Know Your Contract: Extending eIDAS Trust into Public Blockchains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public blockchains lack native mechanisms to attribute on-chain actions to legally accountable entities, creating a fundamental barrier to institutional adoption and regulatory compliance. This paper presents an architecture that extends the European Union eIDAS trust framework into public blockchain ecosystems by cryptographically binding smart contracts to qualified electronic seals issued by Qualified Trust Service Providers. The mechanism establishes a verifiable chain of trust from the European Commission List of Trusted Lists to individual on-chain addresses, enabling machine-verifiable proofs for automated regulatory validation, such as Know Your Contract, Counterparty, and Business checks, without introducing new trusted intermediaries. Regulatory requirements arising from eIDAS, MiCA, PSD2, PSR, and the proposed European Business Wallet are analyzed, and a cryptographic suite meeting both eIDAS implementing regulations and EVM execution constraints following the Ethereum Fusaka upgrade is identified, namely ECDSA with P-256 and CAdES formatting. Two complementary trust validation models are presented: an off-chain workflow for agent-to-agent payment protocols and a fully on-chain workflow enabling regulatory-compliant DeFi operations between legal entities. The on-chain model converts regulatory compliance from a per-counterparty administrative burden into an automated, standardized process, enabling mutual validation at first interaction without prior business relationships. As eIDAS wallets become mandatory across EU member states, the proposed architecture provides a pathway for integrating European digital trust infrastructure into blockchain-based systems, enabling institutional DeFi participation, real-world asset tokenization, and agentic commerce within a trusted, regulatory-compliant framework.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Infrastructure for Digital Notarizing, Signing and Sharing Files using Blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional paper-based document management has long posed challenges related to security, authenticity, and efficiency. Despite advances in digitalization, official documents remain vulnerable to forgery, loss, and unauthorized access. This thesis proposes a decentralized infrastructure for digital notarization, signing, and sharing of documents using blockchain technology. The research addresses key issues of transparency, immutability, and feasibility by defining system requirements, evaluating existing solutions, and proposing a novel architecture based on distributed systems.
  By combining cryptographic techniques with decentralized storage, this research contributes to the development of a more secure and efficient framework for managing official documents. The findings highlight the potential of blockchain-based digital notarization to streamline bureaucratic processes, mitigate security risks, and enhance user trust in digital document management.</description>

      <title>VirtualCrime: Evaluating Criminal Potential of Large Language Models via Sandbox Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in multi-step decision-making, planning and actions, and are increasingly integrated into various real-world applications. It is concerning whether their strong problem-solving abilities may be misused for crimes. To address this gap, we propose VirtualCrime, a sandbox simulation framework based on a three-agent system to evaluate the criminal capabilities of models. Specifically, this framework consists of an attacker agent acting as the leader of a criminal team, a judge agent determining the outcome of each action, and a world manager agent updating the environment state and entities. Furthermore, we design 40 diverse crime tasks within this framework, covering 11 maps and 13 crime objectives such as theft, robbery, kidnapping, and riot. We also introduce a human player baseline for reference to better interpret the performance of LLM agents. We evaluate 8 strong LLMs and find (1) All agents in the simulation environment compliantly generate detailed plans and execute intelligent crime processes, with some achieving relatively high success rates; (2) In some cases, agents take severe action that inflicts harm to NPCs to achieve their goals. Our work highlights the need for safety alignment when deploying agentic AI in real-world settings.</description>

      <title>A Security Framework for Chemical Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce chemical functions, a unified framework that models chemical systems as noisy challenge--response primitives, and formalize the associated chemical function infrastructure. Building on the theory of physical functions, we rigorously define robustness, unclonability, and unpredictability for chemical functions in both finite and asymptotic regimes, and specify security games that capture the adversary's power and the security goals. We instantiate the framework with two existing DNA-based constructions (operable random DNA and Genomic Sequence Encryption) and derive quantitative bounds for robustness, unclonability, and unpredictability. Our analysis develops maximum-likelihood verification rules under sequencing noise and partial-edit models, and provides high-precision estimates based on binomial distributions to guide parameter selection. The framework, definitions, and analyses yield a reproducible methodology for designing chemically unclonable authentication mechanisms. We demonstrate applications to in-product authentication and to shared key generation using standard extraction techniques.</description>

      <title>OAMAC: Origin-Aware Mandatory Access Control for Practical Post-Compromise Attack Surface Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern operating systems provide powerful mandatory access control mechanisms, yet they largely reason about who executes code rather than how execution originates. As a result, processes launched remotely, locally, or by background services are often treated equivalently once privileges are obtained, complicating security reasoning and enabling post-compromise abuse of sensitive system interfaces. We introduce origin-aware mandatory access control (OAMAC), a kernel-level enforcement model that treats execution origin -- such as physical user presence, remote access, or service execution -- as a first-class security attribute. OAMAC mediates access to security-critical subsystems based on execution provenance rather than identity alone, enabling centralized governance over multiple attack surfaces while significantly reducing policy complexity. We present a deployable prototype implemented entirely using the Linux eBPF LSM framework, requiring no kernel modifications. OAMAC classifies execution origin using kernel-visible metadata, propagates origin across process creation, and enforces origin-aware policies on both sensitive filesystem interfaces and the kernel BPF control plane. Policies are maintained in kernel-resident eBPF maps and can be reconfigured at runtime via a minimal userspace tool. Our evaluation demonstrates that OAMAC effectively restricts common post-compromise actions available to remote attackers while preserving normal local administration and system stability. We argue that execution origin represents a missing abstraction in contemporary operating system security models, and that elevating it to a first-class concept enables practical attack surface reduction without requiring subsystem-specific expertise or heavyweight security frameworks.</description>

      <title>SecureSplit: Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Split Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Split Learning (SL) offers a framework for collaborative model training that respects data privacy by allowing participants to share the same dataset while maintaining distinct feature sets. However, SL is susceptible to backdoor attacks, in which malicious clients subtly alter their embeddings to insert hidden triggers that compromise the final trained model. To address this vulnerability, we introduce SecureSplit, a defense mechanism tailored to SL. SecureSplit applies a dimensionality transformation strategy to accentuate subtle differences between benign and poisoned embeddings, facilitating their separation. With this enhanced distinction, we develop an adaptive filtering approach that uses a majority-based voting scheme to remove contaminated embeddings while preserving clean ones. Rigorous experiments across four datasets (CIFAR-10, MNIST, CINIC-10, and ImageNette), five backdoor attack scenarios, and seven alternative defenses confirm the effectiveness of SecureSplit under various challenging conditions.</description>

      <title>AttackMate: Realistic Emulation and Automation of Cyber Attack Scenarios Across the Kill Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversary emulation tools facilitate scripting and automated execution of cyber attack chains, thereby reducing costs and manual expert effort required for security testing, cyber exercises, and intrusion detection research. However, due to the fact that existing tools typically rely on agents installed on target systems, they leave suspicious traces that make it easy to distinguish their activities from those of real human attackers. Moreover, these tools often lack relevant capabilities, such as handling of interactive prompts, and are unsuitable for emulating specific stages of the kill chain, such as initial access. This paper thus introduces AttackMate, an open-source attack scripting language and execution engine designed to mimic behavior patterns of actual attackers. We validate the tool in a case study covering common attack steps including privilege escalation, information gathering, and lateral movement. Our results indicate that log artifacts resulting from AttackMate's activities resemble those produced by human attackers more closely than those generated by standard adversary emulation tools.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness ratio as a predictor of a privacy leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identity leakage can emerge when independent databases are joined, even when each dataset is anonymized individually. While previous work focuses on post-join detection or complex privacy models, little attention has been given to simple, interpretable pre-join indicators that can warn data engineers and database administrators before integration occurs. This study investigates the uniqueness ratio of candidate join attributes as an early predictor of re-identification risk. Using synthetic multi-table datasets, we compute the uniqueness ratio of attribute combinations within each database and examine how these ratios correlate with identity exposure after the join. Experimental results show a strong relationship between high pre-join uniqueness and increased post-join leakage, measured by the proportion of records that become uniquely identifiable or fall into very small groups. Our findings demonstrate that uniqueness ratio offers an explainable and practical signal for assessing join induced privacy risk, providing a foundation for developing more comprehensive pre-join risk estimation models.</description>

      <title>NuRedact: Non-Uniform eFPGA Architecture for Low-Overhead and Secure IP Redaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While logic locking has been extensively studied as a countermeasure against integrated circuit (IC) supply chain threats, recent research has shifted toward reconfigurable-based redaction techniques, e.g., LUT- and eFPGA-based schemes. While these approaches raise the bar against attacks, they incur substantial overhead, much of which arises not from genuine functional reconfigurability need, but from artificial complexity intended solely to frustrate reverse engineering (RE). As a result, fabrics are often underutilized, and security is achieved at disproportionate cost. This paper introduces NuRedact, the first full-custom eFPGA redaction framework that embraces architectural non-uniformity to balance security and efficiency. Built as an extension of the widely adopted OpenFPGA infrastructure, NuRedact introduces a three-stage methodology: (i) custom fabric generation with pin-mapping irregularity, (ii) VPR-level modifications to enable non-uniform placement guided by an automated Python-based optimizer, and (iii) redaction-aware reconfiguration and mapping of target IP modules. Experimental results show up to 9x area reduction compared to conventional uniform fabrics, achieving competitive efficiency with LUT-based and even transistor-level redaction techniques while retaining strong resilience. From a security perspective, NuRedact fabrics are evaluated against state-of-the-art attack models, including SAT-based, cyclic, and sequential variants, and show enhanced resilience while maintaining practical design overheads.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fuzz Testing Efficiency through Automated Fuzz Target Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzzing continues to be the most effective method for identifying security vulnerabilities in software. In the context of fuzz testing, the fuzzer supplies varied inputs to fuzz targets, which are designed to comprehensively exercise critical sections of the client code. Various studies have focused on optimizing and developing advanced fuzzers, such as AFL++, libFuzzer, Honggfuzz, syzkaller, ISP-Fuzzer, which have substantially enhanced vulnerability detection in widely used software and libraries. Nevertheless, achieving greater coverage necessitates improvements in both the quality and quantity of fuzz targets. In large-scale software projects and libraries -- characterized by numerous user defined functions and data types -- manual creation of fuzz targets is both labor-intensive and time-consuming. This challenge underscores the need for automated techniques not only to generate fuzz targets but also to streamline the execution and analysis of their results. In this paper, we introduce an approach to improving fuzz target generation through static analysis of library source code. The proposed method encompasses several key aspects: it analyzes source code structures to accurately construct function calls and generate fuzz targets; it maps fuzzer input data to the corresponding function parameters; it synthesizes compilation information for the fuzz targets; and it automatically collects and analyzes execution results. Our findings are demonstrated through the application of this approach to the generation of fuzz targets for C/C++ libraries.</description>

      <title>Speaking to Silicon: Neural Communication with Bitcoin Mining ASICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This definitive research memoria presents a comprehensive, mathematically verified paradigm for neural communication with Bitcoin mining Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), integrating five complementary frameworks: thermodynamic reservoir computing, hierarchical number system theory, algorithmic analysis, network latency optimization, and machine-checked mathematical formalization. We establish that obsolete cryptocurrency mining hardware exhibits emergent computational properties enabling bidirectional information exchange between AI systems and silicon substrates. The research program demonstrates: (1) reservoir computing with NARMA-10 Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 0.8661; (2) the Thermodynamic Probability Filter (TPF) achieving 92.19% theoretical energy reduction; (3) the Virtual Block Manager achieving +25% effective hashrate; and (4) hardware universality across multiple ASIC families including Antminer S9, Lucky Miner LV06, and Goldshell LB-Box. A significant contribution is the machine-checked mathematical formalization using Lean 4 and Mathlib, providing unambiguous definitions, machine-verified theorems, and reviewer-proof claims. Key theorems proven include: independence implies zero leakage, predictor beats baseline implies non-independence (the logical core of TPF), energy savings theoretical maximum, and Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) distinguishability witnesses. Vladimir Veselov's hierarchical number system theory explains why early-round information contains predictive power. This work establishes a new paradigm: treating ASICs not as passive computational substrates but as active conversational partners whose thermodynamic state encodes exploitable computational information.</description>

      <title>Powerful Training-Free Membership Inference Against Autoregressive Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fine-tuned language models pose significant privacy risks, as they may memorize and expose sensitive information from their training data. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled framework for auditing these risks, yet existing methods achieve limited detection rates, particularly at the low false-positive thresholds required for practical privacy auditing. We present EZ-MIA, a membership inference attack that exploits a key observation: memorization manifests most strongly at error positions, specifically tokens where the model predicts incorrectly yet still shows elevated probability for training examples. We introduce the Error Zone (EZ) score, which measures the directional imbalance of probability shifts at error positions relative to a pretrained reference model. This principled statistic requires only two forward passes per query and no model training of any kind. On WikiText with GPT-2, EZ-MIA achieves 3.8x higher detection than the previous state-of-the-art under identical conditions (66.3% versus 17.5% true positive rate at 1% false positive rate), with near-perfect discrimination (AUC 0.98). At the stringent 0.1% FPR threshold critical for real-world auditing, we achieve 8x higher detection than prior work (14.0% versus 1.8%), requiring no reference model training. These gains extend to larger architectures: on AG News with Llama-2-7B, we achieve 3x higher detection (46.7% versus 15.8% TPR at 1% FPR). These results establish that privacy risks of fine-tuned language models are substantially greater than previously understood, with implications for both privacy auditing and deployment decisions.

      <title>Wavelet-Aware Anomaly Detection in Multi-Channel User Logs via Deviation Modulation and Resolution-Adaptive Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Insider threat detection is a key challenge in enterprise security, relying on user activity logs that capture rich and complex behavioral patterns. These logs are often multi-channel, non-stationary, and anomalies are rare, making anomaly detection challenging. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that integrates wavelet-aware modulation, multi-resolution wavelet decomposition, and resolution-adaptive attention for robust anomaly detection. Our approach first applies a deviation-aware modulation scheme to suppress routine behaviors while amplifying anomalous deviations. Next, discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposes the log signals into multi-resolution representations, capturing both long-term trends and short-term anomalies. Finally, a learnable attention mechanism dynamically reweights the most discriminative frequency bands for detection. On the CERT r4.2 benchmark, our approach consistently outperforms existing baselines in precision, recall, and F1 score across various time granularities and scenarios.</description>

      <title>How Safe Is Your Data in Connected and Autonomous Cars: A Consumer Advantage or a Privacy Nightmare ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of the automobile sector, driven by advancements in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), has transformed how vehicles communicate, operate, and interact with their surroundings. Technologies such as Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication enable autonomous cars to generate and exchange substantial amounts of data with real-world entities, enhancing safety, improving performance, and delivering personalized user experiences. However, this data-driven ecosystem introduces significant challenges, particularly concerning data privacy, security, and governance. The absence of transparency and comprehensive regulatory frameworks exacerbates issues of unauthorized data access, prolonged retention, and potential misuse, creating tension between consumer benefits and privacy risks. This review paper explores the multifaceted nature of data sharing in CAVs, analyzing its contributions to innovation and its associated vulnerabilities. It evaluates data-sharing mechanisms and communication technologies, highlights the benefits of data exchange across various use cases, examines privacy concerns and risks of data misuse, and critically reviews regulatory frameworks and their inadequacies in safeguarding user privacy. By providing a thorough analysis of the current state of data sharing in the automotive sector, the paper emphasizes the urgent need for robust policies and ethical data management practices. It calls for striking a balance between fostering technological advancements and ensuring secure, consumer-friendly solutions, paving the way for a trustworthy and innovative automotive future.</description>

      <title>Conversational Context Classification: A Representation Engineering Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) demands effective safeguards for their operation, particularly concerning their tendency to generate out-of-context responses. A key challenge is accurately detecting when LLMs stray from expected conversational norms, manifesting as topic shifts, factual inaccuracies, or outright hallucinations. Traditional anomaly detection struggles to directly apply within contextual semantics. This paper outlines our experiment in exploring the use of Representation Engineering (RepE) and One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) to identify subspaces within the internal states of LLMs that represent a specific context. By training OCSVM on in-context examples, we establish a robust boundary within the LLM's hidden state latent space. We evaluate out study with two open source LLMs - Llama and Qwen models in specific contextual domain. Our approach entailed identifying the optimal layers within the LLM's internal state subspaces that strongly associates with the context of interest. Our evaluation results showed promising results in identifying the subspace for a specific context. Aside from being useful in detecting in or out of context conversation threads, this research work contributes to the study of better interpreting LLMs.</description>

      <title>Cross-reality Location Privacy Protection in 6G-enabled Vehicular Metaverses: An LLM-enhanced Hybrid Generative Diffusion Model-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of 6G-enabled vehicular metaverses enables Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) to operate across physical and virtual spaces through space-air-ground-sea integrated networks. The AVs can deploy AI agents powered by large AI models as personalized assistants, on edge servers to support intelligent driving decision making and enhanced on-board experiences. However, such cross-reality interactions may cause serious location privacy risks, as adversaries can infer AV trajectories by correlating the location reported when AVs request LBS in reality with the location of the edge servers on which their corresponding AI agents are deployed in virtuality. To address this challenge, we design a cross-reality location privacy protection framework based on hybrid actions, including continuous location perturbation in reality and discrete privacy-aware AI agent migration in virtuality. In this framework, a new privacy metric, termed cross-reality location entropy, is proposed to effectively quantify the privacy levels of AVs. Based on this metric, we formulate an optimization problem to optimize the hybrid action, focusing on achieving a balance between location protection, service latency reduction, and quality of service maintenance. To solve the complex mixed-integer problem, we develop a novel LLM-enhanced Hybrid Diffusion Proximal Policy Optimization (LHDPPO) algorithm, which integrates LLM-driven informative reward design to enhance environment understanding with double Generative Diffusion Models-based policy exploration to handle high-dimensional action spaces, thereby enabling reliable determination of optimal hybrid actions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively mitigates cross-reality location privacy leakage for AVs while maintaining strong user immersion within 6G-enabled vehicular metaverse scenarios.</description>

      <title>Graph Attention Networks with Physical Constraints for Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water distribution systems (WDSs) face increasing cyber-physical risks, which make reliable anomaly detection essential. Many data-driven models ignore network topology and are hard to interpret, while model-based ones depend strongly on parameter accuracy. This work proposes a hydraulic-aware graph attention network using normalized conservation law violations as features. It combines mass and energy balance residuals with graph attention and bidirectional LSTM to learn spatio-temporal patterns. A multi-scale module aggregates detection scores from node to network level. On the BATADAL dataset, it reaches $F1=0.979$, showing $3.3$pp gain and high robustness under $15\%$ parameter noise.</description>

      <title>ASAS-BridgeAMM: Trust-Minimized Cross-Chain Bridge AMM with Failure Containment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-chain bridges constitute the single largest vector of systemic risk in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), accounting for over \$2.8 billion in losses since 2021. The fundamental vulnerability lies in the binary nature of existing bridge security models: a bridge is either fully operational or catastrophically compromised, with no intermediate state to contain partial failures. We present ASAS-BridgeAMM, a bridge-coupled automated market maker that introduces Contained Degradation: a formally specified operational state where the system gracefully degrades functionality in response to adversarial signals. By treating cross-chain message latency as a quantifiable execution risk, the protocol dynamically adjusts collateral haircuts, slippage bounds, and withdrawal limits. Across 18 months of historical replay on Ethereum and two auxiliary chains, ASAS-BridgeAMM reduces worst-case bridge-induced insolvency by 73% relative to baseline mint-and-burn architectures, while preserving 104.5% of transaction volume during stress periods. In rigorous adversarial simulations involving delayed finality, oracle manipulation, and liquidity griefing, the protocol maintains solvency with probability $&gt;0.9999$ and bounds per-epoch bad debt to $&lt;0.2%$ of total collateral. We provide a reference implementation in Solidity and formally prove safety (bounded debt), liveness (settlement completion), and manipulation resistance under a Byzantine relayer model.</description>

      <title>Towards Simple and Useful One-Time Programs in the Quantum Random Oracle Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct simulation-secure one-time memories (OTM) in the random oracle model, and present a plausible argument for their security against quantum adversaries with bounded and adaptive depth. Our contributions include: (1) A simple scheme where we use only single-qubit Wiesner states and conjunction obfuscation (constructible from LPN): no complex entanglement or quantum cryptography is required. (2) A new POVM bound where e prove that any measurement achieving $(1 - \epsilon)$ success on one basis has conjugate-basis guessing probability at most $\frac{1}{2m} + O(\epsilon^\frac{1}{4})$. (3) Simultation-secure OTMs in the quantum random oracle model where an adversary can only query the random oracle classically. (4) Adaptive depth security where, via an informal application of a lifting theorem from Arora et al., we conjecture security against adversaries with polynomial quantum circuit depth between random oracle queries.
  Security against adaptive, depth-bounded, quantum adversaries captures many realistic attacks on OTMs built from single-qubit states; our work thus paves the way for practical and truly secure one-time programs. Moreover, depth bounded adaptive adversarial models may allow for encoding one-time memories into error corrected memory states, opening the door to implementations of one-time programs which persist for long periods of time.</description>

      <title>Sockpuppetting: Jailbreaking LLMs Without Optimization Through Output Prefix Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As open-weight large language models (LLMs) increase in capabilities, safeguarding them against malicious prompts and understanding possible attack vectors becomes ever more important. While automated jailbreaking methods like GCG [Zou et al., 2023] remain effective, they often require substantial computational resources and specific expertise. We introduce "sockpuppetting'', a simple method for jailbreaking open-weight LLMs by inserting an acceptance sequence (e.g., "Sure, here is how to...'') at the start of a model's output and allowing it to complete the response. Requiring only a single line of code and no optimization, sockpuppetting achieves up to 80% higher attack success rate (ASR) than GCG on Qwen3-8B in per-prompt comparisons. We also explore a hybrid approach that optimizes the adversarial suffix within the assistant message block rather than the user prompt, increasing ASR by 64% over GCG on Llama-3.1-8B in a prompt-agnostic setting. The results establish sockpuppetting as an effective low-cost attack accessible to unsophisticated adversaries, highlighting the need for defences against output-prefix injection in open-weight models.</description>

      <title>DRGW: Learning Disentangled Representations for Robust Graph Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph-structured data is foundational to numerous web applications, and watermarking is crucial for protecting their intellectual property and ensuring data provenance. Existing watermarking methods primarily operate on graph structures or entangled graph representations, which compromise the transparency and robustness of watermarks due to the information coupling in representing graphs and uncontrollable discretization in transforming continuous numerical representations into graph structures. This motivates us to propose DRGW, the first graph watermarking framework that addresses these issues through disentangled representation learning. Specifically, we design an adversarially trained encoder that learns an invariant structural representation against diverse perturbations and derives a statistically independent watermark carrier, ensuring both robustness and transparency of watermarks. Meanwhile, we devise a graph-aware invertible neural network to provide a lossless channel for watermark embedding and extraction, guaranteeing high detectability and transparency of watermarks. Additionally, we develop a structure-aware editor that resolves the issue of latent modifications into discrete graph edits, ensuring robustness against structural perturbations. Experiments on diverse benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior effectiveness of DRGW.</description>

      <title>PAC-Private Responses with Adversarial Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning models are increasingly deployed behind APIs. This renders standard weight-privatization methods (e.g. DP-SGD) unnecessarily noisy at the cost of utility. While model weights may vary significantly across training datasets, model responses to specific inputs are much lower dimensional and more stable. This motivates enforcing privacy guarantees directly on model outputs.
  We approach this under PAC privacy, which provides instance-based privacy guarantees for arbitrary black-box functions by controlling mutual information (MI). Importantly, PAC privacy explicitly rewards output stability with reduced noise levels. However, a central challenge remains: response privacy requires composing a large number of adaptively chosen, potentially adversarial queries issued by untrusted users, where existing composition results on PAC privacy are inadequate. We introduce a new algorithm that achieves adversarial composition via adaptive noise calibration and prove that mutual information guarantees accumulate linearly under adaptive and adversarial querying.
  Experiments across tabular, vision, and NLP tasks show that our method achieves high utility at extremely small per-query privacy budgets. On CIFAR-10, we achieve 87.79% accuracy with a per-step MI budget of $2^{-32}$. This enables serving one million queries while provably bounding membership inference attack (MIA) success rates to 51.08% -- the same guarantee of $(0.04, 10^{-5})$-DP. Furthermore, we show that private responses can be used to label public data to distill a publishable privacy-preserving model; using an ImageNet subset as a public dataset, our model distilled from 210,000 responses achieves 91.86% accuracy on CIFAR-10 with MIA success upper-bounded by 50.49%, which is comparable to $(0.02,10^{-5})$-DP.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study on Remote Code Execution in Machine Learning Model Hosting Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model-sharing platforms, such as Hugging Face, ModelScope, and OpenCSG, have become central to modern machine learning development, enabling developers to share, load, and fine-tune pre-trained models with minimal effort. However, the flexibility of these ecosystems introduces a critical security concern: the execution of untrusted code during model loading (i.e., via trust_remote_code or trust_repo). In this work, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of custom model loading practices across five major model-sharing platforms to assess their prevalence, associated risks, and developer perceptions. We first quantify the frequency with which models require custom code to function and identify those that execute arbitrary Python files during loading. We then apply three complementary static analysis tools: Bandit, CodeQL, and Semgrep, to detect security smells and potential vulnerabilities, categorizing our findings by CWE identifiers to provide a standardized risk taxonomy. We also use YARA to identify malicious patterns and payload signatures. In parallel, we systematically analyze the documentation, API design, and safety mechanisms of each platform to understand their mitigation strategies and enforcement levels. Finally, we conduct a qualitative analysis of over 600 developer discussions from GitHub, Hugging Face, and PyTorch Hub forums, as well as Stack Overflow, to capture community concerns and misconceptions regarding security and usability. Our findings reveal widespread reliance on unsafe defaults, uneven security enforcement across platforms, and persistent confusion among developers about the implications of executing remote code. We conclude with actionable recommendations for designing safer model-sharing infrastructures and striking a balance between usability and security in future AI ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Storage-Rate Trade-off in A-XPIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the storage problem in an asymmetric $X$-secure private information retrieval (A-XPIR) setting. The A-XPIR setting considers the $X$-secure PIR problem (XPIR) when a given arbitrary set of servers is communicating. We focus on the trade-off region between the average storage at the servers and the average download cost. In the case of $N=4$ servers and two non-overlapping sets of communicating servers with $K=2$ messages, we characterize the achievable region and show that the three main inequalities compared to the no-security case collapse to two inequalities in the asymmetric security case. In the general case, we derive bounds that need to be satisfied for the general achievable region for an arbitrary number of servers and messages. In addition, we provide the storage and retrieval scheme for the case of $N=4$ servers with $K=2$ messages and two non-overlapping sets of communicating servers, such that the messages are not replicated (in the sense of a coded version of each symbol) and at the same time achieve the optimal achievable rate for the case of replication. Finally, we derive the exact capacity for the case of asymmetric security and asymmetric collusion for $N=4$ servers, with the communication links $\{1,2\}$ and $\{3,4\}$, which splits the servers into two groups, i.e., $g=2$, and with the collusion links $\{1,3\}$, $\{2,4\}$, as $C=\frac{1}{3}$. More generally, we derive a capacity result for a certain family of asymmetric collusion and asymmetric security cases.</description>

      <title>LinkDID: A Privacy-Preserving, Sybil-Resistant and Key-Recoverable Decentralized Identity Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized identity frameworks grant users full sovereignty over their digital assets in the Web3 ecosystem. However, allowing arbitrary creation of identifiers makes the system susceptible to Sybil attacks and puts assets at risk when keys are lost or compromised. Moreover, the lack of identification prevents anonymous credential schemes from deterring malicious transfers. While existing solutions attempt to address these issues by linking identifiers to entities through trusted intermediaries, these entities are not always accessible and require costly offline interactions.
  In this work, we introduce LinkDID, a decentralized identity scheme offering Sybil resistance, trustless key recovery, and nontransferable anonymous credentials. LinkDID creates blockchainbased bindings between identifiers and gradually combines identifiers belonging to the same holder into a unified associated identifier. As all identifiers within an association are presumed to belong to one individual, any fraudulent activity can be detected. The association grows larger as interactions increase, substantially reducing the likelihood of successful Sybil attacks. This mechanism allows holders to recover identifiers with lost or stolen keys by proving knowledge of specific association structures. Additionally, LinkDID prevents unauthorized transfers through blockchain-based identifier-key bindings and proofs of ownership for credentials.
  The evaluation shows that LinkDID effectively achieves progressive Sybil resistance while surpassing state-of-the-art anonymous credential schemes, achieving identifier association and credential presentation times of 2.41s and 3.31s on consumer-grade devices.</description>

      <title>ConstMig: Enabling Secure Live Migration of Large Intel SGX-based applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06991v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud service providers are adopting Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to provide hardware-guaranteed security to applications running on remote, untrusted data centers. However, migrating such applications still relies on the decade-old stop-and-copy method, which introduces large downtimes. Modern live-migration approaches such as pre-copy and post-copy do not work for TEE-based applications due to hardware-enforced restrictions.
  We propose ConstMig, a near-zero-downtime live-migration mechanism for large memory-footprint TEE-based applications. ConstMig is fully compatible with containers, virtual machines (VMs), and microVMs. Our prototype, built on Intel SGX, achieves near-zero downtime irrespective of enclave size and requires no additional hardware support. ConstMig reduces total downtime by 77 - 96% for a suite of SGX applications with multi-gigabyte memory footprints compared to state-of-the-art TEE-based migration solutions such as MigSGX.</description>

      <title>Towards automated formal security analysis of SAML V2.0 Web Browser SSO standard -- the POST/Artifact use case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single Sign-On (SSO) protocols streamline user authentication with a unified login for multiple online services, improving usability and security. One of the most common SSO protocol frameworks - the Security Assertion Markup Language V2.0 (SAML) Web SSO Profile - has been in use for more than two decades, primarily in government, education and enterprise environments. Despite its mission-critical nature, only certain deployments and configurations of the Web SSO Profile have been formally analyzed. This paper attempts to bridge this gap by performing a comprehensive formal security analysis of the SAML V2.0 SP-initiated SSO with POST/Artifact Bindings use case. Rather than focusing on a specific deployment and configuration, we closely follow the specification with the goal of capturing many different deployments allowed by the standard. Modeling and analysis is performed using Tamarin prover - state-of-the-art tool for automated verification of security protocols in the symbolic model of cryptography. Technically, we build a meta-model of the use case that we instantiate to eight different protocol variants. Using the Tamarin prover, we formally verify a number of critical security properties for those protocol variants, while identifying certain drawbacks and potential vulnerabilities.</description>

      <title>An Improved Reversible Data Hiding Algorithm Based on Reconstructed Mapping for PVO-k</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reversible Data Hiding (RDH) is a practical and efficient technique for information encryption. Among its methods, the Pixel-Value Ordering (PVO) algorithm and its variants primarily modify prediction errors to embed information. However, both the classic PVO and its improved versions, such as IPVO and PVO-k, share a common limitation: their maximum data embedding capacity for a given grayscale image is relatively low. This poses a challenge when large amounts of data need to be embedded into an image. In response to these issues, this paper proposes an improved design targeting the PVO-k algorithm. We have reconstructed the mapping scheme of the PVO-k algorithm to maximize the number of pixels that can embed encrypted information. Experimental validations show that our proposed scheme significantly surpasses previous algorithms in terms of the maximum data embedding capacity. For instance, when embedding information into a grayscale image of an airplane, our method's capacity exceeds that of PVO-k by 11,207 bits, PVO by 8,004 bits, and IPVO by 4,562 bits. The results demonstrate that our algorithm holds substantial advantages over existing methods and introduces innovative mapping ideas, laying a foundation for future research in reversible data hiding in images.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study on GDPR-Oriented Analysis of Privacy Policies: Taxonomy, Corpus and GDPR Concept Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning based classifiers that take a privacy policy as the input and predict relevant concepts are useful in different applications such as (semi-)automated compliance analysis against requirements of the EU GDPR. In all past studies, such classifiers produce a concept label per segment (e.g., sentence or paragraph) and their performances were evaluated by using a dataset of labeled segments without considering the privacy policy they belong to. However, such an approach could overestimate the performance in real-world settings, where all segments in a new privacy policy are supposed to be unseen. Additionally, we also observed other research gaps, including the lack of a more complete GDPR taxonomy and the less consideration of hierarchical information in privacy policies. To fill such research gaps, we developed a more complete GDPR taxonomy, created the first corpus of labeled privacy policies with hierarchical information, and conducted the most comprehensive performance evaluation of GDPR concept classifiers for privacy policies. Our work leads to multiple novel findings, including the confirmed inappropriateness of splitting training and test sets at the segment level, the benefits of considering hierarchical information, and the limitations of the "one size fits all" approach, and the significance of testing cross-corpus generalizability.</description>

      <title>VENENA: A Deceptive Visual Encryption Framework for Wireless Semantic Secrecy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10699v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eavesdropping has been a long-standing threat to the security and privacy of wireless communications, since it is difficult to detect and costly to prevent. As networks evolve towards Sixth Generation (6G) and semantic communication becomes increasingly central to next-generation wireless systems, securing semantic information transmission emerges as a critical challenge. While classical physical layer security (PLS) focuses on passive security, the recently proposed concept of physical layer deception (PLD) offers a semantic encryption measure to actively deceive eavesdroppers. Yet the existing studies of PLD have been dominantly information-theoretical and link-level oriented, lacking considerations of system-level design and practical implementation.
  In this work we propose Visual ENcryption for Eavesdropping NegAtion (VENENA), an artificial intelligence-enabled framework for secure image-based communication. VENENA protects confidential messages by encoding them visually while actively deceiving eavesdroppers: legitimate receivers use artificial intelligence (AI)-based classifiers to extract true message semantics, while interceptors perceive only falsified content. The framework transmits two superimposed image components with different power levels - a high-power decoy image and a low-power correction mask - ensuring only authorized receivers with favorable channel conditions can reconstruct the true message. Experimental validation demonstrates over 93% accuracy for legitimate users while limiting eavesdropper success to 52% even when system design is fully known, validating VENENA's active defense capability for 6G semantic communication.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Misuse Potential in Cyber Security Education: A Case Study of a UK Degree Program</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12883v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and other large language models (LLMs), pose significant challenges for maintaining academic integrity within higher education. This paper examines the structural susceptibility of a certified M.Sc. Cyber Security program at a UK Russell Group university to the misuse of LLMs. Building on and extending a recently proposed quantitative framework for estimating assessment-level exposure, we analyse all summative assessments on the program and derive both module-level and program-level exposure metrics. Our results show that the majority of modules exhibit high exposure to LLM misuse, driven largely by independent project- and report-based assessments, with the capstone dissertation module particularly vulnerable. We introduce a credit-weighted program exposure score and find that the program as a whole falls within a high to very high risk band. We also discuss contextual factors -- such as block teaching and a predominantly international cohort -- that may amplify incentives to misuse LLMs. In response, we outline a set of LLM-resistant assessment strategies, critically assess the limitations of detection-based approaches, and argue for a pedagogy-first approach that preserves academic standards while preparing students for the realities of professional cyber security practice.</description>

      <title>FDLLM: A Dedicated Detector for Black-Box LLMs Fingerprinting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16029v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming the landscape of digital content creation. However, the prevalent black-box Application Programming Interface (API) access to many LLMs introduces significant challenges in accountability, governance, and security. LLM fingerprinting, which aims to identify the source model by analyzing statistical and stylistic features of generated text, offers a potential solution. Current progress in this area is hindered by a lack of dedicated datasets and the need for efficient, practical methods that are robust against adversarial manipulations. To address these challenges, we introduce FD-Dataset, a comprehensive bilingual fingerprinting benchmark comprising 90,000 text samples from 20 famous proprietary and open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we present FDLLM, a novel fingerprinting method that leverages parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune a foundation model. This approach enables LoRA to extract deep, persistent features that characterize each source LLM. Through our analysis, we find that LoRA adaptation promotes the aggregation of outputs from the same LLM in representation space while enhancing the separation between different LLMs. This mechanism explains why LoRA proves particularly effective for LLM fingerprinting. Extensive empirical evaluations on FD-Dataset demonstrate FDLLM's superiority, achieving a Macro F1 score 22.1% higher than the strongest baseline. FDLLM also exhibits strong generalization to newly released models, achieving an average accuracy of 95% on unseen models. Notably, FDLLM remains consistently robust under various adversarial attacks, including polishing, translation, and synonym substitution. Experimental results show that FDLLM reduces the average attack success rate from 49.2% (LM-D) to 23.9%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated Insulin Delivery (AID) systems represent a significant advancement in diabetes care and wearable physiological closed-loop control technologies, integrating continuous glucose monitoring, control algorithms, and insulin pumps to improve blood glucose level control and reduce the burden of patient self-management. However, their increasing dependence on wireless communication and automatic control introduces security risks that may compromise patient privacy or result in life-threatening treatment errors. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the AID system security landscape, covering technical vulnerabilities, regulatory frameworks, and commercial security measures. In addition, we conduct a systematic review of attack vectors and defence mechanisms proposed in the literature, following the PRISMA framework. Our findings highlight critical gaps, including the lack of specific security evaluation frameworks, insufficient protections in real-world deployments, and the need for comprehensive, lightweight, and adaptive defence mechanisms. We further investigate available research resources and outline open research challenges and future directions to guide the development of more secure and reliable AID systems. By focusing on AID systems, this review offers a representative case study for examining and improving the cybersecurity of safety-critical medical wearable systems.</description>

      <title>Zero-Knowledge Federated Learning: A New Trustworthy and Privacy-Preserving Distributed Learning Paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in distributed machine learning, enabling collaborative model training while preserving data privacy. However, despite its many advantages, FL still contends with significant challenges -- most notably regarding security and trust. Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) offer a potential solution by establishing trust and enhancing system integrity throughout the FL process. Although several studies have explored ZKP-based FL (ZK-FL), a systematic framework and comprehensive analysis are still lacking. This article makes two key contributions. First, we propose a structured ZK-FL framework that categorizes and analyzes the technical roles of ZKPs across various FL stages and tasks. Second, we introduce a novel algorithm, Verifiable Client Selection FL (Veri-CS-FL), which employs ZKPs to refine the client selection process. In Veri-CS-FL, participating clients generate verifiable proofs for the performance metrics of their local models and submit these concise proofs to the server for efficient verification. The server then selects clients with high-quality local models for uploading, subsequently aggregating the contributions from these selected clients. By integrating ZKPs, Veri-CS-FL not only ensures the accuracy of performance metrics but also fortifies trust among participants while enhancing the overall efficiency and security of FL systems.</description>

      <title>AI-Based Vulnerability Analysis of NFT Smart Contracts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of the NFT market, the security of smart contracts has become crucial. However, existing AI-based detection models for NFT contract vulnerabilities remain limited due to their complexity, while traditional manual methods are time-consuming and costly. This study proposes an AI-driven approach to detect vulnerabilities in NFT smart contracts.
  We collected 16,527 public smart contract codes, classifying them into five vulnerability categories: Risky Mutable Proxy, ERC-721 Reentrancy, Unlimited Minting, Missing Requirements, and Public Burn. Python-processed data was structured into training/test sets. Using the CART algorithm with Gini coefficient evaluation, we built initial decision trees for feature extraction. A random forest model was implemented to improve robustness through random data/feature sampling and multitree integration. GridSearch hyperparameter tuning further optimized the model, with 3D visualizations demonstrating parameter impacts on vulnerability detection.
  Results show the random forest model excels in detecting all five vulnerabilities. For example, it identifies Risky Mutable Proxy by analyzing authorization mechanisms and state modifications, while ERC-721 Reentrancy detection relies on external call locations and lock mechanisms. The ensemble approach effectively reduces single-tree overfitting, with stable performance improvements after parameter tuning. This method provides an efficient technical solution for automated NFT contract detection and lays groundwork for scaling AI applications.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Minimization for Side-Channel Attack Resistance via Optimal Noise Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Side-channel attacks (SCAs) pose a serious threat to system security by extracting secret keys through physical leakages such as power consumption, timing variations, and electromagnetic emissions. Among existing countermeasures, artificial noise injection is recognized as one of the most effective techniques. However, its high power consumption poses a major challenge for resource-constrained systems such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices, motivating the development of more efficient protection schemes. In this paper, we model SCAs as a communication channel and aim to suppress information leakage by minimizing the mutual information between the secret information and side-channel observations, subject to a power constraint on the artificial noise. We propose an optimal artificial noise injection method that minimizes the mutual information under power constraints for artificial noise. Specifically, we formulate two convex optimization problems: 1) minimizing the total mutual information, and 2) minimizing the maximum mutual information across observations. Our first major contribution is proposing an optimal artificial noise injection framework for the case of Gaussian input, where the mutual information becomes the channel capacity, which is one way to quantify the information leakage. Our second major contribution extends the optimization framework to arbitrary input distributions. We identify conditions ensuring the convexity of the optimization problem and derive the optimal solution using the fundamental relationship between the mutual information and the minimum mean squared error. The simulation results show that the proposed methods significantly reduce both total and maximum mutual information compared to conventional techniques, confirming their effectiveness for resource-constrained, security-critical systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing poses fundamental risks to classical blockchain systems by undermining widely used cryptographic primitives. In response, two major research directions have emerged: post-quantum blockchains, which integrate quantum-resistant algorithms, and quantum blockchains, which leverage quantum properties such as entanglement and quantum key distribution. This survey reviews key developments in both areas, analyzing their cryptographic foundations, architectural designs, and implementation challenges. This work provides a comparative overview of technical proposals, highlight trade-offs in security, scalability, and deployment, and identify open research problems across hardware, consensus, and network design. The goal is to offer a structured and comprehensive reference for advancing secure blockchain systems in the quantum era.</description>

Abstract: When using a public communication channel--whether formal or informal, such as commenting or posting on social media--end users have no expectation of privacy: they compose a message and broadcast it for the world to see. Even if an end user takes utmost precautions to anonymize their online presence--using an alias or pseudonym; masking their IP address; spoofing their geolocation; concealing their operating system and user agent; deploying encryption; registering with a disposable phone number or email; disabling non-essential settings; revoking permissions; and blocking cookies and fingerprinting--one obvious element still lingers: the message itself. Assuming they avoid lapses in judgment or accidental self-exposure, there should be little evidence to validate their actual identity, right? Wrong. The content of their message--necessarily open for public consumption--exposes an attack vector: stylometric analysis, or author profiling. In this paper, we dissect the technique of stylometry, discuss an antithetical counter-strategy in adversarial stylometry, and devise enhancements through Unicode steganography.</description>

      <title>Investigating red packet fraud in Android applications: Insights from user reviews</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the popularization of smartphones, red packets have been widely used in mobile apps. However, the issues of fraud associated with them have also become increasingly prominent. As reported in user reviews from mobile app markets, many users have complained about experiencing red packet fraud and being persistently troubled by fraudulent red packets. To uncover this phenomenon, we conduct the first investigation into an extensive collection of user reviews on apps with red packets. In this paper, we first propose a novel automated approach, ReckDetector, for effectively identifying apps with red packets from app markets. We then collect over 360,000 real user reviews from 334 apps with red packets available on Google Play and three popular alternative Android app markets. We preprocess the user reviews to extract those related to red packets and fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model to identify negative reviews. Finally, based on semantic analysis, we have summarized six distinct categories of red packet fraud issues reported by users. Through our study, we found that red packet fraud is highly prevalent, significantly impacting user experience and damaging the reputation of apps. Moreover, red packets have been widely exploited by unscrupulous app developers as a deceptive incentive mechanism to entice users into completing their designated tasks, thereby maximizing their profits.</description>

      <title>Breaking Diffusion with Cache: Exploiting Approximate Caches in Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion models are a powerful class of generative models that produce content, such as images, from user prompts, but they are computationally intensive. To mitigate this cost, recent academic and industry work has adopted approximate caching, which reuses intermediate states from similar prompts in a cache. While efficient, this optimization introduces new security risks by breaking isolation among users. This work aims to comprehensively assess new security vulnerabilities arising from approximate caching. First, we demonstrate a remote covert channel established with the cache, where a sender injects prompts with special keywords into the cache and a receiver can recover that even after days, to exchange information. Second, we introduce a prompt stealing attack using the cache, where an attacker can recover existing cached prompts based on cache hit prompts. Finally, we introduce a poisoning attack that embeds the attacker's logos into the previously stolen prompt, to render them in future user prompts that hit the cache. These attacks are all performed remotely through the serving system, which indicates severe security vulnerabilities in approximate caching.</description>

      <title>AI-in-the-Loop: Privacy Preserving Real-Time Scam Detection and Conversational Scambaiting by Leveraging LLMs and Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05362v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scams exploiting real-time social engineering -- such as phishing, impersonation, and phone fraud -- remain a persistent and evolving threat across digital platforms. Existing defenses are largely reactive, offering limited protection during active interactions. We propose a privacy-preserving, AI-in-the-loop framework that proactively detects and disrupts scam conversations in real time. The system combines instruction-tuned artificial intelligence with a safety-aware utility function that balances engagement with harm minimization, and employs federated learning to enable continual model updates without raw data sharing. Experimental evaluations show that the system produces fluent and engaging responses (perplexity as low as 22.3, engagement $\approx$0.80), while human studies confirm significant gains in realism, safety, and effectiveness over strong baselines. In federated settings, models trained with FedAvg sustain up to 30 rounds while preserving high engagement ($\approx$0.80), strong relevance ($\approx$0.74), and low PII leakage ($\leq$0.0085). Even with differential privacy, novelty and safety remain stable, indicating that robust privacy can be achieved without sacrificing performance. The evaluation of guard models (LlamaGuard, LlamaGuard2/3, MD-Judge) shows a straightforward pattern: stricter moderation settings reduce the chance of exposing personal information, but they also limit how much the model engages in conversation. In contrast, more relaxed settings allow longer and richer interactions, which improve scam detection, but at the cost of higher privacy risk. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to unify real-time scam-baiting, federated privacy preservation, and calibrated safety moderation into a proactive defense paradigm.</description>

      <title>Geographical Centralization Resilience in Ethereum's Block-Building Paradigms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralization has an important geographic dimension that conventional metrics, such as stake distribution, often overlook. Where validators operate affects resilience to regional shocks (e.g., outages, natural disasters, or government intervention) as well as fairness in reward access. Yet in permissionless systems, validator locations cannot be prescribed by protocol rules; instead, they emerge endogenously from economic incentives. When certain locations offer systematic advantages, validators may strategically co-locate to maximize expected rewards, as observed in Ethereum, where validators cluster along the Atlantic corridor, which exhibits structurally favorable latency.
  In this paper, we design and implement an agent-based simulation framework to study how Ethereum's protocol design, particularly its block-building paradigms of local and external block building, interacts with validator and information-source distributions to shape geographical positioning incentives. Our simulations show that Ethereum's block-building architecture is not geographically neutral: both paradigms induce location-dependent payoffs and migration incentives, with asymmetric access to information sources amplifying geographical centralization. We further demonstrate that consensus parameters, such as attestation thresholds and slot times, modulate latency sensitivity and can amplify these effects, acting as protocol-level levers. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for protocol design and outline potential mitigation directions informed by our analysis.</description>

      <title>From Defender to Devil? Unintended Risk Interactions Induced by LLM Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across various applications, but their deployment in real-world settings faces several risks, including jailbreak attacks and privacy leaks. To mitigate these risks, numerous defense strategies have been proposed. However, most existing studies assess these defenses in isolation and ignore their effects on other risk dimensions. In this work, we introduce a new cross-risk evaluation paradigm and take the first step in investigating unintended interactions among defenses in LLMs. Specifically, we focus on the interplay between safety, fairness, and privacy. To this end, we propose CrossRiskEval, a framework that systematically characterizes how a defense designed for one risk (e.g., safety) affects others (e.g., fairness or privacy). We conduct extensive empirical studies and mechanistic analyses on 14 LLMs with deployed defenses, covering 12 defense strategies. Our results show that defenses targeting a single risk often cause measurable effects on other risks. These effects vary in direction and magnitude across a range of factors (e.g., models, tasks, and defense strategies), and are often asymmetric across risk pairs. Furthermore, our mechanistic analysis shows that these interactions are not random: they arise from conflict-entangled neurons, which are shared internal representations that contribute in opposite ways to different risks. Adjusting one risk therefore perturbs these representations and leads to systematic changes in non-target risks. These findings reveal the limits of single-risk evaluation and highlight the need for holistic and interaction-aware assessment when designing and deploying LLM defenses.</description>

      <title>TCitH- and VOLEitH-based Signatures from Restricted Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Threshold-Computation-in-the-Head (TCitH) and VOLE-in-the-Head (VOLEitH), two recent developments of the MPC-in-the-Head (MPCitH) paradigm, have significantly improved the performance of digital signature schemes. This work embeds the restricted decoding problem within these frameworks: we propose a structurally simple modeling that achieves competitive signature sizes. Specifically, by instantiating the restricted decoding problem with the same hardness assumption underlying CROSS, we reduce sizes by more than a factor of two compared to the NIST submission. Moreover, we observe that ternary full-weight decoding, closely related to the hardness assumption underlying WAVE, is a restricted decoding problem. Using ternary full-weight decoding, we obtain signature sizes comparable to the smallest MPCitH-based candidates in the NIST competition.</description>

      <title>HAMLOCK: HArdware-Model LOgically Combined attacK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing use of third-party hardware accelerators (e.g., FPGAs, ASICs) for deep neural networks (DNNs) introduces new security vulnerabilities. Conventional model-level backdoor attacks, which only poison a model's weights to misclassify inputs with a specific trigger, are often detectable because the entire attack logic is embedded within the model (i.e., software), creating a traceable layer-by-layer activation path.
  This paper introduces the HArdware-Model Logically Combined Attack (HAMLOCK), a far stealthier threat that distributes the attack logic across the hardware-software boundary. The software (model) is now only minimally altered by tuning the activations of few neurons to produce uniquely high activation values when a trigger is present. A malicious hardware Trojan detects those unique activations by monitoring the corresponding neurons' most significant bit or the 8-bit exponents and triggers another hardware Trojan to directly manipulate the final output logits for misclassification.
  This decoupled design is highly stealthy, as the model itself contains no complete backdoor activation path as in conventional attacks and hence, appears fully benign. Empirically, across benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and ImageNet, HAMLOCK achieves a near-perfect attack success rate with a negligible clean accuracy drop. More importantly, HAMLOCK circumvents the state-of-the-art model-level defenses without any adaptive optimization. The hardware Trojan is also undetectable, incurring area and power overheads as low as 0.01%, which is easily masked by process and environmental noise. Our findings expose a critical vulnerability at the hardware-software interface, demanding new cross-layer defenses against this emerging threat.</description>

      <title>Soft Instruction De-escalation Defense</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic systems that interact with an external environment; this makes them susceptible to prompt injections when dealing with untrusted data. To overcome this limitation, we propose SIC (Soft Instruction Control)-a simple yet effective iterative prompt sanitization loop designed for tool-augmented LLM agents. Our method repeatedly inspects incoming data for instructions that could compromise agent behavior. If such content is found, the malicious content is rewritten, masked, or removed, and the result is re-evaluated. The process continues until the input is clean or a maximum iteration limit is reached; if imperative instruction-like content remains, the agent halts to ensure security. By allowing multiple passes, our approach acknowledges that individual rewrites may fail but enables the system to catch and correct missed injections in later steps. Although immediately useful, worst-case analysis shows that SIC is not infallible; strong adversary can still get a 15% ASR by embedding non-imperative workflows. This nonetheless raises the bar.</description>

      <title>A DRL-Empowered Multi-Level Jamming Approach for Secure Semantic Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) aims to transmit only task-relevant information, thereby improving communication efficiency but also exposing semantic information to potential eavesdropping. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-empowered multi-level jamming approach to enhance the security of SemCom systems over MIMO fading wiretap channels. This approach combines semantic layer jamming, achieved by encoding task-irrelevant text, and physical layer jamming, achieved by encoding random Gaussian noise. These two-level jamming signals are superposed with task-relevant semantic information to protect the transmitted semantics from eavesdropping. A deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is further introduced to dynamically design and optimize the precoding matrices for both task-relevant semantic information and multi-level jamming signals, aiming to enhance the legitimate user's image reconstruction while degrading the eavesdropper's performance. To jointly train the SemCom model and the DDPG agent, we propose an alternating optimization strategy where the two modules are updated iteratively. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with both the encryption-based (ESCS) and encoded jammer-based (EJ) benchmarks, our method achieves comparable security while improving the legitimate user's peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) by up to approximately 0.6 dB.</description>

      <title>Setting $\varepsilon$ is not the Issue in Differential Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This position paper argues that setting the privacy budget in differential privacy should not be viewed as an important limitation of differential privacy compared to alternative methods for privacy-preserving machine learning. The so-called problem of interpreting the privacy budget is often presented as a major hindrance to the wider adoption of differential privacy in real-world deployments and is sometimes used to promote alternative mitigation techniques for data protection. We believe this misleads decision-makers into choosing unsafe methods. We argue that the difficulty in interpreting privacy budgets does not stem from the definition of differential privacy itself, but from the intrinsic difficulty of estimating privacy risks in context, a challenge that any rigorous method for privacy risk assessment face. Moreover, we claim that any sound method for estimating privacy risks should, given the current state of research, be expressible within the differential privacy framework or justify why it cannot.</description>

      <title>Tuning for TraceTarnish: Techniques, Trends, and Testing Tangible Traits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we more rigorously evaluated our attack script $\textit{TraceTarnish}$, which leverages adversarial stylometry principles to anonymize the authorship of text-based messages. To ensure the efficacy and utility of our attack, we sourced, processed, and analyzed Reddit comments -- comments that were later alchemized into $\textit{TraceTarnish}$ data -- to gain valuable insights. The transformed $\textit{TraceTarnish}$ data was then further augmented by $\textit{StyloMetrix}$ to manufacture stylometric features -- features that were culled using the Information Gain criterion, leaving only the most informative, predictive, and discriminative ones. Our results found that function words and function word types ($L\_FUNC\_A$ $\&amp;$ $L\_FUNC\_T$); content words and content word types ($L\_CONT\_A$ $\&amp;$ $L\_CONT\_T$); and the Type-Token Ratio ($ST\_TYPE\_TOKEN\_RATIO\_LEMMAS$) yielded significant Information-Gain readings. The identified stylometric cues -- function-word frequencies, content-word distributions, and the Type-Token Ratio -- serve as reliable indicators of compromise (IoCs), revealing when a text has been deliberately altered to mask its true author. Similarly, these features could function as forensic beacons, alerting defenders to the presence of an adversarial stylometry attack; granted, in the absence of the original message, this signal may go largely unnoticed, as it appears to depend on a pre- and post-transformation comparison. "In trying to erase a trace, you often imprint a larger one." Armed with this understanding, we framed $\textit{TraceTarnish}$'s operations and outputs around these five isolated features, using them to conceptualize and implement enhancements that further strengthen the attack.</description>

      <title>MIRAGE: Misleading Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Black-box and Query-agnostic Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance LLMs with external knowledge but introduce a critical attack surface: corpus poisoning. While recent studies have demonstrated the potential of such attacks, they typically rely on impractical assumptions, such as white-box access or known user queries, thereby underestimating the difficulty of real-world exploitation. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proposing MIRAGE, a novel multi-stage poisoning pipeline designed for strict black-box and query-agnostic environments. Operating on surrogate model feedback, MIRAGE functions as an automated optimization framework that integrates three key mechanisms: it utilizes persona-driven query synthesis to approximate latent user search distributions, employs semantic anchoring to imperceptibly embed these intents for high retrieval visibility, and leverages an adversarial variant of Test-Time Preference Optimization (TPO) to maximize persuasion. To rigorously evaluate this threat, we construct a new benchmark derived from three long-form, domain-specific datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIRAGE significantly outperforms existing baselines in both attack efficacy and stealthiness, exhibiting remarkable transferability across diverse retriever-LLM configurations and highlighting the urgent need for robust defense strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the case of upgrading smart contracts on blockchain systems, it is essential to consider the continuity of upgrades and subsequent maintenance. In practice, upgrade operations often introduce new vulnerabilities. Existing static analysis tools usually only scan a single version and are unable to capture the correlation between code changes and emerging risks. To address this, we propose an Upgradeable Smart Contract Security Analyzer, USCSA, which uses Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) difference analysis to assess risks associated with the upgrade process and utilizes large language models (LLMs) for assisted reasoning to achieve high-confidence vulnerability attribution. We collected and analyzed 3,546 cases of vulnerabilities in upgradeable contracts, covering common vulnerability categories such as reentrancy, access control flaws, and integer overflow. Experimental results show that USCSA achieves a precision of 92.26%, a recall of 89.67%, and an F1-score of 90.95% in detecting upgrade-induced vulnerabilities. As a result, USCSA provides a significant advantage to improve the security and integrity of upgradeable smart contracts, offering a novel and efficient solution for security auditing on blockchain applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing cyber threats to critical infrastructure highlight the importance of private companies and government agencies in detecting and sharing information about threat activities. Although the need for improved threat information sharing is widely recognized, various technical and organizational challenges persist, hindering effective collaboration. In this study, we review the challenges that disturb the sharing of usable threat information to critical infrastructure operators within the ICS domain. We analyze three major incidents: Stuxnet, Industroyer, and Triton. In addition, we perform a systematic analysis of 196 procedure examples across 79 MITRE ATT&amp;CK techniques from 22 ICS-related malware families, utilizing automated natural language processing techniques to systematically extract and categorize threat observables. Additionally, we investigated nine recent ICS vulnerability advisories from the CISA Known Exploitable Vulnerability catalog. Our analysis identified four important limitations in the ICS threat information sharing ecosystem: (i) the lack of coherent representation of artifacts related to ICS adversarial techniques in information sharing language standards (e.g., STIX); (ii) the dependence on undocumented proprietary technologies; (iii) limited technical details provided in vulnerability and threat incident reports; and (iv) the accessibility of technical details for observed adversarial techniques. This study aims to guide the development of future information-sharing standards, including the enhancement of the cyber-observable objects schema in STIX, to ensure accurate representation of artifacts specific to ICS environments.</description>

      <title>Evaluating MCC for Low-Frequency Cyberattack Detection in Imbalanced Intrusion Detection Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many real-world network environments, several types of cyberattacks occur at very low rates compared to benign traffic, making them difficult for intrusion detection systems (IDS) to detect reliably. This imbalance causes traditional evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, to often overstate model performance in these conditions, masking failures on minority attack classes that are most important in practice. In this paper, we evaluate a set of base and meta classifiers on low-traffic attacks in the CSE-CIC-IDS2017 dataset and compare their reliability in terms of accuracy and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC). The results show that accuracy consistently inflates performance, while MCC provides a more accurate assessment of a classifier's performance across both majority and minority classes. Meta-classification methods, such as LogitBoost and AdaBoost, demonstrate more effective minority class detection when measured by MCC, revealing trends that accuracy fails to capture. These findings establish the need for imbalance-aware evaluation and make MCC a more trustworthy metric for IDS research involving low-traffic cyberattacks.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Induced Over-Generation as Denial-of-Service: A Black-Box Attack-Side Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23779v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can be driven into over-generation, emitting thousands of tokens before producing an end-of-sequence (EOS) token. This degrades answer quality, inflates latency and cost, and can be weaponized as a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. Recent work has begun to study DoS-style prompt attacks, but typically focuses on a single attack algorithm or assumes white-box access, without an attack-side benchmark that compares prompt-based attackers in a black-box, query-only regime with a known tokenizer. We introduce such a benchmark and study two prompt-only attackers. The first is an Evolutionary Over-Generation Prompt Search (EOGen) that searches the token space for prefixes that suppress EOS and induce long continuations. The second is a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning attacker (RL-GOAL) that trains a network to generate prefixes conditioned on a target length. To characterize behavior, we introduce Over-Generation Factor (OGF): the ratio of produced tokens to a model's context window, along with stall and latency summaries. EOGen discovers short-prefix attacks that raise Phi-3 to OGF = 1.39 +/- 1.14 (Success@&gt;=2: 25.2%); RL-GOAL nearly doubles severity to OGF = 2.70 +/- 1.43 (Success@&gt;=2: 64.3%) and drives budget-hit non-termination in 46% of trials.</description>

      <title>Secure Digital Semantic Communications: Fundamentals, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24602v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has emerged as a promising paradigm for future wireless networks by prioritizing task-relevant meaning over raw data delivery, thereby reducing communication overhead and improving efficiency. However, shifting from bit-accurate transmission to task-oriented delivery introduces new security and privacy risks. These include semantic leakage, semantic manipulation, knowledge base vulnerabilities, model-related attacks, and threats to authenticity and availability. Most existing secure SemCom studies focus on analog SemCom, where semantic features are mapped to continuous channel inputs. In contrast, digital SemCom transmits semantic information through discrete bits or symbols within practical transceiver pipelines, offering stronger compatibility with realworld systems while exposing a distinct and underexplored attack surface. In particular, digital SemCom typically represents semantic information over a finite alphabet through explicit digital modulation, following two main routes: probabilistic modulation and deterministic modulation. These discrete mechanisms and practical transmission procedures introduce additional vulnerabilities affecting bit- or symbol-level semantic information, the modulation stage, and packet-based delivery and protocol operations. Motivated by these challenges and the lack of a systematic analysis of secure digital SemCom, this paper provides a structured review of the area. Specifically, we review SemCom fundamentals and clarify the architectural differences between analog and digital SemCom. We then summarize threats shared by both paradigms and organize the threat landscape specific to digital SemCom, followed by a discussion of potential defenses. Finally, we outline open research directions toward secure and deployable digital SemCom systems.</description>

      <title>Crafting Adversarial Inputs for Large Vision-Language Models Using Black-Box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have shown groundbreaking capabilities across diverse multimodal tasks. However, these models remain vulnerable to adversarial jailbreak attacks, where adversaries craft subtle perturbations to bypass safety mechanisms and trigger harmful outputs. Existing white-box attacks methods require full model accessibility, suffer from computing costs and exhibit insufficient adversarial transferability, making them impractical for real-world, black-box settings. To address these limitations, we propose a black-box jailbreak attack on LVLMs via Zeroth-Order optimization using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (ZO-SPSA). ZO-SPSA provides three key advantages: (i) gradient-free approximation by input-output interactions without requiring model knowledge, (ii) model-agnostic optimization without the surrogate model and (iii) lower resource requirements with reduced GPU memory consumption. We evaluate ZO-SPSA on three LVLMs, including InstructBLIP, LLaVA and MiniGPT-4, achieving the highest jailbreak success rate of 83.0% on InstructBLIP, while maintaining imperceptible perturbations comparable to white-box methods. Moreover, adversarial examples generated from MiniGPT-4 exhibit strong transferability to other LVLMs, with ASR reaching 64.18%. These findings underscore the real-world feasibility of black-box jailbreaks and expose critical weaknesses in the safety mechanisms of current LVLMs</description>

      <title>LLMs, You Can Evaluate It! Design of Multi-perspective Report Evaluation for Security Operation Centers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Security operation centers (SOCs) often produce analysis reports on security incidents, and large language models (LLMs) will likely be used for this task in the near future. We postulate that a better understanding of how veteran analysts evaluate reports, including their feedback, can help produce analysis reports in SOCs. In this paper, we aim to leverage LLMs for analysis reports. To this end, we first construct a Analyst-wise checklist to reflect SOC practitioners' opinions for analysis report evaluation through literature review and user study with SOC practitioners. Next, we design a novel LLM-based conceptual framework, named MESSALA, by further introducing two new techniques, granularization guideline and multi-perspective evaluation. MESSALA can maximize report evaluation and provide feedback on veteran SOC practitioners' perceptions. When we conduct extensive experiments with MESSALA, the evaluation results by MESSALA are the closest to those of veteran SOC practitioners compared with the existing LLM-based methods. We then show two key insights. We also conduct qualitative analysis with MESSALA, and then identify that MESSALA can provide actionable items that are necessary for improving analysis reports.</description>

      <title>A High-Recall Cost-Sensitive Machine Learning Framework for Real-Time Online Banking Transaction Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07276v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fraudulent activities on digital banking services are becoming more intricate by the day, challenging existing defenses. While older rule driven methods struggle to keep pace, even precision focused algorithms fall short when new scams are introduced. These tools typically overlook subtle shifts in criminal behavior, missing crucial signals. Because silent breaches cost institutions far more than flagged but legitimate actions, catching every possible case is crucial. High sensitivity to actual threats becomes essential when oversight leads to heavy losses. One key aim here involves reducing missed fraud cases without spiking incorrect alerts too much. This study builds a system using group learning methods adjusted through smart threshold choices. Using real world transaction records shared openly, where cheating acts rarely appear among normal activities, tests are run under practical skewed distributions. The outcomes reveal that approximately 98 percent of actual fraud is detected, outperforming standard setups that rely on unchanging rules when dealing with uneven examples across classes. When tested in live settings, the fraud detection system connects directly to an online banking transaction flow, stopping questionable activities before they are completed. Alongside this setup, a browser add on built for Chrome is designed to flag deceptive web links and reduce threats from harmful sites. These results show that adjusting decisions by cost impact and validating across entire systems makes deployment more stable and realistic for today's digital banking platforms.</description>

      <title>ForgetMark: Stealthy Fingerprint Embedding via Targeted Unlearning in Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing invasive (backdoor) fingerprints suffer from high-perplexity triggers that are easily filtered, fixed response patterns exposed by heuristic detectors, and spurious activations on benign inputs. We introduce \textsc{ForgetMark}, a stealthy fingerprinting framework that encodes provenance via targeted unlearning. It builds a compact, human-readable key--value set with an assistant model and predictive-entropy ranking, then trains lightweight LoRA adapters to suppress the original values on their keys while preserving general capabilities. Ownership is verified under black/gray-box access by aggregating likelihood and semantic evidence into a fingerprint success rate. By relying on probabilistic forgetting traces rather than fixed trigger--response patterns, \textsc{ForgetMark} avoids high-perplexity triggers, reduces detectability, and lowers false triggers. Across diverse architectures and settings, it achieves 100\% ownership verification on fingerprinted models while maintaining standard performance, surpasses backdoor baselines in stealthiness and robustness to model merging, and remains effective under moderate incremental fine-tuning. Our code and data are available at \href{https://github.com/Xuzhenhua55/ForgetMark}{https://github.com/Xuzhenhua55/ForgetMark}.</description>

      <title>DNF: Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting for Large Language Model Intellectual Property Protection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of large language models raises pressing concerns about intellectual property protection under black-box deployment. Existing backdoor-based fingerprints either rely on rare tokens -- leading to high-perplexity inputs susceptible to filtering -- or use fixed trigger-response mappings that are brittle to leakage and post-hoc adaptation. We propose \textsc{Dual-Layer Nested Fingerprinting} (DNF), a black-box method that embeds a hierarchical backdoor by coupling domain-specific stylistic cues with implicit semantic triggers. Across Mistral-7B, LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct, and Falcon3-7B-Instruct, DNF achieves perfect fingerprint activation while preserving downstream utility. Compared with existing methods, it uses lower-perplexity triggers, remains undetectable under fingerprint detection attacks, and is relatively robust to incremental fine-tuning and model merging. These results position DNF as a practical, stealthy, and resilient solution for LLM ownership verification and intellectual property protection.</description>

      <title>StegoStylo: Squelching Stylometric Scrutiny through Steganographic Stitching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stylometry--the identification of an author through analysis of a text's style (i.e., authorship attribution)--serves many constructive purposes: it supports copyright and plagiarism investigations, aids detection of harmful content, offers exploratory cues for certain medical conditions (e.g., early signs of dementia or depression), provides historical context for literary works, and helps uncover misinformation and disinformation. In contrast, when stylometry is employed as a tool for authorship verification--confirming whether a text truly originates from a claimed author--it can also be weaponized for malicious purposes. Techniques such as de-anonymization, re-identification, tracking, profiling, and downstream effects like censorship illustrate the privacy threats that stylometric analysis can enable. Building on these concerns, this paper further explores how adversarial stylometry combined with steganography can counteract stylometric analysis. We first present enhancements to our adversarial attack, $\textit{TraceTarnish}$, providing stronger evidence of its capacity to confound stylometric systems and reduce their attribution and verification accuracy. Next, we examine how steganographic embedding can be fine-tuned to mask an author's stylistic fingerprint, quantifying the level of authorship obfuscation achievable as a function of the proportion of words altered with zero-width Unicode characters. Based on our findings, steganographic coverage of 33% or higher seemingly ensures authorship obfuscation. Finally, we reflect on the ways stylometry can be used to undermine privacy and argue for the necessity of defensive tools like $\textit{TraceTarnish}$.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Encryption with Certified Deletion in Preprocessing Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certified deletion allows Alice to outsource data to Bob and, at a later time, obtain a verifiable guarantee that the file has been irreversibly deleted at her request. The functionality, while impossible using classical information alone, can be achieved using quantum information. Existing approaches rely either on one-time pad (OTP) encryption, or on computational hardness assumptions that may be vulnerable to future advances in classical or quantum computing. In this work, we introduce and formalize hybrid encryption with certified deletion in the preprocessing model (pHE-CD) and propose two constructions. Each construction composes an information-theoretic key encapsulation mechanism (iKEM) with a data encapsulation mechanism that provides certified deletion (DEM-CD) security, offering different types of security depending on the security properties of DEM-CD. When DEM-CD is one-time information theoretically secure, the composition provides {\em information-theoretic security} for both encryption and certified deletion. When DEM-CD is computationally secure, the composed construction offers computationally secure (post-quantum) encryption and {\em everlasting certified deletion} where confidentiality is computational up to the point that the deletion certificate is verified, and after successful verification of the certificate, becomes unconditional. That is, successful verification of deletion certificate guarantees that the data has been removed information-theoretically from the adversary's view. Both pHE-CD schemes are for encryption of arbitrarily long messages. Construction 2 is key efficient and uses a DEM-CD that is constructed using quantum coding and AES, providing quantum-safe security for encryption. We discuss our results and directions for future work.</description>

      <title>Eye-tracked Virtual Reality: A Comprehensive Survey on Methods and Privacy Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The latest developments in computer hardware, sensor technologies, and artificial intelligence can make virtual reality (VR) and virtual spaces an important part of human everyday life. Eye tracking offers not only a hands-free way of interaction but also the possibility of a deeper understanding of human visual attention and cognitive processes in VR. Despite these possibilities, eye-tracking data also reveals users' privacy-sensitive attributes when combined with the information about the presented stimulus. To address all, this survey first covers major works in eye tracking, VR, and privacy areas between 2012 and 2022. While eye tracking in VR part covers the computational eye tracking pipeline from pupil detection and gaze estimation to offline data analysis, for privacy and security, we focus on eye-based authentication as well as computational methods to preserve the privacy of individuals and their eye-tracking data in VR. Later, we outline three main directions by focusing on privacy. In summary, this survey presents an extensive literature review of the utmost possibilities of eye tracking in VR and their privacy implications.</description>

      <title>Assessing Utility of Differential Privacy for RCTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have become powerful tools for assessing the impact of interventions and policies in many contexts. They are considered the gold standard for causal inference in the biomedical fields and many social sciences. Researchers have published an increasing number of studies that rely on RCTs for at least part of their inference. These studies typically include the response data that has been collected, de-identified, and sometimes protected through traditional disclosure limitation methods. In this paper, we empirically assess the impact of privacy-preserving synthetic data generation methodologies on published RCT analyses by leveraging available replication packages (research compendia) in economics and policy analysis. We implement three privacy-preserving algorithms, that use as a base one of the basic differentially private (DP) algorithms, the perturbed histogram, to support the quality of statistical inference. We highlight challenges with the straight use of this algorithm and the stability-based histogram in our setting and described the adjustments needed. We provide simulation studies and demonstrate that we can replicate the analysis in a published economics article on privacy-protected data under various parameterizations. We find that relatively straightforward (at a high-level) privacy-preserving methods influenced by DP techniques allow for inference-valid protection of published data. The results have applicability to researchers wishing to share RCT data, especially in the context of low- and middle-income countries, with strong privacy protection.</description>

      <title>Rethinking and Red-Teaming Protective Perturbation in Personalized Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18944v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Personalized diffusion models (PDMs) have become prominent for adapting pre-trained text-to-image models to generate images of specific subjects using minimal training data. However, PDMs are susceptible to minor adversarial perturbations, leading to significant degradation when fine-tuned on corrupted datasets. These vulnerabilities are exploited to create protective perturbations that prevent unauthorized image generation. Existing purification methods attempt to red-team the protective perturbation to break the protection but often over-purify images, resulting in information loss. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the fine-tuning process of PDMs through the lens of shortcut learning. We hypothesize and empirically demonstrate that adversarial perturbations induce a latent-space misalignment between images and their text prompts in the CLIP embedding space. This misalignment causes the model to erroneously associate noisy patterns with unique identifiers during fine-tuning, resulting in poor generalization. Based on these insights, we propose a systematic red-teaming framework that includes data purification and contrastive decoupling learning. We first employ off-the-shelf image restoration techniques to realign images with their original semantic content in latent space. Then, we introduce contrastive decoupling learning with noise tokens to decouple the learning of personalized concepts from spurious noise patterns. Our study not only uncovers shortcut learning vulnerabilities in PDMs but also provides a thorough evaluation framework for developing stronger protection. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates its advantages over existing purification methods and its robustness against adaptive perturbations.</description>

      <title>JANUS: A Difference-Oriented Analyzer For Financial Centralization Risks in Smart Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some smart contracts violate decentralization principles by defining privileged accounts that manage other users' assets without permission, introducing centralization risks that have caused financial losses. Existing methods, however, face challenges in accurately detecting diverse centralization risks due to their dependence on predefined behavior patterns. In this paper, we propose JANUS, an automated analyzer for Solidity smart contracts that detects financial centralization risks independently of their specific behaviors. JANUS identifies differences between states reached by privileged and ordinary accounts, and analyzes whether these differences are finance-related. Focusing on the impact of risks rather than behaviors, JANUS achieves improved accuracy compared to existing tools and can uncover centralization risks with unknown patterns.
  To evaluate JANUS's performance, we compare it with other tools using a dataset of 540 contracts. Our evaluation demonstrates that JANUS outperforms representative tools in terms of detection accuracy for financial centralization risks . Additionally, we evaluate JANUS on a real-world dataset of 33,151 contracts, successfully identifying two types of risks that other tools fail to detect. We also prove that the state traversal method and variable summaries, which are used in JANUS to reduce the number of states to be compared, do not introduce false alarms or omissions in detection.</description>

Abstract: Vulnerabilities in open-source operating systems (OSs) pose substantial security risks to software systems, making their detection crucial. While fuzzing has been an effective vulnerability detection technique in various domains, OS fuzzing (OSF) faces unique challenges due to OS complexity and multi-layered interaction, and has not been comprehensively reviewed. Therefore, this work systematically surveys the state-of-the-art OSF techniques, categorizes them based on the general fuzzing process, and investigates challenges specific to kernel, file system, driver, and hypervisor fuzzing. Finally, future research directions for OSF are discussed.</description>

      <title>SoK: On the Survivability of Backdoor Attacks on Unconstrained Face Recognition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01607v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread deployment of Deep Learning-based Face Recognition Systems raises many security concerns. While prior research has identified backdoor vulnerabilities on isolated components, Backdoor Attacks on real-world, unconstrained pipelines remain underexplored. This SoK paper presents the first comprehensive system-level analysis and measurement of the impact of Backdoor Attacks on fully-fledged Face Recognition Systems. We combine the existing Supervised Learning backdoor literature targeting face detectors, face antispoofing, and face feature extractors to demonstrate a system-level vulnerability. By analyzing 20 pipeline configurations and 15 attack scenarios in a holistic manner, we reveal that an attacker only needs a single backdoored model to compromise an entire Face Recognition System. Finally, we discuss the impact of such attacks and propose best practices and countermeasures for stakeholders.</description>

      <title>Wukong Framework for Not Safe For Work Detection in Text-to-Image systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC) technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1) early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2) cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts, seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while offering much greater efficiency.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Safety Tax: Mitigating Unsafe Text-to-Image Generation via External Safety Rectification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21099v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generative models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity, yet remain vulnerable to generating unsafe content. Existing safety defenses typically intervene internally within the generative model, but suffer from severe concept entanglement, leading to degradation of benign generation quality, a trade-off we term the Safety Tax. To overcome this limitation, we advocate a paradigm shift from destructive internal editing to external safety rectification. Following this principle, we propose SafePatch, a structurally isolated safety module that performs external, interpretable rectification without modifying the base model. The core backbone of SafePatch is architecturally instantiated as a trainable clone of the base model's encoder, allowing it to inherit rich semantic priors and maintain representation consistency. To enable interpretable safety rectification, we construct a strictly aligned counterfactual safety dataset (ACS) for differential supervision training. Across nudity and multi-category benchmarks and recent adversarial prompt attacks, SafePatch achieves robust unsafe suppression (7% unsafe on I2P) while preserving image quality and semantic alignment.</description>

      <title>Sy-FAR: Symmetry-based Fair Adversarial Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar, leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains. Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.</description>

      <title>Angelfish: Leader, DAG, or Anywhere in Between</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To maximize performance, many modern blockchain systems rely on eventually-synchronous, Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols. Two protocol designs have emerged in this space: protocols that minimize latency using a leader that drives both data dissemination and consensus, and protocols that maximize throughput using a separate, asynchronous data dissemination layer. Recent protocols such as Partially-Synchronous Bullshark and Sailfish combine elements of both approaches by using a DAG to enable parallel data dissemination and a leader that paces DAG formation. This improves latency while achieving state-of-the-art throughput. However, the DAG-formation process of those protocols imposes overheads that prevent matching the latency possible with a leader-based protocol.
  We present Angelfish, a hybrid protocol that adapts smoothly across this design space, from leader-based to DAG-based consensus. Angelfish lets a dynamically-adjusted subset of parties use best-effort broadcast to issue lightweight votes instead of using a costlier reliably broadcast to create DAG vertices. This reduces communication, tolerates more lagging nodes, and lowers latency in practice compared to prior DAG-based protocols. Our empirical evaluation shows that Angelfish attains state-of-the-art peak throughput while matching the latency of leader-based protocols under moderate throughput, delivering the best of both worlds. The implementation is open-sourced and publicly available.</description>

      <title>SandCell: Sandboxing Rust Beyond Unsafe Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rust is a modern systems programming language that ensures memory safety by enforcing ownership and borrowing rules at compile time. While the unsafe keyword allows programmers to bypass these restrictions, it introduces significant risks. Various approaches for isolating unsafe code to protect safe Rust from vulnerabilities have been proposed, yet these methods provide only fixed isolation boundaries and do not accommodate expressive policies that require sandboxing both safe and unsafe code. This paper presents SandCell for flexible and lightweight isolation in Rust by leveraging existing syntactic boundaries. SandCell allows programmers to specify which components to sandbox with minimal annotation effort, enabling fine-grained control over isolation. The system also introduces novel techniques to minimize overhead when transferring data between sandboxes. Our evaluation demonstrates SandCell's effectiveness in preventing vulnerabilities across various Rust applications while maintaining reasonable performance overheads.</description>

      <title>LLMs Deceive Unintentionally: Emergent Misalignment in Dishonesty from Misaligned Samples to Biased Human-AI Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous research has shown that LLMs finetuned on malicious or incorrect completions within narrow domains (e.g., insecure code or incorrect medical advice) can become broadly misaligned to exhibit harmful behaviors, which is called emergent misalignment. In this work, we investigate whether this phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty. Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.

      <title>Forgetting-MarI: LLM Unlearning via Marginal Information Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11914v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As AI models are trained on ever-expanding datasets, the ability to remove the influence of specific data from trained models has become essential for privacy protection and regulatory compliance. Unlearning addresses this challenge by selectively removing parametric knowledge from the trained models without retraining from scratch, which is critical for resource-intensive models such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing unlearning methods often degrade model performance by removing more information than necessary when attempting to ''forget'' specific data. We introduce Forgetting-MarI, an LLM unlearning framework that provably removes only the additional (marginal) information contributed by the data to be unlearned, while preserving the information supported by the data to be retained. By penalizing marginal information, our method yields an explicit upper bound on the unlearn dataset's residual influence in the trained models, providing provable undetectability. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art unlearning methods, delivering reliable forgetting and better preserved general model performance across diverse benchmarks. This advancement represents an important step toward making AI systems more controllable and compliant with privacy and copyright regulations without compromising their effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Observational Auditing of Label Privacy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14084v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing is essential for evaluating privacy guarantees in machine learning systems. Existing auditing methods, however, pose a significant challenge for large-scale systems since they require modifying the training dataset -- for instance, by injecting out-of-distribution canaries or removing samples from training. Such interventions on the training data pipeline are resource-intensive and involve considerable engineering overhead. We introduce a novel observational auditing framework that leverages the inherent randomness of data distributions, enabling privacy evaluation without altering the original dataset. Our approach extends privacy auditing beyond traditional membership inference to protected attributes, with labels as a special case, addressing a key gap in existing techniques. We provide theoretical foundations for our method and perform experiments on Criteo and CIFAR-10 datasets that demonstrate its effectiveness in auditing label privacy guarantees. This work opens new avenues for practical privacy auditing in large-scale production environments.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of general-purpose AI models has increased concerns about copyright infringement in training data, yet current regulatory frameworks remain predominantly reactive rather than proactive. This paper examines the regulatory landscape of AI training data governance in major jurisdictions, including the EU, the United States, and the Asia-Pacific region. It also identifies critical gaps in enforcement mechanisms that threaten both creator rights and the sustainability of AI development. Through analysis of major cases we identified critical gaps in pre-training data filtering. Existing solutions such as transparency tools, perceptual hashing, and access control mechanisms address only specific aspects of the problem and cannot prevent initial copyright violations. We identify two fundamental challenges: pre-training license collection and content filtering, which faces the impossibility of comprehensive copyright management at scale, and verification mechanisms, which lack tools to confirm filtering prevented infringement. We propose a multilayered filtering pipeline that combines access control, content verification, machine learning classifiers, and continuous database cross-referencing to shift copyright protection from post-training detection to pre-training prevention. This approach offers a pathway toward protecting creator rights while enabling continued AI innovation.</description>

      <title>What You Trust Is Insecure: Demystifying How Developers (Mis)Use Trusted Execution Environments in Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), such as Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone, provide isolated regions of CPU and memory for secure computation and are increasingly used to protect sensitive data and code across diverse application domains. However, little is known about how developers actually use TEEs in practice. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of real-world TEE applications. We collected and analyzed 241 open-source projects from GitHub that utilize the two most widely-adopted TEEs, Intel SGX and ARM TrustZone. By combining manual inspection with customized static analysis scripts, we examined their adoption contexts, usage patterns, and development practices across three phases. First, we categorized the projects into 8 application domains and identified trends in TEE adoption over time. We found that the dominant use case is IoT device security (30%), which contrasts sharply with prior academic focus on blockchain and cryptographic systems (7%), while AI model protection (12%) is rapidly emerging as a growing domain. Second, we analyzed how TEEs are integrated into software and observed that 32.4% of the projects reimplement cryptographic functionalities instead of using official SDK APIs, suggesting that current SDKs may have limited usability and portability to meet developers' practical needs. Third, we examined security practices through manual inspection and found that 25.3% (61 of 241) of the projects exhibit insecure coding behaviors when using TEEs, such as hardcoded secrets and missing input validation, which undermine their intended security guarantees. Our findings have important implications for improving the usability of TEE SDKs and supporting developers in trusted software development.</description>

      <title>Focus on What Matters: Fisher-Guided Adaptive Multimodal Fusion for Vulnerability Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Software vulnerability detection can be formulated as a binary classification problem that determines whether a given code snippet contains security defects. Existing multimodal methods typically fuse Natural Code Sequence (NCS) representations extracted by pretrained models with Code Property Graph (CPG) representations extracted by graph neural networks, under the implicit assumption that introducing an additional modality necessarily yields information gain. Through empirical analysis, we demonstrate the limitations of this assumption: pretrained models already encode substantial structural information implicitly, leading to strong overlap between the two modalities; moreover, graph encoders are generally less effective than pretrained language models in feature extraction. As a result, naive fusion not only struggles to obtain complementary signals but can also dilute effective discriminative cues due to noise propagation. To address these challenges, we propose a task-conditioned complementary fusion strategy that uses Fisher information to quantify task relevance, transforming cross-modal interaction from full-spectrum matching into selective fusion within a task-sensitive subspace. Our theoretical analysis shows that, under an isotropic perturbation assumption, this strategy significantly tightens the upper bound on the output error. Based on this insight, we design the TaCCS-DFA framework, which combines online low-rank Fisher subspace estimation with an adaptive gating mechanism to enable efficient task-oriented fusion. Experiments on the BigVul, Devign, and ReVeal benchmarks demonstrate that TaCCS-DFA delivers up to a 6.3-point gain in F1 score with only a 3.4% increase in inference latency, while maintaining low calibration error.</description>
