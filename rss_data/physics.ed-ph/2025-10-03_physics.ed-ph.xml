      <title>A principled way to think about AI in education: guidance for action based on goals, models of human learning, and use of technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid emergence of generative artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies has the potential to dramatically influence higher education, raising questions about the roles of institutions, educators, and students in a technology-rich future. While existing discourse often emphasizes either the promise and peril of AI or its immediate implementation, this paper advances a third path: a principled framework for guiding the use of AI in teaching and learning. Drawing on decades of scholarship in the learning sciences and uses of technology in education, I articulate a set of principles that connect broad our educational goalsto actionable practices. These principles clarify the respective roles of educators, learners, and technologies in shaping curricula, designing instruction, assessing learning, and cultivating community. The piece illustrates how a principled approach enables higher education to harness new tools while preserving its fundamental mission: advancing meaningful learning, supporting democratic societies, and preparing students for dynamic futures. Ultimately, this framework seeks to ensure that AI augments rather than displaces human capacities, aligning technology use with enduring educational values and goals.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Correctly Interpret Equations with Errors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential of Large Language Models to accurately extract and translate equations from typed student responses into a standard format. This is a useful task as standardized equations can be graded reliably using a Computer Algebra System or a Satisfiability Modulo Theories solver. Therefore physics instructors interested in automated grading would not need to rely on the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Language Models.
  We used two novel frameworks to improve the translations. The first is consensus where a pair of models verify the correctness of the translations. The second is a neuro-symbolic LLM-modulo approach were models receive feedback from an automated reasoning tool. We performed experiments using responses to the Australian Physics Olympaid exam. We report on results, finding that no open-source model was able to translate the student responses at the desired level of accuracy. Future work could involve breaking the task into smaller components before parsing to improve performance, or generalizing the experiments to translate hand-written responses.</description>
