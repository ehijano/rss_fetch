      <title>Stop Saying "AI"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Across academia, industry, and government, ``AI'' has become central in research and development, regulatory debates, and promises of ever faster and more capable decision-making and action. In numerous domains, especially safety-critical ones, there are significant concerns over how ``AI'' may affect decision-making, responsibility, or the likelihood of mistakes (to name only a few categories of critique). However, for most critiques, the target is generally ``AI'', a broad term admitting many (types of) systems used for a variety of tasks and each coming with its own set of limitations, challenges, and potential use cases. In this article, we focus on the military domain as a case study and present both a loose enumerative taxonomy of systems captured under the umbrella term ``military AI'', as well as discussion of the challenges of each. In doing so, we highlight that critiques of one (type of) system will not always transfer to other (types of) systems. Building on this, we argue that in order for debates to move forward fruitfully, it is imperative that the discussions be made more precise and that ``AI'' be excised from debates to the extent possible. Researchers, developers, and policy-makers should make clear exactly what systems they have in mind and what possible benefits and risks attend the deployment of those particular systems. While we focus on AI in the military as an exemplar for the overall trends in discussions of ``AI'', the argument's conclusions are broad and have import for discussions of AI across a host of domains.</description>

      <title>Games That Teach, Chats That Convince: Comparing Interactive and Static Formats for Persuasive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactive systems such as chatbots and games are increasingly used to persuade and educate on sustainability-related topics, yet it remains unclear how different delivery formats shape learning and persuasive outcomes when content is held constant. Grounding on identical arguments and factual content across conditions, we present a controlled user study comparing three modes of information delivery: static essays, conversational chatbots, and narrative text-based games. Across subjective measures, the chatbot condition consistently outperformed the other modes and increased perceived importance of the topic. However, perceived learning did not reliably align with objective outcomes: participants in the text-based game condition reported learning less than those reading essays, yet achieved higher scores on a delayed (24-hour) knowledge quiz. Additional exploratory analyses further suggest that common engagement proxies, such as verbosity and interaction length, are more closely related to subjective experience than to actual learning. These findings highlight a dissociation between how persuasive experiences feel and what participants retain, and point to important design trade-offs between interactivity, realism, and learning in persuasive systems and serious games.</description>

      <title>Non-Contiguous Wi-Fi Spectrum for ISAC: Impact on Multipath Delay Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging channel state information from multiple Wi-Fi bands can improve delay resolution for ranging and sensing when a wide contiguous spectrum is unavailable. However, frequency gaps shape the delay response, introducing sidelobes and secondary peaks that can obscure closely spaced multipath components. This paper examines multipath delay estimation for Wi-Fi-compliant multiband configurations using channel state information (CSI). For a two-path model with unknown complex gains and delays, the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for delay separation is derived and analyzed, confirming the benefit of larger frequency aperture, while revealing pronounced, separation-dependent oscillations driven by gap geometry and inter-path coupling. Given the local nature of Cram\'er-Rao lower bound, the delay response is analyzed next. In the single-path case, the combined subband responses determine how delay-domain sidelobe levels are distributed. The dominant peak spacing is set primarily by the separation between subband center frequencies. In the two-path case, increased aperture sharpens the mainlobe but also intensifies sidelobes and leakage, yielding competing peaks and, in some regimes, a dominant peak shifted from the true delay. Finally, a normalized leakage metric is introduced to predict problematic separations and to identify regimes where local Cram\'er-Rao lower bound analysis does not capture practical peak-leakage behavior in delay estimation.</description>

      <title>A reliability- and latency-driven task allocation framework for workflow applications in the edge-hub-cloud continuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A growing number of critical workflow applications leverage a streamlined edge-hub-cloud architecture, which diverges from the conventional edge computing paradigm. An edge device, in collaboration with a hub device and a cloud server, often suffices for their reliable and efficient execution. However, task allocation in this streamlined architecture is challenging due to device limitations and diverse operating conditions. Given the inherent criticality of such workflow applications, where reliability and latency are vital yet conflicting objectives, an exact task allocation approach is typically required to ensure optimal solutions. As no existing method holistically addresses these issues, we propose an exact multi-objective task allocation framework to jointly optimize the overall reliability and latency of a workflow application in the specific edge-hub-cloud architecture. We present a comprehensive binary integer linear programming formulation that considers the relative importance of each objective. It incorporates time redundancy techniques, while accounting for crucial constraints often overlooked in related studies. We evaluate our approach using a relevant real-world workflow application, as well as synthetic workflows varying in structure, size, and criticality. In the real-world application, our method achieved average improvements of 84.19% in reliability and 49.81% in latency over baseline strategies, across relevant objective trade-offs. Overall, the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach across diverse workflow applications for the considered system architecture, highlighting its practicality with runtimes averaging between 0.03 and 50.94 seconds across all examined workflows.</description>

      <title>Pairwise XOR and XNOR Gates in Squeezed Instantaneous Noise Based Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instantaneous noise-based logic (INBL) is a novel computing approach that encodes binary information using stochastic processes. It uses 2M orthogonal stochastic reference noises for M noise-bits to construct an exponentially large Hilbert space (hyperspace) of dimension 2^M. INBL offers a classical alternative to quantum-style parallelism for specific problems with exponential speedup compared to classical algorithms. Building on recent work that introduced pairwise XOR and XNOR operations defined for a symmetric INBL scheme, this paper implements these gates for a squeezed INBL scheme. Hyperspace vectors are product strings corresponding to M-bit long binary numbers. The proposed operations can apply pairwise on hyperspace vectors and their superpositions, while remaining compatible with the squeezed reference system. We validate that the squeezed-scheme XOR/XNOR gate operations have correct Boolean behavior over both bitwise and targeted M-bit strings and demonstrate that the operations preserve instantaneous evaluation. The results show that the XOR/XNOR toolkit, previously developed for symmetric INBL, can be tailored for the squeezed scheme. This development is a key part of the gate set needed for more complex INBL algorithms in the squeezed INBL scheme and advances the objective of gate universality in INBL. It further strengthens the case for INBL as a flexible, classical computing framework that can emulate some structural advantages of quantum computation.</description>
