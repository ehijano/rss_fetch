      <title>Neutron Star with Dark Matter Admixture: A Candidate for Bridging the Mass Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars and black holes are the after death remnants of massive stars. However, according to the most recent observations, the neutron stars maximum mass is between $2.0-2.5 M_{\odot}$ while black holes of less than 5 $M_{\odot}$ rarely has been observed. The region between the most massive neutron star and the least massive black hole is called the mass gap. If indeed its existence is confirmed by future observations, that indicates a gap in our understanding which seeks for explanation. In addition, the existence of compact objects within the mass gap should also be supported with the help of possible new theoretical scenarios. In this letter, we propose a possible explanation for the existence of compact objects within the mass gap region. Specifically, we propose that the mass gap region could be bridged by the existence of a hybrid compact object, composed of hadronic and self interacting - non annihilating fermionic dark matter, considering that the interaction between these two fluids its only gravitational. Fundamental questions about how these objects form and how they can be detected are also addressed.</description>

      <title>LensWatch: II. Improved Photometry and Time Delay Constraints on the Strongly-Lensed Type Ia Supernova 2022qmx ("SN Zwicky") with HST Template Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly lensed supernovae (SNe) are a rare class of transient that can offer tight cosmological constraints that are complementary to methods from other astronomical events. We present a follow-up study of one recently-discovered strongly lensed SN, the quadruply-imaged Type Ia SN 2022qmx (aka, "SN Zwicky") at z = 0.3544. We measure updated, template-subtracted photometry for SN Zwicky and derive improved time delays and magnifications. This is possible because SNe are transient, fading away after reaching their peak brightness. Specifically, we measure point spread function (PSF) photometry for all four images of SN Zwicky in three Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/UVIS passbands (F475W, F625W, F814W) and one WFC3/IR passband (F160W), with template images taken $\sim 11$ months after the epoch in which the SN images appear. We find consistency to within $2\sigma$ between lens model predicted time delays ($\lesssim1$ day), and measured time delays with HST colors ($\lesssim2$ days), including the uncertainty from chromatic microlensing that may arise from stars in the lensing galaxy. The standardizable nature of SNe Ia allows us to estimate absolute magnifications for the four images, with images A and C being elevated in magnification compared to lens model predictions by about $6\sigma$ and $3\sigma$ respectively, confirming previous work. We show that millilensing or differential dust extinction is unable to explain these discrepancies and find evidence for the existence of microlensing in images A, C, and potentially D, that may contribute to the anomalous magnification.</description>

      <title>Fermi-LAT detection of the low-luminosity radio galaxy NGC 4278 during the LHAASO campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the high-energy properties of the compact symmetric object NGC 4278, recently associated with a TeV source by the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) collaboration. We conducted a dedicated analysis of a Fermi-LAT region around NGC 4278, limited to the LHAASO campaign conducted from March 2021 to October 2022. A statistically significant emission ($\mathrm{TS} = 29$) was revealed, spatially consistent with the radio position of NGC 4278 and the LHAASO source. The Fermi-LAT source is detected above $8\,\mathrm{GeV}$, exhibiting a hard spectrum ($\Gamma=1.3\pm0.3$) and a $\gamma$-ray luminosity of $\mathcal{L}_{&gt;100 \, \mathrm{MeV}} \simeq 4\times 10^{41} \, \mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$. A serendipitous Swift-XRT observation of NGC 4278 during the TeV campaign reveals the source in a high-state, with a flux $\mathcal{F}_{0.5-8\, \mathrm{keV}} = 5_{-2}^{+3} \times 10^{-12} \, \mathrm{erg \, s^{-1}\, cm^{-2}}$, compatible to the highest luminosity level observed in previous Chandra pointings. The high-energy spectral energy distribution of the source and the intense flux variation observed in the X-ray band support a jet origin for the observed radiation. We suggest that the significant enhancement of the high-energy flux observed during the LHAASO campaign is due to a transient, highly energetic perturbation in the jet. The detection of NGC 4278 at both high- and very high-energies opens new frontiers in studying particle acceleration processes. It reveals that even compact, low-power radio galaxies, not just bright blazars, can exceed the sensitivity thresholds of GeV and TeV instruments, becoming promising targets for the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO).</description>

      <title>Computational forms for binary particle interactions at different levels of anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle interactions are key elements of many dynamical systems. In the context of systems described by a Boltzmann equation, such interactions may be described by a collision integral, a multidimensional integral over the momentum-phase space of the interaction. This integral is often simplified by assuming isotropic particle distributions; however, such an assumption places constraints on the dynamics of the system. This paper presents computational forms of the collision integral for relativistic, binary interactions at three levels of anisotropy, including a novel form in the isotropic case. All these forms are split into two parts, an absorption and an emission spectrum, which may be pre-calculated via numerical integration for simulation purposes. We demonstrate the use of these forms by comparison with the analytically integrated, isotropic emission spectrum of electron-positron annihilation, which are shown to agree to numerical precision. The emission spectrum is then further extended to axisymmetric particle distributions, where two-dimensional spectral maps can be generated to provide new insight.</description>

      <title>Eruptive mass-loss less than a year before the explosion of superluminous supernovae: I. The cases of SN 2020xga and SN 2022xgc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN2020xga and SN2022xgc, two hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) at $z = 0.4296$ and $z = 0.3103$ respectively, that show an additional set of broad Mg II absorption lines, blueshifted by a few thousand km s$^{-1}$ with respect to the host galaxy absorption system. Previous work interpreted this as due to resonance line scattering of the SLSN continuum by rapidly expanding CSM expelled shortly before the explosion. The peak rest-frame $g$-band magnitude of SN2020xga is $-22.30 \pm 0.04$ mag and of SN2022xgc is $-21.97 \pm 0.05$ mag, placing them among the brightest SLSNe-I. We use high-quality spectra from ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths to model the Mg II line profiles and infer the properties of the CSM shells. We find that the CSM shell of SN2020xga resides at $\sim 1.3 \times 10^{16} \rm cm$ moving with a maximum velocity of $4275~\rm km~s^{-1}$, and the shell of SN2022xgc is located at $\sim 0.8 \times 10^{16} \rm cm$ reaching up to $4400~\rm km~s^{-1}$. These shells were expelled $\sim 11$ and $\sim 5$ months before explosion for SN2020xga and SN2022xgc respectively, possibly as a result of Luminous Blue Variable-like eruptions or pulsational pair instability (PPI) mass loss. We also analyze optical photometric data and model the light curves considering powering from the magnetar spin-down mechanism. The results support very energetic magnetars, approaching the mass-shedding limit, powering these SNe with ejecta masses of $\sim 7-9 \rm~M_\odot$. The ejecta masses inferred from the magnetar modeling are not consistent with the PPI scenario pointing towards stars $&gt; 50~\rm M_\odot$ He-core, hence alternative scenarios such as fallback accretion are discussed.</description>

      <title>BASS XLI: the correlation between Mid-infrared emission lines and Active Galactic Nuclei emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the Spitzer spectra of 140 active galactic nuclei (AGN) detected in the hard X-rays (14-195 keV) by the Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) on board Swift. This sample allows us to probe several orders of magnitude in black hole masses ($10^6-10^9 M_{\odot}$), Eddington ratios ($10^{-3}-1$), X-ray luminosities ($10^{42}-10^{45}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$), and X-ray column densities ($10^{20}-10^{24}\rm\,cm^{-2}$). The AGN emission is expected to be the dominant source of ionizing photons with energies $\gtrsim50$ eV, and therefore high-ionization mid-infrared (MIR) emission lines such as [Ne V] 14.32, 24.32 $\mu$m and [O IV] 25.89 $\mu$m are predicted to be good proxies of AGN activity, and robust against obscuration effects. We find high detection rates ($\gtrsim85-90$ per cent) for the mid-infrared coronal emission lines in our AGN sample. The luminosities of these lines are correlated with the 14-150 keV luminosity (with a typical scatter of $\sigma \sim 0.4-0.5$ dex), strongly indicating that the mid-infrared coronal line emission is driven by AGN activity. Interestingly, we find that the coronal lines are more tightly correlated to the bolometric luminosity ($\sigma \sim 0.2-0.3$ dex), calculated from careful analysis of the spectral energy distribution, than to the X-ray luminosity. We find that the relationship between the coronal line strengths and $L_{14-150\rm\,keV}$ is independent of black hole mass, Eddington ratio and X-ray column density. This confirms that the mid-infrared coronal lines can be used as unbiased tracers of the AGN power for X-ray luminosities in the $10^{42}-10^{45}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$ range.</description>

      <title>Characteristics of Powerful Radio Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mature radio galaxies such as M87 belong to a specific subclass of active galaxies (AGN) whose evolution in time endows them with five distinguishing characteristics, including (1) low excitation emission, (2) low star formation rates, (3) high bulge stellar-velocity dispersion, (4) bright stellar nuclei, and (5) weak or nonexistent merger signatures. We show how to understand these seemingly disparate characteristics as originating from the time evolution of powerful radio quasars and describe a new model prediction that tilted accretion disks in AGN are expected to occur in bright quasars but not in other subclasses of AGN. The picture we present should be understood as the most compelling evidence for counter-rotation as a key element in feedback from accreting black holes.</description>

      <title>A unified scenario to understand the long-term spectral variation for the bright Fermi-LAT blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze the $\sim 16$ yr Fermi-LAT data of a sample of blazars consisting of 29 flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) and 27 BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs), exhibiting their spectral behavior based on the monthly binned photon index. We find that almost all of the FSRQs ($\sim 90\%$) display a harder-when-brighter (HWB) trend, while the majority of BL Lacs ($\sim 63\%$) exhibit a softer-when-brighter (SWB) trend. The BL Lacs with prominent HWB behavior mainly are low synchrotron peak (LSP, $\nu_p^s&lt;10^{14}$ Hz) targets. Additionally, we observe that, as the variability index increases, the variation trend changes from the SWB to the HWB continuously. We name such correlation the gamma-ray variability sequence of blazars. This sequence could be explained by the multi-zone (two-component) scenario.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Type Ib/c origin of the supernova remnant G292.0+1.8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circumstellar material (CSM) produced by mass loss from massive stars ($\gtrsim10 M_{\odot}$) through strong stellar winds or binary stripping provides rich information for understanding progenitors of core-collapse supernova remnants. In this paper we present a grating spectroscopy of a Galactic SNR G292.0+1.8, which is claimed to be a Type Ib/c remnant in a binary system according to recent studies. If G292.0+1.8 was experienced a strong mass-loss via binary interactions before its explosion, an oxygen-rich material produced in the He-burning layer is expected to be observed in the central belt-like structure formed by shock-heated CSM. Using the Reflection Grating Spectrometer onboard XMM-Newton, we detect N VII Ly$\alpha$ line (0.50 keV) for the first time in G292.0+1.8 and find that the abundance ratio of nitrogen to oxygen is significantly lower (N/O$=0.5\pm0.1$) than the solar value. This low N/O suggests that the progenitor of experienced strong mass-loss and ended up to a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star exposing the He-burning layer at the pre-supernova. Comparing our result and the evolution models of single stars and binaries, we conclude that the progenitor of G292.0+1.8 experienced strong mass-loss enough to occur a Type Ib/c supernova. Our finding is another crucial piece of evidence for a stripped-envelope supernova such as Type Ib/c as the origin of G292.0+1.8.</description>

      <title>Slim disk modeling reveals an accreting intermediate-mass black hole in the luminous fast blue optical transient AT2018cow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the most luminous subclass of the fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs) is still unknown. We present an X-ray spectral analysis of AT2018cow-the LFBOT archetype-using NuSTAR, Swift, and XMM-Newton data. The source spectrum can be explained by the presence of a slim accretion disk, and we find that the mass accretion rate decreases to sub-Eddington levels &gt;~ 200 days after the source's discovery. Applying our slim disk model to data obtained at multiple observational epochs, we constrain the mass of the central compact object in AT2018cow to be log(M_BH/Msun)=2.4+0.6/-0.1 at the 68% confidence level. Our mass measurement is independent from, but consistent with, the results from previously employed methods. The mass constraint is consistent with both the tidal disruption and the black hole-star merger scenarios, if the latter model can be extrapolated to the measured black hole mass. Our work provides evidence for an accreting intermediate-mass black hole (10^2--10^6 Msun) as the central engine in AT2018cow, and, by extension, in LFBOT sources similar to AT2018cow.</description>

      <title>Red giant - jet collisions in galactic nuclei I: 3D hydrodynamical model of a few stellar orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several models have been proposed to explain missing red giants (RGs) near the Galactic centre. Recently, a scenario has been suggested that predicts, among other processes, a long-term ablation of the surface layers of RGs during their repetitive passages through the Galactic jet (Zaja\v{c}ek et al., 2020). In this study, we perform detailed three-dimensional numerical modelling of this phenomenon. We calculate the ablation rate of the surface layers of a RG orbiting the supermassive black hole (SMBH) as it passes through the nuclear jet. In particular, we model the jet-star interaction for approximately 10 passages for the closer orbital distance of $10^{-3}\,\text{pc}$ and 2 passages for $10^{-2}\,\text{pc}$. We find that the mass loss due to ablation by the jet behaves with time as $\Delta M_{\star}\propto \sqrt{t}$ and the total ablated mass during a single active galactic nucleus (AGN) phase ($10^5$ years) is $\sim 10^4\,M_{\odot}$. We arrive at similar rates of the stellar ablation for the relatively smaller jet luminosity $10^{42}\,\text{erg}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ as in the previous analytical calculations. For larger jet luminosities of $10^{44}$ and $10^{48}\,\text{erg}\,\text{s}^{-1}$, the ablation rates inferred from $\sim 10$ interactions as well as extrapolated power-law fits are significantly lower than analytical values. For the smallest orbital distance of $10^{-3}\,\text{pc}$, we also track the thermal behaviour of the stellar surface layer, whose temperature appears to grow rapidly during the first 10 passages from $\sim 3600\,{\rm K}$ (spectral type M) to $\sim 8500\,{\rm K}$ (spectral type A). RG-jet interactions can thus lead to observable changes in the nuclear late-type stellar population.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray burst pulse structures and emission mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prompt phase X- and $\gamma$-ray light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) exhibit erratic and complex behaviour, often with multiple pulses. The temporal shape of individual pulses is often modelled as 'fast rise exponential decay' (FRED). Here, we introduce a novel fitting function to quantify pulse asymmetry. We conduct a light curve and a time-resolved spectral analysis on 61 pulses from 22 GRBs detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor. Contrary to previous claims, we find that only $\sim 50\%$ of pulse lightcurves in our sample show a FRED shape, while about $25\%$ have a symmetric lightcurve, and the other $25\%$ have a mixed shape. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a clear trend: in multi-pulse bursts, the initial pulse tends to exhibit the most symmetric light curve, while subsequent pulses become increasingly asymmetric, adopting a more FRED-like shape. Additionally, we correlate the temporal and spectral shapes of the pulses. By fitting the spectra with the classical "Band" function, we find a moderate positive Spearman correlation index of 0.23 between pulse asymmetry and the low-energy spectral index $\alpha_{\max}$ (the maximum value across all time bins covering an individual pulse). Thus, during GRB light curves, the pulses tend to get more asymmetric and spectrally softer with time. We interpret this as a transition in the dominant emission mechanism from photospheric (symmetric-like and hard) to non-thermal emission above the photosphere and show that this interpretation aligns with a GRB jet Lorentz factor of the order of a few 10s in many cases.</description>

      <title>GRB 240529A: A Tale of Two Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to the rapidly increasing time-domain facilities, we are entering a golden era of research on gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). In this Letter, we report our observations of GRB 240529A with the Burst Optical Observer and Transient Exploring System, the 1.5-meter telescope at Observatorio Sierra Nevada, the 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope of China, the Large Binocular Telescope, and the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. The prompt emission of GRB 240529A shows two comparable energetic episodes separated by a quiescence time of roughly 400 s. Combining all available data on the GRB Coordinates Network, we reveal the simultaneous apparent X-ray plateau and optical re-brightening around $10^3-10^4$ s after the burst. Rather than the energy injection from the magnetar as widely invoked for similar GRBs, the multi-wavelength emissions could be better explained as two shocks launched from the central engine separately. The optical peak time and our numerical modeling suggest that the initial bulk Lorentz factor of the later shock is roughly 50, which indicates that the later jet should be accretion-driven and have a higher mass loading than a typical one. The quiescence time between the two prompt emission episodes may be caused by the transition between different accretion states of a central magnetar or black hole, or the fall-back accretion process. A sample of similar bursts with multiple emission episodes in the prompt phase and sufficient follow-up could help to probe the underlying physics of GRB central engines.</description>

      <title>Constraining the origin of the nanohertz gravitational-wave background by pulsar timing array observations of both the background and individual supermassive binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational waves (GWs) from supermassive binary black holes (BBHs) are long sought by pulsar timing array experiments (PTAs), in the forms of both a stochastic GW background (GWB) and individual sources. The evidence for a GWB was reported recently by several PTAs with origins to be determined. Here we use a BBH population synthesis model to investigate the detection probability of individual BBHs by the Chinese PTA (CPTA) and the constraint on the GWB origin that may be obtained by PTA observations of both GWB and individual BBHs. If the detected GWB signal is entirely due to BBHs, a significantly positive redshift evolution ($\propto(1+z)^{2.07}$) of the mass scaling relation between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies is required. In this case, we find that the detection probability of individual BBHs is $\sim85\%$ or 64% if using a period of 3.4-year CPTA observation data, with an expectation of $\sim1.9$ or 1.0 BBHs detectable with a signal-to-noise ratio $\geq3$ or $5$, and it is expected to increase to $&gt;95\%$ if extending the observation period to $5$ years or longer. Even if the contribution from BBHs to the GWB power signal is as small as $\sim10\%$, a positive detection of individual BBHs can still be expected within an observation period of $\sim10$ years. A non-detection of individual BBHs within several years from now jointly with the detected GWB signal can put a strong constraint on the upper limit of the BBH contribution to the GWB signal and help identify/falsify a cosmological origin.</description>

      <title>Floating orbits and energy extraction from magnetized Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study electromagnetic radiation reaction on a charged particle around a weakly magnetized Kerr black hole. We solve numerically the Teukolsky equation to find energy fluxes in electromagnetic radiation at the horizon and at spatial infinity. We also employ analytical methods in the low-frequency limit, finding excellent agreement with the numerical results. For a wide range of parameters, energy fluxes on the horizon are negative for all orbital radii: the modes are amplified through superradiance. More interestingly, the flux on the horizon is larger (in absolute value) than the flux at infinity for orbits with orbital radius $r_0 \gtrsim 9M$ -- floating orbits are a generic outcome of having magnetic fields around black holes. Particles on these orbits extract energy from the BH through their radiation field; the net effect is an increase in the particles' kinetic energy, so that they outspiral to infinity. Although in realistic accretion disks viscous forces are expected to dominate, floating orbits remain an interesting feature of the existence of ergoregions in black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino fast flavor conversions. II. Solutions at the edge of instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In dense neutrino environments, such as provided by core-collapse supernovae or neutron-star mergers, neutrino angular distributions may be unstable to collective flavor conversions, whose outcome remains to be fully understood. These conversions are much faster than hydrodynamical scales, suggesting that self-consistent configurations may never be strongly unstable. With this motivation in mind, we study weakly unstable modes, i.e., those with small growth rates. We show that our newly developed dispersion relation (Paper~I of this series) allows for an expansion in powers of the small growth rate. For weakly unstable distributions, we show that the unstable modes must either move with subluminal phase velocity, or very close to the speed of light. The instability is fed from neutrinos moving resonantly with the waves, allowing us to derive explicit expressions for the growth rate. For axisymmetric distributions, often assumed in the literature, numerical examples show the accuracy of these expressions. We also note that for the often-studied one-dimensional systems one should not forget the axial-symmetry-breaking modes, and we provide explicit expressions for the range of wavenumbers that exhibit instabilities.</description>

      <title>Direct Collapse Accretion Disks Within Dark Matter Halos: Saturation of the Magneto-rotational Instability and the Field Expulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have used high-resolution zoom-in simulations of direct collapse to supermassive black hole (SMBH) seeds within dark mater (DM) halos in the presence of magnetic fields generated during the collapse, down to $10^{-5}$ pc or 2 AU. We confirm an efficient amplification of magnetic field during collapse, formation of geometrically-thick self-gravitating accretion disk inside 0.1 pc, and damping of fragmentation in the disk by the field. This disk differs profoundly from SMBH accretion disks. We find that (1) accretion disk is subject to the magneto-rotational instability which further amplifies the field to near-equipartition. No artificial seeding of the disk field has been used; (2) Equipartition toroidal field changes its polarity in the mid-plane; (3) The nonlinear Parker instability develops, accompanied by the vertical buckling of the field lines which injects material above the disk, leading to an increase in the disk scaleheight; (4) With the Coriolis force producing a coherent helicity above the disk, vertical poloidal field has been generated and amplified; (5) We estimate that the associated outflow will be most probably squashed by accretion. The resulting configuration consists of a magnetized disk with $\beta \geq 0.1$ and its magnetosphere with $\beta &lt;&lt; 1$, where $\beta = P_{\rm th}/P_{\rm B}$ is the ratio of thermal to magnetic energy density; (6) The disk is highly variable due to feeding by variable accretion flow, and strong vortical motions are present. (7) Finally, the negative gradient of the total vertical stress drives an equatorial outflow sandwiched by an inward accretion flow.</description>

      <title>The kinematic bimodality: Efficient feedback and cold gas deficiency in slow-rotating galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bimodality in the stellar spin of low redshift (massive) galaxies, ubiquitously existing at all star formation levels and in diverse environment, suggests that galaxies grow and quench through two diverged evolutionary pathways. For spheroid-dominated galaxies of slow stellar rotation, the age composition and metallicity of their stellar populations evidence a fast quenching history with significant gas outflows. In this work, we measure the spin parameter $\lambda_{R_{\rm e}}$, i.e. the normalized specific angular momentum of stars, out of the MaNGA integral field spectroscopy for about 10000 galaxies. Among the two thirds with HI follow-up observations ($z\lesssim0.05$), we find that, compared to fast-rotating galaxies of the same stellar mass and star formation, the galaxy population of slower rotation are generally more HI gas-poor, robust against further environmental restriction and with non-detections taken into proper account using stacking technique. This cold gas deficit of slow-rotating galaxies is most apparent at high mass $\sim10^{11}\mathcal{M}_{\odot}$ below the star formation main sequence, supporting the pivotal role of gas outflows in their quenching history. With hints from HI velocity distributions, we suspect that massive gas outflows among the slow-rotating population are facilitated by high ejective feedback efficiency, which is a result of extensive coupling between disturbed volume-filling cold gas and (commonly) biconical feedback from central black holes. By contrast, in fast-rotating disc galaxies the feedback energy mostly goes to the hot circumgalactic medium rather than directly impacts the dense and planar cold gas, thus making the feedback mainly preventive against further gas inflow.</description>

      <title>Millinovae: a new class of transient supersoft X-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some accreting binary systems containing a white dwarf (such as classical novae or persistent supersoft sources) are seen to emit low energy X-rays with temperatures of ~10^6 K and luminosities exceeding 10^35 erg/s. These X-rays are thought to originate from nuclear burning on the white dwarf surface, either caused by a thermonuclear runaway (classical novae) or a high mass accretion rate that sustains steady nuclear burning (persistent sources). The discovery of transient supersoft X-rays from ASASSN-16oh challenged these ideas, as no signatures of nuclear fusion were detected, and the origin of these X-rays remains controversial. It was unclear whether this star was one of a kind or representative of a larger, as yet undiscovered, group. Here we present the discovery of 29 stars located in the direction of the Magellanic Clouds exhibiting long-duration, symmetrical optical outbursts similar to that seen in ASASSN-16oh. We observed one of these objects during an optical outburst and found it to be emitting transient supersoft X-rays, while no signatures of mass ejection (indicative of a classical nova eruption) were detected. We therefore propose that these objects form a homogeneous group of transient supersoft X-ray sources, which we dub `millinovae' because their optical luminosities are approximately a thousand times fainter than those of ordinary classical novae.</description>

      <title>Electrification of a non-rotating black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zajacek et al made an interesting theoretical prediction on the electrification of a non-rotating black hole; if a non-rotating black hole is surrounded by plasma composed of protons and electrons, it will acquire electric charge due to the large difference of the inertial mass of a proton and that of an electron. Furthermore they revealed the effects of the electric charge of the black hole on the surrounding plasma. Since their results mainly rely on non-relativistic analyses, we study the same subject through relativistic analyses in this paper. By investigating a test particle in the Schwarzschild spacetime, we find that if initial velocities of protons and electrons far from a black hole follow the Maxwell distribution, the black hole can acquire electric charge whose value depends on the ratio of temperature of the proton and that of the electron. We also show that if the black hole acquires the electric charge, the radii of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) and the specific energy of a charged particle on ISCO can be very different from those of a neutral particle. In contrast to the result obtained by Zajacek et al, we find that the ISCO radii of a proton and an electron are necessarily larger than that of a neutral test particle as long as the black hole acquires the charge. The large ISCO radius might lead to a larger angular diameter of a black hole shadow and a different estimate of the released energy due to the accretion of plasma from the estimate based on the assumption of electric neutrality of the central black hole.</description>

      <title>Temporal Correlation between Positive-Charged Cosmic Ray Flux and Solar Magnetic Field Variation: Insights from Delayed Modulation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the time-dependent modulation of galactic cosmic rays near Earth, with a focus on the cosmic proton flux and solar magnetic field strength. Using data from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) and the Wilcox Solar Observatory, we identify a significant time-lagged relationship between the observation of two missions. Our model incorporates a weighted magnetic field parameter to address the hemispheric asymmetry in solar magnetic fields and captures the temporal evolution of cosmic-ray proton spectra in relation to solar activity. We find a time lag of approximately 10 months, varying with cosmic ray rigidity. At 1 GV, the time lag is 360 days, while it is 300 days above 3 GV. This offers predictive insights into cosmic ray modulation within the heliosphere. These results enhance the accuracy of space weather forecasting models, with significant implications for the safety of space missions and aviation.</description>

      <title>Convective vortices in collapsing stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies show that non-radial structures arising from massive star shell convection play an important role in shaping core-collapse supernova explosions. During the collapse phase, convective vortices generate acoustic waves that interact with the supernova shock. This amplifies turbulence in the post-shock region, contributing to explosion. We study how various physical parameters influence the evolution of these convective vortices during stellar collapse using simplified simulations. We model the collapsing star with a transonic Bondi flow and represent convection as solenoidal velocity perturbations. Our results are consistent with previous studies, demonstrating that the peak perturbation amplitude scales linearly with the pre-collapse convective Mach number and inversely with the angular wavenumber of convection. While the shell radius and width primarily determine the timescale of accretion, they have little impact on the peak perturbation amplitudes. Finally, we show that when the convective Mach number is below approximately 0.2, the dynamics remain within the linear regime.</description>

      <title>Eccentric extreme mass-ratio inspirals: A gateway to probe quantum gravity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine a loop quantum gravity (LQG) inspired rotating black hole, treating it as a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) in an extreme mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) system, where an inspiralling object exhibits eccentric motion around the SMBH. With the orbital dynamics, we derive analytical expressions for the rate of change of orbital energy and angular momentum, as well as orbital evolution, and subsequently generate the gravitational waveforms. To evaluate the difference between EMR waveforms emitted from the Kerr black hole and a spinning black hole in LQG, we compute the dephasing and mismatch using the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) observation. Our result indicates that LISA can distinguish the modified effect of LQG with a parameter as small as $2\times10^{-6}$. The constraint on a parameter in LQG using the Fisher information matrix can be obtained within a fraction error of $10^{-6}$.</description>

Abstract: The origin and acceleration of high-energy particles in space (cosmic rays), constitute important topics in modern astrophysics. Among the
  two categories of cosmic rays - galactic and solar cosmic rays - the latter are much less investigated. Primary source of solar cosmic ray particles are impulsive explosions of the magnetized plasma known as solar flares and coronal mass ejections. These particles are characterized by relatively low energies compared to their galactic counterparts. In this work, we explore resonance wave-wave (RWW) interaction between the polarized electromagnetic radiation emitted by the solar active region and the quantum waves associated with high-energy, relativistic electrons generated during solar flares. We find that RWW could accelerate the relativistic electrons to enormous energies even comparable to energies in the galactic cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>On relativistic dynamical tides: subtleties and calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response of astrophysical compact objects to external tidal fields carries valuable information on the nature of these objects, on the equation of state of matter, and on the underlying gravitational theory. In this work, we highlight subtleties in describing relativistic dynamical tidal responses that arise from ambiguities in the decomposition of a perturbed metric into external tidal and induced response pieces. Observables are unambiguous. However in practice, differences arising from implicit assumptions in the definition of tidal deformabilities may lead to a bias in constraining nuclear physics or gravitational theories, if not properly tied to observational data. We propose calibration of a tidal response function for any compact objects in vacuum General Relativity. Within this framework, the dynamical tidal Love numbers of a Schwarzschild black hole in both even and odd sectors vanish at any multipole order. The calibration allows one to define dynamical tidal deformabilities of relativistic stars, such as neutron stars, as the difference from the BH values (zero) under the unified definition in a simple manner. As a straightforward extension of our framework, we compute the next-to-leading dissipative tidal response of Schwarzschild black holes for the first time.</description>

      <title>Sky location of Massive Black Hole Binaries in the foreground of Galactic white dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For space-based gravitational wave (GW) detection, the main noise source for massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) is attributed to approximately $10^7$ double white dwarf binaries in the foreground. For a GW source, the amplitude of the detector response, recorded by a space-based gravitational wave detector, exhibits a modulation effect with a year period when observing the source from various orbital positions. Under the adverse conditions mentioned above, where there is a strong foreground noise and annual modulation in the signals, we employed the wavelet transform and the strong-amplitude relevant orbital position search methods, which allows the weak MBHB sources to achieve higher locating accuracy. In detail, for two MBHB sources of lower intensity, the precision of luminosity distance, represented by the ratio $\Delta D_L / D_L$ at the 95$\%$ confidence level, is enhanced by factors of $\sim$ 2. And the angular resolutions, denoted by $\Delta \Omega_s$, are enhanced by a factor of $\sim$ 20. These improvements increase the number of detectable GW sources, facilitates multi-messenger follow-up observations and provides constraints on the cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>A Novel Optimal Transport-Based Approach for Interpolating Spectral Time Series: Paving the Way for Photometric Classification of Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for creating spectral time series, which can be used for generating synthetic light curves for photometric classification but also for applications like K-corrections and bolometric corrections. This approach is particularly valuable in the era of large astronomical surveys, where it can significantly enhance the analysis and understanding of an increasing number of SNe, even in the absence of extensive spectroscopic data. methods: By employing interpolations based on optimal transport theory, starting from a spectroscopic sequence, we derive weighted average spectra with high cadence. The weights incorporate an uncertainty factor for penalizing interpolations between spectra that show significant epoch differences and lead to a poor match between the synthetic and observed photometry. results: Our analysis reveals that even with phase difference of up to 40 days between pairs of spectra, optical transport can generate interpolated spectral time series that closely resemble the original ones. Synthetic photometry extracted from these spectral time series aligns well with observed photometry. The best results are achieved in the V band, with relative residuals of less than 10% for 87% and 84% of the data for type Ia and II, respectively. For the B, g, R and r bands, the relative residuals are between 65% and 87% within the previously mentioned 10% threshold for both classes. The worse results correspond to the i and I bands where, in the case, of SN~Ia the values drop to 53% and 42%, respectively. conclusions: We introduce a new method for constructing spectral time series for individual SNe starting from a sparse spectroscopic sequence, and demonstrate its capability to produce reliable light curves that can be used for photometric classification.</description>

      <title>Pathfinding pulsar observations with the CVN incorporating the FAST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The importance of Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) for pulsar research is becoming increasingly prominent and receiving more and more attention. In this paper, we present pathfinding pulsar observation results with the Chinese VLBI Network (CVN) incorporating the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). On MJD 60045 (April 11th, 2023), PSRs B0919+06 and B1133+16 were observed with the phase-referencing mode in the L-band using four radio telescopes (FAST, TianMa, Haoping and Nanshan) and correlated with the pulsar binning mode of the distributed FX-style software correlator in Shanghai. After further data processing with the NRAO Astronomical Image Processing System (AIPS), we detected these two pulsars and fitted their current positions with accuracy at the milliarcsecond level. By comparison, our results show significantly better agreement with predicted values based on historical VLBI observations than that with previous timing observations, as pulsar astrometry with the VLBI provides a more direct and model-independent method for accurately obtaining related parameters.</description>

      <title>The Environments of Fast Radio Bursts Viewed Using Adaptive Optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01578v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present GeMS/GSAOI observations of five fast radio burst (FRB) host galaxies with sub-arcsecond localizations. We examine and quantify their spatial distributions and locations with respect to their host galaxy light distributions, finding a median host-normalized offset of 2.09 r_e and in fainter regions of the host. When combined with the FRB sample from Mannings et al. (2021), we find that FRBs are statistically distinct from Ca-rich transients in terms of light and from SGRBs and LGRBs in terms of host-normalized offset. We further find that most FRBs are in regions of elevated local stellar mass surface densities in comparison to the mean global values of their hosts. This, in combination with the combined FRB sample trace the distribution of stellar mass, points towards a possible similarity of the environments of CC-SNe and FRBs. We also find that 4/5 FRB hosts exhibit distinct spiral arm features, and the bursts originating from such hosts tend to appear on or close to the spiral structure of their hosts, with a median distance of 0.53 kpc. With many well-localized FRB detections looming on the horizon, we will be able to better characterize the properties of FRB environments relative to their host galaxies and other transient classes.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative study of quantum many-body correlation effects in neutron stars: Equation of state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although neutron stars have been studied for decades, their internal structure remains enigmatic, mainly due to large uncertainties in the equation of state. In neutron stars, the nucleons are strongly interacting by exchanging mesons, which can lead to significant quantum many-body correlation effects. Mean-field calculations failed to capture these effects. Here, we develop a nonperturbative quantum field-theoretic approach to handle strongly correlated dense nuclear matter within the framework of quantum hadrodynamics. We show that the many-body effects can be incorporated in the Dyson-Schwinger equation of the nucleon propagator. Based on a linear $\sigma$-$\omega$-$\rho$ model, we successfully reproduce six empirical observable quantities of saturation nuclear matter by tuning six parameters. After including the many-body effects into the equation of state of realistic neutron star matter, we obtain a mass-radius relation that is comparable with recent astrophysical observations of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Structure and Dynamics of Magneto-Inertial, Differentially Rotating Laboratory Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed characterization of the structure and evolution of differentially rotating plasmas driven on the MAGPIE pulsed-power generator (1.4 MA peak current, 240 ns rise-time). The experiments were designed to simulate physics relevant to accretion discs and jets on laboratory scales. A cylindrical aluminium wire array Z pinch enclosed by return posts with an overall azimuthal off-set angle was driven to produce ablation plasma flows that propagate inwards in a slightly off-radial trajectory, injecting mass, angular momentum, and confining ram pressure to a rotating plasma column on the axis. However, the plasma is free to expand axially, forming a collimated, differentially rotating axial jet that propagates at $\approx 100$ km/s. The density profile of the jet corresponds to a dense shell surrounding a low-density core, which is consistent with the centrifugal barrier effect being sustained along the jet's propagation. We show analytically that, as the rotating plasma accretes mass, conservation of mass and momentum implies plasma radial growth scaling as $r \propto t^{1/3}$. As the characteristic moment of inertia increases, the rotation velocity is predicted to decrease and settle on a characteristic value $\approx 20$ km/s. We find that both predictions are in agreement with Thomson scattering and optical self-emission imaging measurements.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes-shadow correspondence for rotating regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eikonal quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes (BHs) and parameters of null geodesics, ultimately tied to the appearance of BHs to external observers, are known to be related, and the eikonal QNM-BH shadow radii correspondence has been extensively studied for spherically symmetric BHs. The extension to rotating BHs is non-trivial, and has been worked out only for equatorial ($m=\pm\ell$) QNMs, or for general modes but limited to the Kerr metric. We extend the QNM-shadow radius correspondence to more general rotating space-times, and argue that the requirements for it to hold amount to conditions on the separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for null geodesics and the Klein-Gordon equation. Metrics obtained by the Newman-Janis algorithm enjoy these conditions, provided certain mathematical requirements are imposed on the line element. We explicitly verify the correspondence for the rotating Bardeen and Hayward regular BHs, both of which satisfy the separability requirements. Our findings show that the QNM-shadow radius correspondence holds for a wide range of axisymmetric space-times beyond Kerr. This paves the way to potential strong-field multi-messenger tests of fundamental physics by hearing (via gravitational wave spectroscopy - the "thunder") and seeing (via VLBI imaging - the "lightning") BHs, although substantial improvements relative to the current observational sensitivity are required to make this possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the Universe's transparency to gamma rays within a Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) framework, focusing on photon subluminal quadratic corrections driven by a high-energy scale. Based on an explicit calculation, we provide a new expression for the cross section that overcomes the limitations of previous approaches and refines existing constraints for the LIV scale, while we introduce a new approximation that may be useful in LIV scenarios beyond effective field theory. These improvements appear essential for setting constraints on LIV effects with future observations at ultra-high energies, where previous approximations may fall short.</description>

      <title>Does Magnetic Reconnection Change Topology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13732v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that magnetic reconnection and topology-change can be understood, and distinguished, in terms of trajectories of Alfv\'enic wave-packets ${\bf x}(t)$ moving along the magnetic field ${\bf B(x}, t)$ with Alfv\'en velocity $\dot{\bf x}(t)={\bf V}_A({\bf x},t)$, i.e. adopting a Lagrangian formalism for virtual particles. A considerable simplification is attained, in fact, by directly employing elementary concepts from hydrodynamic turbulence without appealing to the fictitious and complicated notion of magnetic field lines moving through plasma. In incompressible flows, Alfv\'enic trajectories correspond to the dynamical system $\dot{\bf x}(t)={\bf B}$, where $\bf B$ solves the induction equation, with phase space $(\bf x,B)$. Metric topology of this phase space, at any time $t$, captures the intuitive notion that nearby wave-packets should remain nearby at a slightly different time $t\pm \delta t$, unless topology changes e.g., by dissipation. In fact, continuity conditions for magnetic field allow rapid but continuous divergence of these trajectories, i.e., reconnection, but not discontinuous divergence which would change magnetic topology. Thus topology can change only due to time-reversal symmetry breaking e.g., by dissipation or turbulence. In laminar and even chaotic flows, the separation of Alfv\'enic trajectories at all times remains proportional to their initial separation, i.e., slow reconnection, and topology changes by dissipation with a rate proportional to resistivity. In turbulence, trajectories diverge super-linearly with time independent of their initial separation, i.e., fast reconnection, and magnetic topology changes by turbulent diffusion with a rate independent of small-scale plasma effects. Our results strongly support the Lazarian-Vishniac model of stochastic reconnection and its reformulation by Eyink in terms of stochastic flux-freezing.</description>
