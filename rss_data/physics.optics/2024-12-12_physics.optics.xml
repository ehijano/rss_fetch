      <title>Gold diamond Nanocomposites Efficiently Generate Hydrated Electrons upon Absorption of Visible Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An efficient source of hydrated electrons generated by visible light has the potential to have a major impact on solar homogeneous catalysis. Diamond has potentially a high capability of emitting hydrated electrons, but only using ultraviolet light (lambda&lt;225 nm). In this work, we demonstrate the efficient absorption of visible light by nanocomposites consisting of detonation nanodiamonds and gold nanoparticles (AuNP@DNDs), which subsequently emit electrons into the aqueous environment in which they are suspended. This has been done by exciting the AuNP@DND with visible laser light and monitoring the appearance and intensity of the transient absorption of hydrated electrons centered at around 720 nm. We suggest that this mechanism is made possible by the plasmonic enhancement of visible absorption by sp2-hybridized islands on the DND surface. Optimization of this process could lead to important breakthroughs in solar photocatalysis of energy-intensive reactions such as N2 and CO2 reduction as well as providing a non-toxic source of hydrated electrons for applications in wastewater management and nanomedicine.</description>

      <title>Yellow diode-pumped lasing of femtosecond-laser-written Dy,Tb:LiLuF4 waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we report the fabrication of a diode-pumped Dy,Tb:LiLuF4 waveguide laser operating in the yellow region of the visible spectrum. The circular depressed-cladding waveguides have been fabricated by direct femtosecond laser writing, and showed propagation losses as low as 0.07 dB/cm. By employing these structures, we obtain a maximum output power of 86 mW at 574 nm from a 60 {\mu}m diameter waveguide, and a highest slope efficiency of 19% from a 80 {\mu}m diameter depressed cladding waveguide. In addition, we demonstrate lasing at 574 nm from a half-ring surface waveguide, with a maximum output power of 12 mW. Moreover, we also obtained dual wavelength operation at 568-574 nm, with a maximum output power of 15 mW, and stable lasing at 578 nm, with an output power of 100 mW. The latter wavelength corresponds to the main transition of the atomic clock based on the neutral ytterbium atom. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a yellow waveguide laser based on Dy-doped materials.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamics in circular and deformed bilayer graphene inspired billiards with anisotropy and strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While billiard systems of various shapes have been used as paradigmatic model systems in the fields of nonlinear dynamics and quantum chaos, few studies have investigated anisotropic billiards. Motivated by the tremendous advances in using and controlling electronic and optical mesoscopic systems with bilayer graphene representing an easily accessible anisotropic material for electrons when trigonal warping is present, we investigate billiards of various anisotropies and geometries using a trajectory tracing approach founded in the concept of ray-wave correspondence. We find that the presence of anisotropy can render the billiards' dynamics dramatically from its isotropic counterpart. It may induce chaotic and mixed dynamics in otherwise integrable systems, and may stabilize originally unstable trajectories. We characterize the dynamics of anisotropic billiards in real and phase space using Lyapunov exponents and the Poincar\'e surface of section as phase space representation.</description>

      <title>Analysis and extensions of the Multi-Layer Born method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating scalar wave propagation in strongly heterogeneous media comes at a steep computational cost, and the widely used approach to simplification - split-step operators - sacrifices accuracy. The recently proposed multi-layer Born method has sought to resolve that problem, but because it discards evanescent modes, also produces large errors. In this work our main goal is to propose solutions to this critical issue by including evanescent modes in the simulation. We work in a setting where backscattering can be neglected, allowing us to only calculate forward propagation, and derive two possible schemes. A rigorous mathematical analysis of the numerical errors shows one method is more accurate. This analysis is also helpful for choosing optimally the discretization parameters. In addition, we propose high order versions of the multi-layer Born method that offer a lower computational cost for a given tolerance.</description>

      <title>Photonic torons, topological phase transition and tunable spin monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creation and control of topological complex excitations play crucial roles in both fundamental physics and modern information science. Torons are a sophisticated class of 3D chiral polar topological structures with both skyrmionic quasiparticle textures and monopole point defects, so far only observed in liquid crystal nonpolar models. Here, we experimentally construct torons with the photonic spin of vector structured light and demonstrate the topological phase transitions among diverse topological states: torons, hopfions, skyrmioniums and monopole pairs. We can also continually tune the toron's chirality and the helical spin textures of emerging monopole pairs. The birth of photonic torons and tunable monopoles opens a flexible platform for studying nontrivial light-matter interaction and topological informatics.</description>

      <title>Frequency-resolved Transient Absorption Spectroscopy for High Pressure System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics of materials under high-pressure conditions has been an important focus of materials science, especially in the timescale of pico- and femto-second of electronic and vibrational motion, which is typically probed by ultrafast laser pulses. To probe such dynamics, it requires an integration of high-pressure devices with the ultrafast laser system. In this work, we construct a frequency-resolved high-pressure transient absorption spectroscopy system based on a diamond anvil cell (DAC) with transmissive detection. In this setup, we use the narrowband laser as the pump beam and the supercontinuum white light as the probe beam. To effectively eliminate the scattering noise from the pump light, we design a double-chopper operating mode, which allows us to obtain signals in the complete frequency domain including the overlap region with the pump pulse. And we test system with Rhodamine B solution with the probe wavelength range of 450-750 nm and the 550nm pump, and observe that the intensity of the signal peak corresponding to the monomer at 560 nm continuously decreased relative to the signal peak corresponding to the dimer at 530 nm. This indicates that the portion of Rhodamine B molecules in the dimer form increases under increasing pressure. Additionally, we find two dynamic components of the signal peaks for both monomer and dimer, and the short-lifetime component increases as the pressure is increased, and the long-lifetime component decreases.</description>

      <title>Sensitive optical coating defect detection via second harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical coating, an integral part of many optical systems, is prone to damage from environmental exposure and laser irradiation. This underscores the need for reliable and sensitive coating diagnostics. We introduce second harmonic generation (SHG) as a method for the sensitive detection of defects and inhomogeneities within optical thin films. We demonstrate the use of SHG on Si3N4 layers tested for their laser-induced damage threshold. The SHG mapping was compared with commonly used diagnostic techniques, including Nomarski microscopy, white light interferometry, and electron microscopy. Owing to its sensitivity to variations in local symmetry, SHG is able to discern minute alterations in material composition, mechanical stress, and interface structures. Therefore, SHG identified modifications in the tested layers, highly extending the damage recognized by standard methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate SHG's ability to enhance specific features by modulation of incidence angles and polarization modes. Based on these findings, we propose SHG as an ideal diagnostic tool for the early identification of laser-induced modifications in centrosymmetric thin films.</description>

      <title>Online training and pruning of photonic neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic neural networks (PNNs) have garnered significant interest due to their potential to offer low latency, high bandwidth, and energy efficiency in neuromorphic computing and machine learning. In PNNs, weights are photonic devices that make them susceptible to environmental factors and fabrication variations. These vulnerabilities can result in inaccurate parameter mapping, increased tuning power consumption, and reduced network performance when conventional offline training methods are used. Here, we experimentally demonstrate an online training and pruning method to address these challenges. By incorporating a power-related term into the conventional loss function, our approach minimizes the inference power budget. With this method, PNNs achieve 96% accuracy while reducing the power consumption by almost 45% on the Iris dataset, despite fabrication and thermal variations. Furthermore, our method is validated with a two-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) experiment for radio-frequency (RF) fingerprinting applications and simulations across larger CNNs on image classification datasets, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. This work represents a significant milestone in enabling adaptive online training of PNNs and showcases their potential for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory for nonlinear optical effects in the ultra-strong light-matter coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a microscopic quantum theory for nonlinear optical phenomena in semiconductor quantum well heterostructures operating in the regime of ultra-strong light matter coupling regime. This work extends the Power-Zienau-Wooley (PZW) formulation of quantum electrodynamics to account for nonlinear interactions based on a fully fermionic approach, without resorting to any bosonization approximation. It provides a unified description of the microcavity and the local field enhancement effects on the nonlinear optical response, thus encompassing the phenomena known as epsilon near zero (ENZ) effect. In particular, our theory describes the impact of the light-matter coupled states on the high frequency generation process, relevant for recent experimental investigations with polaritonic metasurfaces. We unveil the limitations of traditional single-particle approaches and propose novel design principles to optimize nonlinear conversion efficiencies in dense, microcavity-coupled electronic systems. The theoretical framework developed here provides an efficient tool for the development of advanced quantum optical applications in the mid-infrared and terahertz spectral domains. Furthermore, it establishes a foundation for exploring the quantum properties of the ultra-strong light-matter regime through frequency-converted polariton states.</description>

      <title>Optimal conditions for the generation of moderate-order harmonics of a short-wave field in an optically thin medium of helium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that under optimal conditions, the generation of the 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th harmonics of the short-wave laser field by helium atoms is mainly due to transitions between bound states, and the maximum energy of the harmonics is achieved under conditions of their resonant mul-tiphoton excitation. In this case, the optima for the generation of the 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th har-monics of the field correspond to three-, four-, five-, and six-photon resonances, and the optimal value of the peak field intensity, depending on the harmonic order, varies from 2.5*10^14 W/cm^2 to 1.2*10^15 W/cm^2. The total probability of excitation and ionization of an atom at the end of a laser pulse under appropriate conditions exceeds 1/2. With such intensity and not-too-high fre-quency of the laser field, the Stark effect turns out to be very significant, which allows it to be tuned into resonance with an arbitrary excited state of the atom by changing the intensity of the field without changing its frequency. It is shown that for the laser field parameters maximizing the energy of the Nth harmonic, N from 3 to 9, this harmonic dominates in the dipole acceleration spectrum. At the same time, the amplitudes of the remaining harmonics increase as the harmonic order approaches N. In particular, under the conditions maximizing the yield of the 9th harmon-ic, the harmonic amplitudes increase when moving from the 3rd harmonic to the 5th and then to the 7th and 9th harmonics. At the same time, under the conditions maximizing the yield of the 3rd harmonic, its amplitude in the dipole acceleration spectrum exceeds not only the amplitudes of the other harmonics, but also the amplitude of the atomic response at the frequency of the driving field.</description>

      <title>Induced eccentricity splitting in disordered optical microspheres for machine learning enabled wavemeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of light wavelength is critical for applications in spectroscopy, optical communication, and semiconductor manufacturing, ensuring precision and consistency of sensing, high-speed data transmission and device production. Emerging reconstructive wavemeters synergize physical systems capable for pseudo-random wavelength dependent pattern formation with computational techniques to offer a promising alternative against established methods such as frequency beating and inteferometry for high-resolution and broadband measurements in compact and cost-effective devices. In this paper, we propose a novel type of compact and affordable reconstructive wavemeter based on the disordered chip with thousands of high quality-factor whispering gallery mode microcavities as physical model and a hybrid machine learning approach utilizing boosting methods and variational autoencoders implemented as wavelength interpreter. We leverage eccentricity mode splitting obtained via controllable deformation of the spherical microresonators in order to ensure the uniqueness of the wavelength patterns up to ultra-wide (~100 nm) spectral window while guaranteeing high (~100 fm) intrinsic sensitivity. The latter allocates the proposed model right next to the ultimate reconstructive wavemeters based on integrating spheres, but with superior miniaturization options and chip-scale integrability.</description>

      <title>Revealing hidden bioimaging information by isotropic depolarization filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an imaging method to enhance and reveal structures within samples by using a polarization-based filter. This filter removes the isotropic content while amplifying the anisotropic component of depolarization. Whereas isotropic depolarization leads to a complete loss of polarimetric information, the anisotropic one is connected with intrinsic characteristics of samples. The filter has the capability to diminish the isotropic depolarization of samples, revealing their inherent information. As representative cases, we analyze the effect of the filter in heart and brain sections of animal origin. Results highlight the outstanding performance of the filter. In heart, myocardial and subendocardial structures are better visualized, whereas in the brain, fiber tracts are identified. These proves the significance of this filter in the medical field, paving the way to the early detection of pathologies. The methodologies here presented could be applied in a wide range of applications, providing a significant advance in polarization imaging where high isotropic depolarization response is present, this being a common scenario in nature.</description>

      <title>Optical super-torque induced by Mie-resonant modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of resonant optical torque that allows enhancing substantially a transfer of optical angular momentum (AM) of light to a subwavelength particle. We consider high-index cylindrical dielectric nanoparticles supporting Mie resonances, and explore a transfer of AM and how it is affected by absorption and particle shape. We analyse a simple trapping geometry of standing wave patterns created by opposite helical light waves. We uncover stable rotation of particles in both nodes and anti-nodes, and also study how specific particle properties influence the resonant optical torque. We demonstrate that adjusting particle losses can maximize spinning torque, and we predict "super-torque" originating from the superabsorption effect at resonances. Our study offers a deeper understanding of the physics of resonant optical torque and its importance in manipulating AM transfer in optical systems, with promising implications for various fields and inspiring further research in resonant light-matter interactions.</description>

      <title>On-demand Quick Metasurface Design with Neighborhood Attention Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are reshaping traditional optical paradigms and are increasingly required in complex applications that demand substantial computational resources to numerically solve Maxwell's equations-particularly for large-scale systems, inhomogeneous media, and densely packed metadevices. Conventional forward design using electromagnetic solvers is based on specific approximations, which may not effectively address complex problems. In contrast, existing inverse design methods are a stepwise process that is often time-consuming and involves repetitive computations. Here, we present an inverse design approach utilizing a surrogate Neighborhood Attention Transformer, MetaE-former, to predict the performance of metasurfaces with ultrafast speed and high accuracy. This method achieves global solutions for hundreds of nanostructures simultaneously, providing up to a 250,000-fold speedup compared with solving for individual meta-atoms based on the FDTD method. As examples, we demonstrate a binarized high-numerical-aperture (about 1.31) metalens and several optimized structured-light meta-generators. Our method significantly improves the beam shaping adaptability with metasurfaces and paves the way for fast designing of large-scale metadevices for shaping extreme light fields with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Apollon Real-Time Adaptive Optics (ARTAO) -- Astronomy-Inspired Wavefront Stabilization in Ultraintense Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional wavefront control in high-energy, high-intensity laser systems usually lacks real-time capability, failing to address dynamic aberrations. This limits experimental accuracy due to shot-to-shot fluctuations and necessitates long cool-down phases to mitigate thermal effects, particularly as higher repetition rates become essential, e.g. in Inertial Fusion research. This paper details the development and implementation of a real-time capable adaptive optics system at the Apollon laser facility. Inspired by astronomical adaptive optics, the system uses a fiber-coupled 905 nm laser diode as a pilot beam that allows for spectral separation, bypassing the constraints of pulsed lasers. A GPU-based controller, built on the open-source CACAO framework, manages a loop comprising a bimorph deformable mirror and high-speed Shack-Hartmann sensor. Initial tests showed excellent stability and effective aberration correction. However, integration into the Apollon laser revealed critical challenges unique to the laser environment that must be resolved to ensure safe operation with amplified shots.</description>

      <title>Enhancement and speed-up of carrier dynamics in a dielectric nanocavity with deep sub-wavelength confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of dielectric bowtie cavities enable optical confinement with ultrahigh quality factor and ultra-small optical mode volumes with perspectives for enhanced light-matter interaction. Experimental work has so far emphasized the realization of these nanocavities. Here, we experimentally investigate the ultrafast dynamics of a topology-optimized dielectric (silicon) bowtie nanocavity, with device dimensions down to 12 nm, that localizes light to a mode volume deep below the so-called diffraction limit given by the half-wavelength cubed. This strong spatial light concentration is shown to significantly enhance the carrier generation rate through two-photon absorption, as well as reducing the time it takes for the carriers to recover. A diffusion time below 1 ps is achieved for the bowtie cavity, which is more than an order of magnitude smaller than for a conventional microcavity. Additionally, parametric effects due to coherent interactions between pump and probe signals are also enhanced in the bowtie cavity, leading to an improved extinction ratio. These results demonstrate important fundamental advantages of dielectric bowtie cavities compared to conventional point-defect cavities, laying a foundation for novel low-power and ultrafast optical devices, including switches and modulators.</description>

      <title>Coherent frequency combs from electrons colliding with a laser pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly coherent and powerful light sources capable of generating frequency combs in the soft x-ray domain are essential for advancing high precision measurements and conducting rigorous tests of fundamental physics. In this work, we derive the analytical conditions required for the emission of coherent radiation, including coherent frequency combs, from an electron beam colliding with a laser pulse, modeled as a plane wave. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this scheme can produce a coherent soft x-ray frequency comb, provided the electron beam is sufficiently monoenergetic and electrons in the beam are regularly spaced. Furthermore, we highlight the advantageous role of employing few-cycle laser pulses in relaxing the stringent monoenergeticity requirements for coherent emission. The conditions derived here can also be used to optimize coherent emission from electron beam-laser interactions in other frequency ranges, such as the terahertz domain.</description>

      <title>Silicon photonic MEMS switches based on split waveguide crossings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.17366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous push for high-performance photonic switches is one of the most crucial premises for the sustainable scaling of programmable and reconfigurable photonic circuits for a wide spectrum of applications. Conventional optical switches rely on the perturbative mechanisms of mode coupling or mode interference, resulting in inherent bottlenecks in their switching performance concerning size, power consumption and bandwidth. Here we propose and realize a silicon photonic 2x2 elementary switch based on a split waveguide crossing (SWX) consisting of two halves. The propagation direction of the incident light is manipulated to implement the OFF/ON states by splitting/combining the two halves of the SWX, showing excellent performance with low excess loss and low crosstalk over an ultrawide bandwidth. Both elementary switch and a 64x64 switch array based on Benes topology are fabricated and characterized, demonstrating great potential for practical scenarios such as photonic interconnect/routing, Lidar and spectroscopy, photonic computing, as well as microwave photonics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08558v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical information processing and computing can potentially offer enhanced performance, scalability and energy efficiency. However, achieving nonlinearity-a critical component of computation-remains challenging in the optical domain. Here we introduce a design that leverages a multiple-scattering cavity to passively induce optical nonlinear random mapping with a continuous-wave laser at a low power. Each scattering event effectively mixes information from different areas of a spatial light modulator, resulting in a highly nonlinear mapping between the input data and output pattern. We demonstrate that our design retains vital information even when the readout dimensionality is reduced, thereby enabling optical data compression. This capability allows our optical platforms to offer efficient optical information processing solutions across applications. We demonstrate our design's efficacy across tasks, including classification, image reconstruction, keypoint detection and object detection, all of which are achieved through optical data compression combined with a digital decoder. In particular, high performance at extreme compression ratios is observed in real-time pedestrian detection. Our findings open pathways for novel algorithms and unconventional architectural designs for optical computing.</description>

      <title>Map Optical Properties to Subwavelength Structures Directly via a Diffusion Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05959v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subwavelength photonic structures and metamaterials provide revolutionary approaches for controlling light. The inverse design methods proposed for these subwavelength structures are vital to the development of new photonic devices. However, most of the existing inverse design methods cannot realize direct mapping from optical properties to photonic structures but instead rely on forward simulation methods to perform iterative optimization. In this work, we exploit the powerful generative abilities of artificial intelligence (AI) and propose a practical inverse design method based on latent diffusion models. Our method maps directly the optical properties to structures without the requirement of forward simulation and iterative optimization. Here, the given optical properties can work as "prompts" and guide the constructed model to correctly "draw" the required photonic structures. Experiments show that our direct mapping-based inverse design method can generate subwavelength photonic structures at high fidelity while following the given optical properties. This may change the method used for optical design and greatly accelerate the research on new photonic devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electromagnetic fields of the hybrid modes of an optical fiber are reformulated using bi-complex mathematics, which leads to simpler expressions relative to those found using the widely used, conventional complex formulation. Generalized expressions for the electromagnetic fields are also found using both formulations for comparative purposes. Furthermore, the feasibility of bi-complex mathematics is investigated for the derivation of the modal powers, orthogonality relations, and the weakly-guided fiber approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid metals (LM) are emerging plasmonic nanomaterials with transformable surface plasmon resonances (SPR) due to their liquid-like deformability. This study delves into the plasmonic properties of LM nanoparticles, with a focus on EGaIn (eutectic gallium-indium)-based materials. Leveraging Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations, we explored the localized SPR (LSPR) effects of EGaIn nanoparticles with various shapes, including nanospheres, dimers, nanorods, nanodisks, nanoellipses, nanocubes, and nanocuboids, in the broad range of ultraviolet (UV)-visible-near infrared (NIR) spectrum. EGaIn, known for its unique properties such as low toxicity, negligible vapor pressure, and excellent electrical and thermal conductivity, is appealing in broad wavelength plasmonic applications. In particular, this study reveals uncovered LSPR effects in the visible and NIR wavelength ranges, providing a comprehensive map of LSPR peaks and cross-sections for different shapes of EGaIn nanoparticles. The findings offer insights into correlating EGaIn nanoparticle geometry with their optical properties for diverse applications, ranging from biosensing, nanoelectronics, to optomechanical systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current wireless communication systems are increasingly constrained by insufficient bandwidth and limited power output, impeding the achievement of ultra-high-speed data transmission. The terahertz (THz) range offers greater bandwidth, but it also imposes higher requirements on broadband and high-power devices. In this work, we present a modified uni-traveling-carrier photodiode (MUTC-PD) module with WR-6 waveguide output for photonics-assisted fiber-THz integrated wireless communications. Through the optimization of the epitaxial structure and high-impedance coplanar waveguide (CPW), the fabricated 6-um-diameter MUTC-PD achieves a high output power of -0.96 dBm at 150 GHz and ultra-flat frequency response at D-band. The MUTC-PD is subsequently packaged into a compact WR-6 module, incorporating planar-circuit-based RF-choke, DC-block and probe. The packaged PD module demonstrates high saturation power and flat frequency responses with minimal power roll-off of only 2 dB over 110-170 GHz. By incorporating the PD module into a fiber-THz integrated communication system, high data rates of up to 160 Gbps with 16 quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) and a maximum symbol transmission rate of 60 Gbaud with QPSK modulation are successfully secured. The demonstration verifies the potential of the PD module for ultra-broadband and ultra-high-speed THz communications, setting a foundation for future research in high-speed data transmission.</description>

      <title>Optimizing for a Near Single-Mode Type-0 Optical Parametric Amplifier in Nanophotonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has recently emerged as a promising platform for integrated nonlinear photonics, enabling the use of optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) for applications in quantum information processing, precision metrology, and ultrafast optical signal processing. However, OPA waveguide designs have not yet achieved the phase-matching conditions for type-0 operation in a single spectro-temporal mode, limiting their use. We optimize the waveguide dimensions, poling pattern, pump wavelength, and pump pulse duration for high spectral purity, a metric for single-mode fidelity. We numerically demonstrate a nanophotonic OPA with a spectral purity of 0.982 in a TFLN waveguide. Through semi-classical simulations, we further demonstrate that in the optical parametric regime, where vacuum fluctuations at the input of the OPA can saturate the gain and deplete the pump, the macroscopic output of such a single-mode OPA can be utilized for an ultra-fast quantum random number generator. These results demonstrate a promising direction for integrated OPAs in a wide range of ultrafast quantum nanophotonics applications.</description>

      <title>All-optical polarization control and routing by nonlinear interferometry at the nanoscale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces are rapidly establishing as key-enabling platforms for nanophotonics applications. Along with the ability of taming light in subwavelength thicknesses, they can feature multiple functionalities in one device. The generation and control of light polarization by metasurfaces already provided a route towards ultracompact polarimetry devices in the linear regime. If translated to the nonlinear optical regime it may become a key-enabling tool in nonlinear imaging, optical holography and sensing. Here, we report the experimental ultrafast all-optical polarization modulation of upconverted light by all-dielectric metasurfaces via nonlinear interferometry. By controlling the relative phase between a pump beam at $\omega$ and its frequency-double replica at 2$\omega$, we can set the phase relation between two frequency-degenerate upconverted processes at 3$\omega$ $-$ Sum-Frequency Generation (SFG) and Third-Harmonic Generation (THG) $-$ stemming from an AlGaAs metasurface. By exploiting the opposite parity of the two nonlinear process and tuning their relative powers, we can achieve modulation of the polarization states of the light emitted at 3$\omega$ between linear and circular states with a degree of circular polarization (DOCP) up to 83$\%$. In particular, circularly polarized light features opposite handedness symmetrically located in the Fourier space, at coincidence with the first diffraction orders of the metasurface. Moreover, by toggling the phase delay by $\pi$, the handedness can be fully switched between the diffraction. Our work adds an additional layer of modulation in polarization beyond intensity to all-optical routing with precise phase control. The capability to route circular polarization states in the k-space holds significant potential for chiral sensing and advanced imaging techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Taking N2 and O2 as examples, we theoretically study the post-ionization dynamics of molecules in strong laser fields using a density matrix method for open systems, focusing on the effect of ionization-produced coherence on the dynamics of residual ions. We introduce the adiabatic strong-field approximation (ASFA) method to predict the coherences between ionic states resulting from multiorbital strong-field ionizations. Compared with the standard SFA, the ASFA method can be applied across a wide range of laser intensities due to the consideration of orbital distortion effects. Based on the ASFA, it is found that there are obvious coherences between ionic states in residual molecular ions. These coherences significantly influence the transitions between ionic states, which finally change the post-ionization dynamics of molecular ions. Our findings reveal the importance of the ionization-produced coherences in modulating post-ionization molecular dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Doped semiconductors can exhibit metallic-like properties ranging from superconductivity to tunable localized surface plasmon resonances. Diamond is a wide-bandgap semiconductor that is rendered electronically active by incorporating a hole dopant, boron. While the effects of boron doping on the electronic band structure of diamond are well-studied, any link between charge carriers and plasmons, has never been shown. Here, we report intervalence plasmons in boron-doped diamond, defined as collective electronic excitations between the valence subbands, opened up by the presence of holes. Evidence for these low-energy excitations is provided by valence electron energy loss spectroscopy and near-field infrared spectroscopy. The measured spectra are subsequently reproduced by first-principles calculations based on the contribution of intervalence band transitions to the dielectric function. Our calculations also reveal that the real part of the dielectric function exhibits a crossover characteristic of metallicity. These results suggest a new mechanism for inducing plasmon-like behavior in doped semiconductors, and the possibility of attaining such properties in diamond, a key emerging material for quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Optical Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill Qubit Generation via Approximate Squeezed Coherent State Superposition Breeding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) qubits, known for their exceptional error-correction capabilities, are highly coveted in quantum computing. However, generating optical GKP qubits has been a significant challenge. Measurement based methods, where a portion of entangled squeezed vacuum modes are measured with photon number resolving detectors heralding a desired state in the undetected modes, have emerged as leading candidates for optical GKP qubit generation due their minimal resource requirements. While the current measurement based methods can produce high quality GKP qubits, they suffer from low success probabilities limiting experimental realization. The heart of the problem lies in the duality of photon number resolving measurements, being both the source of nonlinearity needed to generate quality GKP qubits and the component driving down their probability of successful production. Our method, breeding approximate squeezed coherent state superpositions created by generalized photon subtraction, overcomes this problem by supplementing two photon number resolving measurements with a single high success probability homodyne measurement. This scheme achieves success probabilities $\geq 10^{-5}$, two orders of magnitude higher than strictly photon number resolving measurement based methods, while still producing states with high-fidelity, possessing error-correction capabilities equivalent to up to a 10 dB squeezed GKP qubit. This breakthrough significantly advances the practical use of the optical GKP qubit encoding.</description>

Abstract: We show topologically ordered states in the complex-valued spectra of non-Hermitian systems. These arise when the distinctive exceptional points in the energy Riemann surfaces of such models are annihilated after threading them across the boundary of the Brillouin zone. This process results in a non-trivially closed branch cut that can be identified with a Fermi arc. Building on an analogy to Kitaev's toric code, these cut lines form non-contractible loops, which parallel the defect lines of the toric-code ground states. Their presence or absence establishes topological order for fully non-degenerate non-Hermitian systems. Excitations above these ground-state analogs are characterized by the occurrence of additional exceptional points. We illustrate the characteristics of the topologically protected states in a non-Hermitian two-band model and provide an outlook toward experimental realizations in metasurfaces and single-photon interferometry.</description>

      <title>Atomic-optical interferometry in fractured loops: a general solution for Rydberg radio frequency receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of novel radio frequency atomic receivers brings attention to the theoretical description of atom-light interactions in sophisticated, multilevel schemes. Of special interest, are the schemes where several interaction paths interfere with each other, bringing about the phase-sensitive measurement of detected radio fields. In the theoretical modeling of those cases, the common assumptions are often insufficient to determine the boundary detection parameters, such as receiving bandwidth or saturation point, critical for practical considerations of atomic sensing technology. This evokes the resurfacing of a long-standing problem on how to describe an atom-light interaction in a fractured loop. In such a case, the quantum steady state is not achieved even with constant, continuous interactions. Here we propose a method for modeling of such a system, basing our approach on the Fourier expansion of a non-equilibrium steady state. The proposed solution is both numerically effective and able to predict edge cases, such as saturation. Furthermore, as an example, we employ this method to provide a complete description of a Rydberg superheterodyne receiver, obtaining the boundary parameters describing the operation of this atomic detector.</description>
