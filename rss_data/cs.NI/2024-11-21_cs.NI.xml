      <title>GenAI Assistance for Deep Reinforcement Learning-based VNF Placement and SFC Provisioning in 5G Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtualization technology, Network Function Virtualization (NFV), gives flexibility to communication and 5G core network technologies for dynamic and efficient resource allocation while reducing the cost and dependability of the physical infrastructure. In the NFV context, Service Function Chain (SFC) refers to the ordered arrangement of various Virtual Network Functions (VNFs). To provide an automated SFC provisioning algorithm that satisfies high demands of SFC requests having ultra-reliable and low latency communication (URLLC) requirements, in the literature, Artificial Intelligence (AI) modules and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms are investigated in detail. This research proposes a generative Variational Autoencoder (VAE) assisted advanced-DRL module for handling SFC requests in a dynamic environment where network configurations and request amounts can be changed. Using the hybrid approach, including generative VAE and DRL, the algorithm leverages several advantages, such as dimensionality reduction, better generalization on the VAE side, exploration, and trial-error learning from the DRL model. Results show that GenAI-assisted DRL surpasses the state-of-the-art model of DRL in SFC provisioning in terms of SFC acceptance ratio, E2E delay, and throughput maximization.</description>

      <title>Wireless Sensor Networks based on TSCH/TDMA with Power Consumption and Latency Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the main goals of wireless sensor networks is to permit the involved nodes to communicate with low energy budgets, as they are typically battery-powered. When such networks are employed in industrial scenarios, constraints about latency may have a significant role, too. The TSCH mechanism, and more in general TDMA schemes, rely on traffic scheduling, and consequently they can feature low power consumption and more predictable latency. Some recent proposals like PRIL-M enable further consistent energy savings, but unfortunately they cause at the same time a dramatic increase in latency. This work presents an extension of PRIL-M, we named PRIL-ML, that achieves a significantly shorter latency in exchange for a slight increase in power consumption. Its operating principles are first illustrated, then some approximate equations are provided for assessing analytically the improvements it achieves, starting from simulation results obtained for both standard TSCH and the original PRIL-M technique.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Trust-Based Enhancement for simultaneous transmission in AOMDV Routing Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses a trust-based enhancement to the Multipath Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector (AOMDV) routing protocol. While AODV and its multipath variant AOMDV have been fundamental in mobile ad hoc networks, they lack mechanisms to account for node reliability. A probabilistic link-trust model is proposed that incorporates factors such as past behavior, battery levels, and node coupling to distribute data optimally to reduce delay while simultaneously transmitting through multiple paths.</description>

      <title>Executable QR codes with Machine Learning for Industrial Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Executable QR codes, also known as eQR codes or just sQRy, are a special kind of QR codes that embed programs conceived to run on mobile devices like smartphones. Since the program is directly encoded in binary form within the QR code, it can be executed even when the reading device is not provided with Internet access. The applications of this technology are manifold, and range from smart user guides to advisory systems. The first programming language made available for eQR is QRtree, which enables the implementation of decision trees aimed, for example, at guiding the user in operating/maintaining a complex machinery or for reaching a specific location.
  In this work, an additional language is proposed, we term QRind, which was specifically devised for Industry. It permits to integrate distinct computational blocks into the QR code, e.g., machine learning models to enable predictive maintenance and algorithms to ease machinery usage. QRind permits the Industry 4.0/5.0 paradigms to be implemented, in part, also in those cases where Internet is unavailable.</description>

      <title>Eco-Friendly 0G Networks: Unlocking the Power of Backscatter Communications for a Greener Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backscatter Communication (BackCom) technology has emerged as a promising paradigm for the Green Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, offering advantages such as low power consumption, cost-effectiveness, and ease of deployment. While traditional BackCom systems, such as RFID technology, have found widespread applications, the advent of ambient backscatter presents new opportunities for expanding applications and enhancing capabilities. Moreover, ongoing standardization efforts are actively focusing on BackCom technologies, positioning them as a potential solution to meet the near-zero power consumption and massive connectivity requirements of next-generation wireless systems. 0G networks have the potential to provide advanced solutions by leveraging BackCom technology to deliver ultra-low-power, ubiquitous connectivity for the expanding IoT ecosystem, supporting billions of devices with minimal energy consumption. This paper investigates the integration of BackCom and 0G networks to enhance the capabilities of traditional BackCom systems and enable Green IoT. We conduct an in-depth analysis of BackCom-enabled 0G networks, exploring their architecture and operational objectives, and also explore the Waste Factor (WF) metric for evaluating energy efficiency and minimizing energy waste within integrated systems. By examining both structural and operational aspects, we demonstrate how this synergy enhances the performance, scalability, and sustainability of next-generation wireless networks. Moreover, we highlight possible applications, open challenges, and future directions, offering valuable insights for guiding future research and practical implementations aimed at achieving large-scale, sustainable IoT deployments.</description>

      <title>Packet Steering Mechanisms for MLO in Wi-Fi 7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Besides extremely high throughput, Wi-Fi 7 is also aimed at providing users a more deterministic behavior, characterized by shorter average latency and smaller jitters. A key mechanism to achieve this is multi-link operation, which brings simultaneous multi-band communication to client stations as well. In this paper, traffic steering policies are briefly reviewed and grouped into general classes, each one with its advantages and limitations. A basic mechanism for supporting dynamic steering is then described, which is simple enough to allow implementation in real Wi-Fi chipsets but highly flexible at the same time. Its operation can be driven by the host on a per-packet basis, and this permits to optimize spectrum usage depending on the requirements of applications and the traffic pattern they generate.</description>

      <title>DRL-Based Optimization for AoI and Energy Consumption in C-V2X Enabled IoV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address communication latency issues, the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has defined Cellular-Vehicle to Everything (C-V2X) technology, which includes Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communication for direct vehicle-to-vehicle communication. However, this method requires vehicles to autonomously select communication resources based on the Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) protocol, which may lead to collisions due to different vehicles sharing the same communication resources, thereby affecting communication effectiveness. Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) is considered a potential solution for handling large-scale vehicle communication, as it can enhance the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) by employing Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC), thereby reducing the negative impact of communication collisions. When evaluating vehicle communication performance, traditional metrics such as reliability and transmission delay present certain contradictions. Introducing the new metric Age of Information (AoI) provides a more comprehensive evaluation of communication system. Additionally, to ensure service quality, user terminals need to possess high computational capabilities, which may lead to increased energy consumption, necessitating a trade-off between communication energy consumption and effectiveness. Given the complexity and dynamics of communication systems, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) serves as an intelligent learning method capable of learning optimal strategies in dynamic environments. Therefore, this paper analyzes the effects of multi-priority queues and NOMA on AoI in the C-V2X vehicular communication system and proposes an energy consumption and AoI optimization method based on DRL. Finally, through comparative simulations with baseline methods, the proposed approach demonstrates its advances in terms of energy consumption and AoI.</description>

      <title>IoT-Based Coma Patient Monitoring System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous monitoring of coma patients is essential but challenging, especially in developing countries with limited resources, staff, and infrastructure. This paper presents a low-cost IoT-based system designed for such environments. It uses affordable hardware and robust software to monitor patients without constant internet access or extensive medical personnel. The system employs cost-effective sensors to track vital signs, including heart rate, body temperature, blood pressure, eye movement, and body position. An energy-efficient microcontroller processes data locally, synchronizing with a central server when network access is available. A locally hosted app provides on-site access to patient data, while a GSM module sends immediate alerts for critical events, even in areas with limited cellular coverage. This solution emphasizes ease of deployment, minimal maintenance, and resilience to power and network disruptions. Using open-source software and widely available hardware, it offers a scalable, adaptable system for resource-limited settings. At under $30, the system is a sustainable, cost-effective solution for continuous patient monitoring, bridging the gap until more advanced healthcare infrastructure is available.</description>

      <title>Toward Multi-Layer Networking for Satellite Network Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellites aim to bring resilience, ubiquitous, and high-quality service to future Internet infrastructure. However, the soaring number of space assets, increasing dynamics of LEO satellites and expanding dimensions of network threats call for an enhanced approach to efficient satellite operations. To address these pressing challenges, we propose an approach for satellite network operations based on multi-layer satellite networking (MLSN), called "SatNetOps". Two SatNetOps schemes are proposed, referred to as LEO-LEO MLSN (LLM) and GEO-LEO MLSN (GLM). The performance of the proposed schemes is evaluated in 24-hr satellite scenarios with typical payload setups in simulations, where the key metrics such as latency and reliability are discussed with the consideration of the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) standard-compliant telemetry and telecommand missions. Although the SatNetOps approach is promising, we analyze the factors affecting the performance of the LLM and GLM schemes. The discussions on the results and conclusive remarks are made in the end.</description>
