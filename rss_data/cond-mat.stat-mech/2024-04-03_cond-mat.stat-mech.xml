      <title>Normal weak eigenstate thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has been shown to occur for few-body observables in a wide range of nonintegrable interacting models. For intensive observables that are sums of local operators, because of their polynomially vanishing Hilbert-Schmidt norm, weak eigenstate thermalization occurs in quadratic and integrable interacting systems. Here, we unveil a novel weak eigenstate thermalization phenomenon that occurs in quadratic models whose single-particle sector exhibits quantum chaos (quantum-chaotic quadratic models) and in integrable interacting models. In such models, we show that there are few-body observables with a nonvanishing Hilbert-Schmidt norm that are guarrantied to exhibit a polynomially vanishing variance of the diagonal matrix elements, a phenomenon we dub normal weak eigenstate thermalization. For quantum-chaotic quadratic Hamiltonians, we prove that normal weak eigenstate thermalization is a consequence of single-particle eigenstate thermalization, i.e., it can be viewed as a manifestation of quantum chaos at the single-particle level. We report numerical evidence of normal weak eigenstate thermalization for quantum-chaotic quadratic models such as the 3D Anderson model in the delocalized regime and the power-law random banded matrix model, as well as for the integrable interacting spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ XYZ and XXZ models.</description>

      <title>A spectral investigation of criticality and crossover effects in two and three dimensions: Short timescales with small systems in minute random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random matrix theory, particularly using matrices akin to the Wishart ensemble, has proven successful in elucidating the thermodynamic characteristics of critical behavior in spin systems across varying interaction ranges. This paper explores the applicability of such methods in investigating critical phenomena and the crossover to tricritical points within the Blume-Capel model. Through an analysis of eigenvalue mean, dispersion, and extrema statistics, we demonstrate the efficacy of these spectral techniques in characterizing critical points in both two and three dimensions. Crucially, we propose a significant modification to this spectral approach, which emerges as a versatile tool for studying critical phenomena. Unlike traditional methods that eschew diagonalization, our method excels in handling short timescales and small system sizes, widening the scope of inquiry into critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Revealing kinetically tuned atomic pathways for interfacial strain relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain at interfaces may profoundly impact the microstructure and properties of materials; thus, it is a major consideration when designing and engineering materials. Dislocation formation is a commonly known mechanism to release mismatch strain at solid-solid interfaces. However, it is still unclear about how materials accommodate interfacial strain under drastically accelerated structural transformation kinetics, since it is extremely challenging to directly observe the atomic structure evolution of fast-propagating interfaces. Utilizing liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (TEM), we have achieved atomic-scale imaging of hydrogen-induced phase transformations of palladium nanocrystals with different transformation speeds. Our observation reveals that the fast phase transformation occurs with an expanded interface of mixed $\alpha$- and $\beta$-$\mathrm{PdH}_x$ phases, and tilting of (020) planes to accommodate mismatch strain. In contrast, slow phase transformations lead to sharp interfaces with slipping misfit dislocations. Our kinetic Monte Carlo simulations show that fast phase transformation pushes the system far-from-equilibrium, generically roughening the interface; however, a smooth boundary minimizes strain near-equilibrium. Unveiling the atomic pathways of transformations from near-equilibrium to far-from-equilibrium, which was previously possible only computationally, this work holds significant implications for engineering microstructure of materials through modulating solid-solid transformations in a wide range of kinetics.</description>

      <title>Noninteracting particles in a harmonic trap with a stochastically driven center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a system of $N$ noninteracting particles on a line in the presence of a harmonic trap $U(x)=\mu \bigl[x-z(t)\bigr]^2/2$, where the trap center $z(t)$ undergoes a bounded stochastic modulation. We show that this stochastic modulation drives the system into a nonequilibrium stationary state, where the joint distribution of the positions of the particles is not factorizable. This indicates strong correlations between the positions of the particles that are not inbuilt, but rather get generated by the dynamics itself. Moreover, we show that the stationary joint distribution can be fully characterized and has a special conditionally independent and identically distributed (CIID) structure. This special structure allows us to compute several observables analytically even in such a strongly correlated system, for an arbitrary bounded drive $z(t)$. These observables include the average density profile, the correlations between particle positions, the order and gap statistics, as well as the full counting statistics. We then apply our general results to two specific examples where (i) $z(t)$ represents a dichotomous telegraphic noise, and (ii) $z(t)$ represents an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our analytical predictions are verified in numerical simulations, finding excellent agreement.</description>

      <title>A Dean-Kawasaki equation for reaction diffusion systems driven by Poisson noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a stochastic partial differential equation that describes the fluctuating behaviour of reaction-diffusion systems of N particles, undergoing Markovian, unary reactions. This generalises the work of Dean [J. Phys. A: Math. and Gen., 29 (24), L613, (1996)] through the inclusion of random Poisson fields. Our approach is based on weak interactions, which has the dual benefit that the resulting equations asymptotically converge (in the N to infinity limit) on a variation of a McKean- Vlasov diffusion, whilst still being related to the case of Dean-like strong interactions via a trivial rescaling. Various examples are presented, alongside a discussion of possible extensions to more complicated reaction schemes.</description>

      <title>Effect of constraint relaxation on dynamic critical phenomena in minimum vertex cover problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of constraint relaxation on dynamic critical phenomena in the Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) problem on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs are investigated using Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations. Following our previous work that revealed the reduction of the critical temperature by constraint relaxation based on the penalty function method, this study focuses on investigating the critical properties of the relaxation time along its phase boundary. It is found that the dynamical correlation function of MVC with respect to the problem size and the constraint strength follows a universal scaling function. The analysis shows that the relaxation time decreases as the constraints are relaxed. This decrease is more pronounced for the critical amplitude than for the critical exponent, and this result is interpreted in terms of the system's microscopic energy barriers due to the constraint relaxation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological environments at micrometer scales and below are often crowded, and experience incessant stochastic thermal fluctuations. The presence of membranes/pores, and multiple biological entities in a constricted space can make the damping/diffusion inhomogeneous. This effect of inhomogeneity is presented by the diffusion becoming coordinate-dependent. In this paper, we analyze the consequence of inhomogeneity-induced coordinate-dependent diffusion on Brownian systems in thermal equilibrium under the It\^o's interpretation. We argue that the presence of coordinate-dependent diffusion under It\^o's formulation gives rise to an effective diffusion potential that can have substantial contribution to system's transport. Alternatively, we relate this to the existence of an emergent force of entropic origin that dictates the transport near interfaces.</description>

      <title>Legendre Transformation under Micro Canonical Ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Legendre transformation is a crucial tool in theoretical physics, known for its symmetry, especially when applied to multivariate functions. In statistical mechanics, ensembles represent the central focus. Leveraging the dimensionless aspect of Legendre transformation, this paper explores the transformation process from the entropy characteristic function of microcanonical ensembles to the analogous definition of partition function transformation. Additionally, it derives characteristic functions, partition functions, and establishes their interrelations, along with deriving corresponding thermodynamic formulas for various ensembles. This streamlined approach sheds light on the fundamental principles of statistical mechanics and underscores the symmetry inherent in Legendre transformation.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of particle size separation in evaporating bi-dispersed colloidal droplets on hydrophilic substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.04759v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidal droplets are used in a variety of practical applications. Some of these applications require particles of different sizes. These include medical diagnostic methods, the creation of photonic crystals, the formation of supraparticles, and the production of membranes for biotechnology. A series of earlier experiments had shown the possibility of particle separation near the contact line, dependent upon their size. A mathematical model has been developed to describe this process. Bi-dispersed colloidal droplets evaporating on a hydrophilic substrate are taken into consideration. A particle monolayer is formed near the periphery of such droplets due to the small value of the contact angle. The shape of the resulting deposit is associated with the coffee ring effect. The model takes into account both particle diffusion and transfers caused by capillary flow due to liquid evaporation. Monte Carlo simulations of such particle dynamics have been performed at several values of particle concentration in the colloidal solution. The numerical results agree with the experimental observations, in which small particles accumulate nearer to the contact line than do the large particles. However, the particles do not actually reach the contact line, but accumulate at a small distance from it. The reason for this is the surface tension acting on the particles in areas where the thickness of the liquid layer is comparable to the particle size. Indeed, the same mechanism affects the observed separation of the small and large particles.</description>

      <title>Ground state properties of the Heisenberg-compass model on the square lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compass models provide insights into the properties of Mott-insulating materials that host bond-dependent anisotropic interactions between their pseudospin degrees of freedom. In this article, we explore the classical and quantum ground state properties of one such model relevant to certain layered perovskite materials akin to Ba$_2$IrO$_4$ - namely, the Heisenberg-compass model on the square lattice. We first investigate the ground state phase diagram of this model using classical Monte Carlo simulations. These reveal that the low temperature classical phase diagram is divided into six different classes of long-range ordered phases, including four phases that exhibit an order by disorder selection and two phases that are stabilized energetically. This model admits a special duality transformation, known as the Klein duality, conveniently allowing to map one region of coupling parameters onto another and constraining the phase diagram, and which we exploit in our study. From the analysis of the zero-point energy and the free energy of the spin waves, we find that order by quantum disorder at zero temperature and order by thermal disorder select the same orderings as those found from classical Monte Carlo simulations. We further investigate the quantum ground states of this model using numerical exact diagonalization on small clusters by exploiting the translational symmetry of the square lattice. We obtain a ground state phase diagram bearing close resemblance to that found from the classical analysis.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Resolution in non-Lorentzian Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the computation of Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy (SREE) for boosted intervals in a two dimensional Conformal Field Theory, we compute the same in various non-Lorentzian limits, viz, Galilean and Carrollian Conformal Field Theory in same number of dimensions. We approach the problem both from a limiting perspective and by using intrinsic symmetries of respective non-Lorentzian conformal algebras. In particular, we calculate the leading order terms, logarithmic terms, and the $\mathcal{O}(1)$ terms and explicitly show exact compliance with $\textit{equipartition of entanglement}$, even in the non-Lorentzian system. Keeping in mind the holographic origin of SREE for the Carrollian limit, we further compute SREE for BMS$_{3}$-Kac-Moody, which couples a $U(1)\times U(1)$ theory with bulk gravity.</description>

      <title>Agent-based Modelling of Quantum Prisoner's Dilemma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What happens when an infinite number of players play a quantum game? In this paper, we will answer this question by looking at the emergence of cooperation in the presence of noise in a one-shot quantum Prisoner's dilemma (QuPD). We will use the numerical Agent-based model (ABM) and compare it with the analytical Nash equilibrium mapping (NEM) technique. To measure cooperation, we consider five indicators, i.e., game magnetization, entanglement susceptibility, correlation, player's payoff average, and payoff capacity, respectively. In quantum social dilemmas, entanglement plays a non-trivial role in determining the players' behavior in the thermodynamic limit, and we consider the existence of bipartite entanglement between neighboring players. For the five indicators in question, we observe \textit{first}-order phase transitions at two entanglement values, and these phase transition points depend on the payoffs associated with the QuPD game. We numerically analyze and study the properties of both the \textit{Quantum} and the \textit{Defect} phases of the QuPD via the five indicators. The results of this paper demonstrate that both ABM and NEM, in conjunction with the chosen five indicators, provide insightful information on cooperative behavior in the thermodynamic limit of the one-shot quantum Prisoner's dilemma.</description>

      <title>A coarse-grained description of anharmonic lattice environments affecting the quantum dynamics of charge carriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice softness has a significant impact on charge carrier dynamics in condensed matter systems, contributing to the emergence of various properties and functions. Examples include the remarkable carrier lifetimes and defect tolerances of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. Recent studies suggest the contribution of quartic anharmonicity of the lattice vibrations. The quartic anharmonicity can be discussed with a double-well potential, and the transition between the two minima can be coarse-grained as a two-state jump stochastic process. Such a stochastic approach is typically employed to describe dynamic fluctuations introduced into a system by two-state transitions in the surroundings. To investigate charge transport in materials, however, it is crucial to describe not only the fluctuations but also the dynamic lattice distortion associated with charge transport. Therefore, there is a need for a theory to describe the charge carrier dynamics proceeding alongside the lattice distortion dynamics. In this study, we present a theory that describes quantum dynamics under the influence of an environment with two stable states, termed a bistable environment. The theory describes the effects of fluctuations and dissipation induced from the bistable environment in a reasonable manner, and the effects exhibit a different temperature dependence than the widely employed Gaussian environment. The physical implication of this temperature dependence is provided in terms of the environmental dynamics. The results of this study are expected to provide a step forward in describing charge carrier dynamics in materials with lattice softness and pronounced lattice anharmonicity, e.g., hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. Moreover, these findings represent an advancement in our understanding of and capacity to predict and control the physical properties and functions of these materials.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture concerning the Fisher--Widom line and the line of vanishing excess isothermal compressibility in simple fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the statistical mechanics approach to liquid-state theory, understanding the role of the intermolecular potential in determining thermodynamic and structural properties is crucial. The Fisher--Widom (FW) line, which separates regions in the temperature vs density plane where the decay of the total correlation function is monotonic or oscillatory, provides insights into the dominance of the attractive or repulsive part of the interactions. Stopper et al. have recently conjectured [J. Chem. Phys. \textbf{151}, 014501 (2019)] that the line of vanishing excess isothermal compressibility approximates the FW line in simple fluids. Here, we investigate this conjecture using the Jagla potential and also explore the line of vanishing excess pressure. We employ theoretical approximations and Monte Carlo simulations to study one-dimensional and three-dimensional systems. While exact results for the one-dimensional case do not support the conjecture, our Monte Carlo simulations for the three-dimensional fluid validate it. Our findings not only contribute to the understanding of the relationship between the three transition lines but also provide valuable insights into the thermodynamic and structural behaviour of simple fluids.</description>

      <title>Condensation in zero-range processes with a fast rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simple zero-range process with constant rates and one fast rate for a particular occupation number, which diverges with the system size. Surprisingly, this minor modification induces a condensation transition in the thermodynamic limit, where the structure of the condensed phase depends on the scaling of the fast rate. We study this transition and its dependence on system parameters in detail on a rigorous level using size-biased sampling. This approach generalizes to any particle system with stationary product measures, and the techniques used in this paper provide a foundation for a more systematic understanding of condensing models with a non-trivial condensed phase.</description>

Abstract: Far-from equilibrium molecular templating networks, like those that maintain the populations of RNA and protein molecules in the cell, are key biological motifs. These networks share the general property that assembled products are produced and degraded via complex pathways controlled by catalysts, including molecular templates. Although it has been suggested that the information propagated from templates to products sets a lower bound on the thermodynamic cost of these networks, this bound has not been explored rigorously to date. We show that, for an arbitrarily catalytic reaction network in steady state, the specificity with which a single product can dominate the ensemble is upper bounded, and the entropy of the product ensemble lower bounded, by a function of $\Delta G$, the difference between the maximal and minimal free-energy changes along pathways to assembly. These simple bounds are particularly restrictive for systems with a smaller number of possible products $M$. Remarkably, however, although $\Delta G$ constrains the information propagated to the product distribution, the systems that saturate the bound operate in a pseudo-equilibrium fashion, and there is no minimal entropy production rate for maintaining this non-equilibrium distribution. Moreover, for large systems, a vanishingly small subset of the possible products can dominate the product ensemble even for small values of $\Delta G/\ln M$.</description>

      <title>Subconductance states in a semimicroscopic model for a tetrameric pore</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A physical model for a structured tetrameric pore is studied. The pore is modeled as a device composed of four subunits, each one exhibiting two possible states (open and closed). The pore is located within a membrane that separates two reservoirs with ionic solutions. All variables of the model follow physical dynamical equations accounting for the internal structure of the pore, derived from a single energy functional and supplemented with thermal noises. An extensive study of the resulting ionic intensity is performed for different values of the control parameters, mainly membrane potential and reservoir ion concentrations. Two possible physical devices are studied: voltage-gated (including a voltage sensor in each subunit) and non-voltage-gated pores. The ionic flux through the pore exhibits several distinct dynamical configurations, in particular subconductance states, which indicate very different dynamical internal states of the subunits. Such subconductance states become much easier to observe in sensorless pores. These results are compared with available experimental data on tetrameric K channels and analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Inferring nonequilibrium thermodynamics from tilted equilibrium using information-geometric Legendre transform</title>

Abstract: Nonstationary thermodynamic quantities depend on the full details of nonstationary probability distributions, making them difficult to measure directly in experiments and numerics. We propose a method to infer thermodynamic quantities in relaxation processes by measuring only a few observables, using additional information obtained from measurements in tilted equilibrium, i.e., equilibrium with external fields applied. Our method is applicable to arbitrary classical stochastic systems, possibly underdamped, that relax to equilibrium. The method allows us to compute the exact value of the minimum entropy production (EP) compatible with the nonstationary observations, giving a tight lower bound on the true EP. Under a certain additional condition, it also allows the inference of the EP rate, thermodynamic forces, and a constraint on relaxation paths. Our method uses a Legendre transform of EP at the level of probability distributions, which we develop based on a similar Legendre transform in information geometry.</description>

      <title>Loss of memory of an elastic line on its way to limit cycles</title>

Abstract: Under an oscillating mechanical drive, an amorphous material progressively forgets its initial configuration and might eventually converge to a limit cycle. Beyond quasistatic drivings, how structurally disordered systems lose or record such memory remains theoretically challenging. Here we investigate these issues in a minimal model system -- with quenched disorder and memory encoded in a spatial pattern -- where the oscillating protocol can formally be replaced by finite positive-velocity driving. We consider an elastic line driven at zero temperature in a fixed disordered landscape, with bi-periodic boundary conditions and tunable system size. This setting allows us to control the area swept by the line at each cycle in a given disorder realisation, as would the amplitude of an oscillating drive. We find that the line converges to disorder-dependent limit cycles, jointly for its geometrical \emph{and} velocity profiles. Moreover, the way it forgets its initial condition is strongly coupled to the nature of the velocity dynamics it displays depending on system size. We conclude on the implications of these results for the response of amorphous materials under \emph{non}-quasistatic oscillating protocols.</description>

      <title>Field theory for the dynamics of the open $O(N)$ model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A field theory approach for the nonequilibrium relaxation dynamics in open systems at late times is developed. In the absence of conservation laws, all excitations are subject to dissipation. Nevertheless, ordered stationary states satisfy Goldstone's theorem. It implies a vanishing damping rate at small momenta, which in turn allows for competition between environment-induced dissipation and thermalization due to collisions. We derive the dynamic theory in the symmetry-broken phase of an $O(N)$-symmetric field theory based on an expansion of the two-particle irreducible (2PI) effective action to next-to-leading order in $1/N$ and highlight the analogies and differences to the corresponding theory for closed systems. A central result of this approach is the systematic derivation of an \emph{open-system Boltzmann equation}, which takes a very different form from its closed-system counterpart due to the absence of well-defined quasiparticles. As a consequence of the general structure of its derivation, it applies to open, gapless field theories that satisfy certain testable conditions, which we identify here. Specifically for the $O(N)$ model, we use scaling analysis and numerical simulations to show that interactions are screened efficiently at small momenta and, therefore, the late-time evolution is effectively collisionless. This implies that fluctuations induced by a quench dissipate into the environment before they thermalize. Goldstone's theorem also constrains the dynamics far from equilibrium, which is used to show that the order parameter equilibrates more quickly for quenches preserving the $O(N)$ symmetry than those breaking it explicitly.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, various notions of dynamical phase transitions have emerged to describe far-from-equilibrium criticality. A unifying framework connecting these different concepts is still missing, and would provide significant progress towards understanding far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body universality. Initializing our system in a thermal ensemble and subsequently performing quantum quenches in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, we establish a direct connection between excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) and two major types of dynamical phase transitions (DPTs), by relating the phases of the latter to the critical energies and conservation laws in the former. Our work provides further insight into how various concepts of non-ground-state criticality are intimately connected, paving the way for a unified framework of far-from-equilibrium universality.</description>

      <title>Proof of the nonintegrability of the PXP model and general spin-$1/2$ systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for proving non-integrability of the quantum systems. For spin-$1/2$ systems, we show that the presence or absence of the local conserved quantity can be shown using the graph theoretical analysis. This approach helps to systematically classify the number of local conserved quantity, as aiding the proof of non-integrability of the Hamiltonian. Using this approach, we prove for the first time that the PXP model is nonintegrable. We also show that our method is applicable to the well-known proof of the non-integrability of other spin-$1/2$ systems. Our new approach offers a significant simplification of the proof of non-integrability and provides a deeper understanding of quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>From logarithmic delocalization of the six-vertex height function under sloped boundary conditions to weakened crossing probability estimates for the Ashkin-Teller, generalized random-cluster, and $(q_{\sigma},q_{\tau})$-cubic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To obtain Russo-Seymour-Welsh estimates for the height function of the six-vertex model under sloped boundary conditions, which can be leveraged to demonstrate that the height function logarithmically delocalizes under a broader class of boundary conditions, we formulate crossing probability estimates in strips of the square lattice and the cylinder, for parameters satisfying $a\equiv b$, $c \in [1,2]$, and $\mathrm{max} \{ a , b \} \leq c$, in which each of the first two conditions respectively relate to invariance under vertical and diagonal reflections enforced through the symmetry $\sigma \xi \geq -\xi$ for domains in strips of the square lattice, and satisfaction of FKG, for the height function and for its absolute value. To determine whether arguments for estimating crossing probabilities of the height function for flat boundary conditions from a recent work due to Duminil-Copin, Karila, Manolescu, and Oulamara remain applicable for sloped boundary conditions, from the set of possible slopes given by the interior of the set of rational points from $[-1,1] \times [-1,1]$, we analyze sloped Gibbs states, which do not have infinitely many disjointly oriented circuits. In comparison to Russo-Seymour-Welsh arguments for flat boundary conditions, arguments for sloped boundary conditions present additional complications for both planar and cylindrical settings, in which crossing events that are considered in the strip, and then extended to the annulus and cylinder, must be maintained across rectangles of large aspect ratio, in spite of the fact that some proportion of faces within the strip freeze with positive probability.</description>

      <title>Are fermionic quantum critical systems more entangled?</title>

Abstract: We study the entanglement between disjoint subregions in quantum critical systems through the lens of the logarithmic negativity. We work with systems in arbitrary dimensions, including conformal field theories and their corresponding lattice Hamiltonians, as well as resonating valence-bond states. At small separations, the logarithmic negativity is big and displays universal behaviour, but we show non-perturbatively that it decays faster than any power at large separations. This can already be seen in the minimal setting of single-spin subregions. The corresponding absence of distillable entanglement at large separations generalises the 1d result, and indicates that quantum critical groundstates do not possess long-range bipartite entanglement, at least for bosons. For systems with fermions, a more suitable definition of the logarithmic negativity exists that takes into account fermion parity, and we show that it decays algebraically. Along the way we obtain general results for the moments of the partially-transposed density matrix.</description>

      <title>Deconfinement Dynamics of Fractons in Tilted Bose-Hubbard Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fractonic constraints can lead to exotic properties of quantum many-body systems. Here, we investigate the dynamics of fracton excitations on top of the ground states of a one-dimensional, dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model. We show that nearby fractons undergo a collective motion mediated by exchanging virtual dipole excitations, which provides a powerful dynamical tool to characterize the underlying ground state phases. We find that in the gapped Mott insulating phase, fractons are confined to each other as motion requires the exchange of massive dipoles. When crossing the phase transition into a gapless Luttinger liquid of dipoles, fractons deconfine. Their transient deconfinement dynamics scales diffusively and exhibits strong but subleading contributions described by a quantum Lifshitz model. We examine prospects for the experimental realization in tilted Bose-Hubbard chains by numerically simulating the adiabatic state preparation and subsequent time evolution, and find clear signatures of the low-energy fracton dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a fundamentally non-local correlation between particles. In its simplest realisation, a measurement on one particle is affected by a prior measurement on its partner, irrespective of their separation. For multiple particles, purely collective types of entanglement exist but their detection, even theoretically, remains an outstanding open question. Here, we show that all forms of multi-party entanglement entirely disappear during the typical evolution of a system as it heats up, evolves in time, or as its parts become separated. These results follow from the nature of the entanglement-free continent in the space of physical states, and hold in great generality. We illustrate these phenomena with a frustrated molecular quantum magnet in and out of equilibrium. In contrast, if the particles are fermions, such as electrons, another notion of entanglement exists that precludes entanglement-free regions, and thus protects quantum correlations. These findings provide fundamental knowledge about the structure of entanglement in quantum matter and architectures, paving the way for its manipulation.</description>
