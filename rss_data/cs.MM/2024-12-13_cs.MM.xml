      <title>Enhancing Modality Representation and Alignment for Multimodal Cold-start Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training multimodal models requires a large amount of labeled data. Active learning (AL) aim to reduce labeling costs. Most AL methods employ warm-start approaches, which rely on sufficient labeled data to train a well-calibrated model that can assess the uncertainty and diversity of unlabeled data. However, when assembling a dataset, labeled data are often scarce initially, leading to a cold-start problem. Additionally, most AL methods seldom address multimodal data, highlighting a research gap in this field. Our research addresses these issues by developing a two-stage method for Multi-Modal Cold-Start Active Learning (MMCSAL).
  Firstly, we observe the modality gap, a significant distance between the centroids of representations from different modalities, when only using cross-modal pairing information as self-supervision signals. This modality gap affects data selection process, as we calculate both uni-modal and cross-modal distances. To address this, we introduce uni-modal prototypes to bridge the modality gap. Secondly, conventional AL methods often falter in multimodal scenarios where alignment between modalities is overlooked. Therefore, we propose enhancing cross-modal alignment through regularization, thereby improving the quality of selected multimodal data pairs in AL. Finally, our experiments demonstrate MMCSAL's efficacy in selecting multimodal data pairs across three multimodal datasets.</description>

      <title>Towards Open-Vocabulary Video Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic segmentation in videos has been a focal point of recent research. However, existing models encounter challenges when faced with unfamiliar categories. To address this, we introduce the Open Vocabulary Video Semantic Segmentation (OV-VSS) task, designed to accurately segment every pixel across a wide range of open-vocabulary categories, including those that are novel or previously unexplored. To enhance OV-VSS performance, we propose a robust baseline, OV2VSS, which integrates a spatial-temporal fusion module, allowing the model to utilize temporal relationships across consecutive frames. Additionally, we incorporate a random frame enhancement module, broadening the model's understanding of semantic context throughout the entire video sequence. Our approach also includes video text encoding, which strengthens the model's capability to interpret textual information within the video context. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets such as VSPW and Cityscapes highlight OV-VSS's zero-shot generalization capabilities, especially in handling novel categories. The results validate OV2VSS's effectiveness, demonstrating improved performance in semantic segmentation tasks across diverse video datasets.</description>

      <title>Video Seal: Open and Efficient Video Watermarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content and sophisticated video editing tools has made it both important and challenging to moderate digital platforms. Video watermarking addresses these challenges by embedding imperceptible signals into videos, allowing for identification. However, the rare open tools and methods often fall short on efficiency, robustness, and flexibility. To reduce these gaps, this paper introduces Video Seal, a comprehensive framework for neural video watermarking and a competitive open-sourced model. Our approach jointly trains an embedder and an extractor, while ensuring the watermark robustness by applying transformations in-between, e.g., video codecs. This training is multistage and includes image pre-training, hybrid post-training and extractor fine-tuning. We also introduce temporal watermark propagation, a technique to convert any image watermarking model to an efficient video watermarking model without the need to watermark every high-resolution frame. We present experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in terms of speed, imperceptibility, and robustness. Video Seal achieves higher robustness compared to strong baselines especially under challenging distortions combining geometric transformations and video compression. Additionally, we provide new insights such as the impact of video compression during training, and how to compare methods operating on different payloads. Contributions in this work - including the codebase, models, and a public demo - are open-sourced under permissive licenses to foster further research and development in the field.</description>

      <title>Reversing the Damage: A QP-Aware Transformer-Diffusion Approach for 8K Video Restoration under Codec Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce DiQP; a novel Transformer-Diffusion model for restoring 8K video quality degraded by codec compression. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first to consider restoring the artifacts introduced by various codecs (AV1, HEVC) by Denoising Diffusion without considering additional noise. This approach allows us to model the complex, non-Gaussian nature of compression artifacts, effectively learning to reverse the degradation. Our architecture combines the power of Transformers to capture long-range dependencies with an enhanced windowed mechanism that preserves spatiotemporal context within groups of pixels across frames. To further enhance restoration, the model incorporates auxiliary "Look Ahead" and "Look Around" modules, providing both future and surrounding frame information to aid in reconstructing fine details and enhancing overall visual quality. Extensive experiments on different datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly for high-resolution videos such as 4K and 8K, showcasing its effectiveness in restoring perceptually pleasing videos from highly compressed sources.</description>

      <title>EmoDubber: Towards High Quality and Emotion Controllable Movie Dubbing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a piece of text, a video clip, and a reference audio, the movie dubbing task aims to generate speech that aligns with the video while cloning the desired voice. The existing methods have two primary deficiencies: (1) They struggle to simultaneously hold audio-visual sync and achieve clear pronunciation; (2) They lack the capacity to express user-defined emotions. To address these problems, we propose EmoDubber, an emotion-controllable dubbing architecture that allows users to specify emotion type and emotional intensity while satisfying high-quality lip sync and pronunciation. Specifically, we first design Lip-related Prosody Aligning (LPA), which focuses on learning the inherent consistency between lip motion and prosody variation by duration level contrastive learning to incorporate reasonable alignment. Then, we design Pronunciation Enhancing (PE) strategy to fuse the video-level phoneme sequences by efficient conformer to improve speech intelligibility. Next, the speaker identity adapting module aims to decode acoustics prior and inject the speaker style embedding. After that, the proposed Flow-based User Emotion Controlling (FUEC) is used to synthesize waveform by flow matching prediction network conditioned on acoustics prior. In this process, the FUEC determines the gradient direction and guidance scale based on the user's emotion instructions by the positive and negative guidance mechanism, which focuses on amplifying the desired emotion while suppressing others. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate favorable performance compared to several state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>MS2Mesh-XR: Multi-modal Sketch-to-Mesh Generation in XR Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MS2Mesh-XR, a novel multi-modal sketch-to-mesh generation pipeline that enables users to create realistic 3D objects in extended reality (XR) environments using hand-drawn sketches assisted by voice inputs. In specific, users can intuitively sketch objects using natural hand movements in mid-air within a virtual environment. By integrating voice inputs, we devise ControlNet to infer realistic images based on the drawn sketches and interpreted text prompts. Users can then review and select their preferred image, which is subsequently reconstructed into a detailed 3D mesh using the Convolutional Reconstruction Model. In particular, our proposed pipeline can generate a high-quality 3D mesh in less than 20 seconds, allowing for immersive visualization and manipulation in run-time XR scenes. We demonstrate the practicability of our pipeline through two use cases in XR settings. By leveraging natural user inputs and cutting-edge generative AI capabilities, our approach can significantly facilitate XR-based creative production and enhance user experiences. Our code and demo will be available at: https://yueqiu0911.github.io/MS2Mesh-XR/</description>

      <title>YingSound: Video-Guided Sound Effects Generation with Multi-modal Chain-of-Thought Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating sound effects for product-level videos, where only a small amount of labeled data is available for diverse scenes, requires the production of high-quality sounds in few-shot settings. To tackle the challenge of limited labeled data in real-world scenes, we introduce YingSound, a foundation model designed for video-guided sound generation that supports high-quality audio generation in few-shot settings. Specifically, YingSound consists of two major modules. The first module uses a conditional flow matching transformer to achieve effective semantic alignment in sound generation across audio and visual modalities. This module aims to build a learnable audio-visual aggregator (AVA) that integrates high-resolution visual features with corresponding audio features at multiple stages. The second module is developed with a proposed multi-modal visual-audio chain-of-thought (CoT) approach to generate finer sound effects in few-shot settings. Finally, an industry-standard video-to-audio (V2A) dataset that encompasses various real-world scenarios is presented. We show that YingSound effectively generates high-quality synchronized sounds across diverse conditional inputs through automated evaluations and human studies.

      <title>Multimodal Sentiment Analysis based on Video and Audio Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the abundance of current researches working on the sentiment analysis from videos and audios, finding the best model that gives the highest accuracy rate is still considered a challenge for researchers in this field. The main objective of this paper is to prove the usability of emotion recognition models that take video and audio inputs. The datasets used to train the models are the CREMA-D dataset for audio and the RAVDESS dataset for video. The fine-tuned models that been used are: Facebook/wav2vec2-large for audio and the Google/vivit-b-16x2-kinetics400 for video. The avarage of the probabilities for each emotion generated by the two previous models is utilized in the decision making framework. After disparity in the results, if one of the models gets much higher accuracy, another test framework is created. The methods used are the Weighted Average method, the Confidence Level Threshold method, the Dynamic Weighting Based on Confidence method, and the Rule-Based Logic method. This limited approach gives encouraging results that make future research into these methods viable.</description>

      <title>Causal Graphical Models for Vision-Language Compositional Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has empirically shown that Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle to fully understand the compositional properties of the human language, usually modeling an image caption as a "bag of words". As a result, they perform poorly on compositional tasks, which require a deeper understanding of the different entities of a sentence (subject, verb, etc.) jointly with their mutual relationships in order to be solved. In this paper, we model the dependency relations among textual and visual tokens using a Causal Graphical Model (CGM), built using a dependency parser, and we train a decoder conditioned by the VLM visual encoder. Differently from standard autoregressive or parallel predictions, our decoder's generative process is partially-ordered following the CGM structure. This structure encourages the decoder to learn only the main causal dependencies in a sentence discarding spurious correlations. Using extensive experiments on five compositional benchmarks, we show that our method significantly outperforms all the state-of-the-art compositional approaches by a large margin, and it also improves over methods trained using much larger datasets.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Music Generation with Explicit Bridges and Retrieval Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal music generation aims to produce music from diverse input modalities, including text, videos, and images. Existing methods use a common embedding space for multimodal fusion. Despite their effectiveness in other modalities, their application in multimodal music generation faces challenges of data scarcity, weak cross-modal alignment, and limited controllability. This paper addresses these issues by using explicit bridges of text and music for multimodal alignment. We introduce a novel method named Visuals Music Bridge (VMB). Specifically, a Multimodal Music Description Model converts visual inputs into detailed textual descriptions to provide the text bridge; a Dual-track Music Retrieval module that combines broad and targeted retrieval strategies to provide the music bridge and enable user control. Finally, we design an Explicitly Conditioned Music Generation framework to generate music based on the two bridges. We conduct experiments on video-to-music, image-to-music, text-to-music, and controllable music generation tasks, along with experiments on controllability. The results demonstrate that VMB significantly enhances music quality, modality, and customization alignment compared to previous methods. VMB sets a new standard for interpretable and expressive multimodal music generation with applications in various multimedia fields. Demos and code are available at https://github.com/wbs2788/VMB.</description>

      <title>Lyra: An Efficient and Speech-Centric Framework for Omni-Cognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) evolve, expanding beyond single-domain capabilities is essential to meet the demands for more versatile and efficient AI. However, previous omni-models have insufficiently explored speech, neglecting its integration with multi-modality. We introduce Lyra, an efficient MLLM that enhances multimodal abilities, including advanced long-speech comprehension, sound understanding, cross-modality efficiency, and seamless speech interaction. To achieve efficiency and speech-centric capabilities, Lyra employs three strategies: (1) leveraging existing open-source large models and a proposed multi-modality LoRA to reduce training costs and data requirements; (2) using a latent multi-modality regularizer and extractor to strengthen the relationship between speech and other modalities, thereby enhancing model performance; and (3) constructing a high-quality, extensive dataset that includes 1.5M multi-modal (language, vision, audio) data samples and 12K long speech samples, enabling Lyra to handle complex long speech inputs and achieve more robust omni-cognition. Compared to other omni-methods, Lyra achieves state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language, vision-speech, and speech-language benchmarks, while also using fewer computational resources and less training data.</description>

      <title>Representing Long Volumetric Video with Temporal Gaussian Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09608v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to address the challenge of reconstructing long volumetric videos from multi-view RGB videos. Recent dynamic view synthesis methods leverage powerful 4D representations, like feature grids or point cloud sequences, to achieve high-quality rendering results. However, they are typically limited to short (1~2s) video clips and often suffer from large memory footprints when dealing with longer videos. To solve this issue, we propose a novel 4D representation, named Temporal Gaussian Hierarchy, to compactly model long volumetric videos. Our key observation is that there are generally various degrees of temporal redundancy in dynamic scenes, which consist of areas changing at different speeds. Motivated by this, our approach builds a multi-level hierarchy of 4D Gaussian primitives, where each level separately describes scene regions with different degrees of content change, and adaptively shares Gaussian primitives to represent unchanged scene content over different temporal segments, thus effectively reducing the number of Gaussian primitives. In addition, the tree-like structure of the Gaussian hierarchy allows us to efficiently represent the scene at a particular moment with a subset of Gaussian primitives, leading to nearly constant GPU memory usage during the training or rendering regardless of the video length. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method over alternative methods in terms of training cost, rendering speed, and storage usage. To our knowledge, this work is the first approach capable of efficiently handling minutes of volumetric video data while maintaining state-of-the-art rendering quality.

      <title>OneAdapt: Fast Configuration Adaptation for Video Analytics Applications via Backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning inference on streaming media data, such as object detection in video or LiDAR feeds and text extraction from audio waves, is now ubiquitous. To achieve high inference accuracy, these applications typically require significant network bandwidth to gather high-fidelity data and extensive GPU resources to run deep neural networks (DNNs). While the high demand for network bandwidth and GPU resources could be substantially reduced by optimally adapting the configuration knobs, such as video resolution and frame rate, current adaptation techniques fail to meet three requirements simultaneously: adapt configurations (i) with minimum extra GPU or bandwidth overhead; (ii) to reach near-optimal decisions based on how the data affects the final DNN's accuracy, and (iii) do so for a range of configuration knobs. This paper presents OneAdapt, which meets these requirements by leveraging a gradient-ascent strategy to adapt configuration knobs. The key idea is to embrace DNNs' differentiability to quickly estimate the accuracy's gradient to each configuration knob, called AccGrad. Specifically, OneAdapt estimates AccGrad by multiplying two gradients: InputGrad (i.e. how each configuration knob affects the input to the DNN) and DNNGrad (i.e. how the DNN input affects the DNN inference output). We evaluate OneAdapt across five types of configurations, four analytic tasks, and five types of input data. Compared to state-of-the-art adaptation schemes, OneAdapt cuts bandwidth usage and GPU usage by 15-59% while maintaining comparable accuracy or improves accuracy by 1-5% while using equal or fewer resources.</description>

      <title>Riemann-based Multi-scale Attention Reasoning Network for Text-3D Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the challenges in acquiring paired Text-3D data and the inherent irregularity of 3D data structures, combined representation learning of 3D point clouds and text remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel Riemann-based Multi-scale Attention Reasoning Network (RMARN) for text-3D retrieval. Specifically, the extracted text and point cloud features are refined by their respective Adaptive Feature Refiner (AFR). Furthermore, we introduce the innovative Riemann Local Similarity (RLS) module and the Global Pooling Similarity (GPS) module. However, as 3D point cloud data and text data often possess complex geometric structures in high-dimensional space, the proposed RLS employs a novel Riemann Attention Mechanism to reflect the intrinsic geometric relationships of the data. Without explicitly defining the manifold, RMARN learns the manifold parameters to better represent the distances between text-point cloud samples. To address the challenges of lacking paired text-3D data, we have created the large-scale Text-3D Retrieval dataset T3DR-HIT, which comprises over 3,380 pairs of text and point cloud data. T3DR-HIT contains coarse-grained indoor 3D scenes and fine-grained Chinese artifact scenes, consisting of 1,380 and over 2,000 text-3D pairs, respectively. Experiments on our custom datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method. Our code and proposed datasets are available at \url{https://github.com/liwrui/RMARN}.</description>

      <title>Compression of Higher Order Ambisonics with Multichannel RVQGAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multichannel extension to the RVQGAN neural coding method is proposed, and realized for data-driven compression of third-order Ambisonics audio. The input- and output layers of the generator and discriminator models are modified to accept multiple (16) channels without increasing the model bitrate. We also propose a loss function for accounting for spatial perception in immersive reproduction, and transfer learning from single-channel models. Listening test results with 7.1.4 immersive playback show that the proposed extension is suitable for coding scene-based, 16-channel Ambisonics content with good quality at 16 kbps when trained and tested on the EigenScape database. The model has potential applications for learning other types of content and multichannel formats.</description>

      <title>Agent Journey Beyond RGB: Unveiling Hybrid Semantic-Spatial Environmental Representations for Vision-and-Language Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06465v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigating unseen environments based on natural language instructions remains difficult for egocentric agents in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN). While recent advancements have yielded promising outcomes, they primarily rely on RGB images for environmental representation, often overlooking the underlying semantic knowledge and spatial cues. Intuitively, humans inherently ground textual semantics within the spatial layout during indoor navigation. Inspired by this, we propose a versatile Semantic Understanding and Spatial Awareness (SUSA) architecture to facilitate navigation. SUSA includes a Textual Semantic Understanding (TSU) module, which narrows the modality gap between instructions and environments by generating and associating the descriptions of environmental landmarks in the agent's immediate surroundings. Additionally, a Depth-based Spatial Perception (DSP) module incrementally constructs a depth exploration map, enabling a more nuanced comprehension of environmental layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that SUSA hybrid semantic-spatial representations effectively enhance navigation performance, setting new state-of-the-art performance across three VLN benchmarks (REVERIE, R2R, and SOON). The source code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>DriveMM: All-in-One Large Multimodal Model for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated exceptional comprehension and interpretation capabilities in Autonomous Driving (AD) by incorporating large language models. Despite the advancements, current data-driven AD approaches tend to concentrate on a single dataset and specific tasks, neglecting their overall capabilities and ability to generalize. To bridge these gaps, we propose DriveMM, a general large multimodal model designed to process diverse data inputs, such as images and multi-view videos, while performing a broad spectrum of AD tasks, including perception, prediction, and planning. Initially, the model undergoes curriculum pre-training to process varied visual signals and perform basic visual comprehension and perception tasks. Subsequently, we augment and standardize various AD-related datasets to fine-tune the model, resulting in an all-in-one LMM for autonomous driving. To assess the general capabilities and generalization ability, we conduct evaluations on six public benchmarks and undertake zero-shot transfer on an unseen dataset, where DriveMM achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. We hope DriveMM as a promising solution for future end-to-end autonomous driving applications in the real world. Project page with code: https://github.com/zhijian11/DriveMM.</description>
