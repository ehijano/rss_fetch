      <title>An Innovative Attention-based Ensemble System for Credit Card Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting credit card fraud (CCF) holds significant importance due to its role in safeguarding consumers from unauthorized transactions that have the potential to result in financial detriment and negative impacts on their credit rating. It aids financial institutions in upholding the reliability of their payment mechanisms and circumventing the expensive procedure of compensating for deceitful transactions. The utilization of Artificial Intelligence methodologies demonstrated remarkable efficacy in the identification of credit card fraud instances. Within this study, we present a unique attention-based ensemble model. This model is enhanced by adding an attention layer for integration of first layer classifiers' predictions and a selection layer for choosing the best integrated value. The attention layer is implemented with two aggregation operators: dependent ordered weighted averaging (DOWA) and induced ordered weighted averaging (IOWA). The performance of the IOWA operator is very close to the learning algorithm in neural networks which is based on the gradient descent optimization method, and performing the DOWA operator is based on weakening the classifiers that make outlier predictions compared to other learners. Both operators have a sufficient level of complexity for the recognition of complex patterns. Accuracy and diversity are the two criteria we use for selecting the classifiers whose predictions are to be integrated by the two aggregation operators. Using a bootstrap forest, we identify the 13 most significant features of the dataset that contribute the most to CCF detection and use them to feed the proposed model. Exhibiting its efficacy, the ensemble model attains an accuracy of 99.95% with an area under the curve (AUC) of 1.</description>

      <title>Sample Average Approximation for Portfolio Optimization under CVaR constraint in an (re)insurance context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider optimal allocation problems with Conditional Value-At-Risk (CVaR) constraint. We prove, under very mild assumptions, the convergence of the Sample Average Approximation method (SAA) applied to this problem, and we also exhibit a convergence rate and discuss the uniqueness of the solution. These results give (re)insurers a practical solution to portfolio optimization under market regulatory constraints, i.e. a certain level of risk.</description>
