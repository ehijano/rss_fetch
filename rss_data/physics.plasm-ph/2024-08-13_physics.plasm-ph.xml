      <title>The Kinetic Analogue of the Pressure-Strain Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy transport in weakly collisional plasma systems is often studied with fluid models and diagnostics. However, the applicability of fluid models is necessarily limited when collisions are weak or absent, and using a fluid approach can obscure kinetic processes that provide key insights into the physics of energy transport. A kinetic technique that retains all of the information in 3D-3V phase-space for the study of energy transfer between electromagnetic fields and particle kinetic energy, which is quantified by the rate of electromagnetic work per unit volume $\mathbf{j} \cdot \mathbf{E}$ in fluid models, is the Field- Particle Correlation (FPC) technique. This technique has demonstrated that leveraging the full information contained in phase-space can elucidate the physical mechanisms of energy transfer. This provides a significant advantage over fluid diagnostics that quantify the rate at which energy is exchanged but do not distinguish between different physical processes. A different channel of energy transport, between fluid flow energy and particle internal energy, is quantified in fluid models via the pressure-strain interaction $-(\mathbf{P} \cdot \nabla ) \cdot \mathbf{u}$. Using a similar approach to that of the field-particle correlation technique, in this work we derive a kinetic analog of the pressure-strain interaction and use it alongside the field-particle correlation to analyze the flow of energy from electromagnetic fields into particle internal energy in two case studies of electron Landau damping.</description>

      <title>Plasma Equilibrium in Diamagnetic Trap with Neutral Beam Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical model of plasma equilibrium in the diamagnetic confinement mode in an axisymmetric mirror device with neutral beam injection. The hot ionic component is described within the framework of the kinetic theory, since the Larmor radius of the injected ions appears to be comparable to or even larger than the characteristic scale of the magnetic field inhomogeneity. The electron drag of the hot ions is taken into account, while the angular scattering due to ion-ion collisions is neglected. The background warm plasma, on the contrary, is considered to be in local thermal equilibrium, i.e. has a Maxwellian distribution function and is described in terms of magnetohydrodynamics. The density of the hot ions is assumed to be negligible compared to that of the warm plasma. Both the conventional gas-dynamic loss and the non-adiabatic loss specific to the diamagnetic confinement mode are taken into account. In this work, we do not consider the effects of the warm plasma rotation as well as the inhomogeneity of the electrostatic potential. A self-consistent theoretical model of the plasma equilibrium is constructed. In the case of the cylindrical bubble, this model is reduced to a simpler one. The numerical solutions in the limit of a thin transition layer of the diamagnetic bubble are found. Examples of the equilibria corresponding to the GDMT device are considered.</description>

      <title>Data-driven MHD Simulation of the Formation of a Magnetic Flux Rope and an Inclined Solar Eruption</title>

Abstract: Solar energetic events are caused by the release of magnetic energy accumulated in the solar atmosphere. To understand their initiating physical mechanisms, the dynamics of the coronal magnetic fields must be studied. Unfortunately, the dominant mechanisms are still unclear due to lack of direct measurements. Numerical simulations based on magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) can reproduce the dynamical evolution of solar coronal magnetic field providing a useful tool to explore flare initiation. Data-driven MHD simulations, in which the time-series observational data of the photospheric magnetic field is used as the simulation boundary condition, can explore different mechanisms. To investigate the accumulation of free magnetic energy through to a solar eruption, we simulated the first of several large flares in NOAA Active Region 11283. We used a data-driven model (Kaneko et al 2021) that was governed by zero-beta MHD, focusing on the free magnetic energy accumulation prior to the M5.3 flare (September 6, 01:59 UT, 2011). We reproduced the flare-associated eruption following the formation of twisted magnetic fields, or a magnetic flux rope (MFR), formed by photospheric motions at its footpoints. We found that the eruption was first triggered by the growth of the torus instability. The erupting MFR caused magnetic reconnections with neighboring magnetic field lines located along the direction of the eruption. Using the simulation results and an axial-radial decay index centered on the MFR, we find a natural explanation for the inclination of the eruption and a possible approach to predict the direction of solar eruptive events.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic perpendicular transport in low-beta collisionless plasma</title>

Abstract: Kinetic physics, including finite Larmor radius (FLR) effects, are known to affect the physics of magnetized plasma phenomena such as the Kelvin-Helmholtz and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities. Accurately incorporating FLR effects into fluid simulations requires moment closures for the heat flux and stress tensor, including the gyroviscous stress in collisionless magnetized plasmas. However, the most commonly used gyroviscous stress tensor closure (Braginskii Rev. Plasma Phys., 1965) is based on a strongly collisional assumption for the asymptotic expansion of the kinetic equation in the so-called fast-dynamics ordering. This collisional assumption becomes less valid for some high-temperature plasmas. To explore perpendicular transport in collisionless and weakly collisional plasmas, an asymptotic analysis of the weakly collisional Vlasov equation in the slow-dynamics or drift ordering is performed in a new "semi-fluid" formalism, which integrates in perpendicular velocity to obtain a five-moment system. The associated heat flux and stress tensor closures are determined via a Hilbert expansion of the kinetic equation. A numerically affordable approximation to the stress tensor is proposed which adjusts the Braginskii closure to account for temperature gradient-driven stress. Continuum kinetic simulations of a family of sheared-flow configurations with variable magnetization and temperature gradients are performed to validate the drift ordering semi-fluid expansion. The expected convergence with magnetization is observed, and residuals are examined and discussed in terms of their relationship to higher-order terms in the expansion. The adjusted Braginskii closure is found to accurately correct for the error committed by the Braginskii gyroviscous stress tensor closure in the presence of temperature gradients.</description>

      <title>Density-gradient-driven drift waves in the solar corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that under solar coronal conditions, drift waves may contribute to coronal heating. Specific properties of the drift waves to be expected in the solar corona have, however, not yet been determined using more advanced numerical models. We investigate the linear properties of density-gradient-driven drift waves in the solar coronal plasma using gyrokinetic ion-electron simulations with the gyrokinetic code GENE, solving the Vlasov-Maxwell equations in five dimensions assuming a simple slab geometry. We determine the frequencies and growth rates of the coronal density gradient-driven drift waves with changing plasma parameters, such as the electron \b{eta} , the density gradient, the magnetic shear and additional temperature gradients. To investigate the influence of the finite Larmor radius effect on the growth and structure of the modes, we also compare the gyrokinetic simulation results to those obtained from drift-kinetics. In most of the investigated conditions, the drift wave has positive growth rates that increase with increasing density gradient and decreasing \b{eta} . In the case of increasing magnetic shear, we find that from a certain point, the growth rate reaches a plateau. Depending on the considered reference environment, the frequencies and growth rates of these waves lie on the order of 0.1 mHz to 1 Hz. These values correspond to the observed solar wind density fluctuations near the Sun detected by WISPR, currently of unexplained origin. As a next step, nonlinear simulations are required to determine the expected fluctuation amplitudes and the plasma heating resulting from this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Application of the Scrape-Off-Layer Fast Ion (SOLFI) code to assess particle motion in mirrors and tokamaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.07547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Scrape-Off-Layer Fast Ion (SOLFI) code, which is a new and versatile full-orbit Monte Carlo particle tracer developed to follow fast ion orbits inside and outside the separatrix in tokamaks. SOLFI is benchmarked in a simple straight mirror geometry, showing that the code conserves particle energy and magnetic moment, obtains the correct passing boundary for particles moving in the magnetic mirror field with an imposed electrostatic field, and correctly observes equal ion and electron current at the ambipolar potential predicted from analytical theory. This result has consequences for collisionless scrape-off-layers in spherical tokamaks. We then utilize SOLFI for fundamental physics studies in novel tokamak geometries, exploring the effect of shaping on the trapped particle fraction and bounce locations in tokamaks and demonstrating that negative triangularity can be used to maximize the fraction of particles bouncing in the good-curvature region, potentially leading to enhanced confinement.</description>

      <title>Direct optimization of neoclassical ion transport in stellarator reactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We directly optimize stellarator neoclassical ion transport while holding neoclassical electron transport at a moderate level, creating a scenario favorable for impurity expulsion and retaining good ion confinement. Traditional neoclassical stellarator optimization has focused on minimizing $\epsilon_\mathrm{eff}$, the geometric factor that characterizes the amount of radial transport due to particles in the $1/\nu$ regime. Under expected reactor-relevant conditions, core electrons will be in the $1/\nu$ regime and core fuel ions will be in the $\sqrt{\nu}$ regime. Traditional optimizations thus minimize electron transport and rely on the radial electric field $\left(E_r\right)$ that develops to confine the ions. This often results in an inward-pointing $E_r$ that drives high-$Z$ impurities into the core, which may be troublesome in future reactors. In this work, we increase the ratio of the thermal transport coefficients $L_{1 1}^{e}/L_{1 1}^{i}$, which previous research has shown can create an outward-pointing $E_r$. This effect is very beneficial for impurity expulsion. We obtain self-consistent density, temperature, and $E_r$ profiles at reactor-relevant conditions for an optimized equilibrium. This equilibrium is expected to enjoy significantly improved impurity transport properties.</description>

      <title>Control of Instability in a Vlasov-Poisson System Through an External Electric Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma instabilities are a major concern in plasma science, for applications ranging from particle accelerators to nuclear fusion reactors. In this work, we consider the possibility of controlling such instabilities by adding an external electric field to the Vlasov--Poisson equations. Our approach to determining the external electric field is based on conducting a linear analysis of the resulting equations. We show that it is possible to select external electric fields that completely suppress the plasma instabilities present in the system when the equilibrium distribution and the perturbation are known. In fact, the proposed strategy returns the plasma to its equilibrium with a rate that is faster than exponential in time. We further perform numerical simulations of the nonlinear two-stream and bump-on-tail instabilities to verify our theory and to compare the different strategies that we propose in this work.</description>
