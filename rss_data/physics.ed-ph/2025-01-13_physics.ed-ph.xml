      <title>AstronomyCalc: A python toolkit for teaching Astronomical Calculations and Data Analysis methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding astrophysical and cosmological processes can be challenging due to their complexity and lack of intuitive analogies. To address this, we present \texttt{AstronomyCalc}, a Python package specifically designed to aid university-level teaching by integrating theoretical physics with practical astronomical data analysis methods. The package enables students to solve key cosmological calculations, such as the Friedmann equations, and explore various models while visualizing how parameter variations affect cosmic dynamics. It includes tools for generating synthetic astronomical data, such as Type Ia supernova measurements, and supports analysis of publicly available datasets, including Pantheon+ and the SPARC galaxy database. Simplified implementations of advanced algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains, allow students to engage with data analysis techniques used in contemporary research. Additionally, \texttt{AstronomyCalc} will be consistently updated with more tools and user-friendly Jupyter notebooks, making it a continually evolving educational resource for developing conceptual understanding and practical skills in astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>A Starter Kit for Diversity-Oriented Communities for Undergraduates: Near-Peer Mentorship Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This mentoring resource is a guide to establishing and running near-peer mentorship programs. It is based on the working knowledge and best practices developed by the Access Network, a collection of nine student-led communities at universities across the country working towards a vision of a more diverse, equitable, inclusive, and accessible STEM environment. Many of these communities, also referred to as sites, include a near-peer mentoring program that is developed to best support their local context. The format of these programs vary, ranging from structured classes with peer mentoring groups to student clubs supporting 1-on-1 relationships. To further support program participants as both students and as whole people, sites often run additional events such as lecture series, workshops, and social activities guided tailored to each student community's needs. Through this process, student leaders have generated and honed best practices for all aspects of running their sites. This guide is an attempt to synthesize those efforts, offering practical advice for student leaders setting up near-peer mentorship programs in their own departments. It has been written through the lens of undergraduate near-peer mentorship programs, although our framework could easily be extended to other demographics (e.g. high schoolers, graduate students, etc.). Our experience is with STEM mentorship specifically, though these practices can extend to any discipline. In this document, we outline best practices for designing, running, and sustaining near-peer mentorship programs. We provide template resources to assist with this work, and lesson plans to run mentor and mentee training sessions. We hope you find this guide useful in designing, implementing, and re-evaluating community oriented near-peer mentoring programs.</description>

      <title>Exploring Large Language Models (LLMs) through interactive Python activities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an approach to introduce physics students to the basic concepts of Large Language Models (LLMs) using Python-based activities in Google Colab. The teaching strategy integrates active learning strategies and combines theoretical ideas with practical, physics-related examples. Students engage with key technical concepts, such as word embeddings, through hands-on exploration of the Word2Vec neural network and GPT-2 - an LLM that gained a lot of attention in 2019 for its ability to generate coherent and plausible text from simple prompts.
  The activities highlight how words acquire meaning and how LLMs predict subsequent tokens by simulating simplified scenarios related to physics. By focusing on Word2Vec and GPT-2, the exercises illustrate fundamental principles underlying modern LLMs, such as semantic representation and contextual prediction. Through interactive experimenting in Google Colab, students observe the relationship between model parameters (such as temperature) in GPT-2 and output behaviour, understand scaling laws relating data quantity to model performance, and gain practical insights into the predictive capabilities of LLMs. This approach allows students to begin to understand how these systems work by linking them to physics concepts - systems that will shape their academic studies, professional careers and roles in society.</description>

      <title>Displacement current: examples that go beyond the beaten path</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ampere-Maxwell's law and the displacement current constitute one of the most difficult aspects of electromagnetic theory for students in introductory electromagnetics courses. Here we present a set of examples that go beyond the classical ones usually discussed in introductory textbooks. In-depth analysis of these examples allows students to develop a deeper understanding of electromagnetic theory even in students who have not acquired the full mathematical toolkit of the more advanced courses.</description>

      <title>Multilingual Performance of a Multimodal Artificial Intelligence System on Multisubject Physics Concept Inventories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the multilingual and multimodal performance of a large language model-based artificial intelligence (AI) system, GPT-4o, on a diverse set of physics concept inventories spanning multiple languages and subject areas. The inventories taken from the PhysPort website cover the classical physics topics of mechanics, electromagnetism, optics, and thermodynamics as well as relativity, quantum mechanics, astronomy, mathematics, and laboratory skills. Unlike previous text-only studies, we uploaded the inventories as images mirroring what a student would see on paper, assessing the system's multimodal functionality. The AI is prompted in English and autonomously chooses the language of its response - either remaining in the nominal language of the test, switching entirely to English, or mixing languages - revealing adaptive behavior dependent on linguistic complexity and data availability. Our results indicate some variation in performance across subject areas, with laboratory skills standing out as the area of poorest performance. Furthermore, the AI's performance on questions that require visual interpretation of images is worse than on purely text-based questions. Questions that are difficult for the AI tend to be that way invariably of the inventory language. We also find large variations in performance across languages, with some appearing to benefit substantially from language switching, a phenomenon similar to code-switching ofhuman speakers. Overall, comparing the obtained AI results to the existing literature, we find that the AI system outperforms average undergraduate students post-instruction in all subject areas but laboratory skills.</description>

      <title>SimOS: A Python Framework for Simulations of Optically Addressable Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an open-source simulation framework for optically detected magnetic resonance, developed in Python. The framework allows users to construct, manipulate, and evolve multipartite quantum systems that consist of spins and electronic levels. We provide an interface for efficient time-evolution in Lindblad form as well as a framework for facilitating simulation of spatial and generalized stochastic dynamics. Further, symbolic operator construction and propagation is supported for simple model systems making the framework also ideal for use in classroom instruction of magnetic resonance. Designed to be backend-agnostic, the library leverages existing Python libraries as computational backends. We introduce the most important functionality and illustrate the syntax on a series of examples. These include systems such as the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond and photo-generated spin-correlated radical pairs for which our library offers system-specific sub-modules.</description>
