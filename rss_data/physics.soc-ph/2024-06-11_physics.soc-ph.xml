      <title>The Paradox of Collective Certainty in Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore a paradox of collective action and certainty in science wherein the more scientists research together, the less that work contributes to the value of their collective certainty. When scientists address similar problems and share data, methods, and collaborators, their understanding of and trust in their colleagues' research rises, a quality required for scientific advance. This increases the positive reinforcement scientists receive for shared beliefs as they become more dependent on their colleagues' knowledge, interests, and findings. This collective action increases the potential for scientists to reside in epistemic ''bubbles'' that limit their capacity to make new discoveries or have their discoveries generalize. In short, as scientists grow closer, their experience of scientific validity rises as the likelihood of genuine replication falls, creating a trade-off between certainty and truth.</description>

      <title>Revisiting institutional punishment in the $N$-person prisoner's dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conflict between individual and collective interests makes fostering cooperation in human societies a challenging task, requiring drastic measures such as the establishment of sanctioning institutions. These institutions are costly because they have to be maintained regardless of the presence or absence of offenders. Here, we propose realistic improvements to the standard $N$-person prisoner's dilemma formulation with institutional punishment by eliminating overpunishment, requiring a minimum number of contributors to establish the sanctioning institution, and sharing the cost among them once this minimum number is reached. In addition, we focus on large groups or communities for which sanctioning institutions are ubiquitous. Using the replicator equation framework for an infinite population, we find that by sufficiently fining players who fail to contribute either to the public good or to the sanctioning institution, a population of contributors immune to invasion by these free riders can be established, provided that the contributors are sufficiently numerous. In a finite population, we use finite-size scaling to show that, for some parameter settings, demographic noise helps to fixate the strategy that contributes to the public good but not to the sanctioning institution even for infinitely large populations when, somewhat counterintuitively, its proportion in the initial population vanishes with a small power of the population size.</description>

      <title>Ecological Data Reveal Imbalances in Collision Avoidance Due to Groups' Social Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relative dynamics in collision avoidance between individual pedestrians and dyads has been recently studied, and it was shown that individuals may intrude dyads that are not socially interacting. Building on this, our current study examines how much each party contributes to collision avoidance by measuring deviations from their intended paths. Our findings suggest that individuals prioritise trajectory efficiency in undisturbed situations, but prioritise safety when encountering dyads, deviating more from their intended path. Non-interacting dyads present a similar behavior, although their trajectories appear to be even more efficient than those of individuals in undisturbed situations, and their deviations during encounters less pronounced. On the other hand, socially interacting dyads are not very efficient in undisturbed situations, and their behavior is mostly unaffected by encounters. These results strongly suggest that group dynamics affects in two ways the behavior of pedestrians, namely it has a dynamical and a social effect. The dynamical effect stabilises their trajectory, while the social one decreases the ability to focus on the external environment, leading to reduced efficiency and safety. Another finding concerns the tendency of individuals to avoid in a more prominent way the interacting dyads as compared to non-interacting ones. This suggests that individuals may assess others' contribution to collision avoidance. An impact parameter analysis reveals that collision risk influences path deviations in pedestrian encounters. For individuals, larger behavioral differences between low and high interaction levels of the dyad occur both when the collision risk is high and during less critical encounters. For dyads, the deviation differences between low and high interaction levels are most pronounced when the individual is on course to pass close to the dyad.</description>

      <title>Inequalities of energy release rates in compression of nano-porous materials predict its imminent breakdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the divergent acoustic energy release rate in a quasi-statically compressed nano-porous material can be used as a precursor to failure in such materials. A quantification of the inequality of the energy release rate using social inequality measure indices help constructing a warning signal for large bursts of energy release. We also verify similar behavior for simulations of viscoelastic fiber bundle models that mimic the strain-hardening dynamics of the samples. The results demonstrate experimental applicability of the precursory signal formulation for any diverging response function near a transition point using social inequality indices.</description>

      <title>How much longer do you have to drive than the crow has to fly?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When we travel by car from one location to another, our route is constrained by the road network. The resulting network distance is generally longer than the geodetic distance, i.e. the distance as the crow flies, between the two locations. We report a systematic relation between the statistical properties of these two distances. In empirical analyses for large motorway networks in various countries and areas, we work out distributions of network and geodetic distances and identify a surprisingly robust scaling property between them. A simple consequence is that we typically have to drive $1.3\pm0.1$ times longer than the crow flies. Moreover, we show that this scaling is not present in standard random networks; rather, it requires a certain non-randomness, namely adjacency. We develop a set of rules to build a realistic motorway network, also consistent with the scaling properties found empirically. We hypothesize that the scaling reflects, in a rather universal fashion, a compromise between two societal needs: high efficiency and accessibility on the one hand, and limitation of costs and other burdens on the other.</description>

      <title>Patterns of co-occurrent skills in UK job adverts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A job usually involves the application of several complementary or synergistic skills to perform its required tasks. Such relationships are implicitly recognised by employers in the skills they demand when recruiting new employees. Here we construct a skills network based on their co-occurrence in a national level data set of 65 million job postings from the UK spanning 2016 to 2022. We then apply multiscale graph-based community detection to obtain data-driven skill clusters at different levels of resolution that reveal a modular structure across scales. Skill clusters display diverse levels of demand and occupy varying roles within the skills network: some have broad reach across the network (high closeness centrality) while others have higher levels of within-cluster containment, yet with high interconnection across clusters and no skill silos. The skill clusters also display varying levels of semantic similarity, highlighting the difference between co-occurrence in adverts and intrinsic thematic consistency. Clear geographic variation is evident in the demand for each skill cluster across the UK, broadly reflecting the industrial characteristics of each region, e.g., London appears as an outlier as an international hub for finance, education and business. Comparison of data from 2016 and 2022 reveals employers are demanding a broader range of skills over time, with more adverts featuring skills spanning different clusters. We also show that our data-driven clusters differ from expert-authored categorisations of skills, indicating that important relationships between skills are not captured by expert assessment alone.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Mean-Field Theory of Complex Systems on Sparse Directed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although real-world complex systems typically interact through sparse and heterogeneous networks, analytic solutions of their dynamics are limited to models with all-to-all interactions. Here, we solve the dynamics of a broad range of nonlinear models of complex systems on sparse directed networks with a random structure. By generalizing dynamical mean-field theory to sparse systems, we derive an exact equation for the path-probability describing the effective dynamics of a single degree of freedom. Our general solution applies to key models in the study of neural networks, ecosystems, epidemic spreading, and synchronization. Using the population dynamics algorithm, we solve the path-probability equation to determine the phase diagram of a seminal neural network model in the sparse regime, showing that this model undergoes a transition from a fixed-point phase to chaos as a function of the network topology.</description>

      <title>Feature-aware ultra-low dimensional reduction of real networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In existing models and embedding methods of networked systems, node features describing their qualities are usually overlooked in favor of focusing solely on node connectivity. This study introduces $FiD$-Mercator, a model-based ultra-low dimensional reduction technique that integrates node features with network structure to create $D$-dimensional maps of complex networks in a hyperbolic space. This embedding method efficiently uses features as an initial condition, guiding the search of nodes' coordinates towards an optimal solution. The research reveals that downstream task performance improves with the correlation between network connectivity and features, emphasizing the importance of such correlation for enhancing the description and predictability of real networks. Simultaneously, hyperbolic embedding's ability to reproduce local network properties remains unaffected by the inclusion of features. The findings highlight the necessity for developing network embedding techniques capable of exploiting such correlations to optimize both network structure and feature association jointly in the future.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Deception: Establishing a Taxonomic Framework for Disinformation within Scientific Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disinformation spreads among the public and in scientific discourse through the actions of individuals, organizations, and governments that distort scholarly communications, media narratives, and institutional trust. This taxonomy introduces a structured framework and specialized set of definitions to elucidate the key participants, platforms, and strategies employed in the propagation of disinformation. Enhanced comprehension of the mechanisms and pathways of scientific disinformation equips journalists and policymakers with the tools necessary to more effectively recognize and address these issues. The authors developed this taxonomy of disinformation through a multi-faceted approach, encompassing a literature review, expert review, and case study analysis. The literature review revealed a scarcity of taxonomical models amidst prevalent algorithmic detection studies. Subsequently, an expert review process refined our taxonomy through collaborative analysis of twenty-two cases of identified disinformation, categorized by their methods, motives, and impacts. Finally, we validated and fine-tuned our taxonomy through detailed case studies of twelve diverse disinformation instances, assessing the taxonomy's effectiveness in capturing the essential characteristics of each case and making necessary adjustments to ensure its relevance and accuracy in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>The Arrow of Time is Alive and Well but Forbidden Under the Received View of Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11456v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This essay offers a meta-level analysis in the sociology and history of physics in the context of the so-called "Arrow of Time Problem" or "Two Times Problem," which asserts that the empirically observed directionality of time is in conflict with physical theory. I argue that there is actually no necessary conflict between physics and the arrow of time, and that the observed directionality of time is perfectly consistent with physics unconstrained by certain optional metaphysical, epistemological and methodological beliefs and practices characterizing the conventional or Received View.</description>
