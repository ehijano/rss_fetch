      <title>Nowruz, Umar Khayyam, Calendar and Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides information about the factors that necessitated the need to adjust the calendar during the time of Umar Khayyam, the method of choosing the beginning of the year, and the length of the months. It also attempts to correct the common error associated with @the arrival of the Sun in Aries on Nowruz@.</description>

      <title>What is a physical theory? Philosophers do have an answer by distinguishing two forms of empirical adequacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is a physical theory? Although this intriguing question has been addressed from many different perspectives, some physicists and philosophers of physics have implicitly or explicitly embraced a philosophically-neutral definition of a physical theory, independently of the philosophical position endorsed with respect to it. Considering some objections against this view, I shall argue that the most appropriate definition of a physical theory already presupposes some commitments shared by a philosophical position associated with scientific realism. As we shall see, what physical theories and scientific realist positions have in common is the commitment of satisfying a non-factive notion of empirical adequacy, whilst a factive notion of empirical adequacy shall be solely associated with scientific realism.</description>

      <title>Cournot's principle revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cournot's principle states that a typical event (i.e., an event with probability very close to $1$) occurs nearly certainly in a single trial of an experiment. This principle has been considered by various authors as the only connection between mathematical probability and the real world of experiments.
  To make the logical structure of the principle clearer, in this paper a reformulation of the principle is proposed. This reformulation is based on the following three elements: (1) The explicit definition of the empirical property of practical certainty, (2) the clear separation between probability measure and experiment, including the remark that typicality is a mathematical property defined by the probability measure while practical certainty is an empirical property defined by the experiment, and (3) the explicit formulation of the product rule for independent trials.
  The novel formulation then states that a probability measure $P$ $\textit{governs}$ an experiment $E$ if the events that are typical according to $P^n$ are practically certain according to $E^n$ for all $n \geq 1$, where $P^n$ is the $n$-fold product of $P$ and $E^n$ is the experiment whose trials are composed of $n$ trials of $E$.
  The novel formulation highlights the possible existence of two ambiguities in the principle, namely: (i) that different probability measures govern the same experiment and (ii) that the same probability measure governs different experiments. In this paper the first ambiguity is rigorously disproved, while the second is disproved provided that a suitable property characterizing the empirical equivalence of experiments is assumed.</description>

      <title>Which features of quantum physics are not fundamentally quantum but are due to indeterminism?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What is fundamentally quantum? We argue that most of the features, problems, and paradoxes -- such as the measurement problem, the Wigner's friend paradox and its proposed solutions, single particle nonlocality, and no-cloning -- allegedly attributed to quantum physics have a clear classical analogue if one is to interpret classical physics as fundamentally indeterministic. What really characterizes quantum physics boils down only to phenomena that involve $\hbar$, i.e., incompatible observables.</description>

      <title>The Newtonian limit of orthonormal frames in metric theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend well-known results on the Newtonian limit of Lorentzian metrics to orthonormal frames. Concretely, we prove that, given a one-parameter family of Lorentzian metrics that in the Newtonian limit converges to a Galilei structure, any family of orthonormal frames for these metrics converges pointwise to a Galilei frame, assuming that the two obvious necessary conditions are satisfied: the spatial frame must not rotate indefinitely as the limit is approached, and the frame's boost velocity with respect to some fixed reference observer needs to converge.</description>

      <title>Comment on `The Classical Limit of Teleparallel Gravity'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We critically discuss the claims of a recent article regarding the Newtonian limit of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) in pure-tetrad formulation (arXiv:2406.17594). In particular, we refute this article's purported main result that if a regular Newtonian limit exists, the torsion of the limiting derivative operator (i.e., connection) necessarily vanishes.</description>
