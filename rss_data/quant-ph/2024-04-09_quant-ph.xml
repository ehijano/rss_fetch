      <title>Hybrid Tree Tensor Networks for quantum simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid Tensor Networks (hTN) offer a promising solution for encoding variational quantum states beyond the capabilities of efficient classical methods or noisy quantum computers alone. However, their practical usefulness and many operational aspects of hTN-based algorithms, like the optimization of hTNs, the generalization of standard contraction rules to an hybrid setting, and the design of application-oriented architectures have not been thoroughly investigated yet. In this work, we introduce a novel algorithm to perform ground state optimizations with hybrid Tree Tensor Networks (hTTNs), discussing its advantages and roadblocks, and identifying a set of promising applications. We benchmark our approach on two paradigmatic models, namely the Ising model at the critical point and the Toric code Hamiltonian. In both cases, we successfully demonstrate that hTTNs can improve upon classical equivalents with equal bond dimension in the classical part.</description>

      <title>Coherent Heat Transfer Leads to Genuine Quantum Enhancement in Performances of Continuous Engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional continuous quantum heat engines rely on incoherent heat transfer with the baths and, thus, have limited capability to outperform their classical counterparts. In this work, we introduce distinct continuous quantum heat engines that utilize coherent heat transfer with baths, yielding significant quantum enhancement in performance. These continuous engines, termed as coherent engines, consist of one qutrit system and two photonic baths and enable coherent heat transfer via two-photon transitions involving three-body interactions between the system and hot and cold baths. The closest quantum incoherent analogs are those that only allow incoherent heat transfer between the qutrit and the baths via one-photon transitions relying on two-body interactions between the system and hot or cold baths. We demonstrate that coherent engines deliver much higher power output and a much lower signal-to-noise ratio in power, where the latter signifies the reliability of an engine, compared to incoherent engines. Coherent engines manifest more non-classical features than incoherent engines because they violate the classical thermodynamic uncertainty relation by a greater amount and for a wider range of parameters. Importantly, coherent engines can operate close to or at the fundamental lower limit on reliability given by the quantum version of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, making them highly reliable. These genuine enhancements in performance by hundreds of folds over incoherent engines and the saturation of the quantum limit by coherent engines are directly attributed to its capacity to harness higher energetic coherence which is, again, a consequence of coherent heat transfer. The experimental feasibility of coherent engines and the improved understanding of how quantum properties can enhance performance may find important implications in emerging quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Ground State Preparation via Dynamical Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms for probing ground-state properties of quantum systems require good initial states. Projection-based methods such as eigenvalue filtering rely on inputs that have a significant overlap with the low-energy subspace, which can be challenging for large, strongly-correlated systems. This issue has motivated the study of physically-inspired dynamical approaches such as thermodynamic cooling. In this work, we introduce a ground-state preparation algorithm based on the simulation of quantum dynamics. Our main insight is to transform the Hamiltonian by a shifted sign function via quantum signal processing, effectively mapping eigenvalues into positive and negative subspaces separated by a large gap. This automatically ensures that all states within each subspace conserve energy with respect to the transformed Hamiltonian. Subsequent time-evolution with a perturbed Hamiltonian induces transitions to lower-energy states while preventing unwanted jumps to higher energy states. The approach does not rely on a priori knowledge of energy gaps and requires no additional qubits to model a bath. Furthermore, it makes $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\,3/2}/\epsilon)$ queries to the time-evolution operator of the system and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{\,3/2})$ queries to a block-encoding of the perturbation, for $d$ cooling steps and an $\epsilon$-accurate energy resolution. Our results provide a framework for combining quantum signal processing and Hamiltonian simulation to design heuristic quantum algorithms for ground-state preparation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Adversarial Learning for Kernel Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that hybrid quantum classifiers based on quantum kernel methods and support vector machines are vulnerable against adversarial attacks, namely small engineered perturbations of the input data can deceive the classifier into predicting the wrong result. Nonetheless, we also show that simple defence strategies based on data augmentation with a few crafted perturbations can make the classifier robust against new attacks. Our results find applications in security-critical learning problems and in mitigating the effect of some forms of quantum noise, since the attacker can also be understood as part of the surrounding environment.</description>

      <title>Estimate of the time required to perform a nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation has been proposed as a method for implementing quantum logic gates with the same robustness as adiabatic holonomic quantum computation but with shorter execution times. In this paper, we establish an isoholonomic inequality for quantum gates, which provides a lower bound on the lengths of cyclic transformations of the computational space that generate a specific gate. Then, as a corollary, we derive a nonadiabatic execution time estimate for holonomic gates. In addition, we demonstrate that under certain dimensional conditions, the isoholonomic inequality is tight in the sense that every gate on the computational space can be implemented holonomically and unitarily in a time-optimal way. We illustrate the results by showing that the procedures for implementing a universal set of holonomic gates proposed in a pioneering paper on nonadiabatic holonomic quantum computation saturate the isoholonomic inequality and are thus time-optimal.</description>

      <title>Strict area law implies commuting parent Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in two spatial dimensions, when a quantum state has entanglement entropy obeying a strict area law, meaning $S(A)=\alpha |\partial A| - \gamma$ for constants $\alpha, \gamma$ independent of lattice region $A$, then it admits a commuting parent Hamiltonian. More generally, we prove that the entanglement bootstrap axioms in 2D imply the existence of a commuting, local parent Hamiltonian with a stable spectral gap. We also extend our proof to states that describe gapped domain walls. Physically, these results imply that the states studied in the entanglement bootstrap program correspond to ground states of some local Hamiltonian, describing a stable phase of matter. Our result also suggests that systems with chiral gapless edge modes cannot obey a strict area law provided they have finite local Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Strong quantum nonlocality: Unextendible biseparability beyond unextendible product basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An unextendible biseparable basis (UBB) is a set of orthogonal pure biseparable states which span a subspace of a given Hilbert space while the complementary subspace contains only genuinely entangled states. These biseparable bases are useful to produce genuinely entangled subspace in multipartite system. Such a subspace could be more beneficial for information theoretic applications if we are able to extract distillable entanglement across every bipartition from each state of this subspace. In this manuscript, we have derived a rule for constructing such a class of UBB which exhibits the phenomenon of strong quantum nonlocality. This result positively answers the open problem raised by Agrawal et al. [Phys. Rev. A 99, 032335 (2019)]; that there exists a UBB which can demonstrate the phenomenon of strong quantum nonlocality in the perspective of local irreducibility paradigm.</description>

      <title>Quantum-inspired activation functions in the convolutional neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the significant advantages offered by quantum computing, research in quantum machine learning has increased in recent years. While quantum speed-up has been demonstrated in some applications of quantum machine learning, a comprehensive understanding of its underlying mechanisms for improved performance remains elusive. Our study fills this gap by examining the expressibility of quantum circuits integrated within a convolutional neural network (CNN). Through numerical training on the MNIST dataset, our hybrid quantum-classical CNN model exhibited superior feature selection capabilities and significantly reduced the required training steps compared to the classical CNN. To understand the root of this enhanced performance, we conducted an analytical investigation of the functional expressibility of quantum circuits and derived a quantum activation function. We demonstrated that this quantum activation is more efficient in selecting important features and discarding unimportant information of input images. These findings not only deepen our comprehension of quantum-enhanced machine-learning models but also advance the classical machine-learning technique by introducing the quantum-inspired activation function.</description>

      <title>Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks in a Silicon Photonic Chip with Maximum Expressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have achieved remarkable success with realistic tasks such as creating realistic images, texts, and audio. Combining GANs and quantum computing, quantum GANs are thought to have an exponential advantage over their classical counterparts due to the stronger expressibility of quantum circuits. In this research, a two-qubit silicon quantum photonic chip is created, capable of executing arbitrary controlled-unitary (CU) operations and generating any 2-qubit pure state, thus making it an excellent platform for quantum GANs. To capture complex data patterns, a hybrid generator is proposed to inject nonlinearity into quantum GANs. As a demonstration, three generative tasks, covering both pure quantum versions of GANs (PQ-GAN) and hybrid quantum-classical GANs (HQC-GANs), are successfully carried out on the chip, including high-fidelity single-qubit state learning, classical distributions loading, and compressed image production. The experiment results prove that silicon quantum photonic chips have great potential in generative learning applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recursive techniques have recently been introduced into quantum programming so that a variety of large quantum circuits and algorithms can be elegantly and economically programmed. In this paper, we present a proof system for formal verification of the correctness of recursively defined quantum circuits. The soundness and (relative) completeness of the proof system are established. To demonstrating its effectiveness, a series of application examples of the proof system are given, including (multi-qubit) controlled gates, a quantum circuit generating (multi-qubit) GHZ (Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger) states, recursive definition of quantum Fourier transform, quantum state preparation, and quantum random-access memories (QRAM).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Learning is a process of recovering system Hamiltonian from measurements, which is a fundamental problem in quantum information processing. In this study, we investigate the problem of learning the symmetric Hamiltonian from its eigenstate. Inspired by the application of group theory in block diagonal secular determination, we have derived a method to determine the number of linearly independent equations about the Hamiltonian unknowns obtained from an eigenstate. This number corresponds to the degeneracy of the associated irreducible representation of the Hamiltonian symmetry group. To illustrate our approach, we examine the XXX Hamiltonian and the XXZ Hamiltonian. We first determine the Hamiltonian symmetry group, then work out the decomposition of irreducible representation, which serves as foundation for analyzing the uniqueness of recovered Hamiltonian. Our numerical findings consistently align with our theoretical analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving precise preparation of quantum many-body states is crucial for the practical implementation of quantum computation and quantum simulation. However, the inherent challenges posed by unavoidable excitations at critical points during quench processes necessitate careful design of control fields. In this work, we introduce a promising and versatile dynamic control neural network tailored to optimize control fields. We address the problem of suppressing defect density and enhancing cat-state fidelity during the passage across the critical point in the quantum Ising model. Our method facilitates seamless transitions between different objective functions by adjusting the {optimization strategy}. In comparison to gradient-based power-law quench methods, our approach demonstrates significant advantages for both small system sizes and long-term evolutions. We provide a detailed analysis of the specific forms of control fields and summarize common features for experimental implementation. Furthermore, numerical simulations demonstrate the robustness of our proposal against random noise and spin number fluctuations. The optimized defect density and cat-state fidelity exhibit a transition at a critical ratio of the quench duration to the system size, coinciding with the quantum speed limit for quantum evolution.</description>

      <title>Noise induced coherent ergotropy of a quantum heat engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically identify the noise-induced coherent contribution to the ergotropy of a four-level quantum heat engine coupled to a unimodal quantum cavity. We utilize a protocol where the passive state's quasiprobabilities can be analytically identified from the population-coherence coupled reduced density matrix. The reduced density matrix elements are evaluated using a microscopic quantum master equation formalism. Multiple ergotropies within the same coherence interval, each characterized by a positive and pronounced coherent contribution, are observed. These ergotropies are a result of population inversion as well as quasiprobability-population inversion, controllable through the coherence measure parameters. The optimal flux and power of the engine are found to be at moderate values of ergotropy with increasing values of noise-induced coherence. The optimal power at different coherences is found to possess a constant ergotropy.</description>

      <title>Efficient quantum Gibbs samplers with Kubo--Martin--Schwinger detailed balance condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lindblad dynamics and other open-system dynamics provide a promising path towards efficient Gibbs sampling on quantum computers. In these proposals, the Lindbladian is obtained via an algorithmic construction akin to designing an artificial thermostat in classical Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics methods, rather than treated as an approximation to weakly coupled system-bath unitary dynamics. Recently, Chen, Kastoryano, and Gily\'en (arXiv:2311.09207) introduced the first efficiently implementable Lindbladian satisfying the Kubo--Martin--Schwinger (KMS) detailed balance condition, which ensures that the Gibbs state is a fixed point of the dynamics and is applicable to non-commuting Hamiltonians. This Gibbs sampler uses a continuously parameterized set of jump operators, and the energy resolution required for implementing each jump operator depends only logarithmically on the precision and the mixing time. In this work, we build upon the structural characterization of KMS detailed balanced Lindbladians by Fagnola and Umanit\`a, and develop a family of efficient quantum Gibbs samplers that only use a discrete set of jump operators (the number can be as few as one). Our methodology simplifies the implementation and the analysis of Lindbladian-based quantum Gibbs samplers, and encompasses the construction of Chen, Kastoryano, and Gily\'en as a special instance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms provide a potential strategy for solving computational problems that are intractable by classical means. Computing the topological invariants of topological matter is one central problem in research on quantum materials, and a variety of numerical approaches for this purpose have been developed. However, the complexity of quantum many-body Hamiltonians makes calculations of topological invariants challenging for interacting systems. Here, we present two quantum circuits for calculating Chern numbers of two-dimensional quantum matter on quantum computers. Both circuits combine a gate-based adiabatic time-evolution over the discretized Brillouin zone with particular phase estimation techniques. The first algorithm uses many qubits, and we analyze it using a tensor-network simulator of quantum circuits. The second circuit uses fewer circuits, and we implement it experimentally on a quantum computer based on superconducting qubits. Our results establish a method for computing topological invariants with quantum circuits, taking a step towards characterizing interacting topological quantum matter using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Shallow Quantum Circuit Implementation of Symmetric Functions with Limited Ancillary Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum computation, optimizing depth and number of ancillary qubits in quantum circuits is crucial due to constraints imposed by current quantum devices. This paper presents an innovative approach to implementing arbitrary symmetric Boolean functions using poly-logarithmic depth quantum circuits with logarithmic number of ancillary qubits. Symmetric functions are those whose outputs rely solely on the Hamming weight of the inputs. These functions find applications across diverse domains, including quantum machine learning, arithmetic circuit synthesis, and quantum algorithm design (e.g., Grover's algorithm). Moreover, by fully leveraging the potential of qutrits (an additional energy level), the ancilla count can be further reduced to 1. The key technique involves a novel poly-logarithmic depth quantum circuit designed to compute Hamming weight without the need for ancillary qubits. The quantum circuit for Hamming weight is of independent interest because of its broad applications, such as quantum memory and quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>How coherence measurements of a qubit steer its quantum environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repetitive Ramsey interferometry measurements (RIMs) are often used to measure qubit coherence, assuming that the environment remains unaffected after each measurement and the outcomes of all measurements are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). While this assumption is often valid for a classical environment, it may not hold for a quantum environment due to non-negligible backaction. Here we present a general theoretical framework to account for the measurement backaction in sequential RIMs. We show that an RIM induces a quantum channel on the quantum environment, and sequential RIMs gradually steer the quantum environment to the fixed points of the channel. For the first time, we reveal three distinct environment steering effects -- polarization, depolarization and metastable polarization, depending on the commutativity of the noise operator $B$ and the environment Hamiltonian $H_e$: (1) When $[B,H_e]=0$, the quantum environment is gradually polarized to different eigenstates of $B$ as the number $m$ of repetitive RIMs increases; (2) When $[B,H_e]\neq 0$, the quantum environment is gradually depolarized to a maximally mixed state of its whole Hilbert space or a Hilbert subspace; (3) When $[B,H_e]\neq 0$ but one of $H_e$ and $B$ is a small perturbation on the other, metastable polarization can happen, such that the quantum environment is first polarized for a finite range of $m$ but becomes gradually depolarized as $m$ increases further. The environment steering also makes the measurement statistics of sequential RIMs develop non-i.i.d. features. Realistic examples of central spin models are also presented. Our work not only elucidates the measurement backaction and statistics of repetitive qubit coherence measurements, but is also useful for designing protocols to engineer the state or dynamics of a quantum environment with a qubit ancilla.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying quantum correlations in the presence of loss is of critical importance for the physical modeling of real quantum systems. Here, we demonstrate the control of spatial correlations between entangled photons in a photonic chip, designed and modeled using the singular value decomposition approach. We show that engineered loss, using an auxiliary waveguide, allows one to invert the spatial statistics from bunching to antibunching. Furthermore, we study the photon statistics within the loss-emulating channel and observe photon coincidences, which may provide insights into the design of quantum photonic integrated chips.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Circuits for Machine Learning Activation Functions including Constant T-depth ReLU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has increasingly captured the interest of researchers. Among the components in this domain, activation functions hold a fundamental and indispensable role. Our research focuses on the development of activation functions quantum circuits for integration into fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures, with an emphasis on minimizing $T$-depth. Specifically, we present novel implementations of ReLU and leaky ReLU activation functions, achieving constant $T$-depths of 4 and 8, respectively. Leveraging quantum lookup tables, we extend our exploration to other activation functions such as the sigmoid. This approach enables us to customize precision and $T$-depth by adjusting the number of qubits, making our results more adaptable to various application scenarios. This study represents a significant advancement towards enhancing the practicality and application of quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for combinatorial optimization problem. We show that under the assumption that the Overlap Gap Property (OGP) in the solution space for the Max-$q$-XORSAT is a monotonic increasing function, the swapping of limits in QAOA leads to suboptimal results limited by the OGP. Furthermore, since the performance of QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model matches asymptotically for Max-$q$-XORSAT on large-girth regular hypergraph, we show that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the pure $q$-spin model for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely. This suggests that a necessary condition for the validity of limit swapping in QAOA is the absence of OGP in a given combinatorial optimization problem. A corollary of this is that the spectral gap of a Hamiltonian exhibiting the OGP will close in the thermodynamic limit resulting in a limitation of the quantum adiabatic theorem and efficient optimization of QAOA parameters. Furthermore, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to Montanari's classical algorithm in solving the mean field spin glass problem, the best known classical algorithm.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-guided gradient descent for quantum neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many supervised learning tasks have intrinsic symmetries, such as translational and rotational symmetry in image classifications. These symmetries can be exploited to enhance performance. We formulate the symmetry constraints into a concise mathematical form. We design two ways to adopt the constraints into the cost function, thereby shaping the cost landscape in favour of parameter choices which respect the given symmetry. Unlike methods that alter the neural network circuit ansatz to impose symmetry, our method only changes the classical post-processing of gradient descent, which is simpler to implement. We call the method symmetry-guided gradient descent (SGGD). We illustrate SGGD in entanglement classification of Werner states and in a binary classification task in a 2-D feature space. In both cases, the results show that SGGD can accelerate the training, improve the generalization ability, and remove vanishing gradients, especially when the training data is biased.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed description of a quantum scalar field theory within a flat spacetime confined to a cavity with perfectly reflecting moving boundaries. Moreover, we establish an equivalence between this time-dependent setting and a field theory on an acoustic metric with static Dirichlet boundary conditions. We discuss the classical and quantum aspects of the theory from the latter perspective, accompanied by the introduction of novel numerical techniques designed for the (nonperturbative) computation of particle production attributed to the Dynamical Casimir effect, applicable to arbitrary boundary trajectories. As an illustrative example of these methodologies, we compute the particle production for a massless field in 1+1 dimensions. Notably, our approaches readily extend to encompass scenarios involving massive fields and higher dimensions</description>

      <title>A quantum information theoretic analysis of reinforcement learning-assisted quantum architecture search</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of quantum computing, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) represent a pivotal category of quantum solutions across a broad spectrum of applications. These algorithms demonstrate significant potential for realising quantum computational advantage. A fundamental aspect of VQAs involves formulating expressive and efficient quantum circuits (namely ansatz) and automating the search of such ansatz is known as quantum architecture search (QAS). RL-QAS involves optimising QAS using reinforcement learning techniques. This study investigates RL-QAS for crafting ansatzes tailored to the variational quantum state diagonalization problem. Our investigation includes a comprehensive analysis of various dimensions, such as the entanglement thresholds of the resultant states, the impact of initial conditions on the performance of RL-agent, the phase change behavior of correlation in concurrence bounds, and the discrete contributions of qubits in deducing eigenvalues through conditional entropy metrics. We leverage these insights to devise an optimal, admissible QAS to diagonalize random quantum states. Furthermore, the methodologies presented herein offer a generalised framework for constructing reward functions within RL-QAS applicable to variational quantum algorithms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the extension of classical games to the quantum domain, generated by the addition of one unitary strategy to two classical strategies of each player. The conditions that need to be met by unitary operations to ensure that the extended game is invariant with respect to the isomorphic transformations of the input game are determined. It has been shown that there are three types of these extensions, two of them are purely quantum. On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that the extensions of two versions of the same classical game by a unitary operator that does not meet these conditions may result in quantum games that are non-equivalent, e.g. having different Nash equilibria. We use the obtained results to extend the classical Prisoner's Dilemma game to a quantum game that has a unique Nash equilibrium closer to Pareto-optimal solutions than the original one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baumgratz, Cramer and Plenio established a rigorous framework (BCP framework) for quantifying the coherence of quantum states [\href{http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.140401}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 140401 (2014)}]. In BCP framework, a quantum state is called incoherent if it is diagonal in the fixed orthonormal basis, and a coherence measure should satisfy some conditions. For a fixed orthonormal basis, if a quantum state $\rho $ has nonzero imaginary part, then $\rho $ must be coherent. How to quantitatively characterize this fact? In this work, we show that any coherence measure $C$ in BCP framework has the property $C(\rho )-C($Re$\rho )\geq 0$ if $C$ is invariant under state complex conjugation, i.e., $C(\rho )=C(\rho ^{\ast })$, here $\rho ^{\ast }$ is the conjugate of $\rho ,$ Re$\rho $ is the real part of $\rho .$ If $C$ does not satisfy $C(\rho )=C(\rho ^{\ast }),$ we can define a new coherence measure $C^{\prime }(\rho )=\frac{1}{2}[C(\rho )+C(\rho ^{\ast })]$ such that $C^{\prime }(\rho )=C^{\prime }(\rho ^{\ast }).$ We also establish some similar results for bosonic Gaussian states.</description>

      <title>From Stochastic Hamiltonian to Quantum Simulation: Exploring Memory Effects in Exciton Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unraveling of open quantum system dynamics in terms of stochastic quantum trajectories offers a picture of open system dynamics that consistently considers memory effects stemming from the finite correlation time of environment fluctuations. These fluctuations significantly influence the coherence and energy transport properties of excitonic systems. When their correlation time is comparable to the timescale of the Hamiltonian evolution, it leads to the departure of open system dynamics from the Markovian limit. In this work, we leverage the unraveling of exciton dynamics through stochastic Hamiltonian propagators to design quantum circuits that simulate exciton transport, capturing finite memory effects. In addition to enabling the synthesis of parametrizable quantum circuits, stochastic unitary propagators provide a transparent framework for investigating non-Markovian effects on exciton transport. Our analysis reveals a nuanced relationship between environment correlation time and transport efficiency, identifying a regime of "memory-assisted" quantum transport where time-correlated fluctuations allow the system to reach higher efficiency. However, this property is not universal and can only be realized in conjunction with specific features of the system Hamiltonian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problems of testing and learning an $n$-qubit $k$-local Hamiltonian from queries to its evolution operator with respect the 2-norm of the Pauli spectrum, or equivalently, the normalized Frobenius norm. For testing whether a Hamiltonian is $\epsilon_1$-close to $k$-local or $\epsilon_2$-far from $k$-local, we show that $O(1/(\epsilon_2-\epsilon_1)^{8})$ queries suffice. This solves two questions posed in a recent work by Bluhm, Caro and Oufkir. For learning up to error $\epsilon$, we show that $\exp(O(k^2+k\log(1/\epsilon)))$ queries suffice. Our proofs are simple, concise and based on Pauli-analytic techniques.</description>

      <title>Coarse-grained quantum state tomography with optimal POVM construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing an integrated large-scale qubit system of realistic size requires addressing the challenge of physical crowding among qubits. This constraint poses an issue of coarse-grained (CG) measurement, wherein information from the multi-qubit system is collectively gathered. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to reconstruct the target density matrix from a comprehensive set of Positive Operator-Valued Measures (POVM) using a Parameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) under the constraint of CG measurement. We improve the robustness and stability of CG quantum state tomography (QST) by optimizing the POVM set to achieve a generalized symmetric informationally complete (GSIC) POVM through maximization of the von Neumann entropy. This optimized construction of CG-POVMs is scalable to an N-qubit system. We further discuss a more efficient construction of N-qubit CG-QST without exponential increases in two-qubit gates or circuit depth per measurement. Our scheme offers a viable pathway towards a detector-efficient large-scale solid-state embedded qubit platform by reconstructing crucial quantum information from collective measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article considers the generative modeling of the states of quantum systems, and an approach based on denoising diffusion model is proposed. The key contribution is an algorithmic innovation that respects the physical nature of quantum states. More precisely, the commonly used density matrix representation of mixed-state has to be complex-valued Hermitian, positive semi-definite, and trace one. Generic diffusion models, or other generative methods, may not be able to generate data that strictly satisfy these structural constraints, even if all training data do. To develop a machine learning algorithm that has physics hard-wired in, we leverage the recent development of Mirror Diffusion Model and design a previously unconsidered mirror map, to enable strict structure-preserving generation. Both unconditional generation and conditional generation via classifier-free guidance are experimentally demonstrated efficacious, the latter even enabling the design of new quantum states when generated on unseen labels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical method to sample the distributions of charge, heat, and entropy production in open quantum systems coupled strongly to macroscopic reservoirs, with both temporal and energy resolution and beyond the linear-response regime. Our method exploits the mesoscopic-leads formulation, where macroscopic reservoirs are modeled by a finite collection of modes that are continuously damped toward thermal equilibrium by an appropriate Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation. Focussing on non-interacting fermionic systems, we access the time-resolved full counting statistics through a trajectory unraveling of the master equation. We show that the integral fluctuation theorems for the total entropy production, as well as the martingale and uncertainty entropy production, hold. Furthermore, we investigate the fluctuations of the dissipated heat in finite-time information erasure. Conceptually, our approach extends the continuous-time trajectory description of quantum stochastic thermodynamics beyond the regime of weak system-environment coupling.</description>

Abstract: Quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) tasks are very important in chemistry, finance, job scheduling, and so on, which can be represented using graph structures, with the variables as nodes and the interaction between them as edges. Variational quantum algorithms, especially the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and its variants, present a promising way, potentially exceeding the capabilities of classical algorithms, for addressing QUBO tasks. However, the possibility of using message-passing machines, inspired by classical graph neural networks, to enhance the power and performance of these quantum algorithms for QUBO tasks was not investigated. This study introduces a novel variational quantum graph optimization algorithm that integrates the message-passing mechanism, which demonstrates significant improvements in performance for solving QUBO problems in terms of resource efficiency and solution precision, compared to QAOA, its variants, and other quantum graph neural networks. Furthermore, in terms of scalability on QUBO tasks, our algorithm shows superior performance compared to QAOA, presenting a substantial advancement in the field of quantum approximate optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-induced quantum computation with continuous-variable cluster states utilizes teleportation propagating the states through the cluster accompanied by non-Gaussian measurements and feedforward control. We analyze such propagation of a quantum non-Gaussian state with nonlinear squeezing through a small cluster state and show that when a nonlinear feedforward is involved in the teleportation protocol, higher nonlinear squeezing can be transferred. In a probabilistic regime, the improvement can be manifested even with current experimental resources. Better processing of non-Gaussian states can bring us closer to the necessary interplay between cluster states and non-Gaussianity required by quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new class of quantum states is introduced by demanding that the computational measurement statistics approach the Boltzmann distribution of higher-order strongly coupled Ising models. The states, referred to as $n$-coupled states, are superpositions of even or odd parity $n$-qubit states, generalize Bell states, and form an orthonormal basis for the $n$-qubit Hilbert space. For any $n$, the states are maximally connected and locally maximally entangled. It is proven that the $n$-qubit W and GHZ multipartite entanglement classes have vanishing hyperdeterminant for all $n\geq 3$ and $n\geq 4$, respectively, and that the $n$-coupled states fall in the latter. Still, multiple novel protocols for multi-party secure dense coding and stabiliser code construction are presented, which rely on the structure of $n$-coupled states as well as symmetry-breaking phase perturbations.</description>

      <title>Disentangling transitions in topological order induced by boundary decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of topological orders subject to decoherence on the bipartition boundary. Focusing on the toric codes in $d$ space dimensions for $d=2,3,4$, we explore whether the boundary decoherence may be able to induce a disentangling transition, characterized by the destruction of mixed-state long-range entanglement across the bipartition, measured by topological entanglement negativity. A key insight of our approach is the connection between the negativity spectrum of the decohered mixed states and emergent symmetry-protected topological orders under certain symmetry-preserving perturbation localized on the bipartition boundary. This insight allows us to analytically derive the exact results of entanglement negativity without using a replica trick.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Taking cue from the recent experimental realization of metallic phases in Kagome materials we report the low temperature signatures and thermal scales of Kagome metals and insulators, determined in the framework of the Kagome Hubbard model, using a non perturbative numerical approach. In contrast to the existing consensus we establish a flat band localized insulator in the weak coupling regime which crosses over to a non Fermi liquid (NFL) metal at intermediate coupling, followed by a first order metal-Mott insulator transition in the strong coupling regime. We provide the first accurate estimates of the thermal scales of this model and analyze the NFL phases in terms of resilient quasiparticles and short range magnetic correlations. With our unprecedented access to the low temperature phases and sufficiently large system sizes, we provide the essential benchmarks for the prospective experiments on the Kagome metal and insulators in terms of their thermodynamic, spectroscopic and transport signatures.</description>

Abstract: Symplectic eigenvalues are known to satisfy analogs of several classic eigenvalue inequalities. Of these is a set of weak supermajorization relations concerning symplectic eigenvalues that are weaker analogs of some majorization relations corresponding to eigenvalues. The aim of this letter is to establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the saturation of the symplectic weak supermajorization relations by majorization.</description>

      <title>Witnessing Quantum Entanglement Using Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although entanglement is both a central ingredient in our understanding of quantum many-body systems and an essential resource for quantum technologies, we only have a limited ability to quantify entanglement in real quantum materials. Thus far, entanglement metrology in quantum materials has been limited to measurements involving Hermitian operators, such as the detection of spin entanglement using inelastic neutron scattering. Here, we devise a method to extract the quantum Fisher information (QFI) from non-Hermitian operators and formulate an entanglement witness for resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). Our approach is then applied to the model iridate dimer system Ba$_3$CeIr$_2$O$_9$ and used to directly test for entanglement of the electronic orbitals between neighboring Ir sites. We find that entanglement is challenging to detect under standard conditions, but that it could be achieved by analyzing the outgoing x-ray polarization or via specific choices of momentum and energy. Our protocol provides a new handle for entanglement detection, which offers routes to related types of entanglement witness (such as orbitally-resolved measurements) and to the generalization to out-of-equilibrium settings accessed in ultrafast settings.</description>

      <title>Unvortex Lattice and Topological Defects in Rigidly Rotating Multicomponent Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By examining the characteristics of a rotating ferromagnetic spinor condensate through the perspective of large spin, we uncover a novel kind of topological point defect in the magnetization texture. These defects are predicted not by the conventional homotopy group analysis but by the Riemann-Hurwitz formula. The spin texture in the system is described by an equal-area mapping from the plane to the sphere of magnetization, forming a lattice of uniformly charged Skyrmions. This lattice carries doubly-quantized (winding number = 2) point defects arranged on the sphere in a tetrahedral configuration. The fluid is found to be rotating rigidly, except at the point defects where the vorticity vanishes. This vorticity structure contrasts with the well-known vortex lattice in scalar rotating superfluids, where vorticity concentrates exclusively within defect points, forming an unconventional "unvortex" lattice. Numerical results are presented, which are in agreement with the aforementioned predictions.</description>

      <title>Instability of quadratic band degeneracies and the emergence of Dirac points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the Schr\"{o}dinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$, where the potential $V$ is $\mathbb{Z}^2$-periodic and invariant under spatial inversion, complex conjugation, and $\pi/2$ rotation. We show that, under typical small linear deformations of $V$, the quadratic band degeneracy points, occurring over the high-symmetry quasimomentum ${\bf M}$ (see [24, 25]) each split into two separated degeneracies over perturbed quasimomenta ${\bf D}^+$ and ${\bf D}^-$, and that these degeneracies are Dirac points. The local character of the degenerate dispersion surfaces about the emergent Dirac points are tilted, elliptical cones. Correspondingly, the dynamics of wavepackets spectrally localized near either ${\bf D}^+$ or ${\bf D}^-$ are governed by a system of Dirac equations with an advection term. Generalizations are discussed.</description>

      <title>Current dependence of the low bias resistance of small capacitance Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dc current-voltage characteristics of small Josephson junctions reveal features that are not observed in larger junctions, in particular, a switch to the finite voltage state at current values much less than the expected critical current of the junction and a finite resistance in the nominally superconducting regime. Both phenomena are due to the increased sensitivity to noise associated with the small capacitance of the Josephson junction and have been extensively studied a few decades ago. Here I focus on the current bias dependence of the differential resistance of the junction at low current bias in the nominally superconducting regime, using a quantum Langevin equation approach that enables a physically transparent incorporation of the noise environment of the junction. A similar approach might be useful in modeling the sensitivity of superconducting qubits to noise in the microwave regime.</description>

      <title>The Application of Tailored Fields for Studying Chirality and Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrashort laser pulses pose unique tools to trigger and probe the fastest charge dynamics in matter, allowing the investigation of fundamental physical phenomena with unprecedented resolution in space, time, and energy. One of the most fascinating opportunities that ultrashort pulses offer is the possibility of modulating and investigating symmetries by tailoring the properties of the laser beam in the spatial and polarization domains, effectively controlling symmetry breaking on multiple levels. In particular, this allows probing chiral matter and ultrafast chiral dynamics. In recent years, the development of highly sensitive approaches for studying chirality has been a hot topic in physics and chemistry that has developed largely separately from the field of tailored light. This perspective discusses the individual and joint evolution of these fields with an emphasis on how the fields have already cross-fertilized, opening new opportunities in science. We outline a future outlook of how the topics are expected to fully merge and mutually evolve, emphasizing outstanding open issues.</description>

      <title>Dressed Majorana fermion in a hybrid nanowire</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy theory of hybrid nanowire systems fails to define Majorana fermion (MF) in the strong tunneling and magnetic field strength. To address this limitation, we propose a holistic approach to define MF in which the quasi-excitation in nanowire and superconductor constitutes together its own ``antiparticles''. This definition is general, beyond the constraint presented in the low-energy theory. It reveals that the Majorana phase depends not only on the chemical potential and Zeeman energy in nanowire but also on those of superconductor, and that the mismatch of chemical potential leads not to observe MF. Such a broader perspective provides more specific experimental guidance under various conditions</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression and low-energy scattering of heavy mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently entanglement suppression was proposed to be one possible origin of emergent symmetries. Here we test this conjecture in the context of heavy meson scatterings. The low-energy interactions of $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ and $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ are closely related to the hadronic molecular candidates $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$, respectively, and can be described by a nonrelativistic effective Lagrangian manifesting heavy-quark spin symmetry, which includes only constant contact potentials at leading order. We explore entanglement suppression in a tensor-product framework to treat both the isospin and spin degrees of freedom. Using the $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ as inputs, we find that entanglement suppression indeed leads to an emergent symmetry, namely, a light-quark spin symmetry, and as such the $D^{(*)}\bar D^{(*)}$ or $D^{(*)} D^{(*)}$ interaction strengths for a given total isospin do not depend on the total angular momentum of light (anti)quarks. The $X(3872)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ are predicted to have five and one isoscalar partner, respectively, while the corresponding partner numbers derived solely from heavy-quark spin symmetry are three and one, respectively. The predictions need to be confronted with experimental data and lattice QCD results to further test the entanglement suppression conjecture.</description>

      <title>Regularized relativistic corrections for polyelectronic and polyatomic systems with explicitly correlated Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drachmann's regularization approach is implemented for floating explicitly correlated Gaussians (fECGs) and molecular systems. Earlier applications of Drachmannized relativistic corrections for molecular systems were hindered due to the unknown analytic matrix elements of $1/r_{ix}1/r_{jy}$-type operators with fECGs. In the present work, one of the $1/r$ factors is approximated by a linear combination of Gaussians, which results in calculable integrals. The numerical approach is found to be precise and robust over a range of molecular systems and nuclear configurations, and thus, it opens the route towards an automated evaluation of high-precision relativistic corrections over potential energy surfaces of polyatomic systems. Furthermore, the newly developed integration approach makes it possible to construct the matrix representation of the square of the electronic Hamiltonian relevant for energy lower-bound as well as time-dependent computations of molecular systems with a flexible and high-precision fECG basis representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate interacting with a gravitational wave for the case when the gravitational fluctuations are quantized in order to incorporate quantum gravity effects into the theory. We observe that the solution of the time-dependent part of the pseudo-Goldstone boson has infusions from the noise induced by gravitons and the corresponding differential equation of motion is Langevin-like. Using this result, we obtain the quantum gravity modified Fisher information which has been termed as the quantum gravitational Fisher information (QGFI). The inverse square root of the stochastic average of the QGFI gives the minimum uncertainty in the measurement of the gravitational wave amplitude. The minimum uncertainty does not go to infinity as the measurement time approaches zero in a quantum gravity setup rather it has a measurable finite value for gravitons with high squeezing. Finally, we observe the effect of decoherence due to interacting phonon modes in the QGFI and observe a less obvious decoherence effect for higher squeezing of the initial graviton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive review on the state-of-the-art of the approximate analytic approaches describing the finite-temperature thermodynamic quantities of the Lieb-Liniger model of the one-dimensional (1D) Bose gas with contact repulsive interactions. This paradigmatic model of quantum many-body-theory plays an important role in many areas of physics -- thanks to its integrability and possible experimental realization using, e.g., ensembles of ultracold bosonic atoms confined to quasi-1D geometries. The thermodynamics of the uniform Lieb-Liniger gas can be obtained numerically using the exact thermal Bethe ansatz (TBA) method, first derived in 1969 by Yang and Yang. However, the TBA numerical calculations do not allow for the in-depth understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms that govern the thermodynamic behavior of the Lieb-Liniger gas at finite temperature. Our work is then motivated by the insights that emerge naturally from the transparency of closed-form analytic results, which are derived here in six different regimes of the gas and which exhibit an excellent agreement with the TBA numerics. Our findings can be further adopted for characterising the equilibrium properties of inhomogeneous (e.g., harmonically trapped) 1D Bose gases within the local density approximation and for the development of improved hydrodynamic theories, allowing for the calculation of breathing mode frequencies which depend on the underlying thermodynamic equation of state. Our analytic approaches can be applied to other systems including impurities in a quantum bath, liquid helium-4, and ultracold Bose gas mixtures.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity CZ Gates in Double Quantum Dot -- Circuit QED Systems Beyond the Rotating-Wave Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor double quantum dot (DQD) qubits coupled via superconducting microwave resonators provide a powerful means of long-range manipulation of the qubits' spin and charge degrees of freedom. Quantum gates can be implemented by parametrically driving the qubits while their transition frequencies are detuned from the resonator frequency. Long-range two-qubit CZ gates have been proposed for the DQD spin qubit within the rotating-wave approximation (RWA). Rapid gates demand strong coupling, but RWA breaks down when coupling strengths become significant relative to system frequencies. Therefore, understanding the detrimental impact of time-dependent terms ignored by RWA is critical for high-fidelity operation. Here, we go beyond RWA to study CZ gate fidelity for both DQD spin and charge qubits. We propose a novel parametric drive on the charge qubit that produces fewer time-dependent terms and show that it outperforms its spin counterpart. We find that drive amplitude - a parameter dropped in RWA - is critical for optimizing fidelity and map out high-fidelity regimes. Our results demonstrate the necessity of going beyond RWA in understanding how long-range gates can be realized in DQD qubits, with charge qubits offering considerable advantages in high-fidelity operation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong-field ionization by counter-rotating two-color laser fields produces quantum interference between photoelectrons emitted on the leading and trailing edges of the laser field oscillations. We show that in chiral molecules, this interference is asymmetric along the light propagation direction and strongly enhances the sensitivity of the attoclock scheme to molecular chirality. Calculations in a toy-model molecule with a short-range chiral potential show that this enhanced sensitivity already emerges at the exit of the tunnel. We investigate the possible sources of chiral sensitivity in the tunneling process, and find that the interference between electron vortices plays a crucial role in the chiral response.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces quantum circuit $C^*$-algebra net, which provides a connection between $C^*$-algebra nets proposed in classical machine learning and quantum circuits. Using $C^*$-algebra, a generalization of the space of complex numbers, we can represent quantum gates as weight parameters of a neural network. By introducing additional parameters, we can induce interaction among multiple circuits constructed by quantum gates. This interaction enables the circuits to share information among them, which contributes to improved generalization performance in machine learning tasks. As an application, we propose to use the quantum circuit $C^*$-algebra net to encode classical data into quantum states, which enables us to integrate classical data into quantum algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate that the interaction among circuits improves performance significantly in image classification, and encoded data by the quantum circuit $C^*$-algebra net are useful for downstream quantum machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Facilities and practices for linear response Hubbard parameters U and J in Abinit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Members of the DFT+U family of functionals are increasingly prevalent methods of addressing errors intrinsic to (semi-) local exchange-correlation functionals at minimum computational cost, but require their parameters U and J to be calculated in situ for a given system of interest, simulation scheme, and runtime parameters. The SCF linear response approach offers ab initio acquisition of the U and has recently been extended to compute the J analogously, which measures localized errors related to exchange-like effects. We introduce a renovated post-processor, the lrUJ utility, together with this detailed best-practices guide, to enable users of the popular, open-source Abinit first-principles simulation suite to engage easily with in situ Hubbard parameters and streamline their incorporation into material simulations of interest. Features of this utility, which may also interest users and developers of other DFT codes, include $n$-degree polynomial regression, error analysis, Python plotting facilities, didactic documentation, and avenues for further developments. In this technical introduction and guide, we place particular emphasis on the intricacies and potential pitfalls introduced by the projector augmented wave (PAW) method, SCF mixing schemes, and non-linear response, several of which are translatable to DFT+U(+J) implementations in other packages.</description>

Abstract: Simulating key static and dynamic properties of matter -- from creation in the Big Bang to evolution into sub-atomic and astrophysical environments -- arising from the underlying fundamental quantum fields of the Standard Model and their effective descriptions, lies beyond the capabilities of classical computation alone. Advances in quantum technologies have improved control over quantum entanglement and coherence to the point where robust simulations are anticipated to be possible in the foreseeable future. We discuss the emerging area of quantum simulations of Standard-Model physics, challenges that lie ahead, and opportunities for progress in the context of nuclear and high-energy physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents the application of continuous Floquet theory in solid-state NMR. Continuous Floquet theory extends traditional Floquet theory to non-continuous Hamiltonians, enabling the description of observable effects not fully captured by traditional Floquet theory due to its requirement for a periodic Hamiltonian. We present closed-form expressions for computing first and second-order effective Hamiltonians, streamlining integration with traditional Floquet theory and facilitating application in NMR experiments featuring multiple modulation frequencies. Subsequently, we show examples of the practical application of Continuous Floquet theory by investigating several solid-state NMR experiments. These examples illustrate the importance of the duration of the pulse scheme regarding the width of the resonance conditions and the near-resonance behavior.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we discuss a historical point regarding Schr\"odinger's discovery of the famous quantum wave equation in 1926 following de Broglie's fundamental works published in 1923-1925 regarding the introduction of matter waves. Drawing on the work of historians and personal analysis, we show that de Broglie was very close to the discovery of the Schr\"odinger equation (at least for the stationary one-electron problem).</description>

      <title>Toward Reliable Dipole Moments without Single Excitations: The Role of Orbital Rotations and Dynamical Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dipole moment is a crucial molecular property linked to a molecular system's bond polarity and overall electronic structure. To that end, the electronic dipole moment, which results from the electron density of a system, is often used to assess the accuracy and reliability of new electronic structure methods. This work analyses electronic dipole moments computed with the pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) ansatz and its linearized coupled cluster (pCCD-LCC) corrections using the canonical Hartree--Fock and pCCD-optimized (localized) orbital bases. The accuracy of pCCD-based dipole moments is assessed against experimental and CCSD(T) reference values using relaxed and unrelaxed density matrices and different basis set sizes. Our test set comprises molecules of various bonding patterns and electronic structures, exposing pCCD-based methods to a wide range of electron correlation effects. Additionally, we investigate the performance of pCCD-in-DFT dipole moments of some model complexes. Finally, our work indicates the importance of orbital relaxation in the pCCD model and shows the limitations of the linearized couple cluster corrections in predicting electronic dipole moments of multiple-bonded systems. Most importantly, pCCD with a linearized CCD correction can reproduce the dipole moment surfaces in singly-bonded molecules, which are comparable to the multi-reference ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electro-optics serves as the crucial bridge between electronics and photonics, unlocking a wide array of applications ranging from communications and computing to sensing and quantum information. Integrated electro-optics approaches in particular enable essential electronic high-speed control for photonics while offering substantial photonic parallelism for electronics. Recent strides in thin-film lithium niobate photonics have ushered revolutionary advancements in electro-optics. This technology not only offers the requisite strong electro-optic coupling but also boasts ultra-low optical loss and high microwave bandwidth. Further, its tight confinement and compatibility with nanofabrication allow for unprecedented reconfigurability and scalability, facilitating the creation of novel and intricate devices and systems that were once deemed nearly impossible in bulk systems. Building upon this platform, the field has witnessed the emergence of various groundbreaking electro-optic devices surpassing the current state of the art, and introducing functionalities that were previously non-existent. This technological leap forward provides a unique framework to explore various realms of physics as well, including photonic non-Hermitian synthetic dimensions, active topological physics, and quantum electro-optics. In this review, we present the fundamental principles of electro-optics, drawing connections between fundamental science and the forefront of technology. We discuss the accomplishments and future prospects of integrated electro-optics, enabled by thin-film lithium niobate platform.</description>

      <title>Majorana stellar representation for mixed-spin $(s,\frac{1}{2})$ systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02462</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.02462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By describing the evolution of a quantum state with the trajectories of the Majorana stars on a Bloch sphere, Majorana's stellar representation provides an intuitive geometric perspective to comprehend a quantum system with high-dimensional Hilbert space. However, the problem of the representation of a two-spin coupling system on a Bloch sphere has not been solved satisfactorily yet. Here, we present a practical method to resolve the problem for the mixed-spin $(s, 1/2)$ system. The system can be decomposed into two spins: spin-$(s+1/2)$ and spin-$(s-1/2)$ at the coupling bases, which can be regarded as independent spins. Besides, we may write any pure state as a superposition of two orthonormal states with one spin-$(s+1/2)$ state and the other spin-$(s-1/2)$ state. Thus, the whole state can be regarded as a state of a pseudo spin-$1/2$. In this way, the mixed spin decomposes into three spins. Therefore, we can represent the state by $(2s+1)+(2s-1)+1=4s+1$ sets of stars on a Bloch sphere. Finally, to demonstrate our theory, we give some examples that indeed show laconic and symmetric patterns on the Bloch sphere, and unveil the properties of the high-spin system by analyzing the trajectories of the Majorana stars on a Bloch sphere.</description>

      <title>Spin squeezing and concurrence under Lee-Yang dephasing channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2006.06342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lee-Yang zeros are one-to-one mapping to zeros in the coherence of a probe spin coupled to a many-body system. Here, we study the spin squeezing under two different types of Lee-Yang dephasing channels in which the partition functions vanish at Lee-Yang zeros. Under the first type of the channels in which probes are coupled to their own bath, we find that the performance of spin squeezing is improved and its maximum only depends on the initial state. Moreover, the centers of all the concurrence vanishing domains are corresponding to the Lee-Yang zeros. Under the second type of the channels in which probes are coupled to one bath together, the performance of spin squeezing is not improved, however, the concurrence shares almost the same properties under both channels. These results provide new experimental possibilities in many-body physics and extend a new perspective of the relationship between the entanglement and spin squeezing in probes-bath systems.</description>

Abstract: The strong and collective atom-light interactions in cavity-QED systems perform manifold benefits in quantum-enhanced measurements. Here, we study the time-reversal protocol that has been proposed to sense small displacements of the light field, and report the sensitivity of the scheme that could be speeded up to attain the Heisenberg limit (HL).We show the holonomic unitary parametrization process of the scheme and one only need to choose appropriate initial states to pursue the ultimate sensitivity. The scheme may pave an experimentally feasible way to achieve Heisenberg-limited metrology with nonclassical states.</description>

      <title>Stochastic approximate state conversion for entanglement and general quantum resource theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.12646v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories provide a mathematically rigorous way of understanding the nature of various quantum resources. An important problem in any quantum resource theory is to determine how quantum states can be converted into each other within the physical constraints of the theory. The standard approach to this problem is to study approximate or probabilistic transformations. Very few results have been presented on the intermediate regime between probabilistic and approximate transformations. Here, we investigate this intermediate regime, providing limits on both, the fidelity and the probability of state transitions. We derive limitations on the transformations, which are valid in all quantum resource theories, by providing bounds on the maximal transformation fidelity for a given transformation probability. As an application, we show that these bounds imply an upper bound on the asymptotic rates for various classes of states under probabilistic transformations. We also show that the deterministic version of the single copy bounds can be applied for drawing limitations on the manipulation of quantum channels, which goes beyond the previously known bounds of channel manipulations. Furthermore, we completely solve the question of stochastic-approximate state conversion via local operations and classical communication in the following two cases: (i) Both initial and target states are pure bipartite entangled states of arbitrary dimensions. (ii) The target state is a two-qubit entangled state and the initial state is a pure bipartite state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.07806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computation demands significant resources: large numbers of physical qubits must be checked for errors repeatedly to protect quantum data as logic gates are implemented in the presence of noise. We demonstrate that an approach based on the color code can lead to considerable reductions in the resource overheads compared with conventional methods, while remaining compatible with a two-dimensional layout. We propose a lattice surgery scheme that exploits the rich structure of the color-code phase to perform arbitrary pairs of commuting logical Pauli measurements in parallel while keeping the space cost low. Compared to lattice surgery schemes based on the surface code with the same code distance, our approach yields about a $3\times$ improvement in the space-time overhead, obtained from a combination of a $1.5\times$ improvement in spatial overhead together with a $2\times$ speedup due to the parallelisation of commuting logical measurements. Even when taking into account the color code's lower error threshold using current decoders, the overhead is reduced by 10\% at a physical error rate of $10^{-3}$ and by 50\% at $10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Circuit Design with a Standard Cell Approach, with an Application to Neutral Atom Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.04990v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design quantum circuits by using the standard cell approach borrowed from classical circuit design, which can speed-up the layout of circuits with a regular structure. Our standard cells are general and can be used for all types of quantum circuits: error-corrected or not. The standard cell approach enables the formulation of layout-aware routing algorithms. Our method is directly applicable to neutral atom quantum computers supporting qubit shuttling. Such computers enable zoned architectures for memory, processing and measurement, and we design circuits using qubit storages (memory and measurement zones) and standard cells (processing zones). Herein, we use cubic standard cells for Toffoli gates and, starting from a 3D architecture, we design a multiplication circuit. We present evidence that, when compared with automatic routing methods, our layout-aware routers are significantly faster and achieve shallower 3D circuits (by at least 2.5x) and with a lower routing cost. Additionally, our co-design approach can be used to estimate the resources necessary for a quantum computation without using complex compilation methods. We conclude that standard cells, with the support of layout-aware routing, pave the way to very large scale methods for quantum circuit compilation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When creating a quantum system whose natural dynamics provide useful computational operations, designers have two key tools at their disposal: the (constrained) choice of both the Hamiltonian and the the initial state of the system (an encoding). Typically, we fix the design, and utilise encodings post factum to tolerate experimental imperfections. In this paper, we describe a vital insight that incorporates encoding into the design process, with radical consequences. This transforms the study of perfect state transfer from the unrealistic scenario of specifying the Hamiltonian of an entire system to the far more realistic situation of being given a Hamiltonian over which we had no choice in the design, and designing time control of just two parameters to still achieve perfect transfer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum coherence as an important physical resource plays the key role in implementing various quantum tasks, whereas quantum coherence is often deteriorated due to the noise. In this paper, we analyse under which dynamical conditions the $l_1$-norm or the relative entropy of coherence can remain unchanged during the whole evolution (freezing coherence). For single qubit systems, a nice formula is given to realize freezing coherence. Conversely, for a $d\ (d&gt;2)$ dimensional system, we identify universal geometric conditions of freezing coherence. This offers an affirmative answer to the open question: how can one determine whether a unital quantum operation can be decomposed as a convex combination of unitary operations [M. A. Nielsen and I. L. Chuang, Quantum Computation and Quantum Information, (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2000)]. Based on this analysis, we also give a complete classification of coherent states from operational coherence theory. This builds the counterpart of entanglement classification under LOCC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.02459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first high performance compiler for very large scale quantum error correction: it translates an arbitrary quantum circuit to surface code operations based on lattice surgery. Our compiler offers an end to end error correction workflow implemented by a pluggable architecture centered around an intermediate representation of lattice surgery instructions. Moreover, the compiler supports customizable circuit layouts, can be used for quantum benchmarking and includes a quantum resource estimator. The compiler can process millions of gates using a streaming pipeline at a speed geared towards real-time operation of a physical device. We compiled within seconds 80 million logical surface code instructions, corresponding to a high precision Clifford+T implementation of the 128-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT). Our code is open-sourced at \url{https://github.com/latticesurgery-com}.</description>

Abstract: We investigate operator growth in quantum systems with two-dimensional Schr\"odinger group symmetry by studying the Krylov complexity. While feasible for semisimple Lie algebras, cases such as the Schr\"odinger algebra which is characterized by a semi-direct sum structure are complicated. We propose to compute Krylov complexity for this algebra in a natural orthonormal basis, which produces a pentadiagonal structure of the time evolution operator, contrasting the usual tridiagonal Lanczos algorithm outcome. The resulting complexity behaves as expected. We advocate that this approach can provide insights to other non-semisimple algebras.</description>

Here, we present a general method to tackle dissipative phase transitions (DPTs) in non-Markovian systems, extending the scope of dissipative engineering of matter phases to more realistic materials and experiments in the solid-state and atomic, molecular and optical physics. We show how memory effects can be used to reshape phase boundaries but also reveal the existence of DPTs genuinely triggered by non-Markovianity.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Haar Measure Tools in Quantum Information: A Beginner's Tutorial</title>

Abstract: The Haar measure plays a vital role in quantum information, but its study often requires a deep understanding of representation theory, posing a challenge for beginners. This tutorial aims to provide a basic introduction to Haar measure tools in quantum information, utilizing only basic knowledge of linear algebra and thus aiming to make this topic more accessible. The tutorial begins by introducing the Haar measure with a specific emphasis on characterizing the moment operator, an essential element for computing integrals over the Haar measure. It also covers properties of the symmetric subspace and introduces helpful tools like tensor network diagrammatic notation, which aid in visualizing and simplifying calculations. Next, the tutorial explores the concept of unitary designs, providing equivalent definitions, and subsequently explores approximate notions of unitary designs, shedding light on the relationships between these different notions. Practical examples of Haar measure calculations are illustrated, including the derivation of well-known formulas such as the twirling of a quantum channel. Lastly, the tutorial showcases the applications of Haar measure calculations in quantum machine learning and classical shadow tomography.</description>

      <title>Quantum metrology enhanced by the $XY$ spin interaction in a generalized Tavis-Cummings model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum metrology is recognized for its capability to offer high-precision estimation by utilizing quantum resources, such as quantum entanglement. Here, we propose a generalized Tavis-Cummings model by introducing the $XY$ spin interaction to explore the impact of the many-body effect on estimation precision, quantified by the quantum Fisher information (QFI). By deriving the effective description of our model, we establish a closed relationship between the QFI and the spin fluctuation induced by the $XY$ spin interaction. Based on this exact relation, we emphasize the indispensable role of the spin anisotropy in achieving the Heisenberg-scaling precision for estimating a weak magnetic field. Furthermore, we observe that the estimation precision can be enhanced by increasing the strength of the spin anisotropy. We also reveal a clear scaling transition of the QFI in the Tavis-Cummings model with the reduced Ising interaction. Our results contribute to the enrichment of metrology theory by considering many-body effects, and they also present an alternative approach to improving the estimation precision by harnessing the power provided by many-body quantum phases.</description>

      <title>On the expressivity of embedding quantum kernels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most natural connections between quantum and classical machine learning has been established in the context of kernel methods. Kernel methods rely on kernels, which are inner products of feature vectors living in large feature spaces. Quantum kernels are typically evaluated by explicitly constructing quantum feature states and then taking their inner product, here called embedding quantum kernels. Since classical kernels are usually evaluated without using the feature vectors explicitly, we wonder how expressive embedding quantum kernels are. In this work, we raise the fundamental question: can all quantum kernels be expressed as the inner product of quantum feature states? Our first result is positive: Invoking computational universality, we find that for any kernel function there always exists a corresponding quantum feature map and an embedding quantum kernel. The more operational reading of the question is concerned with efficient constructions, however. In a second part, we formalize the question of universality of efficient embedding quantum kernels. For shift-invariant kernels, we use the technique of random Fourier features to show that they are universal within the broad class of all kernels which allow a variant of efficient Fourier sampling. We then extend this result to a new class of so-called composition kernels, which we show also contains projected quantum kernels introduced in recent works. After proving the universality of embedding quantum kernels for both shift-invariant and composition kernels, we identify the directions towards new, more exotic, and unexplored quantum kernel families, for which it still remains open whether they correspond to efficient embedding quantum kernels.</description>

      <title>Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) vs Classical LSTM in Time Series Forecasting: A Comparative Study in Solar Power Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate solar power forecasting is pivotal for the global transition towards sustainable energy systems. This study conducts a meticulous comparison between Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) and classical Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for solar power production forecasting. The primary objective is to evaluate the potential advantages of QLSTMs, leveraging their exponential representational capabilities, in capturing the intricate spatiotemporal patterns inherent in renewable energy data. Through controlled experiments on real-world photovoltaic datasets, our findings reveal promising improvements offered by QLSTMs, including accelerated training convergence and substantially reduced test loss within the initial epoch compared to classical LSTMs. These empirical results demonstrate QLSTM's potential to swiftly assimilate complex time series relationships, enabled by quantum phenomena like superposition. However, realizing QLSTM's full capabilities necessitates further research into model validation across diverse conditions, systematic hyperparameter optimization, hardware noise resilience, and applications to correlated renewable forecasting problems. With continued progress, quantum machine learning can offer a paradigm shift in renewable energy time series prediction, potentially ushering in an era of unprecedented accuracy and reliability in solar power forecasting worldwide. This pioneering work provides initial evidence substantiating quantum advantages over classical LSTM models while acknowledging present limitations. Through rigorous benchmarking grounded in real-world data, our study illustrates a promising trajectory for quantum learning in renewable forecasting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) and quantum master equation (QME) are two main classes of approaches for electronic transport. We discuss various Floquet variances of these formalisms for transport properties of a quantum dot driven via interaction with an external periodic field. We first derived two versions of the Floquet NEGF. We also explore an ansatz of the Floquet NEGF formalism for the interacting systems. In addition, we derived two versions of Floquet QME in the weak interaction regime. With each method, we elaborate on the evaluation of the expectation values of the number and current operators. We examined these methods for transport through a two-level system that is subject to periodic driving. The numerical results of all four methods show good agreement for non-interacting systems in the weak regime. Furthermore, we have observed that circular light can introduce spin current. We expect these Floquet quantum transport methods to be useful in studying molecular junctions exposed to light.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy Preserving Quantum Computing via Projection Operator Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing has been widely applied in various fields, such as quantum physics simulations, quantum machine learning, and big data analysis. However, in the domains of data-driven paradigm, how to ensure the privacy of the database is becoming a vital problem. For classical computing, we can incorporate the concept of differential privacy (DP) to meet the standard of privacy preservation by manually adding the noise. In the quantum computing scenario, researchers have extended classic DP to quantum differential privacy (QDP) by considering the quantum noise. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to satisfy the QDP definition by considering the errors generated by the projection operator measurement, which is denoted as shot noises. Then, we discuss the amount of privacy budget that can be achieved with shot noises, which serves as a metric for the level of privacy protection. Furthermore, we provide the QDP of shot noise in quantum circuits with depolarizing noise. Through numerical simulations, we show that shot noise can effectively provide privacy protection in quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Fracton models from product codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a deep connection between fracton order and product codes. In particular, we propose and analyze conditions on classical seed codes which lead to fracton order in the resulting quantum product codes. Depending on the properties of the input codes, product codes can realize either Type-I or Type-II fracton models, in both nonlocal and local constructions. For the nonlocal case, we show that a recently proposed model of lineons on an irregular graph can be obtained as a hypergraph product code. Interestingly, constrained mobility in this model arises only from glassiness associated with the graph. For the local case, we introduce a novel type of classical LDPC code defined on a planar aperiodic tiling. By considering the specific example of the pinwheel tiling, we demonstrate the systematic construction of local Type-I and Type-II fracton models as product codes. Our work establishes product codes as a natural setting for exploring fracton order.</description>

Abstract: We study the non-degenerate parametric amplifier problem from an algebraic approach of the $SU(1,1)$ group. We write the Hamiltonian of this problem in terms of the boson generators of the $SU(1,1)$ group and the difference operator. We apply the tilting transformation to our results to exactly solve this Hamiltonian and obtain its energy spectrum and eigenfunctions. Then, by assuming that our Hamiltonian is an explicit function of time we calculate its Berry phase. Finally we obtain the Mandel $Q-$parameter of the photon numbers $n_a$ and $n_b$.</description>

      <title>Efficient implementation of discrete-time quantum walks on quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum walks have proven to be a universal model for quantum computation and to provide speed-up in certain quantum algorithms. The discrete-time quantum walk (DTQW) model, among others, is one of the most suitable candidates for circuit implementation, due to its discrete nature. Current implementations, however, are usually characterized by quantum circuits of large size and depth, which leads to a higher computational cost and severely limits the number of time steps that can be reliably implemented on current quantum computers. In this work, we propose an efficient and scalable quantum circuit implementing the DTQW on the $2^n$-cycle based on the diagonalization of the conditional shift operator. For $t$ time-steps of the DTQW, the proposed circuit requires only $O(n^2 + nt)$ two-qubit gates compared to the $O(n^2 t)$ of the current most efficient implementation based on quantum Fourier transforms. We test the proposed circuit on an IBM quantum device for a Hadamard DTQW on the $4$- and $8$-cycle characterized by periodic dynamics and recurrent generation of maximally entangled single-particle states. Experimental results are meaningful well beyond the regime of few time steps, paving the way for reliable implementation and use on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Property Testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locality is a fundamental feature of many physical time evolutions. Assumptions on locality and related structural properties also underlie recently proposed procedures for learning an unknown Hamiltonian from access to the induced time evolution. However, no protocols to rigorously test whether an unknown Hamiltonian is local were known. We investigate Hamiltonian locality testing as a property testing problem, where the task is to determine whether an unknown $n$-qubit Hamiltonian $H$ is $k$-local or $\varepsilon$-far from all $k$-local Hamiltonians, given access to the time evolution along $H$. First, we emphasize the importance of the chosen distance measure: With respect to the operator norm, a worst-case distance measure, incoherent quantum locality testers require $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n)$ many time evolution queries and an expected total evolution time of $\tilde{\Omega}(2^n / \varepsilon)$, and even coherent testers need $\Omega(2^{n/2})$ many queries and $\Omega(2^{n/2}/\varepsilon)$ total evolution time. In contrast, when distances are measured according to the normalized Frobenius norm, corresponding to an average-case distance, we give a sample-, time-, and computationally efficient incoherent Hamiltonian locality testing algorithm based on randomized measurements. In fact, our procedure can be used to simultaneously test a wide class of Hamiltonian properties beyond locality. Finally, we prove that learning a general Hamiltonian remains exponentially hard with this average-case distance, thereby establishing an exponential separation between Hamiltonian testing and learning. Our work initiates the study of property testing for quantum Hamiltonians, demonstrating that a broad class of Hamiltonian properties is efficiently testable even with limited quantum capabilities, and positioning Hamiltonian testing as an independent area of research alongside Hamiltonian learning.</description>

Abstract: Efficient simulation of quantum computers relies on understanding and exploiting the properties of quantum states. This is the case for methods such as tensor networks, based on entanglement, and the tableau formalism, which represents stabilizer states. In this work, we integrate these two approaches to present a generalization of the tableau formalism used for Clifford circuit simulation. We explicitly prove how to update our formalism with Clifford gates, non-Clifford gates, and measurements, enabling universal circuit simulation. We also discuss how the framework allows for efficient simulation of more states, raising some interesting questions on the representation power of tensor networks and the quantum properties of resources such as entanglement and magic, and support our claims with simulations.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Protected Topological Phases of Mixed States in the Doubled Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay of symmetry and topology in quantum many-body mixed states has recently garnered significant interest. In a phenomenon not seen in pure states, mixed states can exhibit average symmetries -- symmetries that act on component states while leaving the ensemble invariant. In this work, we systematically characterize symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of short-range entangled (SRE) mixed states of spin systems -- protected by both average and exact symmetries -- by studying their pure Choi states in a doubled Hilbert space, where the familiar notions and tools for SRE and SPT pure states apply. This advantage of the doubled space comes with a price: extra symmetries as well as subtleties around how hermiticity and positivity of the original density matrix constrain the possible SPT invariants. Nevertheless, the doubled space perspective allows us to obtain a systematic classification of mixed-state SPT (MSPT) phases. We also investigate the robustness of MSPT invariants under symmetric finite-depth quantum channels, the bulk-boundary correspondence for MSPT phases, and the consequences of the MSPT invariants for the separability of mixed states and the symmetry-protected sign problem. In addition to MSPT phases, we study the patterns of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of mixed states, including the phenomenon of exact-to-average SSB, and the order parameters that detect them. Mixed state SSB is related to an ingappability constraint on symmetric Lindbladian dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observe non-perturbative high harmonic generation in solids driven by a macroscopic quantum state of light, bright squeezed vacuum (BSV), which we generate in a single spatiotemporal mode. The BSV-driven process is considerably more efficient in the generation of high harmonics than classical light of the same mean intensity. Due to its broad photon-number distribution, covering states from $0$ to $2 \times 10^{13}$ photons per pulse, and sub-cycle electric field fluctuations over $\pm1\hbox{V}/\hbox{\r{A}}$, BSV provides access to free carrier dynamics within a much broader range of peak intensities than accessible with classical light. Our findings contribute to recent developments of quantum optics with extreme intensities, moving beyond its traditional focus on low photon numbers, and providing a new method for exploring extreme nonlinearities in solids.</description>

Abstract: We study the complexity of estimating the partition function $\mathsf{Z}(\beta)=\sum_{x\in\chi} e^{-\beta H(x)}$ for a Gibbs distribution characterized by the Hamiltonian $H(x)$. We provide a simple and natural lower bound for quantum algorithms that solve this task by relying on reflections through the coherent encoding of Gibbs states. Our primary contribution is a $\varOmega(1/\epsilon)$ lower bound for the number of reflections needed to estimate the partition function with a quantum algorithm. The proof is based on a reduction from the problem of estimating the Hamming weight of an unknown binary string.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Circuits for Non-Unitary and Unitary Diagonal Operators with Space-Time-Accuracy trade-offs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unitary and non-unitary diagonal operators are fundamental building blocks in quantum algorithms with applications in the resolution of partial differential equations, Hamiltonian simulations, the loading of classical data on quantum computers (quantum state preparation) and many others. In this paper, we introduce a general approach to implement unitary and non-unitary diagonal operators with efficient-adjustable-depth quantum circuits. The depth, i.e. the number of layers of quantum gates of the quantum circuit, is reducible with respect either to the width, i.e. the number of ancilla qubits, or to the accuracy between the implemented operator and the target one. While exact methods have an optimal exponential scaling either in terms of size, i.e. the total number of primitive quantum gates, or width, approximate methods prove to be efficient for the class of diagonal operators depending on smooth, at least differentiable, functions. Our approach is general enough to allow any method for diagonal operators to become adjustable-depth or approximate, decreasing the depth of the circuit by increasing its width or its approximation level. This feature offers flexibility and can match with the hardware limitations in coherence time or cumulative gate error. We illustrate these methods by performing quantum state preparation and non-unitary-real-space simulation of the diffusion equation: an initial Gaussian function is prepared on a set of qubits before being evolved through the non-unitary evolution operator of the diffusion process.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Boundary between Quantum Mechanics and Classical Model by EPR-Steering Inequality</title>

Abstract: In quantum information, the Werner state is a benchmark to test the boundary between quantum mechanics and classical models. There have been three well-known critical values for the two-qubit Werner state, i.e., $V_{\rm c}^{\rm E}=1/3$ characterizing the boundary between entanglement and separable model, $V_{\rm c}^{\rm B}=1/K_G(3)$ characterizing the boundary between Bell's nonlocality and the local-hidden-variable model, while $V_{\rm c}^{\rm S}=1/2$ characterizing the boundary between Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering and the local-hidden-state model. So far, the problem of $V_{\rm c}^{\rm E}=1/3$ has been completely solved by an inequality involving in the positive-partial-transpose criterion, while how to reveal the other two critical values by the inequality approach are still open. In this work, we focus on EPR steering, which is a form of quantum nonlocality intermediate between entanglement and Bell's nonlocality. By proposing the optimal $N$-setting linear EPR-steering inequalities, we have successfully obtained the desired value $V_{\rm c}^{\rm S}=1/2$ for the two-qubit Werner state, thus resolving the long-standing problem.</description>

      <title>Magic Boundaries of 3D Color Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate boundaries of 3D color codes and provide a systematic classification into 101 distinct boundary types. The elementary types of boundaries are codimension-1 (2D) boundaries that condense electric particle ($Z$-type) or magnetic flux ($X$-type) excitations in the 3D color code, including the $Z$-boundary condensing only electric particles, the $X$-boundary condensing only the magnetic flux, and other boundaries condensing both electric and magnetic excitations. Two novel types of boundaries can be generated based on certain elementary types. The first type is generated by applying transversal-$T$ gate on the entire code in the presence of the $X$-boundary, which effectively sweeps the codimension-1 (2D) $T$-domain wall across the system and attaches it to the $X$-boundary. Since the $T$-domain wall cannot condense on the $X$-boundary, a new magic boundary is produced, where the boundary stabilizers contain $XS$-stabilizers going beyond the conventional Pauli stabilizer formalism and hence contains `magic'. Neither electric nor magnetic excitations can condense on such a magic boundary, and only the composite of the magnetic flux and codimension-2 (1D) $S$-domain wall can condense on it, which makes the magic boundary going beyond the classification of the Lagrangian subgroup. The second type is generated by applying transversal-$S$ gate on a codimension-1 (2D) submanifold in the presence of certain codimension-1 (2D) boundaries, which effectively sweeps the $S$-domain wall across this submanifold and attaches it onto the boundary. This generates a codimension-2 (1D) nested boundary at the intersection. We also connect these novel boundaries to their previously discovered counterpart in the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory equivalent to three copies of 3D toric codes, where the $S$ and $T$ domain walls correspond to gauged symmetry-protected topological (SPT) defects.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimal Circuit Size for Sparse Quantum State Preparation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05147v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared to general quantum states, the sparse states arise more frequently in the field of quantum computation. In this work, we consider the preparation for $n$-qubit sparse quantum states with $s$ non-zero amplitudes and propose two algorithms. The first algorithm uses $O(ns/\log n + n)$ gates, improving upon previous methods by $O(\log n)$. We further establish a matching lower bound for any algorithm which is not amplitude-aware and employs at most $\operatorname{poly}(n)$ ancillary qubits. The second algorithm is tailored for binary strings that exhibit a short Hamiltonian path. An application is the preparation of $U(1)$-invariant state with $k$ down-spins in a chain of length $n$, including Bethe states, for which our algorithm constructs a circuit of size $O\left(\binom{n}{k}\log n\right)$. This surpasses previous results by $O(n/\log n)$ and is close to the lower bound $O\left(\binom{n}{k}\right)$. Both the two algorithms shrink the existing gap theoretically and provide increasing advantages numerically.</description>

      <title>Strange Correlation Function for Average Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Average symmetry-protected topological (ASPT) phase is a generalization of symmetry-protected topological phases to disordered systems or open quantum systems. We devise a "strange correlator" in one and two dimensions to detect nontrivial ASPT states. We demonstrate that for a nontrivial ASPT phase this strange correlator exhibits long-range or power-law behavior. We explore the connection between the strange correlators and correlation functions in two-dimensional loop models with quantum corrections, leading to the exact scaling exponents of the strange correlators.</description>

      <title>Incorporation of random alloy GaBi$_{x}$As$_{1-x}$ barriers in InAs quantum dot molecules: alloy strain and orbital effects towards enhanced tunneling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10115v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-assembled InAs quantum dots (QDs), which have long hole-spin coherence times and are amenable to optical control schemes, have long been explored as building blocks for qubit architectures. One such design consists of vertically stacking two QDs to create a quantum dot molecule (QDM). The two dots can be resonantly tuned to form "molecule-like" coupled hole states from the hybridization of hole states otherwise localized in each respective dot. Furthermore, spin-mixing of the hybridized states in dots offset along their stacking direction enables qubit rotation to be driven optically, allowing for an all-optical qubit control scheme. Increasing the magnitude of this spin mixing is important for optical quantum control protocols. To enhance the tunnel coupling and spin-mixing across the dots, we introduce Bi in the GaAs inter-dot barrier. Previously, we showed how to model InAs/GaBiAs in an atomistic tight-binding formalism, and how the dot energy levels are affected by the alloy. In this paper, we discuss the lowering of the tunnel barrier, which results in a three fold increase of hole tunnel coupling strength in the presence of a 7% alloy. Additionally, we show how an asymmetric strain between the two dots caused by the alloy shifts the resonance. Finally, we discuss device geometries for which the introduction of Bi is most advantageous.</description>

      <title>Correlated volumes for extended wavefunctions on a random-regular graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the ergodic properties of a metallic wavefunction for the Anderson model in a disordered random-regular graph with branching number $k=2.$ A few q-moments $I_q$ associated with the zero energy eigenvector are numerically computed up to sizes $N=4\times 10^6.$ We extract their corresponding fractal dimensions $D_q$ in the thermodynamic limit together with correlated volumes $N_q$ that control finite-size effects. At intermediate values of disorder $W,$ we obtain ergodicity $D_q=1$ for $q=1,2$ and correlation volumes that increase fast upon approaching the Anderson transition $\log(\log(N_q))\sim W.$ We then focus on the extraction of the volume $N_0$ associated with the typical value of the wavefunction $e^{&lt;\log|\psi|^2&gt;},$ which follows a similar tendency as the ones for $N_1$ or $N_2.$ Its value at intermediate disorders is close, but smaller, to the so-called ergodic volume previously found via the super-symmetric formalism and belief propagator algorithms. None of the computed correlated volumes shows a tendency to diverge up to disorders $W\approx 15$, specifically none with exponent $\nu=1/2$. Deeper in the metal, we characterize the crossover to system sizes much smaller than the first correlated volume $N_1\gg N.$ Once this crossover has taken place, we obtain evidence of a scaling in which the derivative of the first fractal dimension $D_1$ behaves critically with an exponent $\nu=1.$</description>

      <title>Catching thermal avalanches in the disordered XXZ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the XXZ model with a random magnetic field in contact with a weakly disordered spin chain, acting as a finite thermal bath. We revise Fermi's golden rule description of the interaction between the thermal bath and the XXZ spin chain, contrasting it with a nonperturbative quantum avalanche scenario for the thermalization of the system. We employ two-point correlation functions to define the extent $\xi_d$ of the thermalized region next to the bath. Unbounded growth of $\xi_d$ proportional to the logarithm of time or faster is a signature of an avalanche. Such behavior signifies the thermalization of the system, as we confirm numerically for a generic initial state in the ergodic and critical regimes of the XXZ spin chain. In the many-body localized regime, a clear termination of avalanches is observed for specifically prepared initial states and, surprisingly, is not visible for generic initial product states. Additionally, we extract the localization length of the local integrals of motion and show that a bath made out of a weakly disordered XXZ chain has a similar effect on the system as a bath modeled by a Hamiltonian from a Gaussian orthogonal ensemble of random matrices. We also comment on the result of the earlier study (Phys. Rev. B 108, L020201 (2023)), arguing that the observed thermalization is due to external driving of the system and does not occur in the autonomous model. Our work reveals experimentally accessible signatures of quantum avalanches and identifies conditions under which termination of the avalanches may be observed.</description>

      <title>The Harmonic Oscillator Potential Perturbed by a Combination of Linear and Non-linear Dirac Delta Interactions with Application to Bose-Einstein Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the bound state analysis of a one dimensional nonlinear version of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation for the harmonic oscillator potential perturbed by a $\delta$ potential, where the nonlinear term is taken to be proportional to $\delta(x) |\psi(x)|^2 \psi(x)$. The bound state wave functions are explicitly found and the bound state energy of the system is algebraically determined by the solution of an implicit equation. Then, we apply this model to the Bose-Einstein condensation of a Bose gas in a harmonic trap with a dimple potential. We propose that the many-body interactions of the Bose gas can be effectively described by the nonlinear term in the Schr\"{o}dinger equation. Then, we investigate the critical temperature, the condensate fraction, and the density profile of this system numerically.</description>

      <title>Online Locality Meets Distributed Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the theory of locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs) from the classical LOCAL model to a number of other models that have been studied recently, including the quantum-LOCAL model, finitely-dependent processes, non-signaling model, dynamic-LOCAL model, and online-LOCAL model [e.g. STOC 2024, ICALP 2023].
  First, we demonstrate the advantage that finitely-dependent processes have over the classical LOCAL model. We show that all LCL problems solvable with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ in the LOCAL model admit a finitely-dependent distribution (with constant locality). In particular, this gives a finitely-dependent coloring for regular trees, answering an open question by Holroyd [2023]. This also introduces a new formal barrier for understanding the distributed quantum advantage: it is not possible to exclude quantum advantage for any LCL in the $\Theta(\log^\star n)$ complexity class by using non-signaling arguments.
  Second, we put limits on the capabilities of all of these models. To this end, we introduce a model called randomized online-LOCAL, which is strong enough to simulate e.g. SLOCAL and dynamic-LOCAL, and we show that it is also strong enough to simulate any non-signaling distribution and hence any quantum-LOCAL algorithm. We prove the following result for rooted trees: if we can solve an LCL problem with locality $o(\log \log n)$ in the randomized online-LOCAL model, we can solve it with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model.
  Put together, these results show that in rooted trees the set of LCLs that can be solved with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ is the same across all these models: classical deterministic and randomized LOCAL, quantum-LOCAL, non-signaling model, dynamic-LOCAL, and deterministic and randomized online-LOCAL.</description>

      <title>Spin-lattice relaxation with non-linear couplings: Comparison between Fermi's golden rule and extended dissipaton equation of motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermi's golden rule (FGR) offers an empirical framework for understanding the dynamics of spin-lattice relaxation in magnetic molecules, encompassing mechanisms like direct (one-phonon) and Raman (two-phonon) processes. These principles effectively model experimental longitudinal relaxation rates, denoted as $T_1^{-1}$. However, under scenarios of increased coupling strength and nonlinear spin-lattice interactions, FGR's applicability may diminish. This paper numerically evaluates the exact spin-lattice relaxation rate kernels, employing the extended dissipaton equation of motion (DEOM) formalism. Our calculations reveal that when quadratic spin-lattice coupling is considered, the rate kernels exhibit a free induction decay-like feature, and the damping rates depend on the interaction strength. We observe that the temperature dependence predicted by FGR significantly deviates from the exact results since FGR ignores the non-Markovian nature of spin-lattice relaxation. Our methods can be readily applied to other systems with nonlinear spin-lattice interactions and provide valuable insights into the temperature dependence of $T_1$ in molecular qubits.</description>
