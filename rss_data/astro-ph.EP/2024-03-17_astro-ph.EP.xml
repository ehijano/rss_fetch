      <title>The Carbon Isotopic Ratio and Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first detection of 13CCH in a protoplanetary disk (TW Hya). Using observations of C2H we measure CCH/13CCH = 65 +/- 20 in gas with a CO isotopic ratio of 12CO/13CO = 21 +/- 5 (Yoshida et al. 2022a). The TW Hya disk exhibits a gas phase C/O that exceeds unity and C2H is the tracer of this excess carbon. We confirm that the TW Hya gaseous disk exhibits two separate carbon isotopic reservoirs as noted previously (Yoshida et al. 2022a). We explore two theoretical solutions for the development of this dichotomy. One model represents TW Hya today with a protoplanetary disk exposed to a cosmic ray ionization rate that is below interstellar as consistent with current estimates. We find that this model does not have sufficient ionization in cold (T &lt; 40 K) layers to activate carbon isotopic fractionation. The second model investigates a younger TW Hya protostellar disk exposed to an interstellar cosmic ray ionization rate. We find that the younger model has sources of ionization deeper in a colder disk that generates two independent isotopic reservoirs. One reservoir is 12C-enriched carried by methane/hydrocarbon ices and the other is 13C-enriched carried by gaseous CO. The former potentially provides a source of methane/hydrocarbon ices to power the chemistry that generates the anomalously strong C$_2$H emission in this (and other) disk systems in later stages. The latter provides a source of gaseous 13C-rich material to generate isotopic enrichments in forming giant planets as recently detected in the super-Jupiter TYC 8998-760-1 b by Zhang et al. (2021).</description>

      <title>The Active Asteroids Citizen Science Program: Overview and First Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Citizen Science program Active Asteroids and describe discoveries stemming from our ongoing project. Our NASA Partner program is hosted on the Zooniverse online platform and launched on 2021 August 31, with the goal of engaging the community in the search for active asteroids -- asteroids with comet-like tails or comae. We also set out to identify other unusual active solar system objects, such as active Centaurs, active quasi-Hilda asteroids, and Jupiter-family comets (JFCs). Active objects are rare in large part because they are difficult to identify, so we ask volunteers to assist us in searching for active bodies in our collection of millions of images of known minor planets. We produced these cutout images with our project pipeline that makes use of publicly available Dark Energy Camera (DECam) data. Since the project launch, roughly 8,300 volunteers have scrutinized some 430,000 images to great effect, which we describe in this work. In total we have identified previously unknown activity on 15 asteroids, plus one Centaur, that were thought to be asteroidal (i.e., inactive). Of the asteroids, we classify four as active quasi-Hilda asteroids, seven as JFCs, and four as active asteroids, consisting of one Main-belt comet (MBC) and three MBC candidates. We also include our findings concerning known active objects that our program facilitated, an unanticipated avenue of scientific discovery. These include discovering activity occurring during an orbital epoch for which objects were not known to be active, and the reclassification of objects based on our dynamical analyses.</description>

      <title>[N I] 10400/10410 {\AA} Lines as Possible Disk Wind Tracers in a Young Intermediate-Mass Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we performed high-resolution near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy (R = 28,000; ${\lambda} = 0.90$-1.35 ${\mu}$m) with a high signal-to-noise ratio on HD 200775, a very young (${\sim}$0.1 Myr old) and massive intermediate-mass star (a binary star with a mass of about 10 $M_{\odot}$ each) with a protoplanetary disk. The obtained spectra show eight forbidden lines of three elements: two of [S II] (10289 and 10323 {\AA}), two of [N I] (10400 and 10410 {\AA}), and four of [Fe II] (12570, 12946, 12981, and 13209 {\AA}). This is the first time that the [N I] lines are detected in a young stellar object with a doublet deblended. Gaussian fitting of the spectra indicates that all line profiles have low-velocity components and exhibit blueshifted features, suggesting that all lines originate from the disk winds (magnetohydrodynamic disk wind and/or photoevaporative wind). Based on the fit, the [N I] and [Fe II] lines are categorized into narrow components, while the [S II] lines are at the boundary between broad and narrow components. These forbidden lines are suggested to be very promising disk wind tracers among the existing ones because they are in the NIR-wavelength range, which can be observed from early stages with high sensitivities. Among these lines, [N I] lines would be a rather powerful probe for deriving the basic physical parameters of disk wind gases. However, the study of these lines herein is limited to one object; thus, further studies are needed to examine their properties.</description>

      <title>Modeling JWST MIRI-MRS Observations of T Cha: Mid-IR Noble Gas Emission Tracing a Dense Disk Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu\mathrm{m}$ emission is a well-used tracer of protoplanetary disk winds due to its blueshifted line profile. MIRI-MRS recently observed T Cha, detecting this line along with lines of [Ne III], [Ar II] and [Ar III], with the [Ne II] and [Ne III] lines found to be extended while the [Ar II] was not. In this complementary work, we use these lines to address long-debated questions about protoplanetary disk winds regarding their mass-loss rate, the origin of their ionization, and the role of magnetically-driven winds as opposed to photoevaporation. To this end, we perform photoionization radiative transfer on simple hydrodynamic wind models to map the line emission. We compare the integrated model luminosities to those observed with MIRI-MRS to identify which models most closely reproduce the data and produce synthetic images from these to understand what information is captured by measurements of the line extents. Along with the low degree of ionization implied by the line ratios, the relative compactness of [Ar II] compared to [Ne II] is particularly constraining. This requires Ne II production by hard X-rays and Ar II production by soft X-rays (and/or EUV) in an extended ($\gtrsim 10$ au) wind that is shielded from soft X-rays - necessitating a dense wind with material launched on scales down to ~1 au. Such conditions could be produced by photoevaporation, whereas an extended MHD wind producing equal shielding would likely underpredict the line fluxes. However, a tenuous inner MHD wind may still contribute to shielding the extended wind. This picture is consistent with constraints from spectrally-resolved line profiles.</description>

      <title>TOI-4438 b: a transiting mini-Neptune amenable to atmospheric characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the confirmation and mass determination of a mini-Neptune transiting the M3.5 V star TOI-4438 (G 182-34) every 7.44 days. A transit signal was detected with NASA's TESS space mission in the sectors 40, 52, and 53. In order to validate the planet TOI-4438 b and to determine the system properties, we combined TESS data with high-precision radial velocity measurements from the CARMENES spectrograph, spanning almost one year, and ground-based transit photometry. We found that TOI-4438 b has a radius of Rb = 2.52 +/- 0.13 R_Earth (5% precision), which together with a mass of Mb=5.4 +/- 1.1 M_Earth (20% precision), results in a bulk density of rho = 1.85+0.51-0.44 g cm-3 (28% precision), aligning the discovery with a volatile-rich planet. Our interior structure retrieval with a pure water envelope yields a minimum water mass fraction of 46% (1-sigma). TOI-4438 b is a volatile-rich mini-Neptune with likely H/He mixed with molecules, such as water, CO_2, and CH_4. The primary star has a J-band magnitude of 9.7, and the planet has a high transmission spectroscopy metric (TSM) of 136 +/- 13. Taking into account the relatively warm equilibrium temperature of T_eq = 435 +/- 15 K, and the low activity level of its host star, TOI-4438 b is one of the most promising mini-Neptunes around an M dwarf for transmission spectroscopy studies.</description>

      <title>Rapid hydrofracture of icy moon shells: insights from glaciology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Europa's surface features many regions of complex topography termed 'chaos terrains'. One set of hypotheses for chaos terrain formation require upward migration of liquid water from perched water bodies formed by convection and tidal heating within the icy shell. However, consideration of the behaviour of terrestrial ice sheets suggests the rapid downwards, not upwards, movement of water from perched water bodies, initiated through hydrofracture and without a propagation limit provided there is a sufficient volume of water to fill the resulting vertical fracture. I suggest that drainage of perched water bodies to the subsurface ocean through hydrofracture is a likely phenomenon at Europa and other icy moons. This may at first appear to rule out perched water bodies in the formation of chaos areas, but the violence of such drainage events and loss of mechanical support could lead to the collapse of the surface shell and a temporary surface-ocean connection. Alternatively, hydrofracture provides a mechanism for entire ice-shell fracture if a surface impact melts enough near-surface ice.</description>

      <title>The Equilibrium Vapor Pressures of Ammonia and Oxygen Ices at Outer Solar System Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few laboratory studies have investigated the vapor pressures of the volatiles that may be present as ices in the outer solar system; even fewer studies have investigated these species at the temperatures and pressures suitable to the surfaces of icy bodies in the Saturnian and Uranian systems ($\lt$100 K, $\lt10^{-9}$ bar). This study adds to the work of Grundy et al. (2024) in extending the known equilibrium vapor pressures of outer solar system ices through laboratory investigations at very low temperatures. Our experiments with ammonia and oxygen ices provide new thermodynamic models for these species' respective enthalpies of sublimation. We find that ammonia ice, and to a lesser degree oxygen ice, are stable at higher temperatures than extrapolations in previous literature have predicted. Our results show that these ices should be retained over longer periods of time than previous extrapolations would predict, and a greater amount of these solids is required to support observation in exospheres of airless bodies in the outer solar system.</description>

      <title>The Dynamic, Chimeric Inner Disk of PDS 70</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition disks, with inner regions depleted in dust and gas, could represent later stages of protoplanetary disk evolution when newly-formed planets are emerging. The PDS 70 system has attracted particular interest because of the presence of two giant planets at tens of au orbits within the inner disk cavity, at least one of which is itself accreting. However, the region around PDS 70 most relevant to understanding the planet populations revealed by exoplanet surveys of middle-aged stars is the inner disk, which is the dominant source of the system's excess infrared emission but only marginally resolved by ALMA. Here we present and analyze time-series optical and infrared photometry and spectroscopy that reveal the inner disk to be dynamic on timescales of days to years, with occultation of sub-micron dust dimming the star at optical wavelengths and 3-5 $\mu$m emission varying due to changes in disk structure. Remarkably, the infrared emission from the innermost region (nearly) disappears for ~1 year. We model the spectral energy distribution of the system and its time variation with a flattened warm (T &lt;~ 600K) disk and a hotter (1200K) dust that could represent an inner rim or wall. The high dust-to-gas ratio of the inner disk relative to material accreting from the outer disk, means that the former could be a chimera consisting of depleted disk gas that is subsequently enriched with dust and volatiles produced by collisions and evaporation of planetesimals in the inner zone.</description>

      <title>Spectral Energy Distributions of Disc-Embedded Accreting Protoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many dozens of protoplanetary discs show signatures of sculpting by planets. To help find these protoplanets by direct imaging, we compute their broadband spectral energy distributions, which overlap with the JWST (James Webb Space Telescope) and ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) passbands. We consider circumplanetary spherical envelopes, and combinations of circumplanetary discs and envelopes, heated by protoplanet accretion and external irradiation. Searches with JWST's NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) and the blue portion of MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) are most promising since $\sim$300--1000 K protoplanets outshine their $\sim$20--50 K circumstellar environs at wavelengths of $\sim$2--20 $\mu$m. Detection is easier if circumplanetary dust settles into discs (more likely for more massive planets) or is less abundant per unit mass gas (because of grain growth or filtration). At wavelengths longer than 20 $\mu$m, circumplanetary material is difficult to see against the circumstellar disc's surface layers that directly absorb starlight and reprocess it to the far-infrared. Such contaminating circumstellar emission can be serious even within the evacuated gaps observed by ALMA. Only in strongly depleted regions, like the cavity of the transitional disc PDS 70 where two protoplanets have been confirmed, may long-wavelength windows open for protoplanet study. We compile a list of candidate protoplanets and identify those with potentially the highest accretion luminosities, all peaking in the near-infrared.</description>

      <title>Asteroid reflectance spectra from Gaia DR3: Near-UV in primitive asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of charge-coupled devices (CCDs), the ultraviolet (UV) region has mostly remained unexplored after the 1990s. Gaia DR3 offers the community a unique opportunity to explore tens of thousands of asteroids in the near-UV as a proxy of the UV absorption. This absorption has been proposed in previous works as a diagnostic of hydration, organics, and space weathering. Aims. In this work, we aim to explore the potential of the NUV as a diagnostic region for primitive asteroids using Gaia DR3. We used a corrective factor over the blue part of Gaia spectra to erase the solar analog selection effect. We identified an artificial relation between the band noise and slope and applied a signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) threshold for Gaia bands. Meeting the quality standards, we employed a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to compute the albedo threshold, maximizing primitive asteroid inclusion. Utilizing one- and two-dimensional (1D and 2D) projections, along with dimensionality-reduction methods (such as PCA and UMAP), we identified primitive asteroid populations. We uncovered: (a) the first observational evidence linking UV absorption to the 0.7 {\mu}m band, tied to hydrated iron-rich phyllosilicates; and (b) a 2D space revealing a split in C-type asteroids based on spectral features, including UV absorption. The computed average depth (3.5 +- 1.0 %) and center (0.70 +- 0.03 {\mu}m) of the 0.7 {\mu}m absorption band for primitive asteroids observed with Gaia is in agreement with the literature values. In this paper, we shed light on the importance of the UV absorption feature to discriminate among different mineralogies (i.e., iron-rich phyllosilicates vs. iron-poor) or to identify taxonomies that are conflated in the visible (i.e., F-types vs. B-types). We have shown that this is a promising region for diagnostic studies of the composition of primitive asteroids.</description>

      <title>zoomies: A tool to infer stellar age from vertical action in Gaia data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar age measurements are fundamental to understanding a wide range of astronomical processes, including galactic dynamics, stellar evolution, and planetary system formation. However, extracting age information from Main Sequence stars is complicated, with techniques often relying on age proxies in the absence of direct measurements. The Gaia data releases have enabled detailed studies of the dynamical properties of stars within the Milky Way, offering new opportunities to understand the relationship between stellar age and dynamics. In this study, we leverage high-precision astrometric data from Gaia DR3 to construct a stellar age prediction model based only on stellar dynamical properties; namely, the vertical action. We calibrate two distinct, hierarchical stellar age--vertical action relations, first employing asteroseismic ages for red giant branch stars, then isochrone ages for main-sequence turn-off stars. We describe a framework called "zoomies" based on this calibration, by which we can infer ages for any star given its vertical action. This tool is open-source and intended for community use. We compare dynamical age estimates from "zoomies" with ages derived from other techniques for a sample of open clusters and main-sequence stars with asteroseismic age measurements. We also compare dynamical age estimates for stellar samples from the Kepler, K2, and TESS exoplanet transit surveys. While dynamical age relations are associated with large uncertainty, they are generally mass-independent and depend on homogeneously measured astrometric data. These age predictions are uniquely useful for large-scale demographic investigations, especially in disentangling the relationship between planet occurrence, metallicity, and age for low-mass stars.</description>

      <title>Constraining Protoplanetary Disk Winds from Forbidden Line Profiles with Simulation-based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks are the sites of vigorous hydrodynamic processes, such as accretion and outflows, and ultimately establish the conditions for the formation of planets. The properties of disk outflows are often inferred through analysis of forbidden emission lines. These lines contain multiple overlapping components, tracing different emission regions with different processes that excite them: a high-velocity component (tracing a jet), a broad low-velocity component (tracing inner disk wind), and a narrow low-velocity component (tracing outer disk wind). They are also heavily contaminated by background spectral features. All of these challenges call into question the traditional approach of fitting Gaussian components to the line profiles, and cloud the physical interpretation of those components. We introduce a novel statistical technique to analyze emission lines in protoplanetary disks. Simulation-Based Inference is a computationally efficient machine learning technique that produces posterior distributions of the parameters (e.g. magnetic field, radiation sources, geometry) of a representative wind model when given a spectrum, without any prior assumption about line shapes (e.g.symmetry). In this pathfinder study, we demonstrate that this technique indeed accurately recovers the parameters from simulated spectra without noise and background. A following work will deal with the analysis of observed spectra.</description>

      <title>Massive Debris Disks May Hinder Secular Stirring by Planetary Companions: An Analytic Proof of Concept</title>

Abstract: Debris disks or exo-Kuiper belts, detected through their thermal or scattered emission from their dusty components, are ubiquitous around main-sequence stars. Since dust grains are short-lived, their sustained presence is thought to require dynamical excitation, i.e., "stirring", of a massive reservoir of large planetesimals, such that mutual collisions are violent enough to continually supply fresh dust. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain debris disk stirring, with the commonly accepted being long-term, secular planet-debris disk interactions. However, while effective, existing planet-stirring models are rudimentary; namely, they ignore the (self-)gravity of the disk, treating it as a massless reservoir of planetesimals. Here, using a simple analytical model, we investigate the secular interactions between eccentric planets and massive, external debris disks. We demonstrate that the disk gravity drives fast apsidal precession of both planetesimal and planetary orbits, which, depending on the system parameters, may well exceed the planet-induced precession rate of planetesimals. This results in strong suppression of planetesimal eccentricities and thus relative collisional velocities throughout the disk, often by more than an order of magnitude when compared to massless disk models. We thus show that massive debris disks may hinder secular stirring by eccentric planets orbiting near, e.g., the disk's inner edge, provided the disk is more massive than the planet. We provide simple analytic formulae to describe these effects. Finally, we show that these findings have important implications for planet inferences in debris-bearing systems, as well as for constraining the total masses of debris disks (as done for $\beta$ Pic).</description>

      <title>Observability of substructures in planet-forming disk in (sub)cm wavelength with SKA and ngVLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current imaging observations of protoplanetary disks using ALMA primarily focus on the sub-millimeter wavelength, leaving a gap in effective observational approaches for centimeter-sized dust, which is crucial to the issue of planet formation. The forthcoming SKA and ngVLA may rectify this deficiency. In this paper, we employ multi-fluid hydrodynamic numerical simulations and radiative transfer calculations to investigate the potential of SKA1-Mid, ngVLA, and SKA2 for imaging protoplanetary disks at sub-cm/cm wavelengths. We create mock images with ALMA/SKA/ngVLA at multi-wavelengths based on the hydrodynamical simulation output, and test different sensitivity and spatial resolutions. We discover that both SKA and ngVLA will serve as excellent supplements to the existing observational range of ALMA, and their high resolution enables them to image substructures in the disk's inner region ($\sim$ 5 au from the stellar). Our results indicate that SKA and ngVLA can be utilized for more extended monitoring programs in the centimeter waveband. While in the sub-centimeter range, ngVLA possesses the capability to produce high-fidelity images within shorter observation times ($\sim$ 1 hour on source time) than previous research, holding potential for future survey observations. We also discuss for the first time the potential of SKA2 for observing protoplanetary disks at a 0.7 cm wavelength.</description>

      <title>Effect of the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB 221009A) on low energy gamma-ray counts at sea level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08244v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A gamma-ray burst, named GRB 221009A, occurred on 9 October 2022 and is the brightest ever observed GRB, whose frequency is now estimated as once in 10,000 years. This GRB was reported to be observed from many space missions, VLF receivers, and ground observations in optical and radio data. Additionally, a strikingly large number of very high energy (VHE) photons associated with this GRB were observed by the gamma-ray and cosmic ray observatory LHAASO. Though gamma rays of cosmic origin usually tend to be absorbed by the atmosphere, the high fluence of this GRB, along with the observation of more than 5000 VHE photons (0.5 to 18 TeV) by LHAASO from the ground, emphasises the need to explore other possible ground observations of this GRB.
  The present paper examines the effect of this GRB using gamma-ray data in a low energy range (0.2-6) MeV obtained using NaI (Tl) detectors located at Tirunelveli (Geographic coordinates: 8.71{\deg}N, 77.76{\deg}E), India. With RA = 288.3{\deg} and Dec = 19.8{\deg}, the exceptionally bright fluence of this GRB was geographically centred on India. We report no significant change in the observations associated with GRB 221009A. We discuss the extent of attenuation of gamma-rays in the atmosphere that could explain the reported observations. Further, we investigate the likelihood of ground observation of gamma-rays ($&lt;$10 MeV) for a much more intense hypothetical GRB, and estimate the parameters, such as distance, fluence, and isotropic energy of such a GRB.</description>
