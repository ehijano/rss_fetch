      <title>Extending DD-$\alpha$AMG on heterogeneous machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multigrid solvers are the standard in modern scientific computing simulations. Domain Decomposition Aggregation-Based Algebraic Multigrid, also known as the DD-$\alpha$AMG solver, is a successful realization of an algebraic multigrid solver for lattice quantum chromodynamics. Its CPU implementation has made it possible to construct, for some particular discretizations, simulations otherwise computationally unfeasible, and furthermore it has motivated the development and improvement of other algebraic multigrid solvers in the area. From an existing version of DD-$\alpha$AMG already partially ported via CUDA to run some finest-level operations of the multigrid solver on Nvidia GPUs, we translate the CUDA code here by using HIP to run on the ORISE supercomputer. We moreover extend the smoothers available in DD-$\alpha$AMG, paying particular attention to Richardson smoothing, which in our numerical experiments has led to a multigrid solver faster than smoothing with GCR and only 10% slower compared to SAP smoothing. Then we port the odd-even-preconditioned versions of GMRES and Richardson via CUDA. Finally, we extend some computationally intensive coarse-grid operations via advanced vectorization.</description>

      <title>Holographic Hagedorn Temperature: Strong Coupling, Flavor and $\theta$-angle Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Hagedorn temperature $T_H$ of strongly coupled quantum field theories admitting a holographic string or M-theory description in various regimes and scenarios.
  In the first part of the paper we propose a ``thermal scalar'' effective approach to the calculation of $T_H$ in eleven-dimensional supergravity. The proposal allows to extend the existing results for $T_H$ to the strongly coupled string regime, i.e. to a previously unexplored regime of field theory parameters where the number of colors $N$ is smaller than (some power of) the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$. We can thus extend the existing results for the $\alpha'$ expansion of the ABJM model, which have a spectacular agreement with predictions from integrability, in a different direction in parameter space. In particular, we explicitate the first non-perturbative corrections. We also apply the formalism to the Witten-Yang-Mills model, finding that the result for the ratio of $T_H$ with the deconfinement temperature is in the same ballpark of the lattice one for pure Yang-Mills. Within the same model, we study the dependence of the Hagedorn temperature on the $\theta$-angle.
  In the second part of the paper we analyze the effect of dynamical flavors on $T_H$ in confining theories. By studying the few available examples of regular backgrounds dual to confining theories with flavors, we find that generally the effects of flavors is to reduce the value of $T_H$ in units of the square root of the confining string tension. The effect turns out to be milder than the analogous reduction of the critical temperature for deconfinement when the latter is known.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the $\Xi_c^* \bar K$ molecular pentaquark state by its electromagnetic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are systematically studying the electromagnetic characteristics of multiquark systems to shed light on their internal structure, whose nature and quantum numbers are controversial. In this study, we investigate the magnetic dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments of the $\Xi_c^*\bar K$ state within the context of the QCD light-cone sum rule. During this analysis, we posit that the $\Xi_c^*\bar K$ state assumes a molecular structure with quantum numbers $J^P = \frac{3}{2}^-$. The extracted outcomes are given as $\mu_{\Xi_c^*\bar K} = 0.15^{+0.04}_{-0.03}\,\mu_N$, $\mathcal{Q}_{\Xi_c^*\bar K} = (-0.93^{+0.22}_{-0.17})\times 10^{-3}\,\rm{fm^2}$, and $\mathcal{O}_{\Xi_c^*\bar K} = (-0.45^{+0.10}_{-0.09})\times 10^{-4}\,\rm{fm^3}$. The findings of this study, when considered alongside other pertinent characteristics, may assist in elucidating the nature of this controversial phenomenon.</description>

      <title>A unitary coupled-channel three-body amplitude with pions and kaons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-body dynamics above threshold is required for the reliable extraction of many amplitudes and resonances from experiment and lattice QCD. The S-matrix principle of unitarity can be used to construct dynamical coupled-channel approaches in which three particles scatter off each other, re-arranging two-body subsystems by particle exchange. This paper reports the development of a three-body coupled-channel, amplitude including pions and kaons. The unequal-mass amplitude contains two-body S- and P-wave subsystems ("isobars") of all isospins, $I=0,\,1/2,\,1,\, 3/2, \, 2$, and it also allows for transitions within a given isobar. The $f_0(500)\, ("\sigma"),\,f_0(980),\,\rho(700), K_0^*(700)\,("\kappa")$, and $K^*(892)$ resonances are included, apart from repulsive isobars. Different methods to evaluate the amplitude for physical momenta are discussed. Production amplitudes for $a_1$ quantum numbers are shown as a proof of principle for the numerical implementation.</description>
