      <title>Self-Attention Based Multi-Scale Graph Auto-Encoder Network of 3D Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D meshes are fundamental data representations for capturing complex geometric shapes in computer vision and graphics applications. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have excelled in structured data like images, extending them to irregular 3D meshes is challenging due to the non-Euclidean nature of the data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) offer a solution by applying convolutions to graph-structured data, but many existing methods rely on isotropic filters or spectral decomposition, limiting their ability to capture both local and global mesh features. In this paper, we introduce 3D Geometric Mesh Network (3DGeoMeshNet), a novel GCN-based framework that uses anisotropic convolution layers to effectively learn both global and local features directly in the spatial domain. Unlike previous approaches that convert meshes into intermediate representations like voxel grids or point clouds, our method preserves the original polygonal mesh format throughout the reconstruction process, enabling more accurate shape reconstruction. Our architecture features a multi-scale encoder-decoder structure, where separate global and local pathways capture both large-scale geometric structures and fine-grained local details. Extensive experiments on the COMA dataset containing human faces demonstrate the efficiency of 3DGeoMeshNet in terms of reconstruction accuracy.</description>

      <title>LighthouseGS: Indoor Structure-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting for Panorama-Style Mobile Captures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled real-time novel view synthesis (NVS) with impressive quality in indoor scenes. However, achieving high-fidelity rendering requires meticulously captured images covering the entire scene, limiting accessibility for general users. We aim to develop a practical 3DGS-based NVS framework using simple panorama-style motion with a handheld camera (e.g., mobile device). While convenient, this rotation-dominant motion and narrow baseline make accurate camera pose and 3D point estimation challenging, especially in textureless indoor scenes. To address these challenges, we propose LighthouseGS, a novel framework inspired by the lighthouse-like sweeping motion of panoramic views. LighthouseGS leverages rough geometric priors, such as mobile device camera poses and monocular depth estimation, and utilizes the planar structures often found in indoor environments. We present a new initialization method called plane scaffold assembly to generate consistent 3D points on these structures, followed by a stable pruning strategy to enhance geometry and optimization stability. Additionally, we introduce geometric and photometric corrections to resolve inconsistencies from motion drift and auto-exposure in mobile devices. Tested on collected real and synthetic indoor scenes, LighthouseGS delivers photorealistic rendering, surpassing state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating the potential for panoramic view synthesis and object placement.</description>

      <title>NRXR-ID: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) in VR Using Near-Range Extended Reality and Smartphones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-factor authentication (2FA) has become widely adopted as an efficient and secure way to validate someone's identity online. Two-factor authentication is difficult in virtual reality (VR) because users are usually wearing a head-mounted display (HMD) which does not allow them to see their real-world surroundings. We present NRXR-ID, a technique to implement two-factor authentication while using extended reality systems and smartphones. The proposed method allows users to complete an authentication challenge using their smartphones without removing their HMD. We performed a user study where we explored four types of challenges for users, including a novel checkers-style challenge. Users responded to these challenges under three different configurations, including a technique that uses the smartphone to support gaze-based selection without the use of VR controllers. A 4X3 within-subjects design allowed us to study all the variations proposed. We collected performance metrics and performed user experience questionnaires to collect subjective impressions from 30 participants. Results suggest that the checkers-style visual matching challenge was the most appropriate option, followed by entering a digital PIN challenge submitted via the smartphone and answered within the VR environment.</description>

      <title>AnatomyCarve: A VR occlusion management technique for medical images based on segment-aware clipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visualizing 3D medical images is challenging due to self-occlusion, where anatomical structures of interest can be obscured by surrounding tissues. Existing methods, such as slicing and interactive clipping, are limited in their ability to fully represent internal anatomy in context. In contrast, hand-drawn medical illustrations in anatomy books manage occlusion effectively by selectively removing portions based on tissue type, revealing 3D structures while preserving context. This paper introduces AnatomyCarve, a novel technique developed for a VR environment that creates high-quality illustrations similar to those in anatomy books, while remaining fast and interactive. AnatomyCarve allows users to clip selected segments from 3D medical volumes, preserving spatial relations and contextual information. This approach enhances visualization by combining advanced rendering techniques with natural user interactions in VR. Usability of AnatomyCarve was assessed through a study with non-experts, while surgical planning effectiveness was evaluated with practicing neurosurgeons and residents. The results show that AnatomyCarve enables customized anatomical visualizations, with high user satisfaction, suggesting its potential for educational and clinical applications.</description>

      <title>Feature-Based vs. GAN-Based Learning from Demonstrations: When and Why</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This survey provides a comparative analysis of feature-based and GAN-based approaches to learning from demonstrations, with a focus on the structure of reward functions and their implications for policy learning. Feature-based methods offer dense, interpretable rewards that excel at high-fidelity motion imitation, yet often require sophisticated representations of references and struggle with generalization in unstructured settings. GAN-based methods, in contrast, use implicit, distributional supervision that enables scalability and adaptation flexibility, but are prone to training instability and coarse reward signals. Recent advancements in both paradigms converge on the importance of structured motion representations, which enable smoother transitions, controllable synthesis, and improved task integration. We argue that the dichotomy between feature-based and GAN-based methods is increasingly nuanced: rather than one paradigm dominating the other, the choice should be guided by task-specific priorities such as fidelity, diversity, interpretability, and adaptability. This work outlines the algorithmic trade-offs and design considerations that underlie method selection, offering a framework for principled decision-making in learning from demonstrations.</description>

      <title>StreamDiffusion: A Pipeline-level Solution for Real-time Interactive Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce StreamDiffusion, a real-time diffusion pipeline designed for interactive image generation. Existing diffusion models are adept at creating images from text or image prompts, yet they often fall short in real-time interaction. This limitation becomes particularly evident in scenarios involving continuous input, such as Metaverse, live video streaming, and broadcasting, where high throughput is imperative. To address this, we present a novel approach that transforms the original sequential denoising into the batching denoising process. Stream Batch eliminates the conventional wait-and-interact approach and enables fluid and high throughput streams. To handle the frequency disparity between data input and model throughput, we design a novel input-output queue for parallelizing the streaming process. Moreover, the existing diffusion pipeline uses classifier-free guidance(CFG), which requires additional U-Net computation. To mitigate the redundant computations, we propose a novel residual classifier-free guidance (RCFG) algorithm that reduces the number of negative conditional denoising steps to only one or even zero. Besides, we introduce a stochastic similarity filter(SSF) to optimize power consumption. Our Stream Batch achieves around 1.5x speedup compared to the sequential denoising method at different denoising levels. The proposed RCFG leads to speeds up to 2.05x higher than the conventional CFG. Combining the proposed strategies and existing mature acceleration tools makes the image-to-image generation achieve up-to 91.07fps on one RTX4090, improving the throughputs of AutoPipline developed by Diffusers over 59.56x. Furthermore, our proposed StreamDiffusion also significantly reduces the energy consumption by 2.39x on one RTX3060 and 1.99x on one RTX4090, respectively.</description>

      <title>HyperGaussians: High-Dimensional Gaussian Splatting for High-Fidelity Animatable Face Avatars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce HyperGaussians, a novel extension of 3D Gaussian Splatting for high-quality animatable face avatars. Creating such detailed face avatars from videos is a challenging problem and has numerous applications in augmented and virtual reality. While tremendous successes have been achieved for static faces, animatable avatars from monocular videos still fall in the uncanny valley. The de facto standard, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), represents a face through a collection of 3D Gaussian primitives. 3DGS excels at rendering static faces, but the state-of-the-art still struggles with nonlinear deformations, complex lighting effects, and fine details. While most related works focus on predicting better Gaussian parameters from expression codes, we rethink the 3D Gaussian representation itself and how to make it more expressive. Our insights lead to a novel extension of 3D Gaussians to high-dimensional multivariate Gaussians, dubbed 'HyperGaussians'. The higher dimensionality increases expressivity through conditioning on a learnable local embedding. However, splatting HyperGaussians is computationally expensive because it requires inverting a high-dimensional covariance matrix. We solve this by reparameterizing the covariance matrix, dubbed the 'inverse covariance trick'. This trick boosts the efficiency so that HyperGaussians can be seamlessly integrated into existing models. To demonstrate this, we plug in HyperGaussians into the state-of-the-art in fast monocular face avatars: FlashAvatar. Our evaluation on 19 subjects from 4 face datasets shows that HyperGaussians outperform 3DGS numerically and visually, particularly for high-frequency details like eyeglass frames, teeth, complex facial movements, and specular reflections.</description>
