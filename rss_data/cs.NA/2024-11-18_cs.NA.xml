      <title>Reduced-order modelling of parameter-dependent systems with invariant manifolds: application to Hopf bifurcations in follower force problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct parametrisation method for invariant manifolds is adjusted to consider a varying parameter. More specifically, the case of systems experiencing a Hopf bifurcation in the parameter range of interest are investigated, and the ability to predict the amplitudes of the limit cycle oscillations after the bifurcation is demonstrated. The cases of the Ziegler pendulum and Beck's column, both of which have a follower force, are considered for applications. By comparison with the eigenvalue trajectories in the conservative case, it is advocated that using two master modes to derive the ROM, instead of only considering the unstable one, should give more accurate results. Also, in the specific case where an exceptional bifurcation point is met, a numerical strategy enforcing the presence of Jordan blocks in the Jacobian matrix during the procedure, is devised. The ROMs are constructed for the Ziegler pendulum having two and three degrees of freedom, and then Beck's column is investigated, where a finite element procedure is used to space discretize the problem. The numerical results show the ability of the ROMs to correctly predict the amplitude of the limit cycles up to a certain range, and it is shown that computing the ROM after the Hopf bifurcation gives the most satisfactory results. This feature is analyzed in terms of phase space representations, and the two proposed adjustments are shown to improve the validity range of the ROMs.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the SUPG Method for the Solution of Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of the streamline upwind/Petrov Galerkin (SUPG) stabilized finite element method on the discretization of optimal control problems governed by linear advection-diffusion equations. We compare two approaches for the numerical solution of such optimal control problems. In the discretize-then-optimize approach, the optimal control problem is first discretized, using the SUPG method for the discretization of the advection-diffusion equation, and then the resulting finite dimensional optimization problem is solved. In the optimize-then-discretize approach one first computes the infinite dimensional optimality system, involving the advection-diffusion equation as well as the adjoint advection-diffusion equation, and then discretizes this optimality system using the SUPG method for both the original and the adjoint equations. These approaches lead to different results. The main result of this paper are estimates for the error between the solution of the infinite dimensional optimal control problem and their approximations computed using the previous approaches. For a class of problems prove that the optimize-then-discretize approach has better asymptotic convergence properties if finite elements of order greater than one are used. For linear finite elements our theoretical convergence results for both approaches are comparable, except in the zero diffusion limit where again the optimize-then-discretize approach seems favorable. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate some of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Natural Deep Ritz Method for Essential Boundary Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural network approaches show promise in solving partial differential equations. However, unlike traditional numerical methods, they face challenges in enforcing essential boundary conditions. The widely adopted penalty-type methods, for example, offer a straightforward implementation but introduces additional complexity due to the need for hyper-parameter tuning; moreover, the use of a large penalty parameter can lead to artificial extra stiffness, complicating the optimization process. In this paper, we propose a novel, intrinsic approach to impose essential boundary conditions through a framework inspired by intrinsic structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using the deep Ritz method applied to Poisson problems, with the potential for extension to more general equations and other deep learning techniques. Numerical results are provided to substantiate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Determination and reconstruction of a semilinear term from point measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the inverse problem of determining a semilinear term appearing in an elliptic equation from boundary measurements. Our main objective is to develop flexible and general theoretical results that can be used for developing numerical reconstruction algorithm for this inverse problem. For this purpose, we develop a new method, based on different properties of solutions of elliptic equations, for treating the determination of the semilinear term as a source term from a point measurement of the solutions. This approach not only allows us to make important relaxations on the data used so far for solving this class of inverse problems, including general Dirichlet excitation lying in a space of dimension one and measurements located at one point on the boundary of the domain, but it also allows us to derive a novel algorithm for the reconstruction of the semilinear term. The effectiveness of our algorithm is corroborated by extensive numerical experiments. Notably, as demonstrated by the theoretical analysis, we are able to effectively reconstruct the unknown nonlinear source term by utilizing solely the information provided by the measurement data at a single point.</description>

      <title>Geometric optics approximation sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new dimensionality-independent and gradient-free sampler, called Geometric Optics Approximation Sampling, which is based on the reflector antenna system. The core idea is to construct a reflecting surface that redirects rays from a source with a predetermined simpler measure towards a output domain while achieving a desired distribution defined by the projection of a complex target measure of interest. Given a such reflecting surface, one can generate arbitrarily many independent and uncorrelated samples from the target measure simply by dual re-simulating or rays tracing the reflector antenna system and then projecting the traced rays onto target domain. In order to obtain a desired reflecting surface, we use the method of supporting paraboloid to solve the reflector antenna problem that does not require a gradient information regarding the density of the target measure. Furthermore, within the supporting paraboloid method, we utilize a low-discrepancy sequence or a random sequence to discretize the target measure, which in turn yields a dimensionality-independent approach for constructing the reflecting surface. Meanwhile, we present a dual re-simulation or ray tracing method based on its dual reflecting surface, which enables drawing samples from the target measure using the reflector antenna system obtained through the dimensionality-independent method. Several examples and numerical experiments comparing with measure transport samplers as well as traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations are provided in this paper to demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of our geometric optics approximation sampling, especially in the context of Bayesian inverse problems. Additionally, these numerical results confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Self-Alignment Radio Frequency Resonant Beam System for Information and Power Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to power attenuation, improving transmission efficiency in the radio-frequency (RF) band remains a significant challenge, which hinders advancements in various fields of the Internet of Things (IoT), such as wireless power transfer (WPT) and wireless communication. Array design and retro-directive beamforming (RD-BF) techniques offer simple and effective ways to enhance transmission efficiency. However, when the target is an array or in the near field, the RD-BF system (RD-BFS) cannot radiate more energy to the target due to phase irregularities in the target region, resulting in challenges in achieving higher efficiency. To address this issue, we propose the RF-based resonant beam system (RF-RBS), which adaptively optimizes phase and power distribution between transmitting and receiving arrays by leveraging the resonance mechanism to achieve higher transmission efficiency. We analyze the system structure and develop an analytical model to evaluate power flow and resonance establishment. Numerical analysis demonstrates that the proposed RF-RBS achieves self-alignment without beam control and provides higher transmission efficiency compared to RD-BFS, with improvements of up to 16%. This self-alignment capability allows the system to effectively transfer power and information across varying distances and offsets. The numerical results indicate the capability to transmit watt-level power and achieve 21 bps/Hz of downlink spectral efficiency in indoor settings, highlighting the advantages of RF-RBS in information and power transfer for mobile applications.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of a first-order DoD cut cell method for 2D unsteady advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present an a priori error analysis for solving the unsteady advection equation on cut cell meshes along a straight ramp in two dimensions. The space discretization uses a lowest order upwind-type discontinuous Galerkin scheme involving a \textit{Domain of Dependence} (DoD) stabilization to correct the update in the neighborhood of small cut cells. Thereby, it is possible to employ explicit time stepping schemes with a time step length that is independent of the size of the very small cut cells.
  Our error analysis is based on a general framework for error estimates for first-order linear partial differential equations that relies on consistency, boundedness, and discrete dissipation of the discrete bilinear form. We prove these properties for the space discretization involving DoD stabilization. This allows us to prove, for the fully discrete scheme, a quasi-optimal error estimate of order one half in a norm that combines the $L^\infty$-in-time $L^2$-in-space norm and a seminorm that contains velocity weighted jumps. We also provide corresponding numerical results.</description>

      <title>From Mesh to Neural Nets: A Multi-Method Evaluation of Physics-Informed Neural Networks and Galerkin Finite Element Method for Solving Nonlinear Convection-Reaction-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-linear convection-reaction-diffusion (CRD) partial differential equations (PDEs) are crucial for modeling complex phenomena in fields such as biology, ecology, population dynamics, physics, and engineering. Numerical approximation of these non-linear systems is essential due to the challenges of obtaining exact solutions. Traditionally, the Galerkin finite element method (GFEM) has been the standard computational tool for solving these PDEs. With the advancements in machine learning, Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) has emerged as a promising alternative for approximating non-linear PDEs.
  In this study, we compare the performance of PINN and GFEM by solving four distinct one-dimensional CRD problems with varying initial and boundary conditions and evaluate the performance of PINN over GFEM. This evaluation metrics includes error estimates, and visual representations of the solutions, supported by statistical methods such as the root mean squared error (RMSE), the standard deviation of error, the the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test and the coefficient of variation (CV) test.
  Our findings reveal that while both methods achieve solutions close to the analytical results, PINN demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency. PINN achieved significantly lower RMSE values and smaller standard deviations for Burgers' equation, Fisher's equation, and Newell-Whitehead-Segel equation, indicating higher accuracy and greater consistency. While GFEM shows slightly better accuracy for the Burgers-Huxley equation, its performance was less consistent over time. In contrast, PINN exhibit more reliable and robust performance, highlighting their potential as a cutting-edge approach for solving non-linear PDEs.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for numerical model error approximation and superresolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical modeling errors are unavoidable in finite element analysis. The presence of model errors inherently reflects both model accuracy and uncertainty. To date there have been few methods for explicitly quantifying errors at points of interest (e.g. at finite element nodes). The lack of explicit model error approximators has been addressed recently with the emergence of machine learning (ML), which closes the loop between numerical model features/solutions and explicit model error approximations. In this paper, we propose physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for simultaneous numerical model error approximation and superresolution. To test our approach, numerical data was generated using finite element simulations on a two-dimensional elastic plate with a central opening. Four- and eight-node quadrilateral elements were used in the discretization to represent the reduced-order and higher-order models, respectively. It was found that the developed PINNs effectively predict model errors in both x and y displacement fields with small differences between predictions and ground truth. Our findings demonstrate that the integration of physics-informed loss functions enables neural networks (NNs) to surpass a purely data-driven approach for approximating model errors.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Algorithms to Assess Site Closure Time Frames for Soil and Groundwater Contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA) is gaining prominence as an effective method for managing soil and groundwater contamination due to its cost-efficiency and minimal environmental disruption. Despite its benefits, MNA necessitates extensive groundwater monitoring to ensure that contaminant levels decrease to meet safety standards. This study expands the capabilities of PyLEnM, a Python package designed for long-term environmental monitoring, by incorporating new algorithms to enhance its predictive and analytical functionalities. We introduce methods to estimate the timeframe required for contaminants like Sr-90 and I-129 to reach regulatory safety standards using linear regression and to forecast future contaminant levels with the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks. Additionally, Random Forest regression is employed to identify factors influencing the time to reach safety standards. Our methods are illustrated using data from the Savannah River Site (SRS) F-Area, where preliminary findings reveal a notable downward trend in contaminant levels, with variability linked to initial concentrations and groundwater flow dynamics. The Bi-LSTM model effectively predicts contaminant concentrations for the next four years, demonstrating the potential of advanced time series analysis to improve MNA strategies and reduce reliance on manual groundwater sampling.

      <description>arXiv:2411.10363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Braaten and Weller discovered that the star-discrepancy of Halton sequences can be strongly reduced by scrambling them. In this paper, we apply a similar approach to those subsequences of Halton sequences which can be identified to have low-discrepancy by results from p-adic discrepancy theory. For given finite $N$, it turns out that the discrepancy of these sets is surprisingly low. By that known empiric bounds for the inverse star-discrepancy can be improved.</description>

      <title>Discretization of Total Variation in Optimization with Integrality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce discretizations of infinite-dimensional optimization problems with total variation regularization and integrality constraints on the optimization variables. We advance the discretization of the dual formulation of the total variation term with Raviart--Thomas functions which is known from literature for certain convex problems. Since we have an integrality constraint, the previous analysis from Caillaud and Chambolle [10] does not hold anymore. Even weaker $\Gamma$-convergence results do not hold anymore because the recovery sequences generally need to attain non-integer values to recover the total variation of the limit function. We solve this issue by introducing a discretization of the input functions on an embedded, finer mesh. A superlinear coupling of the mesh sizes implies an averaging on the coarser mesh of the Raviart--Thomas ansatz, which enables to recover the total variation of integer-valued limit functions with integer-valued discretized input functions. Moreover, we are able to estimate the discretized total variation of the recovery sequence by the total variation of its limit and an error depending on the mesh size ratio. For the discretized optimization problems, we additionally add a constraint that vanishes in the limit and enforces compactness of the sequence of minimizers, which yields their convergence to a minimizer of the original problem. This constraint contains a degree of freedom whose admissible range is determined. Its choice may have a strong impact on the solutions in practice as we demonstrate with an example from imaging.</description>

      <title>Bona-Smith-type systems in bounded domains with slip-wall boundary conditions: Theoretical justification and a conservative numerical scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considered herein is a class of Boussinesq systems of Bona-Smith type that describe water waves in bounded two-dimensional domains with slip-wall boundary conditions and variable bottom topography. Such boundary conditions are necessary in situations involving water waves in channels, ports, and generally in basins with solid boundaries. We prove that, given appropriate initial conditions, the corresponding initial-boundary value problems have unique solutions locally in time, which is a fundamental property of deterministic mathematical modeling. Moreover, we demonstrate that the systems under consideration adhere to three basic conservation laws for water waves: mass, vorticity, and energy conservation.
  The theoretical analysis of these specific Boussinesq systems leads to a conservative mixed finite element formulation. Using explicit, relaxation Runge-Kutta methods for the discretization in time, we devise a fully discrete scheme for the numerical solution of initial-boundary value problems with slip-wall conditions, preserving mass, vorticity, and energy. Finally, we present a series of challenging numerical experiments to assess the applicability of the new numerical model.</description>

Abstract: Multipartite quantum scenarios are a significant and challenging resource in quantum information science. Tensors provide a powerful framework for representing multipartite quantum systems. In this work, we introduce the role of tensor-generated matrices that can broadly be defined as the relationships between an $m$-th order $n$-dimensional tensor and an $n$-dimensional square matrix. Through these established connections, we demonstrate that the classification of the tensor-generated matrix as an $H$-matrix implies the original tensor is also an $H$-tensor. We also explore various similar properties exhibited by both the original tensor and the tensor-generated matrix, including weak irreducibility, weakly chained diagonal dominance, and (strong) symmetry. These findings provide a method to transform intricate tensor problems into matrices in specific contexts, which is especially pertinent due to the NP-hard complexity of the majority of tensor problems. Subsequently, we explore the application of tensor-generated matrices in analyzing the classicality of spin states. Leveraging the tensor representation, we introduce classicality criteria for (strongly) symmetric spin-$j$ states, which potentially provide fresh perspectives on the study of multipartite quantum resources. Finally, we extend classical matrix eigenvalue inclusion sets to higher-order tensor $H$-eigenvalues, a task that is typically challenging for higher-order tensors. Consequently, we propose representative tensor $H$-eigenvalue inclusion sets, such as modified Brauer's Ovals of Cassini sets, Ostrowski sets, and $S$-type inclusion sets.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic consistency and structure-preservation in summation by parts methods for the moist compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moist thermodynamics is a fundamental driver of atmospheric dynamics across all scales, making accurate modeling of these processes essential for reliable weather forecasts and climate change projections. However, atmospheric models often make a variety of inconsistent approximations in representing moist thermodynamics. These inconsistencies can introduce spurious sources and sinks of energy, potentially compromising the integrity of the models.
  Here, we present a thermodynamically consistent and structure preserving formulation of the moist compressible Euler equations. When discretised with a summation by parts method, our spatial discretisation conserves: mass, water, entropy, and energy. These properties are achieved by discretising a skew symmetric form of the moist compressible Euler equations, using entropy as a prognostic variable, and the summation-by-parts property of discrete derivative operators. Additionally, we derive a discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method with energy and tracer variance stable numerical fluxes, and experimentally verify our theoretical results through numerical simulations.</description>
