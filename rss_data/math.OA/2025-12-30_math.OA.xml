      <title>Infinitesimal moments in free and c-free probability and Motzkin paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinitesimal moments associated with infinitesimal freeness and infinitesimal conditional freeness are studied. For free random variables, we consider continuous deformations of moment functionals associated with Motzkin paths $w$, which provide a decomposition of their moments, and we compute their derivatives at zero. We show that the first-order derivative of each functional vanishes unless the path has exactly one local maximum. Geometrically, this means that $w$ is a pyramid path, which is consistent with the characteristic formula for alternating moments of infinitesimally free centered random variables. In this framework, infinitesimal Boolean independence is also obtained and it corresponds to flat paths. A similar approach is developed for infinitesimal conditional freeness, for which we show that the only moment functionals that have a non-zero first-order derivative are associated with concatenations of a pyramid path and a flat path. This charaterization leads to a Leibniz-type definition of infinitesimal conditional freeness at the level of moments.</description>

      <title>On the Brown measure of $x + i y$, with $x,y$ selfadjoint and $y$ free Poisson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $x,y$ be freely independent selfadjoint elements in a $W^{*}$-probability space, where $y$ has free Poisson distribution of parameter $p$. We pursue a methodology for computing the absolutely continuous part of the Brown measure of $x + i y$, which relies on the matrix-valued subordination function $\Omega$ of the Hermitization of $x + i y$, and on the fact that $\Omega$ has an explicitly described left inverse $H$. Our main point is that the Brown measure of $x + i y$ becomes more approachable when it is reparametrized via a certain change of variable $h : \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{M}$, with $\mathcal{D}, \mathcal{M}$ open subsets of $\mathbb{C}$, where $\mathcal{D}$ and $h$ are defined in terms of the aforementioned left inverse $H$, and $\mathrm{cl} \,(\mathcal{M})$ contains the support of the Brown measure. More precisely, we find (with some conditions on the distribution of $x$, which have to be imposed for certain values of the parameter $p$) the following formula: \[ f(s + i \, t) =\frac{1}{4\pi}\left[\frac{2}{t}\left(\frac{\partial \alpha}{\partial s} +\frac{\partial \beta}{\partial t}\right)-\frac{2}{t}-\frac{2\beta}{t^2}\right], \ \ s + i \, t \in \mathcal{M}, \] where $f$ is the density of the absolutely continuous part of the Brown measure and the functions $\alpha, \beta : \mathcal{M} \to \mathbb{R}$ are the real and respectively the imaginary part of $h^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>On regions of mixed unitarity for semigroups of unital quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is established that both discrete and continuous semigroups of unital quantum channels are eventually mixed unitary. However, after introducing the mixed unitary index of a unital quantum channel as the least time beyond which all subsequent powers of the channel are mixed unitary, we demonstrate that for any fixed finite dimension $d\geq 3$, there exists no universal upper bound for this index. Furthermore, for a continuous semigroup that is not mixed unitary for some $t&gt;0$, we prove it remains non-mixed unitary for all times $t&gt;0$, sufficiently close to the origin. Finally, a necessary and sufficient condition is derived for a quantum dynamical semigroup to be a convex combination of maps implemented solely by Weyl unitaries.</description>

      <title>Stable homotopy theory of invertible gapped quantum spin systems I: Kitaev's $\Omega$-spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical realization of a conjecture by Kitaev, on the basis of the operator-algebraic formulation of infinite quantum spin systems. Our main results are threefold. First, we construct an $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$ whose homotopy groups are isomorphic to the smooth homotopy group of invertible gapped quantum systems on Euclidean spaces. Second, we develop a model for the homology theory associated with the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*$, describing it in terms of the space of quantum systems placed on an arbitrary subspace of a Euclidean space. This involves introducing the concept of localization flow, a semi-infinite path of quantum systems with decaying interaction range, inspired by Yu's localization C*-algebra in coarse index theory. Third, we incorporate spatial symmetries given by a crystallographic group $\Gamma $ and define the $\Omega$-spectrum $\mathit{IP}_*^\Gamma$ of $\Gamma$-invariant invertible phases. We propose a strategy for computing the homotopy group $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma )$ that uses the Davis--L\"{u}ck assembly map and its description by invertible gapped localization flow. In particular, we show that the assembly map is split injective, and hence $\pi_n(\mathit{IP}_d^\Gamma)$ contains a computable direct summand.</description>
