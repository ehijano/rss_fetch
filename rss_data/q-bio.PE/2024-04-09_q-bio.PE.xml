      <title>A hybrid discrete-continuum modelling approach for the interactions of the immune system with oncolytic viral infections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oncolytic virotherapy, utilizing genetically modified viruses to combat cancer and trigger anti-cancer immune responses, has garnered significant attention in recent years. In our previous work arXiv:2305.12386, we developed a stochastic agent-based model elucidating the spatial dynamics of infected and uninfected cells within solid tumours. Building upon this foundation, we present a novel stochastic agent-based model to describe the intricate interplay between the virus and the immune system; the agents' dynamics are coupled with a balance equation for the concentration of the chemoattractant that guides the movement of immune cells. We formally derive the continuum limit of the model and carry out a systematic quantitative comparison between this system of PDEs and the individual-based model in two spatial dimensions. Furthermore, we describe the traveling waves of the three populations, with the uninfected proliferative cells trying to escape from the infected cells while immune cells infiltrate the tumour.
  Simulations show a good agreement between agent-based approaches and numerical results for the continuum model. Some parameter ranges give rise to oscillations of cell number in both models, in line with the behaviour of the corresponding nonspatial model, which presents Hopf bifurcations. Nevertheless, in some situations the behaviours of the two models may differ significantly, suggesting that stochasticity plays a key role in the dynamics. Our results highlight that a too rapid immune response, before the infection is well-established, appears to decrease the efficacy of the therapy and thus some care is needed when oncolytic virotherapy is combined with immunotherapy. This further suggests the importance of clinically improving the modulation of the immune response according to the tumour's characteristics and to the immune capabilities of the patients.</description>

      <title>Polygenic dynamics underlying the response of quantitative traits to directional selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the response of a quantitative trait to exponential directional selection in a finite haploid population at the genetic and the phenotypic level. We assume an infinite sites model, in which the number of new mutations per generation in the population follows a Poisson distribution (with mean $\Theta$) and each mutation occurs at a new, previously monomorphic site. Mutation effects are beneficial and drawn from a distribution. Sites are unlinked and contribute additively to the trait. Assuming that selection is stronger than random genetic drift, we model the initial phase of the dynamics by a supercritical Galton-Watson process. This enables us to obtain time-dependent results. We show that the copy-number distribution of the mutant in generation n, conditioned on non-extinction until n, is described accurately by the deterministic increase from an initial distribution with mean 1. This distribution is related to the absolutely continuous part $W^+$ of the random variable, typically denoted $W$, that characterizes the stochasticity accumulating during the mutant's sweep. On this basis, we derive explicitly the (approximate) time dependence of the mutant frequency distribution, of the expected mean and variance of the trait and of the expected number of segregating sites. Unexpectedly, we obtain highly accurate approximations for all times, even for the quasi-stationary phase where we refine classical results. In addition, we find that $\Theta$ is the main determinant of the pattern of adaptation at the genetic level, i.e., whether the initial allele-frequency dynamics are best described by sweep-like patterns at few loci or small allele-frequency shifts at many. The selection strength determines primarily the rate of adaptation. The accuracy of our results is tested by comprehensive simulations in a Wright-Fisher framework.</description>

      <title>Switching particle systems for foraging ants showing phase transitions in path selections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Switching interacting particle systems studied in probability theory are the stochastic processes of hopping particles on a lattice made up of slow and fast particles, where the switching between these types of particles occurs randomly at a given transition rate. This paper explores how such stochastic processes involving multiple particles can model group behaviors of ants. Recent experimental research by the last author's group has investigated how ants switch between two types of primarily relied cues to select foraging paths based on the current situation. Here, we propose a discrete-time interacting random walk model on a square lattice, incorporating two types of hopping rules. Numerical simulation results demonstrate global changes in selected homing paths, transitioning from trailing paths of the `pheromone road' to nearly optimal paths depending on the switching parameters. By introducing two types of order parameters characterizing the dependence of homing duration distributions on switching parameters, we discuss these global changes as phase transitions in ant path selections. We also study critical phenomena associated with continuous phase transitions.</description>
