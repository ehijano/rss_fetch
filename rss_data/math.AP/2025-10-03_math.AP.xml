      <title>Localized Pattern Formation and Oscillatory Instabilities in a Three-component Gierer Meinhardt Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a three-component Gierer-Meinhardt model in the semi-strong interaction regime, characterized by an asymptotically large diffusivity ratio. A key feature of this model is that the interior spike can undergo Hopf bifurcations in both amplitude and position, leading to rich oscillatory dynamics not present in classical two-component systems. Using asymptotic analysis and numerical path-following, we construct localized spike equilibria and analyze spike nucleation that occurs through slow passage beyond a saddle-node bifurcation. Moreover, stability of spike equilibrium is analyzed by introducing time-scaling parameters, which reveal two distinct mechanisms: amplitude oscillations triggered by large-eigenvalue instabilities and oscillatory spike motion associated with small eigenvalues. Numerical simulations illustrate these dynamics and their transition regimes. This dual mechanism highlights richer spike behavior in three-component systems and suggests several open problems for future study.</description>

      <title>Symmetry analysis and new partially invariant solutions for the gas dynamics system with a special equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is a contribution to the symmetry analysis of the gas dynamics system in the vein of the ''podmodeli'' (submodels) program outlined by Ovsyannikov (1994). We consider the case of the special state equation, prescribing pressure to be the sum of entropy and an arbitrary function of density. Such a system has a 12-dimensional symmetry Lie algebra. This work advances the study of its four-dimensional subalgebras, continuing the work started in Siraeva (2024). For a large subset of not previously considered, non-similar four-dimensional subalgebras from an optimal list in Siraeva (2014), we compute a complete set of generating invariants. For one of the subalgebras, we construct a partially symmetry-reduced system. We explicitly solve this reduced system (submodel). This leads to new families of explicit solutions of the original system. We analyze the trajectories of these solutions. Additionally, we match each of the subalgebras considered in this paper with its isomorphism class, planting a seed for future study of the hierarchy of the reduced systems.</description>

      <title>Correlation estimates for Brownian particles with singular interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study particle systems with singular pairwise interactions and non-vanishing diffusion in the mean-field scaling. A classical approach to describing corrections to mean-field behavior is through the analysis of correlation functions. For bounded interactions, the optimal estimates on correlations are well known: the $m$-particle correlation function is $G_{N,m}=O(N^{1-m})$ for all $m$. Such estimates, however, have remained out of reach for more singular interactions. In this work, we develop a new framework based on linearized correlation functions, which allows us to derive robust bounds for systems with merely square-integrable interaction kernels, providing the first systematic control of correlations in the singular setting. Although at first not optimal, our estimates can be partially refined a posteriori using the BBGKY hierarchy: in the case of bounded interactions, our method recovers the known optimal estimates with a simplified argument. As key applications, we establish the validity of the Bogolyubov correction to mean field and prove a central limit theorem for the empirical measure, extending these results beyond the bounded interaction regime for the first time.</description>

      <title>On the attainment of boundary data in variational problems with linear growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that convex variational problems with linear growth and Dirichlet boundary conditions might not have minimizers if the boundary condition is not suitably relaxed.
  We show that for a wide range of integrands, including the least gradient problem and the non-parametric Plateau problem, and under suitable mean-convexity conditions of the boundary, minimizers of the relaxed problem attain the boundary data in the trace sense if it lies in $BV$ or $W^{\alpha,p}$ with $\alpha p\geq 2$ without any kind of continuity assumption. Unlike previous works, our methods are also able to treat systems under a certain quasi-isotropy assumption on the integrand. We further show that without this quasi-isotropy assumption, smooth counterexamples on uniformly convex domains exist.
  Further applications to the uniqueness of minimizers and to open problems about the ROF functional with Dirichlet boundary conditions, and to the trace space of functions of least gradient are given.</description>

      <title>Inertial instability of Couette flow with Coriolis force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the nonlinear inertial instability of Couette flow under Coriolis forcing in \(\mathbb{R}^{3}\). For the Coriolis coefficient \(f \in (0,1)\), we show that the non-normal operator associated with the linearized system admits only continuous spectrum. Hence, there are no exponentially growing eigenfunctions for the linearized system. Instead, we construct unstable solutions in the form of pseudo-eigenfunctions that exhibit non-ideal spectral properties. Then through a bootstrap argument and resolving the challenges posed by the non-ideal spectral behavior of pseudo-eigenfunctions, we establish the velocity instability of Couette flow in the Hadamard sense for $ f \in \Big(\frac{2}{17} \left(5-2 \sqrt{2}\right), \frac{2}{17} \left(5 + 2 \sqrt{2}\right) \Big)$.</description>

      <title>The weighted isoperimetric inequality and Sobolev inequality outside convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a weighted capillary isoperimetric inequality outside convex sets using the $\lambda_w$-ABP method. The weight function $w$ is assumed to be positive, even, and homogeneous of degree $\alpha$, such that $w^{1/\alpha}$ is concave on $\R^n$.
  Based on the weighted isoperimetric inequality, we develop a technique of capillary Schwarz symmetrization outside convex sets, and establish a weighted P\'{o}lya-Szeg\"{o} principle and a sharp weighted capillary Sobolev inequality outside convex domain. Our result can be seen as an extension of the weighted Sobolev inequality in the half-space established by Ciraolo-Figalli-Roncoroni in \cite{CFR}.</description>

      <title>On dispersive decay for the generalized Korteweg--de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove pointwise-in-time dispersive estimates for solutions to the generalized Korteweg--de Vries (gKdV) equation. In particular, for solutions to the mass-critical model, we assume only that initial data lie in $\dot{H}^{\frac{1}{4}} \cap \dot{H}^{-\frac{1}{12}}$ and show that solutions decay in $L^\infty$ like $|t|^{-\frac{1}{3}}$. To accomplish this, we develop a persistence of negative regularity for solutions to gKdV and extend Lorentz--Strichartz estimates to the mixed norm case.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Forward-Backward Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions to the equation $u u_x - u_{yy} = f$ in the vicinity of the linear shear flow, subject to perturbations of the source term and lateral boundary conditions. Since the solutions we consider have opposite signs in the lower and upper half of the domain, this is a quasilinear forward-backward parabolic problem, which changes type across a critical curved line within the domain. In particular, lateral boundary conditions can be imposed only where the characteristics are inwards. There are several difficulties associated with this problem. First, the forward-backward geometry depends on the solution itself. This requires to be quite careful with the approximation procedure used to construct solutions. Second, and more importantly, the linearized equations solved at each step of the iterative scheme admit a finite number of singular solutions, of which we provide an explicit construction. This is similar to well-known phenomena in elliptic problems in nonsmooth domains. Hence, the solutions to the equation are regular if and only if the source terms satisfy a finite number of orthogonality conditions. A key difficulty of this work is to cope with these orthogonality conditions during the nonlinear fixed-point scheme. In particular, we are led to prove their stability with respect to the underlying base flow. To tackle this deceivingly simple problem, we develop a methodology which we believe to be both quite natural and adaptable to other situations in which one wishes to prove the existence of regular solutions to a nonlinear problem for suitable data despite the existence of singular solutions at the linear level. This paper is a shorter version of [3].</description>

      <title>Notes on Schauder estimates by scaling for elliptic PDEs in divergence form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These are the notes of a part of the PhD course Regularity for free boundary problems and for elliptic PDEs, held in Pavia in the spring of 2025. The aim is to provide a comprehensive and self-contained treatment of classical interior and local Schauder estimates for second-order linear elliptic PDEs in divergence form via scaling in the spirit of Simon's work. The main techniques presented here are geometric in nature and were primarily developed in the study of geometric problems such as minimal surfaces. The adopted approach relies on compactness and blow-up arguments, combined with rigidity results (Liouville theorems), and shares many features with the one used in the study of free boundary problems, which was the main topic of the other part of the PhD course.</description>

      <title>Strichartz and dispersive estimates for quantum bouncing ball model: exponential sums and Van der Corput methods in 1d semi-classical Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the one-dimensional semi-classical Schr\"odinger equation on the half-line with a linear potential and Dirichlet boundary conditions. Our main focus is on establishing improved dispersive and Strichartz estimates for this model, which govern the space-time behavior of solutions. We prove refined Strichartz bounds using Van der Corput-type derivative tests, beating previous known results where Strichartz estimates incur 1/4 losses. Moreover, assuming sharp bounds for certain exponential sums, our results indicate the possibility to reduce these losses further to $1/6 + \epsilon$ for all $\epsilon&gt;0$, which would be sharp. We further expect that analogous Strichartz bounds should hold within the Friedlander model domain in higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We consider classical solutions to $-\Delta u = f(u)$ in half-spaces, under homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. We prove that any positive solution is strictly monotone increasing in the direction orthogonal to the boundary, provided that it is directionally bounded on finite strips. As a corollary, we deduce a new Liouville-type theorem for the Lane-Emden equation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $\limsup$ inequality in the double gradient model for phase transitions governed by a Modica--Mortola functional with a double-well potential in two dimensions. Specifically, we consider energy functionals of the form \[ E_\varepsilon(u, \Omega) = \int_\Omega \left( \frac{1}{\varepsilon} W(\nabla u) + \varepsilon |\nabla^2 u|^2 \right) dx \] for maps $ u \in H^2(\Omega; \mathbb{R}^2) $, where $ W $ vanishes only at two wells. Assuming a bound on the optimal profile constant -- namely the cell problem on the unit cube -- in terms of the geodesic distance between the two wells, we characterise the limiting interfacial energy via periodic recovery sequences as $\varepsilon \to 0^+$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper employs layer potential techniques to investigate wave scattering in two-dimensional elastic media exhibiting high contrasts in both Lam\'{e} parameters and density. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we construct an invertible operator based on the kernel spaces of boundary integral operators, which enables the characterization of resonant frequencies through an orthogonality condition. Second, we use asymptotic analysis to derive the equation governing the leading-order terms of these resonant frequencies. Third, we analyze the scattered field in the interior domain for incident frequencies across different regimes and characterize the longitudinal and transverse far-field patterns in the exterior domain. Finally, we examine the subwavelength bandgap in the phononic crystal with a dilute structure.</description>

      <title>Transfer of Stability from the Classical to the Fractional Anisotropic Calder\'on Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss two spectral fractional anisotropic Calder\'on problems with source-to-solution measurements and their quantitative relation to the classical Calder\'on problem. Firstly, we consider the anistropic fractional Calder\'on problem from [FGKU25]. In this setting, we quantify the relation between the local and nonlocal Calder\'on problems which had been deduced in [R25] and provide an associated stability estimate. As a consequence, any stability result which holds on the level of the local problem with source-to-solution data has a direct nonlocal analogue (up to a logarithmic loss). Secondly, we introduce and discuss the fractional Calder\'on problem with source-to-solution measurements for the spectral fractional Dirichlet Laplacian on open, bounded, connected, Lipschitz sets on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Also in this context, we provide a qualitative and quantitative transfer of uniqueness from the local to the nonlocal setting. As a consequence, we infer the first stability results for the principal part for a fractional Calder\'on type problem for which no reduction of Liouville type is known. Our arguments rely on quantitative unique continuation arguments. As a result of independent interest, we also prove a quantitative relation between source-to-solution and Dirichlet-to-Neumann measurements for the classical Calder\'on problem.</description>

      <title>The noncommutative KP hierarchy and its solution via descent algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give the solution to the complete noncommutative Kadomtsev--Petviashvili (KP) hierarchy. We achieve this via direct linearisation which involves the Gelfand--Levitan--Marchenko (GLM) equation. This is a linear integral equation in which the scattering data satisfies the linearised KP hierarchy. The solution to the GLM equation is then shown to coincide with the solution to the noncommutative KP hierarchy. We achieve this using two approaches. In the first approach we use the standard Sato-Wilson dressing transformation. In the second approach, which was pioneered by Poppe, we assume the scattering data is semi-additive and by direct substitution, we show that the solution to the GLM equation satisfies the infinite set of field equations representing the noncommutative KP hierarchy. This approach relies on the augmented pre-Poppe algebra. This is a representative algebra that underlies the field equations representing the hierarchy. It is nonassociative and isomorphic to a descent algebra equipped with a grafting product. While we perform computations in the nonassociative descent algebra, the final result which establishes the solution to the complete hierarchy, resides in the natural associative subalgebra. The advantages of this second approach are that it is constructive, explicit, highlights the underlying combinatorial structures within the hierarchy, and reveals the mechanisms underlying the solution procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first give a general introduction to the mean curvature flow, and then discuss fundamental results established over the last 10 years that yield a precise theory for the flow through singularities in $\mathbb{R}^3$. With the aim of developing a satisfying theory in higher dimensions, we then describe our recent classification of all noncollapsed singularities in $\mathbb{R}^4$. Finally, we provide a detailed discussion of open problems and conjectures.</description>

      <title>Efficient manifold evolution algorithm using adaptive B-Spline interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores an efficient Lagrangian approach for evolving point cloud data on smooth manifolds. In this preliminary study, we focus on analyzing plane curves, and our ultimate goal is to provide an alternative to the conventional radial basis function (RBF) approach for manifolds in higher dimensions. In particular, we use the B-Spline as the basis function for all local interpolations. Just like RBF and other smooth basis functions, B-Splines enable the approximation of geometric features such as normal vectors and curvature. Once properly set up, the advantage of using B-Splines is that their coefficients carry geometric meanings. This allows the coefficients to be manipulated like points, facilitates rapid updates of the interpolant, and eliminates the need for frequent re-interpolation. Consequently, the removal and insertion of point cloud data become seamless processes, particularly advantageous in regions experiencing significant fluctuations in point density. The numerical results demonstrate the convergence of geometric quantities and the effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we show simulations of curvature flows whose speeds depend on the solutions of coupled reaction--diffusion systems for pattern formation.</description>

Abstract: We study regularity of the centered Hardy--Littlewood maximal function $M f$ of a function $f$ of bounded variation in $\mathbb R^d$, $d\in \mathbb N$. In particular, we show that at $|D^c f|$-a.e. point $x$ where $f$ has a non-concave blow-up, it holds that $M f(x)&gt;f^*(x)$. We further deduce from this that if the variation measure of $f$ has no jump part and its Cantor part has non-concave blow-ups, then BV regularity of $M f$ can be upgraded to Sobolev regularity.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Minkowski spacetime with regular conformal compactification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct perturbations of Minkowski spacetime in general relativity, when given initial data that decays inverse polynomially to initial data of a Kerr spacetime towards spacelike infinity. We show that the perturbations admit a regular conformal compactification at null and timelike infinity, where the degree of regularity increases linearly with the rate of decay of the initial data to Kerr initial data. In particular, the compactification is smooth if the initial data decays rapidly to Kerr initial data. This generalizes results of Friedrich, who constructed spacetimes with a smooth conformal compactification in the case when the initial data is identical to Kerr initial data on the complement of a compact set. Our results rely on a novel formulation of the Einstein equations about Minkowski spacetime introduced by the author, that allows one to formulate the dynamic problem as a quasilinear, symmetric hyperbolic PDE that is regular at null infinity and with null infinity being at a fixed locus. It is not regular at spacelike infinity, due to the asymptotics of Kerr. Thus the main technical task is the construction of solutions near spacelike infinity, using tailored energy estimates. To accomplish this, we organize the equations according to homogeneity with respect to scaling about spacelike infinity, which identifies terms that are leading, respectively lower order, near spacelike infinity, with contributions from Kerr being lower order.</description>

Abstract: We solve the open problem by Demuth, Hansmann, and Katriel announced in [Integr. Equ. Oper. Theory 75 (2013), 1-5] by a counter-example construction. The problem concerns a possible generalisation of the Lieb-Thirring inequality for Schr\"odinger operators in to the case of complex-valued potentials. A counter-example has already been found for the one-dimensional case by the first and third authors in [J. Spectr. Theory 11 (2021), 1391-1413]. Here we generalise the counter-example to higher dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove optimal Lieb-Thirring type inequalities for Schr\"odinger and Jacobi operators with complex potentials. Our results bound eigenvalue power sums (Riesz means) by the $L^p$ norm of the potential, where in contrast to the self-adjoint case, each term needs to be weighted by a function of the ratio of the distance of the eigenvalue to the essential spectrum and the distance to the endpoint(s) thereof. Our Lieb-Thirring type bounds only hold for integrable weight functions. To prove optimality, we establish divergence estimates for non-integrable weight functions. The divergence rates exhibit a logarithmic or even polynomial gain compared to semiclassical methods (Weyl asymptotics) for real potentials.</description>

Abstract: We construct a two-parameter continuum of type II blow up solutions for the energy-critical focusing NLS in dimension $ d = 3$. The solutions collapse to a single energy bubble in finite time, precisely they have the form $ u(t,x) = e^{i \alpha(t)}\lambda(t)^{\frac{1}{2}}W(\lambda(t) x) + \eta(t, x )$, $ t \in[0, T)$, $ x \in \mathbb{R}^3$, where $ W( x) = \big( 1 + \frac{|x|^2}{3}\big)^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ is the ground state solution, $\lambda(t) = (T-t)^{- \frac12 - \nu} $ for suitable $ \nu &gt; 0 $, $ \alpha(t) = \alpha_0 \log(T - t)$ and $ T= T(\nu, \alpha_0) &gt; 0 $. Further $ \|\eta(t) - \eta_T\|_{\dot{H}^1 \cap \dot{H}^2} = o(1)$ as $ t \to T^-$ for some $ \eta_T \in \dot{H}^{1} \cap~ \dot{H}^2$.</description>

      <title>Refined asymptotics for the Cauchy problem for the fast $p$-Laplace evolution equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our focus is on the fast diffusion equation driven by the $p$-Laplacian operator, that is $\partial_t u=\Delta_p u$ with $1&lt;p&lt;2$, posed in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N\geq 2$. The nonnegative solutions are expected to converge in time toward a stationary profile. While such convergence had been previously established for $p$ close to $2$, no quantitative rates were known, and the asymptotic behaviour remained poorly understood across the full fast diffusion range. In fact, the long time behaviour of solutions to the $p$-Laplace Cauchy problem drastically change in different subranges of the $p$. Some of them are analysed here for the first time.
  In this work, we provide the convergence rates for nonnegative, integrable solutions in the so-called good fast diffusion range, $p_c=\tfrac{2N}{N+1} &lt;p&lt;2$, where mass is conserved. We prove that solutions converge to a self-similar profile with matching mass, with explicit rates measured in relative error. Our constructive proof is based on a new entropy method that remains effective even when the entropy is not displacement convex -- where optimal transport techniques fail.
  In the very fast diffusion range $1&lt;p&lt;p_c$, we give the first asymptotic analysis near the extinction time. We uncover new critical exponents -- especially in high dimensions -- that give rise to markedly different qualitative behaviour depending on the value of $p$.
  We also establish convergence rates for the gradients of radial solutions in the good fast diffusion range, again measured in relative error. Finally, we analyze the structural properties required for the entropy method to apply, thereby opening a broader investigation into the basin of attraction of Barenblatt-type profiles, particularly in the singular case of $p$ close to $1$.</description>

Abstract: We consider a free energy functional defined on probability densities on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^d$, and investigate its global minimizers. The energy consists of two components: an entropy and a nonlocal interaction energy, which favour spreading and aggregation behaviour, respectively. We find a threshold value for the size of the attractive interactions, and establish the global energy minimizers in each case. The bifurcation at this threshold value is investigated. We also generalize the results to spaces consisting of an arbitrary number of spheres (e.g., the flat torus $\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^1$).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12804v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Substantially extending previous results of the authors for smooth solutions in the viscous case, we develop linear damping estimates for periodic roll-wave solutions of the inviscid Saint-Venant equations and related systems of hyperbolic balance laws. Such damping estimates, consisting of $H^s$ energy estimates yielding exponential slaving of high-derivative to low-derivative norms, have served as crucial ingredients in nonlinear stability analyses of traveling waves in hyperbolic or partially parabolic systems, both in obtaining high-frequency resolvent estimates and in closing a nonlinear iteration for which available linearized stability estimates apparently lose regularity. Here, we establish for systems of size $n\leq 6$ a Lyapunov-type theorem stating that such energy estimates are available whenever strict high-frequency spectral stability holds; for dimensions 7 and higher, there may be in general a gap between high-frequency spectral stability and existence of the type of energy estimate that we develop here. A key ingredient is a dimension-dependent linear algebraic lemma reminiscent of Lyapunov's Lemma for ODE that is to our knowledge new.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies a nonlinear diffusion equation with memory: $$u_t=\nabla\cdot \big( D(x)\cdot\int_0^t K(t-s) \nabla\cdot\Phi(u(x,s))ds \big)+f(x,t)$$ Where $K$ is memory Kernel and $D(x)$ is bounded. Under monotonicity and growth conditions on $\Phi$, the existence and uniqueness of weak solution is established. The analysis employs Orthogonal approximation, energy estimates, and monotone operator theory. The convolution structure is handled within variational frameworks. The result provides a basis for studying memory-type diffusion.</description>

Abstract: This short note modifies a reconstruction method by the author (Comm.~PDE, 45(9):1118--1133, 2020), for reconstructing piecewise constant conductivities in the Calder\'on problem (electrical impedance tomography). In the former paper, a layering assumption and the local Neumann-to-Dirichlet map were needed since the piecewise constant partition also was assumed unknown. Here I show how to modify the method in case the partition is known, for general piecewise constant conductivities and only a finite number of partial boundary measurements. Moreover, no lower/upper bounds on the unknown conductivity are needed.</description>

      <title>Sharp remainder terms and stability of weighted Hardy-Poincar\'e and Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl inequalities related to the Baouendi-Grushin operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain sharp remainder terms for the Hardy-Poincar\'e inequalities with general non-radial weights in the setting of Baouendi-Grushin vector fields (see Theorem 2.5). It is worth emphasizing that all of our results are new both in the Baouendi-Grushin and standard Euclidean settings. The method employed allows us to not only unify, but also improve the results of Kombe and Yener [KY18] for any $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ while holding true for complex-valued functions and providing explicit constants (Corollary 2.7). As a result, we are able to obtain sharp remainder terms to many known weighted Hardy-type inequalities (see Section 3.1). Aside from weighted Hardy-type inequalities, we also recover a sharp remainder formula for the $L^{p}$-Poincar\'e inequality (Corollary 3.5). In the special case of radial weights, we are naturally able to introduce the notion of Baouendi-Grushin $p$-Bessel pairs (see Definition 2.9). Finally, we apply the technique to establish the sharp remainder term of the Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl inequality in $L^{p}$ for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ (Corollary 3.13), which includes the sharp constant. This makes it possible to obtain the $L^{p}$-analogue for $2\leq p &lt; n$ (Theorem 3.17) of a stability result by Cazacu, Flynn, Lam and Lu [CFLL24].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Energy decay rates of damped waves on the torus depend on the behavior of the damping near the undamped region and on the geometry of the damped set. In this paper we refine these geometric considerations, by introducing the concept of order of a glancing undamped point, and estimating decay rates in terms of this order. The proof is based on generalizing an averaging argument due to Sun. We also show that damping sets which attain these improvements are generic among polygons and smooth curves.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between solvability of the Dirichlet and Regularity problem under an $L^1$ Carleson condition on $\partial_t A$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an elliptic operator $L:=\mathrm{div}(A\nabla \cdot)$ on the upper half space. It is known that solvability of the Regularity problem in $\dot{W}^{1,p}$ implies solvability of the adjoint Dirichlet problem in $L^{p'}$. Previously, Shen (2007) established a partial reverse result. In our work, we show that if we assume an $L^1$-Carleson condition on only $|\partial_t A|$ the full reverse direction holds. As a result, we obtain equivalence between solvability of the Dirichlet problem $(D)^*_{p'}$ and the Regularity problem $(R)_p$ under this condition.
  As a further consequence, we can extend the class of operators for which the $L^p$ Regularity problem is solvable by operators satisfying the mixed $L^1-L^\infty$ condition. Additionally in the case of the upper half plane, this class includes operators satisfying this $L^1$-Carleson condition on $|\partial_t A|$.</description>

      <title>Numerical Approximation of the Critical Value of Eikonal Hamilton-Jacobi Equations on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical value of an eikonal equation is the unique value of a parameter for which the equation admits solutions and is deeply related to the effective Hamiltonian of a corresponding homogenization problem. We study approximation strategies for the critical value of eikonal equations posed on networks. They are based on the large time behavior of corresponding time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equations. We provide error estimates and some numerical tests, showing the performance and the convergence properties of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Mixed Christoffel-Minkowski problems for bodies of revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09794v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mixed Christoffel-Minkowski problem asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for a Borel measure on the Euclidean unit sphere to be the mixed area measure of some convex bodies, one of which, appearing multiple times, is free and the rest are fixed. In the case where all bodies involved are symmetric around a common axis, we provide a complete solution to this problem, without assuming any regularity. In particular, we refine Firey's classification of area measures of figures of revolution.
  In our argument, we introduce an easy way to transform mixed area measures and mixed volumes involving axially symmetric bodies, and we significantly improve Firey's estimate on the local behavior of area measures. As a secondary result, we obtain a family of Hadwiger type theorems for convex valuations that are invariant under rotations around an axis.</description>
