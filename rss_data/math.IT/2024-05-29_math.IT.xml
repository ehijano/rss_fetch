      <title>On Counting Subsequences and Higher-Order Fibonacci Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In array-based DNA synthesis, multiple strands of DNA are synthesized in parallel to reduce the time cost from the sum of their lengths to the length their shortest common supersequences. To maximize the amount of information that can be synthesized into DNA within a finite amount of time, we study the number of unordered sets of $n$ strands of DNA that have a common supersequence whose length is at most $t$. Our analysis stems from the following connection: The number of subsequences of A C G T A C G T A C G T ... is the partial sum (prefix sum) of the fourth-order Fibonacci numbers.</description>

      <title>Wireless Federated Learning over Resource-Constrained Networks: Digital versus Analog Transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enable wireless federated learning (FL) in communication resource-constrained networks, two communication schemes, i.e., digital and analog ones, are effective solutions. In this paper, we quantitatively compare these two techniques, highlighting their essential differences as well as respectively suitable scenarios. We first examine both digital and analog transmission schemes, together with a unified and fair comparison framework under imbalanced device sampling, strict latency targets, and transmit power constraints. A universal convergence analysis under various imperfections is established for evaluating the performance of FL over wireless networks. These analytical results reveal that the fundamental difference between the digital and analog communications lies in whether communication and computation are jointly designed or not. The digital scheme decouples the communication design from FL computing tasks, making it difficult to support uplink transmission from massive devices with limited bandwidth and hence the performance is mainly communication-limited. In contrast, the analog communication allows over-the-air computation (AirComp) and achieves better spectrum utilization. However, the computation-oriented analog transmission reduces power efficiency, and its performance is sensitive to computation errors from imperfect channel state information (CSI). Furthermore, device sampling for both schemes are optimized and differences in sampling optimization are analyzed. Numerical results verify the theoretical analysis and affirm the superior performance of the sampling optimization.</description>

      <title>On the Downlink Average {Energy }Efficiency of Non-Stationary XL-MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extra large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is a key technology for future wireless communication systems. This paper considers the effects of visibility region (VR) at the base station (BS) in a non-stationary multi-user XL-MIMO scenario, where only partial antennas can receive users' signal. In time division duplexing (TDD) mode, we first estimate the VR at the BS by detecting the energy of the received signal during uplink training phase. The probabilities of two detection errors are derived and the uplink channel on the detected VR is estimated. In downlink data transmission, to avoid cumbersome Monte-Carlo trials, we derive a deterministic approximate expression for ergodic {average energy efficiency (EE)} with the regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding. In frequency division duplexing (FDD) mode, the VR is estimated in uplink training and then the channel information of detected VR is acquired from the feedback channel. In downlink data transmission, the approximation of ergodic average {EE} is also derived with the RZF precoding. Invoking approximate results, we propose an alternate optimization algorithm to design the detection threshold and the pilot length in both TDD and FDD modes. The numerical results reveal the impacts of VR estimation error on ergodic average {EE} and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Cascaded Group Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a variation of the group testing problem where each test is specified by an ordered subset of items, and returns the first defective item in the specified order. We refer to this as \textit{cascaded group testing} and the goal is to identify a small set of $K$ defective items amongst a collection of size $N$, using as few tests as possible. For the adaptive testing regime, we show that a simple scheme is able to find all defective items in at most $K$ tests, which is optimal. For the non-adaptive setting, we first come up with a necessary and sufficient condition for any collection of tests to be feasible for recovering all the defectives. Using this, we are able to show that any feasible non-adaptive strategy requires at least $\Omega(K^2)$ tests. In terms of achievability, it is easy to show that a collection of $O(K^2 \log (N/K))$ randomly constructed tests is feasible. We show via carefully constructed explicit designs that one can do significantly better. We provide two simple schemes for $K = 1, 2$ which only require one and two tests respectively irrespective of the number of items $N$. Note that this is in contrast to standard binary group testing, where at least $\Omega(\log N)$ tests are required. The case of $K \ge 3$ is more challenging and here we come up with an iterative design which requires only $\text{poly}(\log \log N)$ tests.</description>

      <title>Performance of Slotted ALOHA in User-Centric Cell-Free Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To efficiently utilize the scarce wireless resource, the random access scheme has been attaining renewed interest primarily in supporting the sporadic traffic of a large number of devices encountered in the Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper we investigate the performance of slotted ALOHA -- a simple and practical random access scheme -- in connection with the grant-free random access protocol applied for user-centric cell-free massive MIMO. More specifically, we provide the expression of the sum-throughput under the assumptions of the capture capability owned by the centralized detector in the uplink. Further, a comparative study of user-centric cell-free massive MIMO with other types of networks is provided, which allows us to identify its potential and possible limitation. Our numerical simulations show that the user-centric cell-free massive MIMO has a good trade-off between performance and fronthaul load, especially at low activation probability regime.</description>

      <title>Generator polynomials of cyclic expurgated or extended Goppa codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Goppa codes are a well-known class of codes with applications in code-based cryptography, which are a special case of alternant codes. Many papers are devoted to the search for Goppa codes with a cyclic extension or with a cyclic parity-check subcode. Let $\Bbb F_q$ be a finite field with $q=2^l$ elements, where $l$ is a positive integer. In this paper, we determine all the generator polynomials of cyclic expurgated or extended Goppa codes under some prescribed permutations induced by the projective general linear automorphism $A \in PGL_2(\Bbb F_q)$. Moreover, we provide some examples to support our findings.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometry Codes for Cross-Subspace Alignment in Private Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new framework for interference alignment in secure and private information retrieval (PIR) from colluding servers is proposed, generalizing the original cross-subspace alignment (CSA) codes proposed by Jia, Sun, and Jafar. The general scheme is built on algebraic geometry codes and explicit constructions with replicated storage are given over curves of genus zero and one. It is shown that the proposed scheme offers interesting tradeoffs between the field size, file size, number of colluding servers, and the total number of servers. When the field size is fixed, this translates in some cases to higher retrieval rates than those of the original scheme. In addition, the new schemes exist also in cases where the original ones do not.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Approximate Message Passing Algorithms for Spiked Matrix Models with Rotationally Invariant Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a rank one signal matrix from an observed matrix generated by corrupting the signal with additive rotationally invariant noise. We develop a new class of approximate message-passing algorithms for this problem and provide a simple and concise characterization of their dynamics in the high-dimensional limit. At each iteration, these algorithms exploit prior knowledge about the noise structure by applying a non-linear matrix denoiser to the eigenvalues of the observed matrix and prior information regarding the signal structure by applying a non-linear iterate denoiser to the previous iterates generated by the algorithm. We exploit our result on the dynamics of these algorithms to derive the optimal choices for the matrix and iterate denoisers. We show that the resulting algorithm achieves the smallest possible asymptotic estimation error among a broad class of iterative algorithms under a fixed iteration budget.</description>

      <title>What characteristics define disinformation and fake news?: review of taxonomies and definitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What characteristics define disinformation and fake news? To address this research question, this Technical Note provides a comprehensive analysis of disinformation and fake news, synthesizing 46 definitions and highlighting four key points addressing their fundamental characteristics. Adopting the Prisma 2020 method, five search sets with the Boolean operator AND were selected in both Portuguese and English, which were applied across four databases, resulting in 237 reviewed articles. Following a meticulous analysis, relevant articles were identified and included, while duplicates and inaccessible documents were excluded. It points to disinformation as information that is totally or partially false, crafted by a sender with the aim of misleading, with opportunistic content designed to manipulate reality, being amplified by individual characteristics of the receiver in their interpretation and by contextual factors in which they are embedded. This Technical Note seeks to contribute to an understanding of the phenomenon of disinformation that includes the contextual dimension, obtaining as fundamental elements of analysis: I.) Sender; II.) Content; III.) Receiver; and IV.) Environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate CSS and CSS-T quantum error-correcting codes from the point of view of their existence, rarity, and performance. We give a lower bound on the number of pairs of linear codes that give rise to a CSS code with good correction capability, showing that such pairs are easy to produce with a randomized construction. We then prove that CSS-T codes exhibit the opposite behaviour, showing also that, under very natural assumptions, their rate and relative distance cannot be simultaneously large. This partially answers an open question on the feasible parameters of CSS-T codes. We conclude with a simple construction of CSS-T codes from Hermitian curves. The paper also offers a concise introduction to CSS and CSS-T codes from the point of view of classical coding theory.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Quadratic Transform and WMMSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional programming (FP) arises in various communications and signal processing problems because several key quantities in the field are fractionally structured, e.g., the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound, the Fisher information, and the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). A recently proposed method called the quadratic transform has been applied to the FP problems extensively. The main contributions of the present paper are two-fold. First, we investigate how fast the quadratic transform converges. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that analyzes the convergence rate for the quadratic transform as well as its special case the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm. Second, we accelerate the existing quadratic transform via a novel use of Nesterov's extrapolation scheme [1]. Specifically, by generalizing the minorization-maximization (MM) approach in [2], we establish a nontrivial connection between the quadratic transform and the gradient projection, thereby further incorporating the gradient extrapolation into the quadratic transform to make it converge more rapidly. Moreover, the paper showcases the practical use of the accelerated quadratic transform with two frontier wireless applications: integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) and massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO).</description>

Abstract: Basic algebraic and combinatorial properties of finite vector spaces in which individual vectors are allowed to have multiplicities larger than $ 1 $ are derived. An application in coding theory is illustrated by showing that multispace codes that are introduced here may be used in random linear network coding scenarios, and that they generalize standard subspace codes (defined in the set of all subspaces of $ \mathbb{F}_q^n $) and extend them to an infinitely larger set of parameters. In particular, in contrast to subspace codes, multispace codes of arbitrarily large cardinality and minimum distance exist for any fixed $ n $ and $ q $.</description>

      <title>Operational Interpretation of the Sandwiched R\'enyi Divergence of Order 1/2 to 1 as Strong Converse Exponents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00554v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence of order $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$, as well as its induced quantum information quantities, with an operational interpretation in the characterization of the exact strong converse exponents of quantum tasks. Specifically, we consider (a) smoothing of the max-relative entropy, (b) quantum privacy amplification, and (c) quantum information decoupling. We solve the problem of determining the exact strong converse exponents for these three tasks, with the performance being measured by the fidelity or purified distance. The results are given in terms of the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence of order $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$, and its induced quantum R\'enyi conditional entropy and quantum R\'enyi mutual information. This is the first time to find the precise operational meaning for the sandwiched R\'enyi divergence with R\'enyi parameter in the interval $\alpha\in(\frac{1}{2},1)$.</description>

Abstract: We study security-latency bounds for Nakamoto consensus, i.e., how secure a block is after it becomes $k$-deep in the chain. We improve the state-of-the-art bounds by analyzing the race between adversarial and honest chains in three different phases. We find the probability distribution of the growth of the adversarial chains under models similar to those in [Guo, Ren; AFT 2022] when a target block becomes $k$-deep in the chain. We analyze certain properties of this race to model each phase with random walks that provide tighter bounds than the existing results. Combining all three phases provides novel upper and lower bounds for blockchains with small $\lambda\Delta$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between adversarial robustness and differential privacy in high-dimensional algorithmic statistics. We give the first black-box reduction from privacy to robustness which can produce private estimators with optimal tradeoffs among sample complexity, accuracy, and privacy for a wide range of fundamental high-dimensional parameter estimation problems, including mean and covariance estimation. We show that this reduction can be implemented in polynomial time in some important special cases. In particular, using nearly-optimal polynomial-time robust estimators for the mean and covariance of high-dimensional Gaussians which are based on the Sum-of-Squares method, we design the first polynomial-time private estimators for these problems with nearly-optimal samples-accuracy-privacy tradeoffs. Our algorithms are also robust to a nearly optimal fraction of adversarially-corrupted samples.</description>

      <title>Fidelity-Based Smooth Min-Relative Entropy: Properties and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fidelity-based smooth min-relative entropy is a distinguishability measure that has appeared in a variety of contexts in prior work on quantum information, including resource theories like thermodynamics and coherence. Here we provide a comprehensive study of this quantity. First we prove that it satisfies several basic properties, including the data-processing inequality. We also establish connections between the fidelity-based smooth min-relative entropy and other widely used information-theoretic quantities, including smooth min-relative entropy and smooth sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy, of which the sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropy and smooth max-relative entropy are special cases. After that, we use these connections to establish the second-order asymptotics of the fidelity-based smooth min-relative entropy and all smooth sandwiched R\'enyi relative entropies, finding that the first-order term is the quantum relative entropy and the second-order term involves the quantum relative entropy variance. Utilizing the properties derived, we also show how the fidelity-based smooth min-relative entropy provides one-shot bounds for operational tasks in general resource theories in which the target state is mixed, with a particular example being randomness distillation. The above observations then lead to second-order expansions of the upper bounds on distillable randomness, as well as the precise second-order asymptotics of the distillable randomness of particular classical-quantum states. Finally, we establish semi-definite programs for smooth max-relative entropy and smooth conditional min-entropy, as well as a bilinear program for the fidelity-based smooth min-relative entropy, which we subsequently use to explore the tightness of a bound relating the last to the first.</description>

      <title>Degree-$M$ Bethe and Sinkhorn Permanent Based Bounds on the Permanent of a Non-negative Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02280v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The permanent of a non-negative square matrix can be well approximated by finding the minimum of the Bethe free energy functions associated with some suitably defined factor graph; the resulting approximation to the permanent is called the Bethe permanent. Vontobel gave a combinatorial characterization of the Bethe permanent via degree-$M$ Bethe permanents, which are based on degree-$M$ covers of the underlying factor graph. In this paper, we prove a degree-$M$-Bethe-permanent-based lower bound on the permanent of a non-negative matrix, which solves a conjecture proposed by Vontobel in [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, Mar. 2013]. We also prove a degree-$M$-Bethe-permanent-based upper bound on the permanent of a non-negative matrix. In the limit $M \to \infty$, these lower and upper bounds yield known Bethe-permanent-based lower and upper bounds on the permanent of a non-negative matrix. Moreover, we prove similar results for an approximation to the permanent known as the (scaled) Sinkhorn permanent.</description>

      <title>Quantum Pufferfish Privacy: A Flexible Privacy Framework for Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a versatile privacy framework for quantum systems, termed quantum pufferfish privacy (QPP). Inspired by classical pufferfish privacy, our formulation generalizes and addresses limitations of quantum differential privacy by offering flexibility in specifying private information, feasible measurements, and domain knowledge. We show that QPP can be equivalently formulated in terms of the Datta-Leditzky information spectrum divergence, thus providing the first operational interpretation thereof. We reformulate this divergence as a semi-definite program and derive several properties of it, which are then used to prove convexity, composability, and post-processing of QPP mechanisms. Parameters that guarantee QPP of the depolarization mechanism are also derived. We analyze the privacy-utility tradeoff of general QPP mechanisms and, again, study the depolarization mechanism as an explicit instance. The QPP framework is then applied to privacy auditing for identifying privacy violations via a hypothesis testing pipeline that leverages quantum algorithms. Connections to quantum fairness and other quantum divergences are also explored and several variants of QPP are examined.</description>

      <title>Practical limitations on robustness and scalability of quantum Internet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As quantum theory allows for information processing and computing tasks that otherwise are not possible with classical systems, there is a need and use of quantum Internet beyond existing network systems. At the same time, the realization of a desirably functional quantum Internet is hindered by fundamental and practical challenges such as high loss during transmission of quantum systems, decoherence due to interaction with the environment, fragility of quantum states, etc. We study the implications of these constraints by analyzing the limitations on the scaling and robustness of quantum Internet. Considering quantum networks, we present practical bottlenecks for secure communication, delegated computing, and resource distribution among end nodes. Motivated by the power of abstraction in graph theory (in association with quantum information theory), we consider graph-theoretic quantifiers to assess network robustness and provide critical values of communication lines for viable communication over quantum Internet.
  In particular, we begin by discussing limitations on usefulness of isotropic states as device-independent quantum key repeaters which otherwise could be useful for device-independent quantum key distribution. We consider some quantum networks of practical interest, ranging from satellite-based networks connecting far-off spatial locations to currently available quantum processor architectures within computers, and analyze their robustness to perform quantum information processing tasks. Some of these tasks form primitives for delegated quantum computing, e.g., entanglement distribution and quantum teleportation. For some examples of quantum networks, we present algorithms to perform different quantum network tasks of interest such as constructing the network structure, finding the shortest path between a pair of end nodes, and optimizing the flow of resources at a node.</description>

      <title>FAdam: Adam is a natural gradient optimizer using diagonal empirical Fisher information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12807v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a mathematical foundation for the Adam optimizer, elucidating its connection to natural gradient descent through Riemannian and information geometry. We rigorously analyze the diagonal empirical Fisher information matrix (FIM) in Adam, clarifying all detailed approximations and advocating for the use of log probability functions as loss, which should be based on discrete distributions, due to the limitations of empirical FIM. Our analysis uncovers flaws in the original Adam algorithm, leading to proposed corrections such as enhanced momentum calculations, adjusted bias corrections, adaptive epsilon, and gradient clipping. We refine the weight decay term based on our theoretical framework. Our modified algorithm, Fisher Adam (FAdam), demonstrates superior performance across diverse domains including LLM, ASR, and VQ-VAE, achieving state-of-the-art results in ASR.</description>

      <title>MambaVC: Learned Visual Compression with Selective State Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15413v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learned visual compression is an important and active task in multimedia. Existing approaches have explored various CNN- and Transformer-based designs to model content distribution and eliminate redundancy, where balancing efficacy (i.e., rate-distortion trade-off) and efficiency remains a challenge. Recently, state-space models (SSMs) have shown promise due to their long-range modeling capacity and efficiency. Inspired by this, we take the first step to explore SSMs for visual compression. We introduce MambaVC, a simple, strong and efficient compression network based on SSM. MambaVC develops a visual state space (VSS) block with a 2D selective scanning (2DSS) module as the nonlinear activation function after each downsampling, which helps to capture informative global contexts and enhances compression. On compression benchmark datasets, MambaVC achieves superior rate-distortion performance with lower computational and memory overheads. Specifically, it outperforms CNN and Transformer variants by 9.3% and 15.6% on Kodak, respectively, while reducing computation by 42% and 24%, and saving 12% and 71% of memory. MambaVC shows even greater improvements with high-resolution images, highlighting its potential and scalability in real-world applications. We also provide a comprehensive comparison of different network designs, underscoring MambaVC's advantages. Code is available at https://github.com/QinSY123/2024-MambaVC.</description>
