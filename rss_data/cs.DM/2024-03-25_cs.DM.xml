      <title>Robust Filter Design for Graph Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our goal in this paper is the robust design of filters acting on signals observed over graphs subject to small perturbations of their edges. The focus is on developing a method to identify spectral and polynomial graph filters that can adapt to the perturbations in the underlying graph structure while ensuring the filters adhere to the desired spectral mask. To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages approximate closed-form expressions for the perturbed eigendecomposition of the Laplacian matrix associated with the nominal topology. Furthermore, when dealing with noisy input signals for graph filters, we propose a strategy for designing FIR filters that jointly minimize the approximation error with respect to the ideal filter and the estimation error of the output, ensuring robustness against both graph perturbations and noise. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed strategies, highlighting their capability to efficiently manage perturbations and noise.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Group Spectra for Some Small Relation Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of characterizing the (finite) representable relation algebras in a ``nice" way is open. The class $\mathbf{RRA}$ is known to be not finitely axiomatizable in first-order logic. Nevertheless, it is conjectured that ``almost all'' finite relation algebras are representable.
  All finite relation algebras with three or fewer atoms are representable. So one may ask, Over what cardinalities of sets are they representable? This question was answered completely by Andr\'eka and Maddux (``Representations for small relation algebras,'' \emph{Notre Dame J. Form. Log.}, \textbf{35} (1994)); they determine the spectrum of every finite relation algebra with three or fewer atoms.
  In the present paper, we restrict attention to cyclic group representations, and completely determine the cyclic group spectrum for all seven symmetric integral relation algebras on three atoms. We find that in some instances, the spectrum and cyclic spectrum agree; in other instances, the spectra disagree for finitely many $n$; finally, for other instances, the spectra disagree for infinitely many $n$. The proofs employ constructions, SAT solvers, and the probabilistic method.</description>

      <title>SAT Encoding of Partial Ordering Models for Graph Coloring Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we suggest new SAT encodings of the partial-ordering based ILP model for the graph coloring problem (GCP) and the bandwidth coloring problem (BCP). The GCP asks for the minimum number of colors that can be assigned to the vertices of a given graph such that each two adjacent vertices get different colors. The BCP is a generalization, where each edge has a weight that enforces a minimal "distance" between the assigned colors, and the goal is to minimize the "largest" color used. For the widely studied GCP, we experimentally compare our new SAT encoding to the state-of-the-art approaches on the DIMACS benchmark set. Our evaluation confirms that this SAT encoding is effective for sparse graphs and even outperforms the state-of-the-art on some DIMACS instances. For the BCP, our theoretical analysis shows that the partial-ordering based SAT and ILP formulations have an asymptotically smaller size than that of the classical assignment-based model. Our practical evaluation confirms not only a dominance compared to the assignment-based encodings but also to the state-of-the-art approaches on a set of benchmark instances. Up to our knowledge, we have solved several open instances of the BCP from the literature for the first time.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Frequency Bin Interval in FFT via Dense Sampling Factor $\alpha$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a fundamental tool for signal analysis, widely used across various fields. However, traditional FFT methods encounter challenges in adjusting the frequency bin interval, which may impede accurate spectral analysis. In this study, we propose a method for adjusting the frequency bin interval in FFT by introducing a parameter $\alpha$. We elucidate the underlying principles of the proposed method and discuss its potential applications across various contexts. Our findings suggest that the proposed method offers a promising approach to overcome the limitations of traditional FFT methods and enhance spectral analysis accuracy.</description>

      <title>Connected greedy colourings of perfect graphs and other classes: the good, the bad and the ugly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.14003v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Grundy number of a graph is the maximum number of colours used by the "First-Fit" greedy colouring algorithm over all vertex orderings. Given a vertex ordering $\sigma= v_1,\dots,v_n$, the "First-Fit" greedy colouring algorithm colours the vertices in the order of $\sigma$ by assigning to each vertex the smallest colour unused in its neighbourhood.
  By restricting this procedure to vertex orderings that are connected, we obtain {\em connected greedy colourings}. For some graphs, all connected greedy colourings use exactly $\chi(G)$ colours; they are called {\em good graphs}. On the opposite, some graphs do not admit any connected greedy colouring using only $\chi(G)$ colours; they are called {\em ugly graphs}.
  We show that no perfect graph is ugly. We also give simple proofs of this fact for subclasses of perfect graphs (block graphs, comparability graphs), and show that no $K_4$-minor free graph is ugly.
  Moreover, our proofs are constructive, and imply the existence of polynomial-time algorithms to compute good connected orderings for these graph classes.</description>

      <title>Counting Kernels in Directed Graphs with Arbitrary Orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A kernel of a directed graph is a subset of vertices that is both independent and absorbing (every vertex not in the kernel has an out-neighbour in the kernel). Not all directed graphs contain kernels, and computing a kernel or deciding that none exist is NP-complete even on low-degree planar digraphs. The existing polynomial-time algorithms for this problem all restrict both the undirected structure and the edge orientations of the input: for example, to chordal graphs without bidirectional edges (Pass-Lanneau, Igarashi and Meunier, Discrete Appl Math 2020) or to permutation graphs where each clique has a sink (Abbas and Saoula, 4OR 2005). By contrast, we count the kernels of a fuzzy circular interval graph in polynomial time, regardless of its edge orientations, and return a kernel when one exists. (Fuzzy circular graphs were introduced by Chudnovsky and Seymour in their structure theorem for claw-free graphs.) We also consider kernels on cographs, where we establish NP-hardness in general but linear running times on the subclass of threshold graphs.</description>

      <title>Sample compression schemes for balls in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.13254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the open problems in machine learning is whether any set-family of VC-dimension $d$ admits a sample compression scheme of size $O(d)$. In this paper, we study this problem for balls in graphs. For a ball $B=B_r(x)$ of a graph $G=(V,E)$, a realizable sample for $B$ is a signed subset $X=(X^+,X^-)$ of $V$ such that $B$ contains $X^+$ and is disjoint from $X^-$. A proper sample compression scheme of size $k$ consists of a compressor and a reconstructor. The compressor maps any realizable sample $X$ to a subsample $X'$ of size at most $k$. The reconstructor maps each such subsample $X'$ to a ball $B'$ of $G$ such that $B'$ includes $X^+$ and is disjoint from $X^-$.
  For balls of arbitrary radius $r$, we design proper labeled sample compression schemes of size $2$ for trees, of size $3$ for cycles, of size $4$ for interval graphs, of size $6$ for trees of cycles, and of size $22$ for cube-free median graphs. For balls of a given radius, we design proper labeled sample compression schemes of size $2$ for trees and of size $4$ for interval graphs. We also design approximate sample compression schemes of size 2 for balls of $\delta$-hyperbolic graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an algebraic model of computation which formally relates symbolic listings, complexity of Boolean functions, and low depth arithmetic circuit complexity. In this model algorithms are arithmetic formula expressing symbolic listings of YES instances of Boolean functions, and computation is executed via partial differential operators. We consider the Chow rank of an arithmetic formula as a measure of complexity and establish the Chow rank of multilinear polynomials with totally non-overlapping monomial support. We also provide Chow rank non-decreasing transformations from sets of graphs to sets of functional graphs.</description>

      <title>Improved Dynamics for the Maximum Common Subgraph Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) problem plays a crucial role across various domains, bridging theoretical exploration and practical applications in fields like bioinformatics and social network analysis. Despite its wide applicability, MCS is notoriously challenging and is classified as an NP-Complete (NPC) problem. This study introduces new heuristics aimed at mitigating these challenges through the reformulation of the MCS problem as the Maximum Clique and its complement, the Maximum Independent Set. Our first heuristic leverages the Motzkin-Straus theorem to reformulate the Maximum Clique Problem as a constrained optimization problem, continuing the work of Pelillo in Replicator Equations, Maximal Cliques, and Graph Isomorphism (1999) with replicator dynamics and introducing annealed imitation heuristics as in Dominant Sets and Hierarchical Clustering (Pavan and Pelillo, 2003) to improve chances of convergence to better local optima. The second technique applies heuristics drawn upon strategies for the Maximum Independent Set problem to efficiently reduce graph sizes as used by Akiwa and Iwata in 2014. This enables faster computation and, in many instances, yields near-optimal solutions. Furthermore we look at the implementation of both techniques in a single algorithm and find that it is a promising approach. Our techniques were tested on randomly generated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph pairs. Results indicate the potential for application and substantial impact on future research directions.</description>

      <title>Flip-width: Cops and Robber on dense graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define new graph parameters, called flip-width, that generalize treewidth, degeneracy, and generalized coloring numbers for sparse graphs, and clique-width and twin-width for dense graphs. The flip-width parameters are defined using variants of the Cops and Robber game, in which the robber has speed bounded by a fixed constant $r\in\mathbb N\cup\{\infty\}$, and the cops perform flips (or perturbations) of the considered graph. We then propose a new notion of tameness of a graph class, called bounded flip-width, which is a dense counterpart of classes of bounded expansion of Ne\v{s}etril and Ossona de Mendez, and includes classes of bounded twin-width of Bonnet, Kim, Thomass{\'e}, and Watrigant. This unifies Sparsity Theory and Twin-width Theory, providing a common language for studying the central notions of the two theories, such as weak coloring numbers and twin-width -- corresponding to winning strategies of one player -- or dense shallow minors, rich divisions, or well-linked sets, corresponding to winning strategies of the other player. We prove that boundedness of flip-width is preserved by first-order interpretations, or transductions, generalizing previous results concerning classes of bounded expansion and bounded twin-width. We provide an algorithm approximating the flip-width of a given graph, which runs in slicewise polynomial time (XP) in the size of the graph. Finally, we propose a more general notion of tameness, called almost bounded flip-width, which is a dense counterpart of nowhere dense classes. We conjecture, and provide evidence, that classes with almost bounded flip-width coincide with monadically dependent (or monadically NIP) classes, introduced by Shelah in model theory. We also provide evidence that classes of almost bounded flip-width characterise the hereditary graph classes for which the model-checking problem is fixed-parameter tractable.</description>

      <title>Beatty Sequences for a Quadratic Irrational: Decidability and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ belong to the same quadratic field. We show that the inhomogeneous Beatty sequence $(\lfloor n \alpha + \beta \rfloor)_{n \geq 1}$ is synchronized, in the sense that there is a finite automaton that takes as input the Ostrowski representations of $n$ and $y$ in parallel, and accepts if and only if $y = \lfloor n \alpha + \beta \rfloor$. Since it is already known that the addition relation is computable for Ostrowski representations based on a quadratic number, a consequence is a new and rather simple proof that the first-order logical theory of these sequences with addition is decidable. The decision procedure is easily implemented in the free software Walnut.
  As an application, we show that for each $r \geq 1$ it is decidable whether the set $\{ \lfloor n \alpha + \beta \rfloor \, : \, n \geq 1 \}$ forms an additive basis (or asymptotic additive basis) of order $r$. Using our techniques, we also solve some open problems of Reble and Kimberling, and give an explicit characterization of a sequence of Hildebrand et al.</description>
