      <title>Tensor hypercontraction for fully self-consistent imaginary-time GF2 and GWSOX methods: theory, implementation, and role of the Green's function second-order exchange for intermolecular interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply tensor hypercontraction (THC) to reduce the computational scaling of expensive fully self-consistent Green's function methods. We present an efficient MPI-parallel algorithm and its implementation for evaluating the correlated second-order exchange term (SOX). This approach enabled us to conduct the largest fully self-consistent calculations with over 1100 atomic orbitals (AOs), with negligible errors attributed to THC fitting. Utilizing our THC implementation for scGW, scGF2, and scGWSOX (GW plus the SOX term iterated to achieve full Green's function self-consistency), we evaluated energies of intermolecular interactions. This approach allowed us to circumvent issues related to reference dependence and ambiguity in energy evaluation, which are common challenges in non-self-consistent calculations. We demonstrate that scGW exhibits a slight overbinding tendency for large systems, contrary to the underbinding observed with non-self-consistent RPA. Conversely, scGWSOX exhibits a slight underbinding tendency for such systems. This behavior is both physical and systematic and is caused by exclusion-principle violating diagrams or corresponding corrections. Our analysis elucidates the role played by these different diagrams, which is crucial for the construction of rigorous, accurate, and systematic methods. Finally, we explicitly show that all perturbative fully self-consistent Green's function methods are size-extensive.</description>

      <title>Excimer Formation in Zinc-phthalocyanine Revealed using Ultrafast Electron Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of excited dimer states, so called excimers, is an important phenomenon in many organic molecular semiconductors. In contrast to Frenkel exciton-polaron excited states, an excimer is long-lived and energetically low-lying due to stabilization resulting from a substantial reorganization of the inter-molecular geometry. In this letter, we show that ultrafast electron diffraction can follow the dynamics of solid-state excimer formation in polycrystalline thin films of a molecular semiconductor, revealing both the key reaction modes and the eventual structure of the emitting state. We study the prototypical organic semiconductor zinc-phthalocyanine (ZnPc) in its crystallographic $\alpha$-phase as a model excimeric system. We show, that the excimer forms in a two-step process starting with a fast dimerization ($\lesssim 0.4\, \text{ps}$) followed by a subsequent slow shear-twist motion ($14\, \text{ps}$) leading to an alignment of the $\pi$-systems of the involved monomers. Furthermore, we show that while the same excimer geomtry is present in partially fluorinated derivatives of ZnPc, the formation kinematics slow down with increasing level of fluorination.</description>

      <title>Efficient Random Phase Approximation for Diradicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the analytically solvable model of two electrons in two orbitals to diradical molecules, characterized by two unpaired electrons. The effect of the doubly occupied and empty orbitals is taken into account by means of random phase approximation (RPA). We show that in the static limit the direct RPA leads to the renormalization of the parameters of the two-orbital model. We test our model by comparing its predictions for the singlet-triplet splitting with the results from multi-reference CASSCF and NEVPT2 simulations for a set of ten molecules. We find that, for the whole set, the average relative difference between the singlet-triplet gaps predicted by the RPA-corrected two-orbital model and by NEVPT2 is about 40%. For the five molecules with the smallest singlet-triplet splitting the accuracy is better than 20%.</description>

      <title>A general framework for active space embedding methods: applications in quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a general framework for hybrid quantum-classical computing of molecular and periodic embedding calculations based on an orbital space separation of the fragment and environment degrees of freedom. We show its potential by presenting a specific implementation of periodic range-separated DFT coupled to a quantum circuit ansatz, whereby the variational quantum eigensolver and the quantum equation-of-motion approach are used to obtain the low-lying spectrum of the embedded fragment Hamiltonian. Application of this scheme to study strongly correlated molecular systems and localized electronic states in materials is showcased through the accurate prediction of the optical properties for the neutral oxygen vacancy in magnesium oxide (MgO). Despite some discrepancies in absorption predictions, the method demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art ab initio approaches, particularly evidenced by the accurate prediction of the photoluminescence emission peak.</description>

      <title>Understanding Radicals via Orbital Parities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce analysis of orbital parities as a concept and a tool for understanding radicals. Based on fundamental reduced one- and two-electron density matrices, our approach allows us to evaluate a total measure of radical character and provides spin-like orbitals to visualize real excess spin or odd electron distribution of singlet polyradicals. Finding spin-like orbitals aumotically results in their localization in the case of disjoint (zwitterionic) radicals and so enables radical classification based on spin-site separability. We demonstrate capabilities of the parity analysis by applying it to a number of polyradicals and to prototypical covalent bond breaking.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Reaction Dynamics of N$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atom-exchange and atomization dissociation dynamics for the N($^4$S) + N$_2(^1 \Sigma_{\rm g}^+)$ reaction is studied using a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS)-based, global potential energy surface (PES) at the MRCI-F12/aug-cc-pVTZ-F12 level of theory. For the atom exchange reaction $({\rm N_A N_B} + {\rm N_C} \rightarrow {\rm
  N_A N_C} + {\rm N_B}$), computed thermal rates and their temperature dependence from quasi-classical trajectory (QCT) simulations agree to within error bars with the available experiments. Companion QCT simulations using a recently published CASPT2-based PES confirm these findings. For the atomization reaction, leading to three N$(^4{\rm
  S})$ atoms, the computed rates from the RKHS-PES overestimate the experimentally reported rates by one order of magnitude whereas those from the PIP-PES agree favourably, and the $T$-dependence of both computations is consistent with experiment. These differences can be traced back to the different methods and basis sets used. The lifetime of the metastable N$_3$ molecule is estimated to be $\sim 200$ fs depending on the initial state of the reactants. Finally, neural network-based exhaustive state-to-distribution models are presented using both PESs for the atom exchange reaction. These models will be instrumental for a broader exploration of the reaction dynamics of air.</description>

      <title>SCN as a Local Probe of Protein Structural Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of lysozyme is probed by attaching -SCN to all alanine-residues. The 1-dimensional infrared spectra exhibit frequency shifts in the position of the maximum absorption by 4 cm$^{-1}$ which is consistent with experiments in different solvents and indicates moderately strong interactions of the vibrational probe with its environment. Isotopic substitution $^{12}$C $\rightarrow ^{13}$C leads to a red-shift by $-47$ cm$^{-1}$ which is consistent with experiments with results on CN-substituted copper complexes in solution. The low-frequency, far-infrared part of the protein spectra contain label-specific information in the difference spectra when compared with the wild type protein. Depending on the positioning of the labels, local structural changes are observed. For example, introducing the -SCN label at Ala129 leads to breaking of the $\alpha-$helical structure with concomitant change in the far-infrared spectrum. Finally, changes in the local hydration of SCN-labelled Alanine residues as a function of time can be related to angular reorientation of the label. It is concluded that -SCN is potentially useful for probing protein dynamics, both in the high-frequency (CN-stretch) and far-infrared part of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous measurement of extensional stress and flow birefringence field for uniaxially extending worm-like micellar solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present study proposes a novel and simple rheo-optical technique to investigate the relation between the rheology of complex fluids and their internal structural deformation under uniaxial extensional flow. The macroscale results of viscoelasticity from rheological measurements and microscale results of birefringence from optical measurements are combined to evaluate the microstructural deformation and orientation state inside the fluids under extensional stress. The proposed technique combines a liquid dripping method with a high-speed polarization camera to measure the extensional stress and flow-induced birefringence field simultaneously. In the liquid dripping method, temporal evolution images of the liquid filament diameter for fluids dripping from a nozzle are measured to obtain the extensional stress loading on the liquid filament. These images are captured with a high-speed polarization camera connected to a micro polarization element alley, enabling high-speed imaging of the birefringent field. Worm-like micellar solutions of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and sodium salicylate (NaSal) with varying concentrations of CTAB and NaSal are employed as the measurement targets. Consequently, we successfully visualized temporally developing images of the birefringence field of uniaxially extending worm-like micellar solutions induced by the orientation of micelles toward the extensional direction. Furthermore, the proposed technique supports investigating the conditions for establishing the stress-optical rule, which is the linear relation between stress and birefringence for complex fluids. The stress-optical coefficient, a proportionality constant indicating the sensitivity of birefringence to stress, is analyzed from these measurements. The stress-optical coefficient under uniaxial extensional flow is confirmed to be comparable to that under shear flow.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Origin of Water's Thermal Conductivity Maximum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal conductivity of water features a maximum (TCM) as a function of temperature at constant pressure. By examining why molecular force fields succeed or fail to reproduce the maximum and interpreting our results using the Bridgman equation, we show that water's TCM is connected with its compressibility minimum. Using Stillinger-Weber potentials for tetrahedral liquids, we interpolate between the behaviour of simple liquids and highly tetrahedral materials such as carbon. Together with two vanishing limits at low/high tetrahedrality, we identify three regimes for the TCM: when it originates from either the compressibility minimum or density maximum, or both. Thus, the TCM exists in a "Goldilocks Zone" of tetrahedral order. We provide a thermodynamic explanation for the TCM of not only water, but tetrahedral liquids in general.</description>

      <title>Suppressed self-diffusion of nanoscale constituents of a complex liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to understand and ultimately control the transformations and properties of various nanoscale systems, from proteins to synthetic nanomaterial assemblies, hinges on the ability to directly elucidate their dynamics on their characteristic length and time scales. Here, we use MHz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to directly elucidate the characteristic microsecond-dynamics of density fluctuations of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), not only in a colloidal dispersion but also in a liquid phase consisting of densely packed, yet mobile, NCs with no long-range order. By carefully disentangling X-ray induced effects, we find the wavevector-dependent fluctuation rates in the liquid phase are suppressed relative to those in the colloidal phase and to those in experiments and hydrodynamic theories of densely packed repulsive particles. We show that the suppressed rates are due to a substantial decrease in the self-diffusion of NCs in the liquid phase, which we attribute to explicit attractive interactions. Via comparison with simulations, we find that the extracted strength of the attractions explains the stability of the liquid phase, in contrast to the gelation observed via XPCS in many other charged colloidal systems. This work opens the door to elucidating fast, condensed phase dynamics in a variety of complex fluids and other nanoscale soft matter systems, such as densely packed proteins and non-equilibrium self-assembly processes.</description>

      <title>Stability and Elasticity of Ultrathin Sphere-Patterned Block Copolymer Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sphere-patterned ultrathin block copolymers films are potentially interesting for a variety of applications in nanotechnology. We use self-consistent field theory to investigate the elastic response of sphere monolayer films with respect to in-plane shear, in-plane extension and compression deformations, and with respect to bending. The relations between the in-plane elastic moduli is roughly compatible with the expectations for two-dimensional elastic systems with hexagonal symmetry, with one notable exception: The pure shear and the simple shear moduli differ from each other by roughly 20%. Even more importantly, the bending constants are found to be negative, indicating that free-standing block copolymer membranes made of only sphere mono-layer are inherently unstable above the glass transition. Our results are discussed in view of experimental findings.</description>

      <title>On the suitability of single-edge notch tension (SENT) testing for assessing hydrogen-assisted cracking susceptibility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combined experiments and computational modelling are used to increase understanding of the suitability of the Single-Edge Notch Tension (SENT) test for assessing hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility. The SENT tests were designed to provide the mode I threshold stress intensity factor ($K_{\text{th}}$) for hydrogen-assisted cracking of a C110 steel in two corrosive environments. These were accompanied by hydrogen permeation experiments to relate the environments to the absorbed hydrogen concentrations. A coupled phase-field-based deformation-diffusion-fracture model is then employed to simulate the SENT tests, predicting $K_{\text{th}}$ in good agreement with the experimental results and providing insights into the hydrogen absorption-diffusion-cracking interactions. The suitability of SENT testing and its optimal characteristics (e.g., test duration) are discussed in terms of the various simultaneous active time-dependent phenomena, triaxiality dependencies, and regimes of hydrogen embrittlement susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Evaluating a quantum-classical quantum Monte Carlo algorithm with Matchgate shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving the electronic structure problem of molecules and solids to high accuracy is a major challenge in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. The rapid emergence and development of quantum computers offer a promising route to systematically tackle this problem. Recent work by Huggins et al.[1] proposed a hybrid quantum-classical quantum Monte Carlo (QC-QMC) algorithm using Clifford shadows to determine the ground state of a Fermionic Hamiltonian. This approach displayed inherent noise resilience and the potential for improved accuracy compared to its purely classical counterpart. Nevertheless, the use of Clifford shadows introduces an exponentially scaling post-processing cost. In this work, we investigate an improved QC-QMC scheme utilizing the recently developed Matchgate shadows technique [2], which removes the aforementioned exponential bottleneck. We observe from experiments on quantum hardware that the use of Matchgate shadows in QC-QMC is inherently noise robust. We show that this noise resilience has a more subtle origin than in the case of Clifford shadows. Nevertheless, we find that classical post-processing, while asymptotically efficient, requires hours of runtime on thousands of classical CPUs for even the smallest chemical systems, presenting a major challenge to the scalability of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Spin coupling is all you need: Encoding strong electron correlation on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of quantum algorithms for eigenvalue problems, such as computing Hamiltonian spectra, depends strongly on the overlap of the initial wavefunction and the target eigenvector. In a basis of Slater determinants, the representation of energy eigenstates of systems with $N$ strongly correlated electrons requires a number of determinants that scales exponentially with $N$. On classical processors, this restricts simulations to systems where $N$ is small. Here, we show that quantum computers can efficiently simulate strongly correlated molecular systems by directly encoding the dominant entanglement structure in the form of spin-coupled initial states. This avoids resorting to expensive classical or quantum state preparation heuristics and instead exploits symmetries in the wavefunction. We provide quantum circuits for deterministic preparation of a family of spin eigenfunctions with ${N \choose N/2}$ Slater determinants with depth $\mathcal{O}(N)$ and $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ local gates. Their use as highly entangled initial states in quantum algorithms reduces the total runtime of quantum phase estimation and related fault-tolerant methods by orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we assess the application of spin-coupled wavefunctions as initial states for a range of heuristic quantum algorithms, namely the variational quantum eigensolver, adiabatic state preparation, and different versions of quantum subspace diagonalization (QSD) including QSD based on real-time-evolved states. We also propose a novel QSD algorithm that exploits states obtained through adaptive quantum eigensolvers. For all algorithms, we demonstrate that using spin-coupled initial states drastically reduces the quantum resources required to simulate strongly correlated ground and excited states. Our work paves the way towards scalable quantum simulation of electronic structure for classically challenging systems.</description>

Abstract: This work is a collection of initial calculations and formal considerations within the Salpeter-Sucher exact equal-time relativistic quantum electrodynamics framework. The calculations are carried out as preparation for the computation of pair, retardation, and radiative corrections to the relativistic energy of correlated two-spin-1/2-fermion systems. In this work, particular attention is paid to the retardation and the `one-loop' self-energy corrections, which are known to be among the largest corrections to the correlated relativistic energy. The theoretical development is supplemented with identifying formal connections to the non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics framework, which is based on a correlated but non-relativistic reference, as well as to the `$1/Z$ approach', which is built on a relativistic but independent-particle zeroth order. The two complementary directions currently provide the theoretical framework for light atomic-molecular precision spectroscopy and heavy-atom phenomena. The present theoretical efforts pave the way for relativistic QED corrections to (explicitly) correlated relativistic computations.</description>

      <title>Neutral electronic excitations and derivative discontinuities: An extended $N$-centered ensemble density functional theory perspective</title>

Abstract: This work merges two different types of many-electron ensembles, namely the Theophilou-Gross-Oliveira-Kohn ensembles of ground and neutrally-excited states, and the more recent $N$-centered ensembles of neutral and charged ground states. On that basis, an in-principle exact and general, so-called extended $N$-centered, ensemble density-functional theory of charged and neutral electronic excitations is derived. We revisit in this context the concept of density-functional derivative discontinuity for neutral excitations, without ever invoking nor using the asymptotic behavior of the ensemble electronic density. The present mathematical construction fully relies on the weight dependence of the ensemble Hartree-exchange-correlation density-functional energy, which makes the theory applicable to lattice models and opens new perspectives for the description of gaps in mesoscopic systems.</description>

      <title>Simulating Transient X-ray Photoelectron Spectra of Fe(CO)5 and Its Photodissociation Products With Multireference Algebraic Diagrammatic Construction Theory</title>

Abstract: Accurate simulations of transient X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) provide unique opportunities to bridge the gap between theory and experiment in understanding the photoactivated dynamics in molecules and materials. However, simulating X-ray photoelectron spectra along a photochemical reaction pathway is challenging as it requires accurate description of electronic structure incorporating core-hole screening, orbital relaxation, electron correlation, and spin-orbit coupling in excited states or at nonequilibrium ground-state geometries. In this work, we employ the recently developed multireference algebraic diagrammatic construction theory (MR-ADC) to investigate the core-ionized states and X-ray photoelectron spectra of Fe(CO)5 and its photodissociation products (Fe(CO)4, Fe(CO)3) following excitation with 266 nm light. The simulated transient Fe 3p and CO 3{\sigma} XPS spectra incorporating spin-orbit coupling and high-order electron correlation effects are shown to be in a good agreement with the experimental measurements by Leitner et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 149, 044307 (2018)]. Our calculations suggest that core-hole screening, spin-orbit coupling, and ligand-field splitting effects are similarly important in reproducing the experimentally observed chemical shifts in transient Fe 3p XPS spectra of iron carbonyl complexes. Our results also demonstrate that the MR-ADC methods can be very useful in interpreting the transient XPS spectra of transition metal compounds.</description>

      <title>Rapidly convergent quantum Monte Carlo using a Chebyshev projector</title>

Abstract: The multi-reference coupled-cluster Monte Carlo (MR-CCMC) algorithm is a determinant-based quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm that is conceptually similar to Full Configuration Interaction QMC (FCIQMC). It has been shown to offer a balanced treatment of both static and dynamic correlation while retaining polynomial scaling, although application to large systems with significant strong correlation remained impractical. In this paper, we document recent algorithmic advances that enable rapid convergence and a more black-box approach to the multi-reference problem. These include a logarithmically scaling metric-tree based excitation acceptance algorithm to search for determinants connected to the reference space at the desired excitation level and a symmetry-screening procedure for the reference space. We show that, for moderately sized reference spaces, the new search algorithm brings about an approximately 8-fold acceleration of one MR-CCMC iteration, while the symmetry screening procedure reduces the number of active reference space determinants at essentially no loss of accuracy. We also introduce a stochastic implementation of an approximate wall projector, which is the infinite imaginary time limit of the exponential projector, using a truncated expansion of the wall function in Chebyshev polynomials. Notably, this wall-Chebyshev projector can be used to accelerate any projector-based QMC algorithm. We show that it requires significantly fewer applications of the Hamiltonian to achieve the same statistical convergence. We benchmark these acceleration methods on the beryllium and carbon dimers, using initiator FCIQMC and MR-CCMC with basis sets up to cc-pVQZ quality.</description>

      <title>Picturing the Gap Between the Performance and US-DOE's Hydrogen Storage Target: A Data-Driven Model for MgH2 Dehydrogenation</title>

Abstract: Developing solid-state hydrogen storage materials is as pressing as ever, which requires a comprehensive understanding of the dehydrogenation chemistry of a solid-state hydride. Transition state search and kinetics calculations are essential to understanding and designing high-performance solid-state hydrogen storage materials by filling in the knowledge gap that current experimental techniques cannot measure. However, the ab initio analysis of these processes is computationally expensive and time-consuming. Searching for descriptors to accurately predict the energy barrier is urgently needed, to accelerate the prediction of hydrogen storage material properties and identify the opportunities and challenges in this field. Herein, we develop a data-driven model to describe and predict the dehydrogenation barriers of a typical solid-state hydrogen storage material, magnesium hydride (MgH2), based on the combination of the crystal Hamilton population orbital of Mg-H bond and the distance between atomic hydrogen. By deriving the distance energy ratio, this model elucidates the key chemistry of the reaction kinetics. All the parameters in this model can be directly calculated with significantly less computational cost than conventional transition state search, so that the dehydrogenation performance of hydrogen storage materials can be predicted efficiently. Finally, we found that this model leads to excellent agreement with typical experimental measurements reported to date and provides clear design guidelines on how to propel the performance of MgH2 closer to the target set by the United States Department of Energy (US-DOE).</description>

      <title>Interpolation and differentiation of alchemical degrees of freedom in machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have become a workhorse of modern atomistic simulations, and recently published universal MLIPs, pre-trained on large datasets, have demonstrated remarkable accuracy and generalizability. However, the computational cost of MLIPs limits their applicability to chemically disordered systems requiring large simulation cells or to sample-intensive statistical methods. Here, we report the use of continuous and differentiable alchemical degrees of freedom in atomistic materials simulations, exploiting the fact that graph neural network MLIPs represent discrete elements as real-valued tensors. The proposed method introduces alchemical atoms with corresponding weights into the input graph, alongside modifications to the message-passing and readout mechanisms of MLIPs, and allows smooth interpolation between the compositional states of materials. The end-to-end differentiability of MLIPs enables efficient calculation of the gradient of energy with respect to the compositional weights. Leveraging these gradients, we propose methodologies for optimizing the composition of solid solutions towards target macroscopic properties and conducting alchemical free energy simulations to quantify the free energy of vacancy formation and composition changes. The approach offers an avenue for extending the capabilities of universal MLIPs in the modeling of compositional disorder and characterizing the phase stabilities of complex materials systems.</description>
