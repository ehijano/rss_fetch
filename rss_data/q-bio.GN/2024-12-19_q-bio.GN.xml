      <title>Model Decides How to Tokenize: Adaptive DNA Sequence Tokenization with MxDNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Foundation models have made significant strides in understanding the genomic language of DNA sequences. However, previous models typically adopt the tokenization methods designed for natural language, which are unsuitable for DNA sequences due to their unique characteristics. In addition, the optimal approach to tokenize DNA remains largely under-explored, and may not be intuitively understood by humans even if discovered. To address these challenges, we introduce MxDNA, a novel framework where the model autonomously learns an effective DNA tokenization strategy through gradient decent. MxDNA employs a sparse Mixture of Convolution Experts coupled with a deformable convolution to model the tokenization process, with the discontinuous, overlapping, and ambiguous nature of meaningful genomic segments explicitly considered. On Nucleotide Transformer Benchmarks and Genomic Benchmarks, MxDNA demonstrates superior performance to existing methods with less pretraining data and time, highlighting its effectiveness. Finally, we show that MxDNA learns unique tokenization strategy distinct to those of previous methods and captures genomic functionalities at a token level during self-supervised pretraining. Our MxDNA aims to provide a new perspective on DNA tokenization, potentially offering broad applications in various domains and yielding profound insights.</description>

      <title>Single-cell spatial (scs) omics: Recent developments in data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years, technological advances have allowed for measurement of omics data at the cell level, creating a new type of data generally referred to as single-cell (sc) omics. On the other hand, the so-called spatial omics are a family of techniques that generate biological information in a spatial domain, for instance, in the volume of a tissue. In this survey, we are mostly interested in the intersection between sc and spatial (scs) omics and in the challenges and opportunities that this new type of data pose for downstream data analysis methodologies. Our goal is to cover all major omics modalities, including transcriptomics, genomics, epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics.</description>

      <title>PRAGA: Prototype-aware Graph Adaptive Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12728v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial multi-modal omics technology, highlighted by Nature Methods as an advanced biological technique in 2023, plays a critical role in resolving biological regulatory processes with spatial context. Recently, graph neural networks based on K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs have gained prominence in spatial multi-modal omics methods due to their ability to model semantic relations between sequencing spots. However, the fixed KNN graph fails to capture the latent semantic relations hidden by the inevitable data perturbations during the biological sequencing process, resulting in the loss of semantic information. In addition, the common lack of spot annotation and class number priors in practice further hinders the optimization of spatial multi-modal omics models. Here, we propose a novel spatial multi-modal omics resolved framework, termed PRototype-Aware Graph Adaptative Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis (PRAGA). PRAGA constructs a dynamic graph to capture latent semantic relations and comprehensively integrate spatial information and feature semantics. The learnable graph structure can also denoise perturbations by learning cross-modal knowledge. Moreover, a dynamic prototype contrastive learning is proposed based on the dynamic adaptability of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models to optimize the multi-modal omics representations for unknown biological priors. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on simulated and real datasets with 7 competing methods demonstrate the superior performance of PRAGA.
