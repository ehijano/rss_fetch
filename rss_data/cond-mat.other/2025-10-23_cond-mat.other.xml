      <title>Triple-core structure of the double-core vortex in superfluid $^3$He-B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The order parameter of superfluid $^3$He involves nine complex components, and the multicomponent structure allows quantized vortices in superfluid $^3$He to have complicated cores. One of the vortices found in the B phase is the double-core vortex, which has been often described as a pair of two half-quantum vortices (HQVs) connected by a domain wall. Our numerical calculations of the core structure suggest an alternative representation of the vortex as a combination of three vortices, one in each component of the spin-triplet superfluid. Based on the results we present a qualitative analytical model for the triple-core structure of the double-core vortex. Additionally we numerically calculate the structure of a double-core vortex stretched between pinning sites, and show that the HQV picture becomes more applicable when separation between subcores becomes large.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal interaction and quantum friction in sliding Bi$_2$Se$_3$ topological surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13163v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ thin films exhibit unique electronic properties arising from their topologically protected surface states. In a theoretical model capturing the essential physics of Dirac electrons in Bi$_2$Se$_3$, we study excitations and dissipation in two infinite parallel metallic plates undergoing relative motion. The degrees of freedom of the electrons in both plates are modeled using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field, and a nonlocal potential is selected to describe the interaction between the two plates. The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, with one plate assumed to slide relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. Numerical plots reveal that the vacuum occupation number, as a function of momentum, is isotropic for a motion speed $v = 0$ and anisotropic for nonzero $v$. The relative motion induces energy transfer between the plates, leading to on-shell excitations in a manner analogous to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Consequently, we study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces through the quantum action. By using experimental Fermi velocities of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, our results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action due to the motion boost and the dissipative force exhibit a threshold as functions of $v$, and both are positively correlated with $v$.</description>

      <title>Photocurrents induced by k-linear terms in semiconductors and semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a six-band $\mathbf{k} \cdot \mathbf{p}$ model to describe the electronic structure and optical response of chiral multifold semimetals, such as RhSi. By means of invariants method we construct the effective Hamiltonian describing the states near the $\Gamma$-point of the Brillouin zone where the spin-orbit coupling and $\mathbf{k}$-linear Rashba terms, which are crucial for circular photogalvanic effect, are taken into account. The model is parameterized using tight-binding calculations. We compute the interband absorption spectrum, showing a linear-in-frequency dependence at low energies and a resonant feature near the spin-orbit splitting energy. Furthermore, we calculate the circular photogalvanic effect. In agreement with previous works the current generation rate at low frequencies exhibits a quantized low-frequency response, governed by the universal value $|\mathcal{C}| = 4$ for the effective topological charge. Our results provide an analytical framework for understanding the role of Rashba coupling and topology in the optoelectronic properties of multifold chiral semimetals.</description>
