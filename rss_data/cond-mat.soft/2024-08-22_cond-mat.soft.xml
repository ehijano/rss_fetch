      <title>Shear banding as a cause of non-monotonic stress relaxation after flow cessation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent flow cessation experiments on soft materials have shown a counter-intuitive non-monotonic relaxation of the shear stress: following the switch-off of a steady imposed shear flow, the stress initially decays before later increasing again. By simulating the soft glassy rheology model in a form extended to allow steady state shear banding, we show that the presence of shear bands prior to flow cessation can give rise to this phenomenon. We give a mechanistic understanding of the basic physics involved, in terms of (i) the decay of the shear bands after flow cessation, and (ii) the evolution of frustrated local stresses, governed by different time scales for plastic relaxation in each band. In particular, an elastic recoil in the unsheared band gives rise to negative local frustrated stresses, the slow release of which can cause an increase in macroscopic stress. Given that shear banding and frustrated local stresses arise widely across disordered soft solids, we argue that non-monotonic stress relaxation after flow cessation may occur in many different materials.</description>

      <title>Novel stabilization mechanisms for concentrated emulsions with tunable morphology via amphiphilic polymer-grafted nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the stabilization mechanisms of concentrated emulsions with tunable morphology using amphiphilic polymer-grafted nanoparticles (PGNPs). We employ coarse-grained molecular simulations to investigate concentrated oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by partially hydrolyzed poly(vinyl alcohol)-grafted polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) particles. Two grafting architectures were examined: hydrophilic-hydrophobic (AB-type) diblock PGNPs and reverse BA-type diblock PGNPs. Our findings reveal that AB-type diblock PGNPs tend to aggregate, leading to droplet-droplet coalescence. In contrast, BA-type diblock PGNPs disperse effectively in the water phase, stabilizing robust emulsion through a space-filling mechanism. The study further demonstrates that the stability and morphology of the emulsions can be tuned by varying the number of PGNPs. Our results suggest that BA-type diblock PGNPs are more effective in stabilizing concentrated emulsions, offering insights for the design of novel emulsifiers in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>Nanostructured multiferroic liquids: on the way to fluid ferroelectric magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Responsiveness to multiple stimuli and adaptivity are paramount for designing smart multifunctional materials. In soft, partially ordered systems, these features can often be achieved via self-assembly, allowing for the combination of diverse components in a complex nanostructured material. Here, we demonstrate an example of a liquid that simultaneously displays both ferroelectric and ferromagnetic types of order. This material is a nanostructured liquid crystalline hybrid comprising ferrimagnetic barium hexaferrite nanoplatelets suspended in a ferroelectric nematic host. Director-mediated interactions drive the self-assembly of nanoplatelets in an intricate network. Due to the couplings between the polar electric and magnetic types of order, this material demonstrates magnetically driven electric and nonlinear optical responses, as well as electrically driven magnetic response. Such multiferroic liquids are highly promising for applications in energy harvesting, nonlinear optics, and sensors.</description>

      <title>Modified Debye-H\"{u}ckel-Onsager Theory for Electrical Conductivity in Aqueous Electrolyte Solutions. Nonlocal Electrostatics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a nonlocal mean field theory of electrolyte solutions, extending the classical Debye-H\"{u}ckel-Onsager theory to provide a detailed description of the electrical conductivity in strong electrolyte solutions. The theory systematically incorporates the effects of ions specificity, such as steric interactions, hydration of ions, and their spatial charge distributions, into the mean-field framework. This allows for calculation of ion mobility and electrical conductivity, while accounting for relaxation and hydrodynamic phenomena. At low concentrations, the model reproduces the well-known Kohlrausch's limiting law. Using the exponential (Slater-type) charge distribution function for solvated ions, we demonstrate that experimental data on the electrical conductivity of aqueous 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 electrolyte solutions can be approximated over a broad concentration range by adjusting a single free parameter representing the spatial scale of the nonlocal ion charge distribution. Using the fitted value of this parameter at 298.15 K, we obtain good agreement with available experimental data when calculating the electrical conductivity across different temperatures. We also analyze the effects of temperature and electrolyte concentration on the relaxation and electrophoretic contributions to total electrical conductivity, explaining the underlying physical mechanisms responsible for the observed behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian and fractional processes are useful computational tools for the modelling of physical phenomena. Here, modelling linear homopolymers in solution as Brownian or fractional processes, we develop a formalism to take into account both the interactions of the polymer with the solvent as well as the effect of arbitrary polymer-polymer potentials and Gibbs factors. As an example the average squared length is computed for a non-trivial Gaussian Gibbs factor, which is also compared with the Edwards' and a step factor.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics and elasto-chemical cluster waves in communicating colloids with explicit size response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical communication, response, and feedback are key requirements for the function of adaptive materials with life-like properties. However, how communication on the single cell-level impacts the collective structural, dynamical and mechanical behavior of active soft matter is not well understood. Here, we report how communication controls the spatiotemporal structure and phase behavior of active, hydrogel-based colloidal liquids using Brownian particle-based simulations with explicit resolution of the chemical signaling waves as well as the individual particle's elastic response to communication and crowding. We find a rich topology of nonequilibrium active phases, vastly tuneable by the signaling magnitude, in particular, active melting, synchronization transitions from uncorrelated to antiphase oscillatory liquids, or to in-phase oscillations with accompanying elasto-chemical cluster waves. Our work employs minimal physical principles required for communication-mediated dynamics of microscopic, fluctuating systems, thus uncovering universal aspects in signaling soft systems.</description>

      <title>Achieving specific yet transient bonds between anisotropic colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-assembly of colloidal particles is a promising avenue to control the shape and dynamics of larger aggregates. However, achieving the necessary fine control over the dynamics and specificity of the bonds between such particles remains a challenge. Here we demonstrate such control in bonds mediated by depletion interactions between anisotropic colloids that we 3D-print in the shape of half disks with sub-micron resolution. When brought together by diffusion, the particles interact in different configurations but the interaction through the flat faces is by far the longest-lasting. All bonds are flexible and transient, and we demonstrate control over their life time through the depletant concentration in quantitative agreement with a simple physical model. This basic design could be extended to manufacture particles with multiple binding sites to engineer directional assembly with multiple particles.</description>

      <title>Dissecting mode-coupling theory for supercooled liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mode-coupling theory (MCT) of the glass transition ranks among the most successful first-principles kinetic theories to describe glassy dynamics. However, MCT does not fully account for crucial aspects of the dynamics near the glass transition. To facilitate improving the theory, we critically test the approximations inherent in MCT for a supercooled mixture using Brownian dynamics simulations. Although each MCT approximation significantly impacts the predicted dynamics, our findings show that long-time cancellations of errors occur due to static and dynamic approximations of four-point correlation functions, with the validity of these approximations remaining relatively constant across different temperatures. Notably, the MCT form of the memory functional maintains remarkably high accuracy even in the supercooled regime when evaluated with the intermediate scattering function from simulations. The primary discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results arise from the self-consistent nature of the MCT equations, which amplify minor errors in the memory kernel. This suggests that minor corrections to the memory functional could substantially enhance the theory's predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Effects of curvature on growing films of microorganisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To provide insight into the basic properties of emerging structures when bacteria or other microorganisms conquer surfaces, it is crucial to analyze their growth behavior during the formation of thin films. In this regard, many theoretical studies focus on the behavior of elongating straight objects. They repel each other through volume exclusion and divide into two halves when reaching a certain threshold length. However, in reality, hardly any object of a certain elongation is perfectly straight. Therefore, we here study the consequences of curvature on the growth of colonies and thin active films. A given amount of curvature is prescribed to each growing individual. Particularly, we analyze how this individual curvature affects the size of orientationally ordered domains in the colony and find a significant decrease. Instead, strings of stacked curved cells emerge that show branched structures. Furthermore, we identify a significant spatio-orientational coupling that is not observed in colonies of straight cells. Our results are important for a fundamental understanding of the interaction and spreading of microorganisms on surfaces, with implications for medical applications and bioengineering.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of the Elastic Shear Modulus and Length-Scale-Dependent Dynamic Re-Entrancy Phenomena in Very Dense Sticky Particle Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply the hybrid Projectionless Dynamic Theory (hybrid PDT) formulation of the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) activated dynamics approach to study dense fluids of sticky spheres with short range attractions. Of special interest is the problem of non-monotonic evolution with attraction strength of the elastic modulus ("re-entrancy") at high packing fractions far beyond the ideal mode coupling theory (MCT) nonergodicity boundary. The dynamic force constraints explicitly treat the bare attractive forces that drive transient physical bond formation, while a projection approximation is employed for the singular hard-sphere potential. The resultant interference between repulsive and attractive forces contribution to the dynamic vertex results in the prediction of localization length and elastic modulus re-entrancy, qualitatively consistent with experiments. The non-monotonic evolution of the alpha time predicted by ECNLE theory with the hybrid PDT approach is explored in depth as a function of packing fraction, attraction strength, and range. Isochronal dynamic arrest boundaries based on activated relaxation display the classic non-monotonic glass melting form. Comparisons of these results with the corresponding predictions of ideal MCT and the ECNLE and NLE activated theories based on projection reveal large qualitative differences. The consequences of stochastic trajectory fluctuations on intra-cage single particle dynamics with variable attraction strengths are also studied. Large dynamical heterogeneity effects in attractive glasses are properly captured. These include a rapidly increasing non-Gaussian parameter with packing fraction and a non-monotonic evolution with attraction strength, in accord with recent simulations. Extension of the microscopic theoretical approach to treat double yielding in attractive glass nonlinear rheology is possible.</description>

      <title>Two relaxation mechanisms for rejuvenation of stable polymer glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the rejuvenation of thin films of polystyrene (PS) as they are heated from stable glassy states - prepared either through vapour deposition or physical aging. For films with thickness $h \gtrsim 200$ nm, the rejuvenation of vapour deposited stable PS glass films follow behaviour well-documented for other stable glasses. For films with thickness $h \lesssim 160$nm the behaviour of the vapour deposited films becomes more complicated. This behaviour is characterized for different film thicknesses. The results are compared with vapour deposited films that are aged after rejuvenation or spincast and aged. Collectively, the results of these studies strongly suggest two distinct mechanisms that can result in rejuvenation, and hence two distinct relaxation processes that can couple to the material density. The two physical mechanisms can provide insight into poorly understood or apparently contradictory aspects of $T_g$ measurements in thin PS films.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metastable phases, in general, are unstable to nucleating droplets of the order defining the global free energy minima. However, whether such a droplet grows or shrinks relies on a competition between the surface tension and bulk energy density. We study the role of coupling a topological fermionic field to a scalar field undergoing such nucleation processes. We find that existence of non-trivial fermionic boundary modes on the nucleating droplets leads to substantial quantum corrections to the surface tension thereby modifying the size of the critical nucleus beyond which unrestricted droplet growth happens. To illustrate the phenomena we devise a minimal model of fermions in a Chern insulating system coupled to a classical Ising field in two spatial dimensions. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods we conclusively show that topological phases can lead to characteristic quantum surface tension. Apart from material systems, our work has implications on the interplay of physics of statistical classical fields and quantum topological order.</description>

      <title>Insights into Protein Unfolding under pH, Temperature, and Shear using Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein biologics hold immense potential in therapeutic applications, but their ephemeral nature has hindered their widespread application. The effects of different stressors on protein folding have long been studied, but whether these stressors induce protein unfolding through different pathways remains unclear. In this work, we conduct all-atom molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the unfolding of bovine serum albumin (BSA) under three distinct external stressors: high temperature, acidic pH, and shear stress. Our findings reveal that each stressor induces unique unfolding patterns in BSA, indicating stressor-specific unfolding pathways. Detailed structural analysis showed that high temperature significantly disrupts the protein's secondary structure, while acidic pH causes notable alterations in the tertiary structure, leading to domain separation and an extended shape. Shear stress initially perturbs the tertiary structure, initiating structural rearrangements followed by a loss of secondary structure. These distinct unfolding behaviors suggest that different stabilization strategies are required to enhance protein stability under various denaturation conditions. Insights from these unfolding studies can inform the design of materials, especially polymers, aimed at improving protein stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motor-driven cytoskeletal remodeling in cellular systems can often be accompanied by a diffusive-like effect at local scales, but distinguishing the contributions of the ordering process, such as active contraction of a network, from this active diffusion is difficult to achieve. Using light-dimerizable kinesin motors to spatially control the formation and contraction of a microtubule network, we deliberately photobleach a grid pattern onto the filament network serving as a transient and dynamic coordinate system to observe the deformation and translation of the remaining fluorescent squares of microtubules. We find that the network contracts at a rate set by motor speed but is accompanied by a diffusive-like spread throughout the bulk of the contracting network with effective diffusion constant two orders of magnitude lower than that for a freely-diffusing microtubule. We further find that on micron scales, the diffusive timescale is only a factor of approximately 3 slower than that of advection regardless of conditions, showing that the global contraction and long-time relaxation from this diffusive behavior are both motor-driven but exhibit local competition within the network bulk.</description>

      <title>Rheological behavior of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) inks under electric fields: influence of concentration and voltage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides a complete rheological characterization of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) inks in the presence of electric fields. Several concentrations of MoS2 are studied and dispersed in a viscoelastic fluid. The lubrication effects are present in the ink when the MoS2 concentration is higher than 0.10% w/w. The dielectric properties show the impossibility of a positive electrorheological effect for all MoS2-inks studied. The formation of vortices and electromigration of MoS2 particles occur under the influence of an external electric field. These two phenomena affect the rheological behavior of MoS2-inks under shear flow condition. Relatively to the extensional rheology experiments, the particle migration and the vortex formation promote anisotropy on the rheological properties of the inks which affects the relaxation time, the formation of beads-on-a-string and the uniaxial elongational flow condition is no longer valid. When the electric field strength is 1.5 kV/mm, the formation of Taylor's cone is observed and independent of MoS2 concentration.</description>

      <title>Effect of the background flow on the motility induced phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We simulate active Brownian particles (ABPs) with soft-repulsive interactions subjected to a four-roll-mill flow. In the absence of flow, this system exhibits motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). To investigate the interplay between MIPS and flow-induced mixing, we introduce dimensionless parameters: a scaled time, $\tau$, and a scaled velocity, ${\rm v}$, characterizing the ratio of ABP to fluid time and velocity scales, respectively. The parameter space defined by $\tau$ and ${\rm v}$ reveals three distinct ABP distribution regimes. At low velocities ${\rm v} \ll 1$, flow dominates, leading to a homogeneous mixture. Conversely, at high velocities ${\rm v} \gg 1$, motility prevails, resulting in MIPS. In the intermediate regime (${\rm v} \sim 1$), the system's behavior depends on $\tau$. For $\tau &lt;1$, a moderately mixed homogeneous phase emerges, while for $\tau &gt;1$, a novel phase, termed flow-induced phase separation (FIPS), arises due to the combined effects of flow topology and ABP motility and size. To characterize these phases, we analyze drift velocity, diffusivity, mean-squared displacement, giant number fluctuations, radial distribution function, and cluster-size distribution.</description>

Abstract: Estimating parameters from data is a fundamental problem in physics, customarily done by minimizing a loss function between a model and observed statistics. In scattering-based analysis, researchers often employ their domain expertise to select a specific range of wavevectors for analysis, a choice that can vary depending on the specific case. We introduce another paradigm that defines a probabilistic generative model from the beginning of data processing and propagates the uncertainty for parameter estimation, termed ab initio uncertainty quantification (AIUQ). As an illustrative example, we demonstrate this approach with differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) that extracts dynamical information through Fourier analysis at a selected range of wavevectors. We first show that DDM is equivalent to fitting a temporal variogram in the reciprocal space using a latent factor model as the generative model. Then we derive the maximum marginal likelihood estimator, which optimally weighs information at all wavevectors, therefore eliminating the need to select the range of wavevectors. Furthermore, we substantially reduce the computational cost by utilizing the generalized Schur algorithm for Toeplitz covariances without approximation. Simulated studies validate that AIUQ significantly improves estimation accuracy and enables model selection with automated analysis. The utility of AIUQ is also demonstrated by three distinct sets of experiments: first in an isotropic Newtonian fluid, pushing limits of optically dense systems compared to multiple particle tracking; next in a system undergoing a sol-gel transition, automating the determination of gelling points and critical exponent; and lastly, in discerning anisotropic diffusive behavior of colloids in a liquid crystal. These outcomes collectively underscore AIUQ's versatility to capture system dynamics in an efficient and automated manner.</description>

      <title>Evaluating fracture energy predictions using phase-field and gradient-enhanced damage models for elastomers</title>

Abstract: Recently, the phase field method has been increasingly used for brittle fractures in soft materials like polymers, elastomers, and biological tissues. When considering finite deformations to account for the highly deformable nature of soft materials, the convergence of the phase-field method becomes challenging, especially in scenarios of unstable crack growth. To overcome these numerical difficulties, several approaches have been introduced, with artificial viscosity being among the most widely utilized. This study investigates the energy release rate due to crack propagation in hyperelastic nearly-incompressible materials and compares the phase-field method and a novel gradient-enhanced damage (GED) approach. First, we simulate unstable loading scenarios using the phase-field method, which leads to convergence problems. To address these issues, we introduce artificial viscosity to stabilize the problem and analyze its impact on the energy release rate utilizing a domain J-integral approach giving quantitative measurements during crack propagation. It is observed that the measured energy released rate during crack propagation does not comply with the imposed critical energy release rate, and shows non-monotonic behavior. In the second part of the paper, we introduce a novel stretch-based GED model as an alternative to the phase-field method for modeling crack evolution in elastomers. It is demonstrated that in this method, the energy release rate can be obtained as an output of the simulation rather than as an input which could be useful in the exploration of rate-dependent responses, as one could directly impose chain-level criteria for damage initiation. We show that while this novel approach provides reasonable results for fracture simulations, it still suffers from some numerical issues that strain-based GED formulations are known to be susceptible to.</description>
