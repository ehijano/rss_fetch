      <title>Electromagnetic Form Factors and the Proton Radius Puzzle: A Critical Review of Extraction Methods via Electron-Proton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of protons, fundamental constituents of atomic nuclei, is crucial for understanding nuclear physics and fundamental forces. This review examines advancements in extracting electromagnetic form factors, essential for probing proton structure. Electron-proton scattering experiments, particularly at Jefferson Lab (JLab) and Mainz Microtron (MAMI), have played a key role [arXiv:2009.10510, arXiv:1912.03881].
  Various methodologies, such as Rosenbluth separation and polarization transfer, are discussed, highlighting their evolution and challenges, including systematic uncertainties and theoretical ambiguities [arXiv:1706.00696]. Literature indicates the Rosenbluth method yields a proton radius of approximately 0.8 fm, consistent with early measurements but differing from recent polarization transfer results, which suggest a smaller radius [arXiv:1912.03881].
  The polarization transfer technique has become a preferred approach, offering precise measurements of the electric-to-magnetic form factor ratio, especially at high momentum transfer [arXiv:1706.00696, arXiv:1912.03881]. Alternative methods, such as cross-section ratios, extend form factor studies but still face residual uncertainties [arXiv:2009.10510].
  While significant progress has been made, discrepancies persist, particularly in proton radius extraction. Future research must address systematic uncertainties to refine our understanding of proton electromagnetic properties and advance particle physics [arXiv:1912.03881, arXiv:1706.00696].</description>

      <title>Application of Dynamic Mode Decomposition for Improved Optics Measurements from s star Movement at sPHENIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current average horizontal beta beat measurements between operating Interaction Regions (IR) in the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) are around 15 percent along with significant variation in s star. This threshold to measure the linear optics can be improved by considering preprocessing methods involving data reconstruction such as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), and cross checking between different method variations, model independent and dependent methods, and turn by turn (TBT) datasets. These were then applied to analyze the movement of horizontal s star at the 8 o clock IR at RHIC (IR8). This movement was done using an optics response matrix to determine magnet strengths necessary to move horizontal s star without disturbing other optics. Data preprocessing was found to significantly aid in beat reduction around IP, with DMD demonstrating the least variability between preprocessing methods and between horizontal s star movements. These preprocessing methods will be implemented into RHIC for future linear optics analysis.</description>

      <title>A systematic study of initial state quark energy loss in fixed target proton nucleus collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate parton energy loss in cold nuclear matter by studying the ratio of Drell-Yan production cross sections in fixed-target proton-nucleus (p + A) collisions. We analyze Drell-Yan production cross-section data from the Fermilab E866 and E906 experiments using two different quark energy loss parametrization models and various parton distribution functions for 800 GeV and 120 GeV proton beams incident on light and heavy nuclear targets. The sensitivity of the energy loss parameter on the employed parton distribution function has been thoroughly investigated. Our results have been used to predict the target mass dependence of Drell-Yan production in upcoming proton-induced collisions at SPS and FAIR.</description>

      <title>Calorimetric Analysis in the DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In neutrino long-baseline experiments the energy of the incoming neutrino must be reconstructed from observations of the final state. We first discuss the problems that arise for energy conservation during the final-state interactions in a momentum-dependent potential. We then show that the presence of such a potential is necessarily connected with a large uncertainty in the reconstructed energy. This same uncertainty also affects the determination of energy- and four-momentum-transfers in neutrino-nucleus reactions. We analyze the origins of this uncertainty using transport theory for the description of the evolution of the final state of the reaction.</description>

      <title>Ultra fast, event-by-event heavy-ion simulations for next generation experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel deep generative framework that uses probabilistic diffusion models for ultra fast, event-by-event simulations of heavy-ion collision output. This new framework is trained on UrQMD cascade data to generate a full collision event output containing 26 distinct hadron species. The output is represented as a point cloud, where each point is defined by a particle's momentum vector and its corresponding species information (ID). Our architecture integrates a normalizing flow-based condition generator that encodes global event features into a latent vector, and a diffusion model that synthesizes a point cloud of particles based on this condition. A detailed description of the model and an in-depth analysis of its performance is provided. The conditional point cloud diffusion model learns to generate realistic output particles of collision events which successfully reproduce the UrQMD distributions for multiplicity, momentum and rapidity of each hadron type. The flexible point cloud representation of the event output preserves full event-level granularity, enabling direct application to inverse problems and parameter estimation tasks while also making it easily adaptable for accelerating any event-by-event model calculation or detector simulation.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric effects of an interacting hadron gas in the presence of an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot and dense hadronic medium formed during the heavy-ion collisions at the RHIC and LHC energies can show thermoelectric effects in the presence of temperature gradients and non-zero baryon chemical potential. In this article we study the thermoelectric coefficients of an interacting hot and dense hadron gas using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under the relaxation time approximation (RTA). We discuss the thermoelectric properties within different frameworks of Hardon Resonance Gas (HRG) models. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the thermoelectric coefficients become anisotropic, which leads to Hall-like thermoelectric coefficients, namely Nernst coefficients, along with the magneto-Seebeck coefficients. For the first time, we also estimate the Thomson coefficient of the medium, which comes into the picture due to the temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient of the medium. In the context of studying the thermoelectric generator performance, we calculate the values of the thermoelectric figure of merit of the medium.</description>

      <title>Robust treatment of finite nuclear size reduces CKM unitarity deficit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the extraction of the $|V_{ud}|$ CKM matrix element from the superallowed transition decay rate of $^{26m}$Al$\rightarrow$$^{26}$Mg, focusing on finite nuclear size effects. We show that the dependence of the decay rate of $^{26m}$Al on its charge radius is 4 times greater than previously believed, so it must be determined with high precision. However, for a short-lived isotope of an odd $Z$ element such as $^{26m}$Al, radius extraction relies on challenging many-body atomic calculations. We performed the needed calculations, finding an excellent agreement with previous ones, which used a highly different methodology. This sets a new standard for the reliability of isotope shift factor calculations in many-electron systems. The $\mathcal{F}t$ value obtained from our analysis is lower by $2.2\,\sigma$ than the corresponding value in the previous critical survey, resulting in an increase in $|V_{ud}|^2$ by $0.9\,\sigma$. Adopting $|V_{ud}|$ from this decay alone reduces the CKM unitarity deficit by one standard deviation, irrespective of the choice of $|V_{us}|</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test microscopic global optical potential in three-body calculations of deuteron-nucleus scattering. We solve Faddeev-type equations for three-body transition operators. We calculate differential cross section and analyzing power for the deuteron elastic scattering and breakup in collisions with ${}^{12}$C, ${}^{16}$O and ${}^{24}$Mg nuclei, and find a reasonable agreement with available experimental data. Comparison with respective predictions using phenomenological optical potentials reveals systematic deviations in particular kinematic regimes.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal anisotropies of charged particles with high transverse momentum in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_\text{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A measurement is presented of elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) azimuthal anisotropy coefficients for charged particles produced in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{_\text{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $0.44$ nb$^{-1}$ collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2018. The values of $v_2$ and $v_3$ are measured for charged particles over a wide range of transverse momentum ($p_\text{T}$), 1-400 GeV, and Pb+Pb collision centrality, 0-60%, using the scalar product and multi-particle cumulant methods. These methods are sensitive to event-by-event fluctuations and non-flow effects in the measurements of azimuthal anisotropies. Positive values of $v_2$ are observed up to a $p_{\text{T}}$ of approximately 100 GeV from both methods across all centrality intervals. Positive values of $v_3$ are observed up to approximately 25 GeV using both methods, though the application of the three-subevent technique to the multi-particle cumulant method leads to significant changes at the highest $p_{\text{T}}$. At high $p_{\text{T}}$ ($p_{\text{T}} \gtrapprox 10$ GeV), charged particles are dominantly from jet fragmentation. These jets, and hence the measurements presented here, are sensitive to the path-length dependence of parton energy loss in the quark-gluon plasma produced in Pb+Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Analysis of R-Matrix Fitting: ${}^{12}$C$(p,\gamma)$${}^{13}$N as Test Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In nuclear astrophysics, the accurate determination of nuclear reaction cross sections at astrophysical energies is critical for understanding stellar evolution and nucleosynthesis. This study focuses on the $^{12}$C($p, \gamma$)$^{13}$N reaction, which takes part in the CNO cycle and is significant for determining the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio in stellar interiors. Data from various studies, including recent LUNA measurements, reveal high discrepancies in cross section values, underscoring the need for robust fitting approaches. Utilizing the R-matrix theory, we compare different frequentist and Bayesian methodologies for estimating reaction cross sections and their uncertainties. The analysis evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of different statistical techniques, highlighting the importance of systematic uncertainty treatment and the estimate of covariance matrix estimation to enhance the reliability and reproducibility of uncertainty estimates in nuclear astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ in lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2010.14463v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first calculation of the jet transport coefficient $\hat{q}$ in quenched and (2+1)-flavor QCD on a 4-D Euclidean lattice. The light-like propagation of an energetic parton is factorized from the mean square gain in momentum transverse to the direction of propagation, which is expressed in terms of the thermal field-strength field-strength correlator. The leading-twist term in its operator product expansion is calculated on the lattice. Continuum extrapolated quenched results, and full QCD estimates based on un-renormalized lattice data, over multiple lattice sizes, are compared with (non) perturbative calculations and phenomenological extractions of $\hat{q}$. The lattice data for $\hat{q}$ show a temperature dependence similar to the entropy density. Within uncertainties, these are consistent with phenomenological extractions, contrary to calculations using perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Bottomoniumlike states in proton collisions: Fragmentation and resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the semi-inclusive hadroproduction of doubly bottomed tetraquarks ($X_{b\bar{b}q\bar{q}}$) as well as fully bottomed ones ($T_{4b}$), to which we collectively refer as "bottomoniumlike" states. We rely upon the variable-flavor number-scheme fragmentation at leading power, where a single parton perturbatively splits into the corresponding Fock state, which then hadronizes into the color-neutral, observed tetraquark. To this end, we build new sets of DGLAP/HF-NRevo consistent, hadron-structure oriented collinear fragmentation functions, which we name TQHL1.1 and TQ4Q1.1 parametrizations. They extend and supersede the corresponding 1.0 versions recently derived in previous works. The first family describes the fragmentation of doubly heavy tetraquarks and is based on an improved version of the Suzuki model for the heavy-quark channel. The second family depicts the fragmentation of fully heavy tetraquarks and embodies initial-scale inputs for gluon and heavy-quark channels, both of them calculated by the hands of potential nonrelativistic QCD. As a phenomenological application, we provide novel predictions for tetraquark-plus-jet high-energy distributions, computed within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization from (sym)JETHAD, at 14 TeV and 100 TeV FCC.</description>

      <title>Weak nuclear decays deep-underground as a probe of axion dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the time modulation of weak nuclear decays as a method to probe axion dark matter. To this end, we develop a theoretical framework to compute the $\theta$-dependence of weak nuclear decays, including electron capture and $\beta$ decay, which enables us to predict the time variation of weak radioactivity in response to an oscillating axion dark matter background. As an application, we recast old data sets, from the weak nuclear decays of ${^{40}\text{K}}$ and ${^{137}\text{Cs}}$ taken at the underground Gran Sasso Laboratory, in order to set constraints on the axion decay constant, specifically in the axion mass range from few $10^{-23}\;$eV up to $10^{-19}\;$eV. We finally propose a new measurement at the Gran Sasso Laboratory, based on the weak nuclear decay of ${^{40}\text{K}}$ via electron capture, in order to explore even shorter timescales, thus reaching sensitivities to axion masses up to $10^{-9}\;$eV.</description>

Abstract: We present the design of an automated current-voltage (IV) multiplexer (MUX) that enables accurate measurement of the dark current in cryogenic silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), achieving a sensitivity equivalent to detecting less than one avalanche per second. Dynamic pulse-counting measurements were used as a benchmark for reconstructing the dark current in static IV measurements. The IV-MUX features 15 channels on a single board and up to seven boards can be connected in parallel under the control of one Arduino microcontroller. To minimize leakage and enhance performance, the layout includes guard rings and high-isolation relays, enabling resolution of currents as small as 49 fA. The IV-MUX can be integrated into systems designed for IV or pulse-counting measurements, enabling seamless switching between IV and pulse-counting modes. Moreover, the IV-MUX is vacuum-compatible, validated by testing an SiPM array in a cryostat. This feature reduces the need for multiple feedthroughs when testing sensor arrays in vacuum. The design is open source and can be used to facilitate rapid and automated testing of SiPMs or similar low-current devices in one measurement cycle.</description>

      <title>Projective imaging of high-energy nuclei through coherent exclusive vector meson production in electron-ion collisions</title>

Abstract: One of the major goals of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is to better understand the distributions of quarks and gluons inside nuclei at high-energy. A principal measurement is coherent exclusive vector meson (VM) production in diffractive $eA$ collisions. The gluon spatial distribution inside the nucleus can be obtained through a Fourier transform of the nuclear momentum transfer ($|t|$) distribution for these VMs. However, the $|t|$ distribution is one of the most challenging measurements at the EIC. This research aims to overcome one of the main obstacles in this measurement: limited precision in measuring $|t|$, making it difficult to resolve the diffractive pattern from coherent events. We employ a method for reconstructing $|t|$ by utilizing the electron beam polarization in $eA$ collisions and measuring the projected $|t|$ distribution to overcome this complication. Through the study of diffractive VM production, we carry out an experimental simulation of how the detector effect would change the extracted nuclear geometry and how to use projective techniques to avoid defects. This technique will allow us to measure the diffractive pattern in coherent events more precisely, providing a potential solution for a critical measurement that is difficult for the EIC baseline detector.</description>
