      <title>A production planning benchmark for real-world refinery-petrochemical complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To achieve digital intelligence transformation and carbon neutrality, effective production planning is crucial for integrated refinery-petrochemical complexes. Modern refinery planning relies on advanced optimization techniques, whose development requires reproducible benchmark problems. However, existing benchmarks lack practical context or impose oversimplified assumptions, limiting their applicability to enterprise-wide optimization. To bridge the substantial gap between theoretical research and industrial applications, this paper introduces the first open-source, demand-driven benchmark for industrial-scale refinery-petrochemical complexes with transparent model formulations and comprehensive input parameters. The benchmark incorporates a novel port-stream hybrid superstructure for modular modeling and broad generalizability. Key secondary processing units are represented using the delta-base approach grounded in historical data. Three real-world cases have been constructed to encompass distinct scenario characteristics, respectively addressing (1) a stand-alone refinery without integer variables, (2) chemical site integration with inventory-related integer variables, and (3) multi-period planning. All model parameters are fully accessible. Additionally, this paper provides an analysis of computational performance, ablation experiments on delta-base modeling, and application scenarios for the proposed benchmark.</description>

      <title>Numerical optimization of aviation decarbonization scenarios: balancing traffic and emissions with maturing energy carriers and aircraft technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being considered a hard-to-abate sector, aviation's emissions will play an important role in long-term climate mitigation of transportation. The introduction of low-carbon energy carriers and the deployment of new aircraft in the current fleet are modeled as a technology-centered decarbonization policy, and supply constraints in targeted market segments are modeled as demand-side policy. Shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) are used to estimate the trend traffic demand and limit the sectoral consumption of electricity and biomass. Mitigation scenarios are formulated as optimization problems and three applications are demonstrated: single-policy optimization, scenario-robust policy, and multiobjective policy trade-off. Overall, we find that the choice of energy carrier to embark is highly dependent on assumptions regarding aircraft technology and background energy system, and that aligning trend scenarios with the Paris Agreement market-targeted traffic constraints are required to align trend scenarios with the Paris Agreement. The usual burdens associated with nonlinear optimization with high-dimensional variables are dealt with by jointly using libraries for Multidisciplinary Optimization (GEMSEO) and Automatic Differentiation (JAX), which resulted in speedups of two orders of magnitude at the optimization level, while reducing associated implementation efforts.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Nonlinear Model Reduction to Spectral Submanifolds via Oblique Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics in a primary Spectral Submanifold (SSM) constructed over the slowest modes of a dynamical system provide an ideal reduced-order model for nearby trajectories. Modeling the dynamics of trajectories further away from the primary SSM, however, is difficult if the linear part of the system exhibits strong non-normal behavior. Such non-normality implies that simply projecting trajectories onto SSMs along directions normal to the slow linear modes will not pair those trajectories correctly with their reduced counterparts on the SSMs. In principle, a well-defined nonlinear projection along a stable invariant foliation exists and would exactly match the full dynamics to the SSM-reduced dynamics. This foliation, however, cannot realistically be constructed from practically feasible amounts and distributions of experimental data. Here we develop an oblique projection technique that is able to approximate this foliation efficiently, even from a single experimental trajectory of a significantly non-normal and nonlinear beam.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Data Integration for Sustainable Indoor Gardening: Tracking Anyplant with Time Series Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Indoor gardening within sustainable buildings offers a transformative solution to urban food security and environmental sustainability. By 2030, urban farming, including Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) and vertical farming, is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.2% from 2024 to 2030, according to market reports. This growth is fueled by advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, sustainable innovations such as smart growing systems, and the rising interest in green interior design. This paper presents a novel framework that integrates computer vision, machine learning (ML), and environmental sensing for the automated monitoring of plant health and growth. Unlike previous approaches, this framework combines RGB imagery, plant phenotyping data, and environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, to predict plant water stress in a controlled growth environment. The system utilizes high-resolution cameras to extract phenotypic features, such as RGB, plant area, height, and width while employing the Lag-Llama time series model to analyze and predict water stress. Experimental results demonstrate that integrating RGB, size ratios, and environmental data significantly enhances predictive accuracy, with the Fine-tuned model achieving the lowest errors (MSE = 0.420777, MAE = 0.595428) and reduced uncertainty. These findings highlight the potential of multimodal data and intelligent systems to automate plant care, optimize resource consumption, and align indoor gardening with sustainable building management practices, paving the way for resilient, green urban spaces.</description>

      <title>Convolutional optimization with convex kernel and power lift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We focus on establishing the foundational paradigm of a novel optimization theory based on convolution with convex kernels. Our goal is to devise a morally deterministic model of locating the global optima of an arbitrary function, which is distinguished from most commonly used statistical models. Limited preliminary numerical results are provided to test the efficiency of some specific algorithms derived from our paradigm, which we hope to stimulate further practical interest.</description>

      <title>Inverse design of dual-band valley-Hall topological photonic crystals with arbitrary pseudospin states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Valley photonic crystals (VPCs) offer topological kink states that ensure robust, unidirectional, and backscattering-immune light propagation. The design of VPCs is typically based on analogies with condensed-matter topological insulators that exhibit the quantum valley Hall effect; trial-and-error approaches are often used to tailor the photonic band structures and their topological properties, which are characterized by the local Berry curvatures. In this paper, we present an inverse design framework based on frequency-domain analysis for VPCs with arbitrary pseudospin states. Specifically, we utilize the transverse spin angular momentum (TSAM) at the band edge to formulate the objective function for engineering the desired topological properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed design approach can successfully produce photonic crystal waveguides exhibiting dual-band operation, enabling frequency-dependent light routing. Our pseudospin-engineering method thus provides a cost-effective alternative for designing topological photonic waveguides, offering novel functionalities.</description>

      <title>A high order multigrid-preconditioned immersed interface solver for the Poisson equation with boundary and interface conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a multigrid preconditioned high order immersed finite difference solver to accurately and efficiently solve the Poisson equation on complex 2D and 3D domains. The solver employs a low order Shortley-Weller multigrid method to precondition a high order matrix-free Krylov subspace solver. The matrix-free approach enables full compatibility with high order IIM discretizations of boundary and interface conditions, as well as high order wavelet-adapted multiresolution grids. Through verification and analysis on 2D domains, we demonstrate the ability of the algorithm to provide high order accurate results to Laplace and Poisson problems with Dirichlet, Neumann, and/or interface jump boundary conditions, all effectively preconditioned using the multigrid method. We further show that the proposed method is able to efficiently solve high order discretizations of Laplace and Poisson problems on complex 3D domains using thousands of compute cores and on multiresolution grids. To our knowledge, this work presents the largest problem sizes tackled with high order immersed methods applied to elliptic partial differential equations, and the first high order results on 3D multiresolution adaptive grids. Together, this work paves the way for employing high order immersed methods to a variety of 3D partial differential equations with boundary or inter-face conditions, including linear and non-linear elasticity problems, the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and fluid-structure interactions.</description>

      <title>Empirical Asset Pricing with Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel asset pricing model leveraging the Large Language Model (LLM) agents, which integrates qualitative discretionary investment evaluations from LLM agents with quantitative financial economic factors manually curated, aiming to explain the excess asset returns. The experimental results demonstrate that our methodology surpasses traditional machine learning-based baselines in both portfolio optimization and asset pricing errors. Notably, the Sharpe ratio for portfolio optimization and the mean magnitude of $|\alpha|$ for anomaly portfolios experienced substantial enhancements of 10.6\% and 10.0\% respectively. Moreover, we performed comprehensive ablation studies on our model and conducted a thorough analysis of the method to extract further insights into the proposed approach. Our results show effective evidence of the feasibility of applying LLMs in empirical asset pricing.</description>
