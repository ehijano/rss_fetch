      <title>Tailoring Bell inequalities to the qudit toric code and self testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell nonlocality provides a robust scalable route to the efficient certification of quantum states. Here, we introduce a general framework for constructing Bell inequalities tailored to the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric code for odd prime local dimensions. Selecting a suitable subset of stabilizer operators and mapping them to generalized measurement observables, we compute multipartite Bell expressions whose quantum maxima admit a sum-of-squares decomposition. We show that these inequalities are maximally violated by all states in the ground-state manifold of the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric code, and determine their classical (local) bounds through a combination of combinatorial tiling arguments and explicit optimization. As a concrete application, we analyze the case of $d=3$ and demonstrate that the maximal violation self-tests the full qutrit toric-code subspace, up to local isometries and complex conjugation. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first-ever example of self-testing a qutrit subspace. Extending these constructions, we further present schemes to enhance the ratio of classical--quantum bounds and thus improve robustness to experimental imperfections. Our results establish a pathway toward device-independent certification of highly entangled topological quantum matter and provide new tools for validating qudit states in error-correcting codes and quantum simulation platforms.</description>

      <title>On the Dynamics of Multiparticle Carroll-Schr\"dinger Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of multiparticle Carroll-Schr\"odinger (CS) quantum systems in $1{+}1$ dimensions, where $x$ acts as the evolution variable and $t$ as the configuration coordinate. We derive the $N$-body theory on equal-$x$ slices as the Carrollian limit of a relativistic multi-time Klein-Gordon model, introducing temporal interactions via minimal coupling to the temporal energy operators. An $x$-dependent gauge transformation maps this to an equivalent description with explicit many-body potentials, illustrated by a temporal coupled-oscillator model that exhibits synchronization. Adopting a complementary spatial viewpoint with a static potential $U_{\!tot}(\mathbf x)$, we show that the evolution is driven by the collective force $\sum_j\partial_{x_j}U_{\!tot}$; for any translation-invariant interaction (such as a regularized Coulomb potential), these internal forces cancel, rendering the collective dynamics free and highlighting Carrollian ultralocality. We also construct a coordinate duality mapping separable Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians to CS generators via Schwarzian derivatives. Exchange symmetry is formulated in the time domain, yielding temporal bunching for bosons and antibunching for fermions via the second-order coherence function $g^{(2)}(t,t')$. In second quantization, the contact limit yields a temporal derivative cubic--quintic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a theoretically fixed nonlinearity coefficient $\beta=-3/16$. Finally, by coupling canonical pairs to external scalar and gauge fields, we establish an isomorphism with one-dimensional current-density functional theory, outlining a Carrollian Hohenberg-Kohn mapping and Kohn-Sham scheme.</description>

      <title>Multi-Mode Quantum Memories for High-Throughput Satellite Entanglement Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networking seeks to enable global entanglement distribution through terrestrial and free space channels; however, the exponential loss in these channels necessitates quantum repeaters with efficient, long lived quantum memories (QMs). Space based architectures, particularly satellite assisted links, offer a path to truly global connectivity, yet they demand QMs that are compatible with orbital factors such as infrared radiation and the unique challenges of operating aboard a satellite. In this work, we propose a multimode quantum memory (MMQM) for low Earth orbit (LEO) repeaters based on the atomic frequency comb (AFC) protocol. Our design integrates a hybrid alkali noble gas ensemble in an optical cavity, using alkali atoms for strong photon matter coupling and noble gas nuclear spins for minutes to hours coherence, all without the need for cryogenics. The architecture natively supports temporal and spectral multiplexing, enabling the storage of 100 modes to parallelize probabilistic operations and overcome light limited round trip times. Representative link budgets at $h = 500$ km with realistic apertures, $\eta_{\text{mem}}\gtrsim 70%$, and $t_{\text{buffer}}$ of several minutes predict improvements of up to two orders of magnitude in per pass success probability and instantaneous SKR relative to a memoryless dual downlink, with clear scaling in $N$. Our contributions are (i) a non cryogenic, space ready multimode memory, (ii) a systems analysis coupling mode count, storage time, and orbital geometry to achievable rate, and (iii) a near term implementation roadmap. Together, these results indicate feasibility with current to near term technology and provide a practical path toward a high rate, space enabled quantum internet.</description>

      <title>UNIQ: Communication-Efficient Distributed Quantum Computing via Unified Nonlinear Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) is widely regarded as a promising approach to overcome quantum hardware limitations. A major challenge in DQC lies in reducing the communication cost introduced by remote CNOT gates, which are significantly slower and more resource-consuming than local operations. Existing DQC approaches treat the three essential components (qubit allocation, entanglement management, and network scheduling) as independent stages, optimizing each in isolation. However, we observe that these components are inherently interdependent, and therefore adopting a unified optimization strategy can be more efficient to achieve the global optimal solutions. Consequently, we propose UNIQ, a novel DQC optimization framework that integrates all three components into a non-linear integer programming (NIP) model. UNIQ aims to reduce the circuit runtime by maximizing parallel Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation through the use of idle communication qubits, while simultaneously minimizing the communication cost of remote gates. To solve this NP-hard formulated problem, we adopt two key strategies: a greedy algorithm for efficiently mapping logical qubits to different QPUs, and a JIT (Just-In-Time) approach that builds EPR pairs in parallel within each time slot. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach is widely applicable to diverse quantum circuits and QPU topologies, while substantially reducing communication cost and runtime over existing methods.</description>

      <title>Four-body interactions in Kerr parametric oscillator circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically present new unit circuits of Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) with four-body interactions, which enable the scalable embedding of all-to-all connected logical Ising spins using the Lechner-Hauke-Zoller (LHZ) scheme. These unit circuits enable four-body interactions using linear couplers, making the circuit fabrication and characterization much simpler than those of conventional unit circuits with nonlinear couplers. Numerical calculations indicate that the magnitudes of the coupling constants can be comparable to those in conventional circuits. On the basis of this theory, we designed a four-KPO circuit and experimentally confirmed the four-body correlation by measuring the pump-phase dependence of the parity of the four-KPO states. We show that the choice of the pump frequencies are important not only to enable the four-body interaction, but to cancel the effects of other unwanted interactions. Using the circuit, we demonstrated the quantum annealing based on the LHZ scheme, where the strength of the interaction between the logical Ising spins is mapped to the local field and controlled by a coherent drive applied to each KPO.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time correlation functions in single-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of quantum chaos, `out of time ordered correlators' (OTOCs) are commonly used to quantify the rate at which quantum information is scrambled. This rate has been conjectured by Maldecena et al. to obey a universal, temperature dependent bound. Recent studies have shown that instantons, delocalised structures that dominate tunnelling statistics over barriers, reduce the growth rate of OTOCs. For the case of the symmetric double well, this reduction ensures the bound is maintained for OTOCs generated using ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), a method with approximate dynamics but exact quantum statistics. In this report we set out to further understand the role of the instanton in the enforcement of the Maldacena bound and test whether RPMD is sufficient to satisfy the bound. We also investigate the impact of coherence on the flattening of of OTOCs by contrasting bounded with scattering systems. For the scattering system we observe a significantly smaller OTOC growth rate than that of the analogous bounded system, and a flattening in growth rate as time progresses. We attribute the first effect to influence of the Boltzmann operator, and the second to interference caused by anharmonicity of the potential. In our studies of RPMD, we find counterexamples showing that it is not sufficient to satisfy the bound. We develop a theory for OTOCs using (analytically-continued) Matsubara dynamics, revealing significantly different dynamical behaviour around the instanton compared to the predictions of RPMD. The instanton is found to be stationary in all coordinates but its collective angle $\Phi_0$, and fluctuations about it no longer resemble that of classical dynamics on a first order saddle as in RPMD.</description>

      <title>A Concatenated Dual Displacement Code for Continuous-Variable Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous-variable (CV) Gaussian no-go theorem fundamentally limits the suppression of Gaussian displacement errors using only Gaussian gates and states. Prior studies have employed Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states as ancillary qumodes to suppress small Gaussian displacement errors, but when the displacement magnitude becomes large, lattice-crossing events arise beyond the correctable range of the GKP state. To address this issue, we concatenate a Gaussian-noise-suppression circuit with an outer analog Steane code that corrects such occasional lattice-crossing events as well as other abrupt displacement errors. Unlike conventional concatenation, which primarily aims to reduce logical error rates, the Steane-GKP duality in encoding provides complementary protection against both large and small displacement errors, enabling CV error correction within the continuous encoding space and contrasting with earlier approaches that concatenate GKP states with repetition codes for discrete qubit or qudit encodings. Analytical results show that, under infinite squeezing, the concatenated code suppresses the variance of Gaussian displacement errors across all qumodes by up to 50 percent while enabling unbiased correction of lattice-crossing events, with a success probability determined by the ratio between the residual Gaussian error standard deviation and the lattice-crossing magnitude. Even with finite squeezing, the proposed architecture continues to provide Gaussian-error suppression together with lattice-crossing correction, and the presence of the outer analog Steane code relaxes the squeezing requirement of the inner GKP states, indicating near-term experimental feasibility. This work establishes a viable route toward fault-tolerant continuous-variable quantum computation and provides new insight into the design of concatenated CV error-correcting architectures.</description>

      <title>Local distinguishability of five orthogonal product states on bipartite and tripartite quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local distinguishability of orthogonal quantum states can effectively reduce the consumption of quantum resources and lower economic costs in quantum protocols. Although numerous achievements have been made regarding local distinguishability of orthogonal quantum states, some fundamental issues have not been effectively addressed. For example, the local distinguishability of five orthogonal product states (OPSs) is still unknown up to now. In this paper, we give the properties of local distinguishability of five OPSs on bipartite and tripartite quantum systems. Firstly, to characterize the structure of a set of bipartite OPSs, we propose the concept of the vector of orthogonal relations for a set of bipartite OPSs. Secondly, we classify the structures of five bipartite OPSs into six categories by this concept and prove that five of these six categories can be perfectly distinguished by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Thirdly we show that the local distinguishability of each case of the sixth category singly. On the other hand, we first divide the structures of five tripartite OPSs into eight categories by the vectors of orthogonal relations of five tripartite OPSs. Then we give the local distinguishability of each category. Our work enriches the research results of quantum nonlocality and will provide a clear understanding of the local distinguishability of five OPSs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Sensing via Large Spin-Clusters in Solid-State NMR: Optimal coherence order for practical sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement has long been recognized as an important resource for quantum sensing. In this work, we demonstrate the use of multiple-quantum solid-state NMR for quantum sensing by creating, manipulating, and detecting large clusters of correlated nuclear spins. We show that such clusters can sensitively detect pulse-width jitters in radio-frequency control fields at the level of tens of nanoseconds. By analyzing the response of high-order quantum coherences to these control-field jitters, we investigate the critical interplay between the enhanced sensitivity offered by large coherence orders, their relative distributions, and their varying susceptibility to decoherence. We further demonstrate that, even within a non-uniform distribution of coherence orders, there exists an optimal maximum coherence order that maximizes sensing efficiency. To support our interpretation, we supplement the experimental results with a simplified numerical model that estimates the corresponding quantum Fisher information. These results support the solid-state NMR platform as a valuable testbed for investigating many-body quantum metrology protocols.</description>

      <title>On the EPR paradox in systems with finite number of levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we reexamine the EPR paradox for composite systems with a finite number of levels. The analysis emphasizes the connection between measurements and conditional probabilities. This connection implies, on the one hand, that when a measurement is performed, the new quantum state and the probability distribution becomes a function of the observable being measured. On the other hand, this becomes important when making predictions about the properties of the subsystems, since the predictions are implicitly a function of the observable that was measured.
  Systems with finitely many levels are simpler to describe because the analysis is not encumbered by the mathematical technicalities of the continuous case, and the underlying physical interpretations are the same.</description>

      <title>Hybridization of pulse and continuous-wave based optical quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a pulse and continuous wave (CW) hybrid architecture of continuous-variable measurement-based optical quantum computation utilizing the strengths of both pulsed and CW light. In this architecture, input and ancillary non-Gaussian quantum states necessary for fault-tolerance and universality of quantum computing are generated with pulsed light, whereas quantum processors including continuous-variable cluster states and homodyne measurement systems are operated with CW light. This architecture is expected to enable both generation of quantum states with shorter optical wavepackets and low-loss manipulation and measurement of these states, thus is compatible with ultrafast and low-loss quantum information processing. In this study, as a proof-of-principle, an ultrafast homodyne measurement using CW local oscillator was performed on single-photon states generated with pulsed light. The measured single-photon state's temporal width was around 70 ps and the value of the Wigner function at the origin was W(0,0) = -0.153 +/- 0.003, which is highly non-classical. This will be a core technology for realizing high-speed optical quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Optimized Many-Hypercube Codes toward Lower Logical Error Rates and Earlier Realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-hypercube codes [H. Goto, Sci. Adv. 10, eadp6388 (2024)], concatenated ${[[n,n-2,2]]}$ quantum error-detecting codes ($n$ is even), have recently been proposed as high-rate quantum codes suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the original many-hypercube codes with ${n=6}$ have large code block sizes at high concatenation levels (216 and 1296 physical qubits per block at levels 3 and 4, respectively), making not only experimental realization difficult but also logical error rates high. Toward earlier experimental realization and lower logical error rates, here we investigate smaller many-hypercube codes obtained by concatenating $[[6,4,2]]$ and/or $[[4,2,2]]$ codes, where, e.g., $D_{6,4,4}$ denotes the many-hypercube code using $[[6,4,2]]$ at level 1 and $[[4,2,2]]$ at levels 2 and 3. As a result, we found a surprising fact: $D_{6,4,4}$ ($D_{6,6,4,4}$) can achieve lower block error rates than $D_{4,4,4}$ ($D_{4,4,4,4}$), despite its higher encoding rate. Focusing on level 3, we also developed efficient fault-tolerant encoders realizing about 60% overhead reduction while maintaining or even improving the performance, compared to the original design. Using them, we numerically confirmed that $D_{6,4,4}$ also achieves the best performance for logical controlled-NOT gates in a circuit-level noise model. These results will be useful for early experimental realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing with high-rate quantum codes.</description>

      <title>Physical Probability in the Everett Interpretation and Bell Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I define a notion of local causality LOC closely modelled on the Bell principle, construed as the condition that single case probabilities cannot be modified by actions at spacelike separation. The new principle, like that of Bell, forces Bell inequalities, but with two loopholes: one is retrocausation, known to Bell, but the other is nonuniqueness of remote outcomes, a loophole only for LOC, not for the Bell principle. I also set out a theory of physical probability, applicable to the Everett interpretation, in agreement with the Born rule, and therefore violating Bell inequalities. I show it is consistent with LOC. Surprisingly, both loopholes are exploited. I conclude not only that probability in the Everett interpretation involves no action at a distance, but that the observed violations of Bell inequalities is powerful evidence for many worlds.</description>

      <title>Geometric Parameterization of Kraus Operators with Applications to Quasi Inverse Channels for Multi Qubit Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a differentiable geometric parameterization of quantum channels in Kraus representation, which can be efficiently probed to find an unknown quantum channel. We explore its feasibility in finding the quasi inverse channels, which can be a tedious analytically for complex noise processes and is often achievable only for a limited range of parameters. In this regard, machine learning based algorithms have been employed successfully to find quasi inverse of quantum channels. The space of quantum channels in this scheme is a unit hypersphere, and components of mutually constrained unit vectors residing in this space, are used to construct a physically valid quantum channel. Symplectic constraints, orthogonality, and unit length of the vectors suffice to maintain complete positivity and the trace-preserving property of the channels. By performing gradient descent on this parametric space with a fidelity-based loss function, this approach is found to optimize quasi inverse of a variety of quantum channels, not limited to single-qubits, proving its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>On-Chip Levitated Neon Particle Arrays for Robust and Scalable Electron Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-on-neon (eNe) qubits have recently emerged as a compelling platform for quantum computing, which combines the vacuum isolation advantages of trapped-ion qubits with the scalability of superconducting circuits. In this system, electrons are trapped in vacuum above a solid neon film deposited on superconducting microwave resonators, where they exhibit strong coupling to the resonators, coherence times of ~0.1 ms, and single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.97%. A central challenge, however, is the spontaneous binding of electrons to neon surface bumps. These bumps, originating from substrate roughness, vary in size: electrons on bumps of suitable sizes within the resonator can couple to microwave photons and function as qubits, whereas those on unfavorable bumps remain inactive yet contribute to background charge noise. Moreover, both the bump landscape and the sites where electrons bind differ from run to run, leading to irreproducible qubit characteristics that hinder scalability. To address this challenging issue, we present an on-chip magnetic-levitation architecture in which arrays of solid-neon microparticles are suspended above the processor chip to act as electron carriers. This design eliminates substrate effects while retaining strong qubit-resonator coupling and supporting inter-qubit connectivity. Our analysis further shows that the qubit transition frequency can be tuned across the gigahertz range and its anharmonicity can reach ~0.8 GHz by tuning the resonator bias voltage. Together, these features suggest a promising pathway toward robust, reproducible, and scalable eNe-based quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Non-Negative Matrix Factorization Using Non-Von Neumann Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a matrix decomposition problem with applications in unsupervised learning. The general form of this problem (along with many of its variants) is NP-hard in nature. In our work, we explore how this problem could be solved with an energy-based optimization method suitable for certain machines with non-von Neumann architectures. We used the Dirac-3, a device based on the entropy computing paradigm and made by Quantum Computing Inc., to evaluate our approach. Our formulations consist of (i) a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization model (QUBO, suitable for Ising machines) and a quartic formulation that allows for real-valued and integer variables (suitable for machines like the Dirac-3). Although current devices cannot solve large NMF problems, the results of our preliminary experiments are promising enough to warrant further research. For non-negative real matrices, we observed that a fusion approach of first using Dirac-3 and then feeding its results as the initial factor matrices to Scikit-learn's NMF procedure outperforms Scikit-learn's NMF procedure on its own, with default parameters in terms of the error in the reconstructed matrices. For our experiments on non-negative integer matrices, we compared the Dirac-3 device to Google's CP-SAT solver (inside the Or-Tools package) and found that for serial processing, Dirac-3 outperforms CP-SAT in a majority of the cases. We believe that future work in this area might be able to identify domains and variants of the problem where entropy computing (and other non-von Neumann architectures) could offer a clear advantage.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Aware Optimization of Noisy Variational Quantum Circuits via Weighted Projective Line Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a differential-geometric framework for variational quantum circuits in which noisy single- and multi-qubit parameter spaces are modeled by weighted projective lines (WPLs). Starting from the pure-state Bloch sphere CP1, we show that realistic hardware noise induces anisotropic contractions of the Bloch ball that can be represented by a pair of physically interpretable parameters (lambda_perp, lambda_parallel). These parameters determine a unique WPL metric g_WPL(a_over_b, b) whose scalar curvature is R = 2 / b^2, yielding a compact and channel-resolved geometric surrogate for the intrinsic information structure of noisy quantum circuits.
  We develop a tomography-to-geometry pipeline that extracts (lambda_perp, lambda_parallel) from hardware data and maps them to the WPL parameters (a_over_b, b, R). Experiments on IBM Quantum backends show that the resulting WPL geometries accurately capture anisotropic curvature deformation across calibration periods. Finally, we demonstrate that WPL-informed quantum natural gradients (WPL-QNG) provide stable optimization dynamics for noisy variational quantum eigensolvers and enable curvature-aware mitigation of barren plateaus.</description>

      <title>Weighted Projective Line ZX Calculus: Quantized Orbifold Geometry for Quantum Compilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a unified geometric framework for quantum circuit compilation based on quantized orbifold phases and their diagrammatic semantics. Physical qubit platforms impose heterogeneous phase resolutions, anisotropic Bloch-ball contractions, and hardware-dependent $2\pi$ winding behavior. We show that these effects admit a natural description on the weighted projective line $\mathbb{P}(a,b)$, whose orbifold points encode discrete phase grids and whose monodromy captures winding accumulation under realistic noise channels.
  Building on this geometry, we introduce the WPL--ZX calculus, an extension of the standard ZX formalism in which each spider carries a weight--phase--winding triple $(a,\alpha,k)$. We prove soundness of LCM-based fusion and normalization rules, derive curvature predictors for phase-grid compatibility, and present the Weighted ZX Circuit Compression (WZCC) algorithm, which performs geometry-aware optimization on heterogeneous phase lattices.
  To connect circuit-level structure with fault-tolerant architectures, we introduce Monodromy-Aware Surface-Code Decoding (MASD), a winding-regularized modification of minimum-weight matching on syndrome graphs. MASD incorporates orbifold-weighted edge costs, producing monotone decoder-risk metrics and improved robustness across phase-quantized noise models.
  All results are validated through symbolic and numerical simulations, demonstrating that quantized orbifold geometry provides a coherent and hardware-relevant extension of diagrammatic quantum compilation.</description>

      <title>DyLoC: A Dual-Layer Architecture for Secure and Trainable Quantum Machine Learning Under Polynomial-DLA constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum circuits face a critical trade-off between privacy and trainability. High expressivity required for robust privacy induces exponentially large dynamical Lie algebras. This structure inevitably leads to barren plateaus. Conversely, trainable models restricted to polynomial-sized algebras remain transparent to algebraic attacks. To resolve this impasse, DyLoC is proposed. This dual-layer architecture employs an orthogonal decoupling strategy. Trainability is anchored to a polynomial-DLA ansatz while privacy is externalized to the input and output interfaces. Specifically, Truncated Chebyshev Graph Encoding (TCGE) is employed to thwart snapshot inversion. Dynamic Local Scrambling (DLS) is utilized to obfuscate gradients. Experiments demonstrate that DyLoC maintains baseline-level convergence with a final loss of 0.186. It outperforms the baseline by increasing the gradient reconstruction error by 13 orders of magnitude. Furthermore, snapshot inversion attacks are blocked when the reconstruction mean squared error exceeds 2.0. These results confirm that DyLoC effectively establishes a verifiable pathway for secure and trainable quantum machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generalized Deutsch-Jozsa (DJ) quantum algorithm that not only determines both the global type of an unknown Boolean function (constant or balanced) but also determines explicit output values of the function in a single oracle query. Unlike the original DJ algorithm, which identifies only whether a function is constant or balanced, our generalization retrieves actual function output values at the same time with using a Bell state as ancilla. This makes a richer function characterization with minimal queries to have practical quantum advantages, e.g. data classification, logistic regression, and quantum cryptography.</description>

      <title>Information conservation relations for weak measurement and its reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the information distribution among different entities in the weak measurements protocol. Focusing on multilevel, decaying systems under continuous (no-click) monitoring, we derive exact, conservation-type information relations that hold for each outcome in the record. Analogous relations hold when an explicit reversal is applied, with the reversal success probability entering the relation.
  We extend the framework to finite-count outcomes (arbitrary photon numbers) obtaining quantitative trade-offs that link information change in the weak measurement process to the entities to which the information is distributed. These results provide a unified, outcome-resolved account of information flow in monitored open quantum dynamics and provide insight into a deeper understanding of open-system dynamics and its control.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation is Efficiently Learnable by Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation is a phenomenon in which the Hilbert space of a quantum system is dynamically decoupled into exponentially many Krylov subspaces. We can define the Schur transform as a unitary operation mapping some set of preferred bases of these Krylov subspaces to computational basis states labeling them. We prove that this transformation can be efficiently learned via gradient descent from a set of training data using quantum neural networks, provided that the fragmentation is sufficiently strong such that the summed dimension of the unique Krylov subspaces is polynomial in the system size. To demonstrate this, we analyze the loss landscapes of random quantum neural networks constructed out of Hilbert space fragmented systems. We prove that in this setting, it is possible to eliminate barren plateaus and poor local minima, suggesting efficient trainability when using gradient descent. Furthermore, as the algebra defining the fragmentation is not known a priori and not guaranteed to have sparse algebra elements, to the best of our knowledge there are no existing efficient classical algorithms generally capable of simulating expectation values in these networks. Our setting thus provides a rare example of a physically motivated quantum learning task with no known dequantization.</description>

      <title>Boosting Gaussian Boson Sampling using Optical Parametric Amplification Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) provides a route toward demonstrating quantum computational advantage. However, optical loss, which reduces the entanglement in the system, can render GBS results classically simulable. We propose a nonlinear photonic architecture based on optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) arranged in an interferometer network. This active configuration amplifies quantum correlations within the circuit while preserving the #P-hard Hafnian structure of the output probabilities. Using logarithmic negativity, we numerically show that entanglement scales linearly with both the OPA gain and network depth in the lossless limit, and maintains linear scaling with the number of modes under realistic loss rate. These scaling behaviors suggest that classical simulation in lossy scenarios remains computationally intractable. Our results demonstrate that OPA-boosted GBS preserves computational hardness in noisy environments, offering a more effective implementations of near-term photonic quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of thermally noisy quantum gates in a multilevel system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum systems are inherently sensitive to environmental noise and imperfections in external control fields, posing a significant challenge for the practical implementation of quantum technologies. These noise sources degrade the fidelity of quantum gates, making their mitigation a key requirement for realizing reliable quantum computing. In this study, we apply optimal control theory (OCT) within a thermodynamically consistent framework to design and stabilize high-fidelity quantum gates under Markovian noise. Our approach focuses on thermal relaxation and incorporates these effects into the control protocol, wherein external driving fields not only govern the system's unitary evolution but also modulate its interaction with the environment. By leveraging this interplay, we demonstrate that OCT can enable entropy-modifying processes, such as targeted cooling or heating, while maintaining high-fidelity gate performance in noisy environments. To validate our approach, we employ high-precision numerical methods on an open quantum system implementing one- or two-qubit gates embedded in a larger Hilbert space. The results showcase robust gate operation even under significant dissipative influences, offering a concrete path toward fault-tolerant quantum computation under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Super-Extensive Charging Power in the Absence of Global Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries have emerged as a platform for investigating whether quantum effects can accelerate energy storage beyond classical limits. Although a variety of charging schemes have reported signatures of quantum advantage, the fundamental physical requirements for achieving superextensive charging power remain insufficiently understood. Here, we show that, in addition to Hamiltonian locality, a key structural property, g-extensiveness, quantifying the distribution of interaction energy across lattice sites places a fundamental bound on charging performance in spin-lattice models. We prove that superextensive power scaling is possible only when the interaction-energy distribution becomes increasingly nonuniform, with the maximal local weight growing with system size. This criterion explains why many previously studied protocols fail to exhibit superextensive power, even when the Hamiltonians involve large participation numbers. We further demonstrate that this condition is realized in an experimentally relevant interacting model, where, despite fixed interaction order, the charging power scales superextensively. Our results establish g-extensiveness as a necessary resource for quantum advantage in direct-charging protocols and provide a systematic framework for identifying and engineering physically feasible quantum batteries capable of outperforming classical counterparts in charging power.</description>

      <title>Particle creation, adiabaticity, and irreversibility in the TDHO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact description of the dynamics and the thermodynamics of a time dependent harmonic oscillator (TDHO) that follows a unitary evolution. In that context, we study the relationship between particle creation, adiabaticity and irreversibility in terms of three different representations: the initial, the diagonal and the invariant representations of the TDHO. We provide analytical results that are valid for any functional value of the frequency and along the whole evolution of the TDHO, which allows us to monitor the behavior of the thermodynamical magnitudes in regions that are not fully considered in previous works, i.e. the transition and the non quasi-static regions. We supplement the analytical results with numerical calculations and graphs.
  They both show how the largest modes of the non invariant representations may undergo a process of reversible thermalization, where the concept of temperature naturally arises from the unitary evolution of the oscillator with no relation to any external concept of temperature. It would allow us to monitor an unexpected classical-to-quantum transition, which might entail a violation of the third principle of classical thermodynamics. We also provide adaptations of the customary definitions of the quantum heat and work that account for the particle creation of the TDHO. They thus depend on the representation and their evolution is different for the three representations analyzed in this paper, which might have important consequences in the development of quantum thermal machines. Finally, we study the relationship between the creation of particles and the diagonal entropy, which is derived from the von Neumann entropy in the diagonalization limit. The condition of no production of entropy under unitary evolution suggests the definition of a mode temperature that would correspond to the thermal temperature is some appropriate limit.</description>

      <title>Multiqubit Rydberg Gates for Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiqubit gates that involve three or more qubits are usually thought to be of little significance for fault-tolerant quantum error correction because single gate faults can lead to high-weight correlated errors. However, recent works have shown that multiqubit gates can be beneficial for measurement-free fault-tolerant quantum error correction and for fault-tolerant stabilizer readout in unrotated surface codes. In this work, we investigate multiqubit Rydberg gates that are useful for fault-tolerant quantum error correction in single-species neutral-atom platforms and can be implemented with a single, non-addressed laser pulse. We develop an open-source Python package to generate analytical, few-parameter pulses that implement the desired gates while minimizing gate errors due to Rydberg-state decay. The tool also allows us to identify parameter-optimal pulses, characterized by a minimal parameter count for the pulse ansatz. Measurement-free quantum error correction protocols require CCZ gates, which we analyze for atoms arranged in symmetric and asymmetric configurations. We investigate the performance of these schemes for various single-, two-, and three-qubit gate error rates, showing that break-even performance of measurement-free QEC is within reach of current hardware. Moreover, we study Floquet quantum error correction protocols that comprise two-body stabilizer measurements. Those can be realized using global three-qubit gates, and we show that this can lead to a significant reduction in shuttling operations. Simulations with realistic circuit-level noise indicate that applying three-qubit gates for stabilizer measurements in Floquet codes can yield competitive logical qubit performance in experimentally relevant error regimes.</description>

      <title>Opportunities and Challenges for Data Quality in the Era of Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era where data underpins decision-making across science, politics, and economics, ensuring high data quality is of paramount importance. Conventional computing algorithms for enhancing data quality, including anomaly detection, demand substantial computational resources, lengthy processing times, and extensive training datasets. This work aims to explore the potential advantages of quantum computing for enhancing data quality, with a particular focus on detection. We begin by examining quantum techniques that could replace key subroutines in conventional anomaly detection frameworks to mitigate their computational intensity. We then provide practical demonstrations of quantum-based anomaly detection methods, highlighting their capabilities. We present a technical implementation for detecting volatility regime changes in stock market data using quantum reservoir computing, which is a special type of quantum machine learning model. The experimental results indicate that quantum-based embeddings are a competitive alternative to classical ones in this particular example. Finally, we identify unresolved challenges and limitations in applying quantum computing to data quality tasks. Our findings open up new avenues for innovative research and commercial applications that aim to advance data quality through quantum technologies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing non-Markovian quantum dynamics is currently hindered by the self-inconsistency and high computational complexity of existing quantum comb tomography (QCT) methods. In this work, we propose a self-consistent framework that unifies the quantum comb, instrument set, and initial states into a single geometric entity, termed as the Comb-Instrument-State (CIS) set. We demonstrate that the CIS set naturally resides on a product Stiefel manifold, allowing the tomography problem to be solved via efficient unconstrained Riemannian optimization while automatically preserving physical constraints. Numerical simulations confirm that our approach is computationally scalable and robust against gate definition errors, significantly outperforming conventional isometry-based QCT methods. Our work indicates the potential to efficiently learn quantum comb with fewer computational resources.</description>

      <title>Formulations of Quantum Thermodynamics and Applications in Open Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics has emerged as a central field for understanding how energy conversion processes occur in microscopic systems. In these systems, effects such as coherence, entanglement, and non-Markovianity play key roles. In this thesis, we explore different ways to describe quantum thermodynamics, using two main approaches: one based on entropy and the other on ergotropy. First, we introduce a generalized approach to quantify non-Markovianity through the breakdown of monotonicity in thermodynamic functions. In this context, the entropy-based heat flow serves as a practical tool to witness and measure quantum memory in unital maps that do not reverse the sign of the internal energy. Next, we analyze the dynamics of ergotropy in open qubits under both Markovian and non-Markovian evolutions. We identify phenomena such as freezing and sudden death of ergotropy, and we establish an analytical relation between the change in ergotropy and the environment-induced work . This provides a clear physical interpretation for the additional term in the first law in the entropy-based formulation. Finally, we propose an ergotropy-based thermodynamic formulation, in which heat is reinterpreted in terms of the change of the passive state associated with the density operator governing the quantum dynamics. This approach allows one to measure non-Markovianity of unital maps more generally and accurately than the entropy-based heat flow. This advantage comes from the direct link between heat and von Neumann entropy, a property ensured by invariance under passive transformations. Moreover, the out-of-equilibrium temperature naturally remains non-negative, similarly to equilibrium thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum ramp secret sharing from Haar scrambling</title>

Abstract: Quantum information scrambling has emerged as a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, assessing benchmarking protocols, and even investigating exotic black hole models. During quantum information scrambling, localized quantum information disperses across the entire system, hiding from the observers who can only access part of it. On the other side, we have a fundamental cryptographic primitive called secret-sharing schemes, where a dealer shares a quantum secret with a group of parties, such that any subset of parties above a specific threshold size can reconstruct it. In this paper, we demonstrate that two protocols, Haar scrambling, which serves as a baseline for other scrambling techniques, and quantum secret sharing, are indeed equivalent. The scheme one gets out of this is of a ramp secret-sharing nature rather than a threshold scheme. We expect this because of the inherent randomness present in Haar unitaries. Moreover, by varying the purity of the initial states, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain all possible types of ramp secret-sharing schemes. Furthermore, utilizing complexity theoretic arguments, we argue that the protocol can be implemented efficiently, i.e., in polynomial time. Finally, we explore potential applications, ranging from security implications for distributed quantum networks to cryptography in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, and draw insights for fundamental physics, such as many-body physics and quantum black holes.</description>

      <title>From Promise to Practice: Benchmarking Quantum Chemistry on Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a systematic evaluation of the sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) method for electronic structure based on the W4-11 thermochemistry dataset, comprising 124 total atomization, 83 bond dissociation, 20 isomerization, 505 heavy-atom transfer, and 13 nucleophilic substitution processes, covering diverse bonding situations and reaction mechanisms. This is the largest study assessing the accuracy and precision of a quantum-hybrid algorithm on a digital quantum device across a variety of molecular systems and chemical reactions, using 16.85 hours on the superconducting quantum processor ibm_rensselaer and 724.22 node hours on the supercomputer AiMOS. To ensure a fair comparison, our study employs commensurate resource allocation for both classical and quantum simulations. Although SQD exhibits large statistical deviations from ground-state reference energies, energy extrapolations yield CCSD-level accuracy. While bond-breaking reactions show a systematic improvement as computational resources increase, nucleophilic substitution or heavy atom transfer reactions do not. The limitations quantified in this manuscript indicate opportunities for improvement in SQD-based algorithms. This work provides a benchmark and community resource for exploring new quantum algorithms and devices, supported by an online benchmark challenge and an open-source Python library for direct comparison.</description>

      <title>Thermalization Rate of Light in Weakly Coupled Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emission and absorption spectra of molecular films are impacted by low-frequency molecular vibrations. These vibrations define the linewidths of the absorption and emission spectral peaks, as well as the Stokes shift. In cavities that use a molecular film as an active medium, low-frequency molecular vibrations facilitate the thermalization of light, enabling the formation of Bose-Einstein condensation. In this work, I employ perturbation theory for Lindblad superoperators and derive the contribution of the low-frequency molecular vibrations to the thermalization rate of light in a weak coupling regime between light and matter. The derived thermalization rate applies for any cavity design but depends on the local microscopic properties of low-frequency molecular vibrations. I provide an estimation for the thermalization rate, which requires only knowledge of the macroscopic parameters of the system: light-matter interaction strength, resonant frequencies of the cavity and excitons, number of molecules in the illuminated area, and the linewidth temperature dependence of the 0-0 peak in the emission spectra of standalone molecular film.</description>

      <title>Photons in a Spherical Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The iconic problem of photon modes in a spherical cavity has been discussed in the literature; however, conflicting results have been reported \cite{Heitler,Davydov_QuantumMechanics}. For this reason, the solution of this problem is worked out in detail here, starting with the Maxwell equations and applying boundary conditions at the surface of the bounding perfect conductor. Contrary to the treatments in the literature \cite{Heitler,Davydov_QuantumMechanics}, the allowed frequencies for photons in the sphere are given by two different conditions, one for electric and one for magnetic multipole photons. After establishing the modes and their allowed frequencies, we write down the second-quantized vector potential in the spherical geometry. Based on these spherical modes, bipartite photon entanglement is investigated showing that there are in-principle 40 different types of entangled photon states. Finally, we include some appendices about photon plane-wave and spherical-wave helicity states, helicity spherical harmonic vectors, and rotation of the helicity states and 3-d vectors using the Wigner $D$-matrix.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Control in Two-Spin-1/2 NMR Systems Through Magnetic Fields and Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum entanglement in two-spin-1/2 NMR systems at thermal equilibrium under external magnetic fields. We derive closed-form analytical expressions for the entanglement of the system and show how the entanglement depends on temperature and magnetic field strength, resulting in a threshold temperature beyond which entanglement vanishes. We demonstrate that at zero temperature, the system exhibits a quantum critical point, characterized by non-analytic behavior in the measure of entanglement. We further develop analytical criterion for level crossing, which serves as a condition for identifying quantum critical points in both homonuclear and heteronuclear systems, and apply it to multiple settings to analyze their quantum critical points. We establish a direct link between the quantum entanglement quantifier and experimentally accessible NMR observables, enabling entanglement to be quantified through NMR signal processing. This provides a practical framework for characterizing quantum correlations using standard NMR experiments. These findings provide insights into the thermal control of quantum features, with implications for quantum-enhanced NMR, low-temperature spectroscopy, and emerging quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Machine Learning for Experimental Detection of Quantum-Many-Body Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum many-body (QMB) systems are generally computationally hard: the computing resources necessary to simulate them exactly can often exceed the existing computation resources by orders of magnitude. For this reason, Richard Feynman proposed the concept of a quantum simulator: quantum systems engineered to obey a prescribed evolution equation and repeating the experiment multiple times. Experimentally, however, as we explain below, the vast majority of observables describing the system are inaccessible. Thus, while Feynman's idea addresses the problem of simulating quantum dynamics, it leaves unsolved the equally fundamental problem of inferring the underlying physics from the limited observables accessible in experiments. Indeed, many complex phenomena associated with QMB systems remain elusive. Perhaps, the most important example is identifying phase transitions in QMB systems when no simple order-parameter exists, which poses major challenges to this day. Complicating the problem further is the fact that, in most cases, it is impossible to learn from numerical simulations, as the underlying systems are often too large to be computable, and small QMB can show strong finite size effects, masking the presence of the transition. Here, we present an unsupervised machine learning approach to study QMB experiments, specifically aimed at detecting phase transitions and crossovers directly from raw experimental measurements. We demonstrate our methodology on systems undergoing Many-Body Localization cross-over and Mott-to-Superfluid phase-transition, showing that it reveals collective phenomena from the very partial experimental data and without any model-specific prior knowledge of the system. This approach offers a general and scalable route for data-driven discovery of emergent phenomena in complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum features and non-classical nature of two-spin-$1/2$ NMR systems at thermal equilibrium under external magnetic fields. More specifically, using suitable quantifiers, we analyze quantum coherence, mixedness, and entanglement in NMR systems and examine their features within the system. We derive closed-form analytical expressions for the quantum elements and show how they depend on temperature and magnetic field strength. We demonstrate that at zero temperature, the system exhibits a quantum critical point, characterized by non-analytic behavior in the measures of coherence, and a sharp peak in mixedness. Moreover, we analyze the entanglement of the system using a suitable entanglement witness. This provides an experimentally friendly setting for testing entanglement in NMR systems. In other words, the witness links the entanglement in the system to quantum observables, making it directly provable in NMR experiments. We establish a connection between quantum information quantifiers and experimentally accessible NMR spectra of the system, enabling the quantification of entanglement, coherence, and mixedness through NMR signal processing.</description>

      <title>Optimized spectral and interferometric techniques for the certification of ETPA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phenomenon of Entangled Two-Photon Absorption (ETPA) presents a persistent controversy in the literature, evidenced by a wide disparity in the reported values for the $\sigma_E$ cross-sections. Much of this discrepancy is attributed to the difficulty in discriminating ETPA from various background processes that can mimic its signal, such as linear absorption or scattering. Given this need to certify the presence of ETPA unequivocally, this work introduces a key strategy to isolate the ETPA contribution through its spectral signature. This involves modeling the molecule as a two-photon notch filter and inducing a controlled asymmetric overlap with the joint spectral intensity (JSI) of the incident photons. This asymmetry is used to generate a measurable distortion in the transmitted JSI, and, complementarily, as a reduction in the visibility of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) dip. To ensure the experimental feasibility of this technique, a comprehensive analysis of the experimental conditions required for its detection is presented, establishing the absorption efficiency limits that must be overcome given the constraints of entangled-photon-pair flux and detector noise. A preliminary experiment addressing the ETPA detection limits using the standard RhB dye is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The projected rapid growth of battery cell production over the next decade demands advanced diagnostic tools for quality control, ageing prediction, and recycling. Most existing techniques lack the spatial and temporal resolution required to capture internal electrochemical processes non-invasively. Here, we present magnetic imaging of current densities in battery cells, a sensitive quantum-magnetometry method that uses optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs) to perform real-time imaging of internal dynamics in open-circuit configuration. We demonstrate this approach for monitoring relaxation processes in 6000 mA h lithium-ion cells following pulsed discharges across a range of pulse durations and currents as well as states of charge. The measurement results are benchmarked against superconducting-quantum-interference-device (SQUID) magnetometry and validated with three-dimensional finite element simulations. Equivalent circuit models are employed to interpret the relaxation profiles, revealing spatially resolved features and transient magnetic-field signatures that are inaccessible with complementary non-invasive techniques such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). This work establishes OPM-based magnetic imaging of battery current density as a powerful diagnostic tool with potential impact on cell development, manufacturing quality assurance, and second-life assessment.</description>

      <title>Scoring-based Static Variable Ordering for Decision Diagram-based Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision diagram (DD)-based quantum circuit simulators represent quantum states and gates using DDs, enabling memory-efficient and fast simulations for some quantum circuits like Shor. Although it is known that DD size and processing time vary depending on the variable order in classical circuits, there has not been much research on the variable order under quantum circuit simulation. One existing study pointed out that dynamic reordering worsens the simulation time and numerical accuracy, and there is no comprehensive research on static orders in the context of quantum circuit simulation. Therefore, this paper proposes a scoring-based heuristic method for determining a static variable order that enables efficient DD-based quantum circuit simulation. When applied to benchmark circuits, the default original variable orders resulted in slow simulations, whereas the proposed method achieved speedups of up to 150x. Furthermore, the proposed order completed the simulation of Shor's 1011 factorization in 5 hours on a single-core laptop, although it was not completed within two days previously.</description>

      <title>Experimental Witness of Quantum Jump Induced High-Order Liouvillian Exceptional Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exceptional point has presented considerably interesting and counterintuitive phenomena associated with nonreciprocity, precision measurement, and topological dynamics. The Liouvillian exceptional point (LEP), involving the interplay of energy loss and decoherence inherently relevant to quantum jumps, has recently drawn much attention due to capability to fully capture quantum system dynamics and naturally facilitate non-Hermitian quantum investigations. It was also predicted that quantum jumps could give rise to third-order LEPs in two-level quantum systems for its high dimensional Liouvillian superoperator, which, however, has never been experimentally confirmed until now. Here we report the first observation of the third-order LEPs emerging from quantum jumps in an ultracold two-level trapped-ion system. Moreover, by combining decay with dephasing processes, we present the first experimental exploration of LEPs involving combinatorial effect of decay and dephasing. In particular, due to non-commutativity between the Lindblad superoperators governing LEPs for decay and dephasing, we witness the movement of LEPs driven by the competition between decay and dephasing occurring in an open quantum system. This unique feature of non-Hermitian quantum systems paves a new avenue for modifying nonreciprocity, enhancing precision measurement, and manipulating topological dynamics by tuning the LEPs.</description>

      <title>Passive Polarization Stabilization for Practical and Robust Entanglement Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a key resource in quantum information science, playing an essential role in quantum key distribution (QKD), quantum networks, and distributed quantum computing. However, practical applications require techniques capable of reliably distributing entanglement under lossy and noisy conditions. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple configuration using two polarization-maintaining fibers (PMFs) arranged in a cross-axis alignment enables stable distribution of entangled photon pairs without the need for real-time polarization compensation. To support this, we performed quantum information modeling and fidelity simulations for the cross-aligned PMF pair, and experimentally compared the entanglement preservation and interference fringe stability in setups based on standard single-mode fibers (SMFs) and PMFs. The experimental results show that the PMF-based configuration achieves an average visibility of 0.867 and an error propagation of 0.023 under unstable conditions, whereas the SMF setup exhibits a significantly lower stability with an average visibility of 0.444 and an error propagation of 0.167 under the same conditions. These results indicate that the cross-aligned PMF pair allows robust entanglement transmission without complex active compensation devices, suggesting its suitability for reliable quantum state distribution in long-distance quantum communication, drone-based QKD, and multi-user quantum networks.</description>

      <title>The Entropy Flow of a Laser Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A laser beam is often modelled by a pure coherent state. In fact its state is mixed, even if it has coherent-state photon-number statistics (Poissonian), because the phase must vary. We consider such an ideal laser beam, with phase diffusion rate $\ell$, equal to its (Lorentzian) spectral width. We show that the beam entropy is extensive, with an entropy flow of $\dot{S} = \sqrt{\dot{N}\ell}$, where $\dot{N}$ is the number flow. We give an intuitive explanation for this remarkably simple result, and compare it to a unidirectional thermal beam.</description>

      <title>Geometric Phase of the Two-Particle Bethe Wavefunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a problem of geometric phase generation in a system of two interacting bosons confined in a narrow ring potential with a localized defect. Geometric phase emerges from variation of parameters of the defect. Particle interaction is taken into account within a framework of the Lieb-Liniger model. The energy spectrum is evaluated and its dependence on the parameters of the problem is described. It is shown that the interaction leads to increase of the geometric phase for a given contour of variations. The work is motivated by earlier proposed ideas of quantum gyroscope and quantum accelerometer based on atomic Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <title>Tunable Single- and Multiphoton Bundles in Cavity-Coupled Atomic Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an experimentally accessible scheme for realizing tunable nonclassical light in cavity-coupled reconfigurable atomic arrays. By coherently controlling the collective interference phase, the system switches from single-photon blockade to high-purity multiphoton bundle emission, unveiling a hierarchical structure of photon correlations dictated by atom-number parity and cavity detuning. The scaling of photon population identifies the transition between superradiant and subradiant regimes, while parity- and phase-dependent spin correlations elucidate the microscopic interference processes enabling coherent multiphoton generation. This work establishes a unified framework connecting cooperative atomic interactions to controllable nonclassical photon statistics and introduces a distinct interference-enabled mechanism that provides a practical route toward high-fidelity multiphoton sources in scalable cavity QEDs.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Learnability Transition of Measurement-Induced Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) captures how local measurements generate long-range quantum correlations and drive dynamical phase transitions in many-body systems. Yet estimating MIE experimentally remains challenging: direct evaluation requires extensive post-selection over measurement outcomes, raising the question of whether MIE is accessible with only polynomial resources. We address this challenge by reframing MIE detection as a data-driven learning problem that assumes no prior knowledge of state preparation. Using measurement records alone, we train a neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict the uncertainty metric for MIE--the gap between upper and lower bounds of the average post-measurement bipartite entanglement. Applied to random circuits with one-dimensional all-to-all connectivity and two-dimensional nearest-neighbor coupling, our method reveals a learnability transition with increasing circuit depth: below a threshold, the uncertainty is small and decreases with polynomial measurement data and model parameters, while above it the uncertainty remains large despite increasing resources. We further verify this transition experimentally on current noisy quantum devices, demonstrating its robustness to realistic noise. These results highlight the power of data-driven approaches for learning MIE and delineate the practical limits of its classical learnability.</description>

      <title>Measurement-based quantum computation on weighted graph states with arbitrarily small weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weighted graph states are a natural generalization of graph states, which are generated by applying controlled-phase gates, instead of controlled-Z gates, to a separable state. In this paper, we show that uniformly weighted graph states on a suitable planar graph constitute universal resources for measurement-based quantum computation for an arbitrary nonzero constant weight. To our knowledge, this is the first example of universal resources prepared with only non-maximally entangling gates and has potential applications to weakly interacting systems, such as photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Single-Photon Detector: Achieving Superconducting-Level Performance with Conventional Quantum Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-performance single-photon detectors (SPDs) are indispensable components for quantum optical tasks. However, the reliance of state-of-the-art devices on superconducting materials imposes severe technological demands and challenging operational conditions (e.g., cryogenics), which hinder scalable commercial deployment. To address this, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detector (ESPD) framework, a novel paradigm for achieving high-performance SPDs through the iterative enhancement of low-technology SPDs. Utilizing only standard quantum optical components, the ESPD scheme transforms a legacy non-superconducting SPD, with detection efficiency (DE) about $59\%$ and dark count rate (DCR) $10^{-2}$, into a device with superior performance metrics, achieving DE higher than $95\%$ and DCR below $10^{-9}$. This level of performance is comparable to or surpasses recently designed superconducting SPDs, allowing the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols to be reduced by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the scheme's device requirements are moderate, relying on readily available current technology, which ensures near-term experimental feasibility. The ESPD framework thus provides a clear, scalable path toward the large-scale deployment of high-performance SPDs and the commercialization of quantum communication technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the ensemble transverse relaxation time (T2*) and spin-echo coherence time (T2) of the proton spin of HD molecules trapped in solid parahydrogen. By using high-purity parahydrogen matrices, we are able to measure significantly longer T2 and T2* times than seen in prior work. We also measure the longitudinal spin relaxation time T1. We examine how these parameters scale with the matrix purity and find limits on the coherence time from the parahydrogen matrix itself.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) have attracted intense interest, yet their many-particle counterparts remain largely unexplored in waveguide quantum electrodynamics. We identify and characterize a bound state embedded in the doublon continuum (BIDC) that emerges when four atoms couple to a coupled-resonator waveguide with strong on-site interaction. Exploiting this interaction-enabled BIDC, we show that (i) a distant, four-atom entangled state can be prepared with high fidelity, and (ii) quantum entangled states can be coherently transferred between spatially separated nodes. Our results establish a scalable mechanism for multi-particle state generation and routing in waveguide platforms, opening a route to interaction-protected quantum communication with many-particle BICs.</description>

In particular, we introduce a two-parameter family of entanglement witnesses, identify the parameter ranges where they constitute valid witnesses, and demonstrate their ability to reveal effective entanglement in the COW protocol. Additionally, we analyze previously obtained experimental data from a COW implementation and report clear signatures of effective entanglement.</description>

      <title>Modeling Wavelet Transformed Quantum Support Vector for Network Intrusion Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network traffic anomaly detection is a critical cy- bersecurity challenge requiring robust solutions for complex Internet of Things (IoT) environments. We present a novel hybrid quantum-classical framework integrating an enhanced Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM) with the Quantum Haar Wavelet Packet Transform (QWPT) for superior anomaly classification under realistic noisy intermediate-scale Quantum conditions. Our methodology employs amplitude-encoded quan- tum state preparation, multi-level QWPT feature extraction, and behavioral analysis via Shannon Entropy profiling and Chi-square testing. Features are classified using QSVM with fidelity-based quantum kernels optimized through hybrid train- ing with simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) optimizer. Evaluation under noiseless and depolarizing noise conditions demonstrates exceptional performance: 96.67% accuracy on BoT-IoT and 89.67% on IoT-23 datasets, surpassing quantum autoencoder approaches by over 7 percentage points.</description>

      <title>Formal Verification of Noisy Quantum Reinforcement Learning Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) aims to use quantum effects to create sequential decision-making policies that achieve tasks more effectively than their classical counterparts. However, QRL policies face uncertainty from quantum measurements and hardware noise, such as bit-flip, phase-flip, and depolarizing errors, which can lead to unsafe behavior. Existing work offers no systematic way to verify whether trained QRL policies meet safety requirements under specific noise conditions.
  We introduce QVerifier, a formal verification method that applies probabilistic model checking to analyze trained QRL policies with and without modeled quantum noise. QVerifier builds a complete model of the policy-environment interaction, incorporates quantum uncertainty directly into the transition probabilities, and then checks safety properties using the Storm model checker.
  Experiments across multiple QRL environments show that QVerifier precisely measures how different noise models influence safety, revealing both performance degradation and cases where noise can help. By enabling rigorous safety verification before deployment, QVerifier addresses a critical need: because access to quantum hardware is expensive, pre-deployment verification is essential for any safety-critical use of QRL. QVerifier targets a potential classical-quantum sweet spot: trained QRL policies that execute efficiently on quantum hardware, yet remain tractable for classical probabilistic model checking despite being too slow for real-time classical deployment.</description>

      <title>Learning Reduced Representations for Quantum Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data sets that are specified by a large number of features are currently outside the area of applicability for quantum machine learning algorithms. An immediate solution to this impasse is the application of dimensionality reduction methods before passing the data to the quantum algorithm. We investigate six conventional feature extraction algorithms and five autoencoder-based dimensionality reduction models to a particle physics data set with 67 features. The reduced representations generated by these models are then used to train a quantum support vector machine for solving a binary classification problem: whether a Higgs boson is produced in proton collisions at the LHC. We show that the autoencoder methods learn a better lower-dimensional representation of the data, with the method we design, the Sinkclass autoencoder, performing 40% better than the baseline. The methods developed here open up the applicability of quantum machine learning to a larger array of data sets. Moreover, we provide a recipe for effective dimensionality reduction in this context.</description>

      <title>Fixed Points in Quantum Metric Spaces: A Structural Advantage over Fuzzy Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an existence and uniqueness theorem for fixed points of contraction maps in the framework of quantum metric spaces, where distinguishability is defined by the $L^2$ norm: $d_Q(\psi_1,\psi_2) = \|\psi_1 - \psi_2\|$. The result applies to normalized real-valued Gaussian wavefunctions under continuous contractive evolution preserving the functional form. In contrast, while fuzzy metric spaces admit analogous fixed point theorems, they lack interference, phase sensitivity, and topological protection. This comparison reveals a deeper structural coherence in the quantum framework -- not merely technical superiority, but compatibility with the geometric richness of Hilbert space. Our work extends the critique of fuzzy logic into dynamical reasoning under intrinsic uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wigner function is a well-known phase space distribution function with many applications in quantum mechanics. In this article, we consider an open quantum system consisting of a non-relativistic single particle interacting with a general, possibly relativistic environment. For this system, we derive an expression for directly computing the time-dependent Wigner function from its initial values. This result renders time-dependent Wigner functions more applicable without having to make additional approximations that would otherwise be required in order to solve the corresponding equation of motion. As an illustration of our findings, we discuss the example of a non-relativistic single scalar particle interacting via a Yukawa interaction with an environment comprising another type of scalar field that is treated relativistically.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This PhD thesis explores the potential of quantum computing to address computational challenges in high-energy physics (HEP). As the Standard Model (SM) leaves key questions unanswered and no signs of new physics have emerged since the Higgs boson discovery, advanced experimental and computational tools become necessary. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative to classical methods, and this work investigates three main avenues where quantum algorithms can be useful in HEP research. First, we develop quantum subroutines for computing Minkowski distances and identifying maximum values in unsorted data, inserting them into clustering algorithms such as $k$-means, Affinity Propagation, and $k_T$-jet clustering. These quantum algorithms match classical performance while offering theoretical advantages when implemented on quantum hardware with qRAM. Then, we introduce a novel quantum Monte Carlo integrator, Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude Estimation (QFIAE), which combines a quantum neural network with amplitude estimation to integrate multivariate functions. QFIAE is executed on simulators and real quantum computers to evaluate Feynman loop integrals via Loop-Tree Duality, and is extended to compute (partially on hardware) a physical observable at NLO in perturbative quantum field theory. Finally, we present Quantum Chebyshev Probabilistic Models (QCPMs) for modeling multivariate distributions, applying them to fragmentation functions of partons fragmenting into kaons and pions. These models demonstrate accurate generative and interpolation capabilities. We also show how entanglement between variables plays a key role in training, enhancing model accuracy. Overall, these results show how quantum algorithms can already tackle relevant HEP problems on current hardware, while paving the way for future fault-tolerant applications that fully exploit quantum computational advantages.</description>

      <title>Resource Estimation for VQE on Small Molecules: Impact of Fermion Mappings and Hamiltonian Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate determination of ground-state energies for molecules remains a challenge in quantum chemistry and a cornerstone for progress in fields such as drug discovery and materials design. The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) represents a leading hybrid quantum-classical paradigm for addressing this challenge; however, its widespread realization is limited by noise and the restricted scalability of current quantum hardware. Achieving efficient simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices and forthcoming Fault-Tolerant Application-Scalable Quantum (FASQ) systems demands a detailed understanding of how computational resources scale with molecular complexity and fermion-to-qubit encoding schemes. In this study, resource requirements for VQE implementations employing the Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD) ansatz are systematically analyzed. The molecular Hamiltonian is formulated in second quantization and mapped to qubit operators through the Jordan-Wigner (JW), Bravyi-Kitaev (BK), and Parity (Pa) transformations. Hamiltonian reduction strategies, including $\mathbb{Z}_2$ tapering and frozen-core approximations, are examined to assess their effect on quantum resource scaling. The analysis reveals that appropriate transformations, when combined with symmetry-based reductions, can substantially reduce qubit counts by up to $\approx 50\%$ and quantum gate counts by up to $\approx 45\times$ for the representative set of molecular systems under study. This provides practical insights for executing chemically relevant simulations on NISQ and FASQ hardware.</description>

      <title>Robust hyperentanglement self testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperentanglement, which refers to entanglement encoded in two or more independent degrees of freedom (DOFs), is a valuable resource for the future high-capacity quantum network. Certifying hyperentanglement sources work as intended is critical for the hyperentanglement-based quantum information tasks. Self testing is the strongest certification method for quantum state and measurement under minimal assumptions, even without any knowledge of the devices' inner workings. However, the existing self testing protocols all focus on one-DOF entanglement, which cannot self test the multi-DOF entanglement. In the paper, we propose a hyperentanglement self testing framework. We take the self testing for the polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states as an example. The self testing is based on the violation of two-dimension CHSH test in each DOF independently. The two-step swap isometry circuits are proposed for self testing the entanglement in spatial-mode and polarization DOFs, respectively. All the sixteen polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states can be self tested. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework has three advantages. First, it is a general hyperentanglement self testing framework, and can be extended to self test multi-DOF hyperentanglement and multipartite hyperentanglement. Second, it can provide the robust hyperentanglement self testing and establish the relation between the lower bound of fidelity and the imperfect violation of Bell-like inequality in each DOF. Third, it is feasible with current experimental technology. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework provides a promising way to certify complex hyperentanglement sources, and has potential application in future high-capacity quantum network.</description>

      <title>Antibunching in locally driven dissipative Lieb lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Lieb lattices, geometric frustration and destructive interference of hopping cancels the occupation of certain sites, leading to flat-band physics. Here, we show numerically how, in the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard (DDBH) model arranged into Lieb lattices and related geometries, specific localised driving schemes can repurpose this interference to generate enhanced antibunching via a mechanism similar to the so-called unconventional photon blockade. Stochastic simulations using the positive-P method allow us to calculate occupations and second order correlations exactly for extended lattices. We use this to optimise the parameters for the possible observation of this effect in polariton micropillar experiments. This work demonstrates the possibility of using localised driving and interference effects to generate non-trivial quantum correlations in open quantum lattice systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the formal equivalence between the electromagnetic energy conservation law derived from Maxwell's equations in an optical microcavity and the conservation of a probability fluid associated with the de Broglie-Bohm theory for an effective massive particle describing a photon in this cavity. This work is part of a critical analysis of recent experiments [Nature \textbf{643}, 67-72 (2025)] carried out with a view to refuting the de Broglie-Bohm theory. Furthermore, the consequences of our analysis for microphotonics go far beyond these experiments. In particular, extensions that take into account photon spin and stochastic aspects associated with radiative or absorption losses are considered.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of a ferrimagnetic sphere resonator to an externally applied parametric excitation is experimentally studied. Measurement results are compared with predictions derived from a theoretical model, which is based on the hypothesis that disentanglement spontaneously occurs in quantum systems. According to this hypothesis, time evolution is governed by a modified master equation having an added nonlinear term that deterministically generates disentanglement. It is found that the disentanglement--based model is compatible with the experimental results. In particular, the model can qualitatively account for an experimentally observed instability in the system under study, which cannot be derived from any theoretical model that is based on a linear master equation.</description>

      <title>Folded optimal transport and its application to separable quantum optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce folded optimal transport, as a way of extending a cost or distance defined on the extreme boundary of a convex to the whole set, broadening the framework of standard optimal transport, found to be the particular case where the convex is a simplex. Relying on Choquet's theory and standard optimal transport, we introduce the so-called folded Kantorovitch cost and folded Wasserstein distance, and study the metric properties it provides to the convex. We then apply the construction to the quantum setting, and obtain an actual separable quantum Wasserstein distance on the set of density matrices from a distance on the set of pure states, closely related to the semi-distance of Beatty and Stilck-Fran\c{c}a [3], and of which we obtain a variety of properties. Folded optimal transport provides a unified setting for both classical and separable quantum optimal transport, and we also find that the semiclassical Golse-Paul [12] cost writes as a folded Kantorovitch cost.</description>

      <title>An introductory review of the theory of continuous-variable quantum key distribution: Fundamentals, protocols, and security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) has emerged as a promising approach for secure quantum communication, offering advantages such as high key generation rates, compatibility with standard telecommunication infrastructure, and potential for integration on photonic chips. This review provides an accessible introduction to the theory of CV-QKD, aimed at researchers entering this rapidly developing field. We focus on fundamental concepts, key protocols, and security analysis essential for understanding CV-QKD systems, with a special emphasis on prepare-and-measure protocols using coherent states under asymptotic security conditions. We explain their equivalence to entanglement-based protocols and detail the security proof framework against collective attacks, encompassing both Gaussian and discrete modulation schemes. We also briefly address more advanced topics, including measurement-device-independent CV-QKD and finite-size security analysis. This work is motivated by Brazil's growing investment in quantum communication technologies. By presenting a clear learning path from basic concepts to advanced topics, this work aims to equip newcomers with the essential tools to engage with current research in CV-QKD, thereby supporting the training of a new generation of researchers in this strategic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically levitated particles are used in a wide range of experiments to explore both fundamental physics and to act as sensors to a variety of external forces. One field of particular interest that these particles can be used to investigate is quantum mechanics. Previous research has yet to set an absolute upper bound on the size of objects that can be prepared in a quantum superposition. Exploring this limit involves allowing ever-larger objects to freely and coherently evolve to assess if their behaviour matches quantum or classical theoretical predictions. However, the long free evolution times required for these behaviours to be visible result in the experiments being gravitationally limited. Space based platforms therefore become the next key step in these investigations. In this white paper, we shall discuss our proposal for an optical levitation experiment in space that will explore the fundamental upper size limits of quantum mechanics. We shall cover the scientific motivation behind these investigations, then summarize the current status of our designs for the satellite. We will then review the aspects of the payload that require further development, then summarize the current estimates of the payload's requirements.</description>

      <title>Efficient Time Evolution of 2D Open-Quantum Lattice Models with Long-Range Interactions using Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating many-body open quantum systems is an extremely challenging problem, with methods often restricted to either models with nearest-neighbor interactions or semi-classical approximations. In particular, modeling two-dimensional systems with realistic long-range interactions, in addition to dissipation, is of vital importance to the development of modern quantum computing and simulation platforms. In this paper, we present a construction of the time-evolution operator, as a projected entangled pair operator (denoted tePEPO), that can be used to evolve a tensor network ansatz through time. Interactions beyond nearest-neighbor, including interactions between sites not collinear in the lattice, can be represented efficiently as a tePEPO. Furthermore, we obtain approximations to realistic radial long-range interactions decaying with a power-law, that give accurate results with small tePEPO bond dimension. Finally, we consider a physical example of a Rydberg atom Hamiltonian with long-range dipolar interactions, and show evidence of a dipole-dipole blockading effect in presence of dissipation. This work demonstrates the applicability of tensor networks to two-dimensional systems widely studied in experiments, but previously inaccessible to non-semi-classical methods.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum State Preparation via Data Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation (QSP) for a general $n$-qubit state requires $O(2^n)$ CNOT gates and circuit depth, making exact amplitude encoding (EAE) impractical for near-term quantum hardware. We introduce an ancilla-free hybrid classical-quantum strategy that reduces this cost to $O(poly(n))$ for a broad class of compressible data. The method first applies a classical compression step to obtain a $d$-sparse representation of the input, loads this sparse vector using a sparse-state preparation routine, and then reconstructs the target state through a polynomial-depth quantum inverse transform. We evaluate the framework on synthetic benchmark signals and real biomedical time series using Fourier and Haar transforms, demonstrating substantial reductions in CNOT counts and circuit depth compared to EAE, together with competitive performance relative to the Fourier Series Loader (FSL). The quantum simulation results show that combining classical data compression with quantum decompression provides a scalable framework for efficient QSP, reducing quantum overhead without requiring variational training or ancillary registers.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Distributed Quantum Computing Emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable quantum computing requires architectural solutions beyond monolithic processors. Distributed quantum computing (DQC) addresses this challenge by interconnecting smaller quantum nodes through quantum communication protocols, enabling collaborative computation. While several experimental and theoretical proposals for DQC exist, emulator platforms are essential tools for exploring their feasibility under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate DQC emulators using a distributed implementation of the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform ($\mathrm{QFT}^{\dagger}$) as a representative test case, which enables efficient phase recovery from pre-encoded Fourier states. The QFT is partitioned across nodes using teleportation-based protocols, and performance is analyzed in terms of execution time, memory usage, and fidelity with respect to a monolithic baseline.
  As part of this work, we review a broad range of emulators, identifying their capabilities and limitations for programming distributed quantum algorithms. Many platforms either lacked support for teleportation protocols or required complex workarounds. Consequently, we select and benchmark four representative emulators: Qiskit Aer, SquidASM, Interlin-q, and SQUANCH. They differ significantly in their support for discrete-event simulation, quantum networking, noise modeling, and parallel execution. Our results highlight the trade-offs between architectural fidelity and simulation scalability, providing a foundation for future emulator development and the validation of distributed quantum protocols. This framework can be extended to support additional algorithms and emulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification in quantum communication enables receivers to verify the presence of a message without decoding its entire content. While identification capacity has been explored for classical and finite-dimensional quantum channels, its behaviour in bosonic systems remains less understood. This work analyses identification over noisy bosonic broadcast channels using coherent states. We derive achievable identification rate regions while ensuring error probabilities remain bounded, even in an infinite-dimensional setting. Our approach leverages quantum hypothesis testing and approximates the infinite sender alphabet with discrete subsets to maintain power constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine a fluctuation-dissipation framework for quantum dynamical semigroups to resolve a long-standing ambiguity in Markovian master equations. For finite-dimensional systems, we prove that the underlying diffusion-dissipation structure - rooted in a classical Markov process analogy - is invariant under Lindblad generator symmetries. This invariance uniquely identifies the internal Hamiltonian. Our framework provides a universal principle for objectively distinguishing coherent from incoherent parts of the dynamics, enabling an unambiguous determination of a system's inherent energy structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the framework of quantum pushforward designs to the approximate setting, where averaging is achieved only up to finite precision. Using Schatten $p$-norms and Lipschitz continuity arguments, we derive bounds on the approximation parameters of pushforward designs obtained from complex projective spaces, including simplices, mixed states, and quantum channels. In the mixed-state case, we refine the bounds by exploiting the symmetric subspace structure, leading to asymptotically tighter estimates. Numerical simulations support our theoretical results, showing near-optimality in low-dimensional scenarios.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Reversible BCD Adder Architectures with Enhanced Speed and Reduced Quantum Cost for Next-Generation Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum and reversible paradigm merges the principles of quantum mechanics and reversible computation to enable information-preserving processing. It supports next-generation computing architectures that provide improved scalability and enhanced computational efficiency. Within these architectures, the decimal adder is a key arithmetic component, particularly for Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) operations widely used in financial and commercial systems. However, most reversible BCD adders focus primarily on quantum and reversible metrics, overlooking the critical influence of delay, which makes balanced optimization a significant challenge. This paper presents two reversible BCD adder designs optimized for both delay and quantum cost. One design integrates the decimal carry-skip technique to improve the overall delay. Using reversible logic gates, the proposed architectures efficiently perform BCD addition and implement the required correction logic while maintaining full reversibility. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed designs surpass existing reversible BCD adders, achieving best-case average improvements of 85.12% in delay and 30.75% in quantum cost. These advancements demonstrate the potential of the proposed adders for integration into future quantum-based arithmetic units and scalable reversible computing systems. Moreover, analysis of real banking transaction data underscores the practical importance of BCD addition and its widespread use in accurate and efficient monetary computations.</description>

      <title>Automated Compilation Including Dropouts: Tolerating Defective Components in Stabiliser Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utility-scale solid-state quantum devices will need to fabricate quantum devices at scale using imperfect processes. By introducing tolerance to fabrication defects into the design of the quantum devices, we can improve the yield of usable quantum chips and lower the cost of useful systems. Automated Compilation Including Dropouts (ACID) is a framework that works in the ancilla-free (or `middle-out') paradigm, to generate syndrome extraction circuits for general stabiliser codes in the presence of defective couplers or qubits. In the ancilla-free paradigm, we do not designate particular qubits as measurement ancillas, instead measuring stabilisers using any of the data qubits in their support. This approach leads to a great deal of flexibility in how syndrome extraction circuits can be implemented. ACID works by constructing and solving an optimisation problem within the ancilla-free paradigm to find a short syndrome extraction circuit. Applied to the surface code, ACID produces syndrome-extraction circuits of depth between $1\times$ (no overhead) and $1.5\times$ relative to the depth of defect-free circuits. The LUCI algorithm, the best prior art, yielded a $2 \times$ overhead, so ACID offers a significant time saving. The yield of surface code chips with a logical error rate at most $10\times$ the dropout-free baseline is up to $3\times$ higher using ACID than using LUCI. I demonstrate the broad applicability of ACID by compiling syndrome extraction circuits for bivariate bicycle codes and the colour code. For these circuits, we incur a circuit-depth overhead of between $1\times$ (no overhead) and $2.5\times$ relative to defect-free circuits. I believe this work is the first to simulate both of these families of codes in the presence of fabrication defects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic error cancellation is an attempt to reverse the effect of dissipative noise channels on quantum computers by applying unphysical channels after the execution of a quantum algorithm on noisy hardware. We investigate on general grounds the properties of such unphysical quantum channels by considering a random matrix ensemble modeling noisy quantum algorithms. We show that the complex spectra of denoiser channels inherit their structure from random Lindbladians. Additional structure imposed by the locality of noise channels of the quantum computer emerges in terms of a hierarchy of timescales.</description>

      <title>A List of Complexity Bounds for Property Testing by Quantum Sample-to-Query Lifting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sample-to-query lifting, a relation between quantum sample complexity and quantum query complexity presented in Wang and Zhang (SIAM J. Comput. 2025), was significantly strengthened by Tang, Wright, and Zhandry (2025) to the case of state-preparation oracles. In this paper, we compile a list of quantum lower and upper bounds for property testing that are obtained by quantum sample-to-query lifting. The problems of interest include testing properties of probability distributions and quantum states, such as entropy and closeness. This collection contains new results, as well as new proofs of known bounds. In total, we present 49 complexity bounds, where 41 are new and 18 are (near-)optimal.</description>

      <title>A Heptalemma for Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a seven-pronged no-go result for quantum mechanics: a "heptalemma". It shows that seven initially plausible theses about physical reality are jointly inconsistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics, while any six are jointly consistent. We must then decide which theses to retain and which to give up. Since different interpretations of quantum mechanics entail different responses to the heptalemma, we get a novel taxonomy of such interpretations. Beyond the application to quantum mechanics, the heptalemma offers a general diagnostic criterion for determining whether a given scientific domain should count as classical or not, and if not, how it departs from classicality.</description>

      <title>Parametric processes in nonlinear structures with reflections: an asymptotic-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of engineered quantum states of light via nonlinear processes is fundamental for quantum technologies based on photons. Although embedding nonlinear materials within resonant structures allows for the enhancement and tailoring of photon properties, accurately modeling these quantum interactions remains a challenge. In this work, we apply the asymptotic-fields formalism, an approach based on scattering theory, to describe nonlinear optical processes within a Fabry-P\'erot cavity. Unlike previous applications of this formalism, we explicitly account for reflections in the system. We derive the interaction Hamiltonian and calculate photon-pair generation rates using perturbation theory. The versatility of this model is illustrated through three examples: (i) spontaneous parametric down-conversion in an idealized cavity with flat-response mirrors; (ii) the generation of counter-propagating photon pairs in a periodically-poled material; and (iii) spontaneous four-wave mixing in a cavity built with Bragg reflectors.</description>

      <title>RapunSL: Untangling Quantum Computing with Separation, Linear Combination and Mixing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Separation Logic (QSL) has been proposed as an effective tool to improve the scalability of deductive reasoning for quantum programs. In QSL, separation is interpreted as disentanglement, and the frame rule brings a notion of entanglement-local specification (one that only talks about the qubits entangled with those acted upon by the program). In this paper, we identify two notions of locality unique to the quantum domain, and we construct a novel quantum separation logic, RapunSL, which is able to soundly reduce reasoning about superposition states to reasoning about pure states (basis-locality), and reasoning about mixed states arising from measurement to reasoning about pure states (outcome-locality). To do so, we introduce two connectives, linear combination and mixing, which together with separation provide a dramatic improvement in the scalability of reasoning, as we demonstrate on a series of challenging case studies.</description>

      <title>An algorithm for atom-centered lossy compression of the atomic orbital basis in density functional theory calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large atomic-orbital (AO) basis sets of at least triple and preferably quadruple-zeta (QZ) size are required to adequately converge Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT) calculations towards the complete basis set limit. However, incrementing the cardinal number by one nearly doubles the AO basis dimension, and the computational cost scales as the cube of the AO dimension, so this is very computationally demanding. In this work, we develop and test a natural atomic orbital (NAO) scheme in which the NAOs are obtained as eigenfunctions of atomic blocks of the density matrix in a one-center orthogonalized representation. The NAO representation enables one-center compression of the AO basis in a manner that is optimal for a given threshold, by discarding NAOs with occupation numbers below that threshold. Extensive tests using the Hartree-Fock functional suggest that a threshold of $10^{-5}$ can yield a compression factor (ratio of AO to compressed NAO dimension) between 2.5 and 4.5 for the QZ pc-3 basis. The errors in relative energies are typically less than 0.1 kcal/mol when the compressed basis is used instead of the uncompressed basis. Between 10 and 100 times smaller errors (i.e., usually less than 0.01 kcal/mol) can be obtained with a threshold $10^{-7}$, while the compression factor is typically between 2 and 2.5.</description>

      <title>An Operational Quantum Information Framework for Experimental Studies on Color Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the foundational axiomatization of the perceptual color space initiated by Schr\"odinger in 1920 and eventually refined by Resnikoff in 1974, Berthier, Provenzi and their collaborators have recently proposed a reformulation of perceptual color attributes within the framework of quantum information. Their work is based on the Jordan algebra formalism of quantum theories and, more specifically, on a quantum system described by a spin factor over the field of real numbers. This theoretical framework is not that of ordinary quantum mechanics, mainly because it requires dealing with rebits, whereas the latter uses qubits. The aim of this paper is to show that this difference in no way hinders the implementation of experimental protocols for testing the validity of the predictions of the color perception model. In particular, we show how to compute the quantum information based perceptual attributes of perceived colors in terms of qubit density matrices.</description>

Abstract: We are at the dawn of the second quantum revolution, where our ability to create and control individual quantum systems is poised to drive transformative advancements in basic science, computation, and everyday life. However, quantum theory has long been conceived as notoriously hard to learn, creating a significant barrier to workforce development, informed decision-making by stakeholders and policymakers, and broader public understanding.
  This paper is concerned with Quantum Picturalism, a novel visual mathematical language for quantum physics. Originally developed over two decades ago to explore the foundational structure of quantum theory, this rigorous diagrammatic framework has since been adopted in both academia and industry as a powerful tool for quantum computing research and software development. Here, we demonstrate its potential as a transformative educational methodology.
  We report the findings from a pilot study involving 54 UK high school students, randomly selected from a pool of 734 volunteers across the UK. Despite the absence of advanced mathematical prerequisites, these students demonstrated a strong conceptual grasp of key quantum principles and operations. On an assessment comprising university graduate-level exam questions, participants achieved an 82% pass rate, with 48% obtaining a distinction-level grade.
  These results pave the way for making quantum more inclusive, lowering traditional cognitive and demographic barriers to quantum learning. This approach has the potential to broaden participation in the field and provide a promising new entry point for stakeholders, future experts, and the general public.</description>

      <title>When the center matters: color screening and gluelumps in dihedral lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confinement is one of the hallmarks of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Yet, its first-principle characterization, even in simpler models, remains elusive. Through a combination of group-theoretical arguments and numerical analysis, we show that the physical consequences of confinement in a class of discrete non-Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs), the dihedral groups $D_N$, are intimately connected with the presence of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ central subgroup. When the center is trivial (for odd $N$), static charges are screened by a gluon cloud, forming composite objects known in SU$(N)$ gauge theories as gluelumps. This finding implies that string breaking can occur through fluctuations of the electric field only, without the need to nucleate particle--antiparticle pairs from the vacuum. Furthermore, numerical analysis hints at finite-range interactions between the gluelumps in the continuum limit.
  Our results showcase how the rich and intricate physics typically associated with QCD can emerge in much simpler discrete non-Abelian LGTs, making them ideal settings to test this phenomenology both in numerical calculations and in near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Searching for Ultralight Dark Matter with MOLeQuTE: a Massive Optically Levitated Quantum Tabletop Experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many well theoretically motivated models of ultralight dark matter are expected to give rise to feeble oscillatory forces on macroscopic objects. Optically trapped sensors have high force sensitivities but have remained relatively unexplored in this context. In this work we propose a new, tunable, optically trapped sensor specifically designed to detect such forces. Our design features a high-mass (mg) plate whose weight is supported by a vertical beam. We present the first systematic analysis and optimisation of quantum noises in optically trapped systems and show that our setup has the potential to operate at the standard quantum limit with current off-the-shelf technologies. We demonstrate that our sensor could offer unique access to large regions of uncharted parameter space of vector B-L dark matter, with projected sensitivities that could advance existing limits by several orders of magnitude over a broad range of frequencies.</description>

      <title>Band inversion transition in HgTe nanowire grown along the [001] direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low-energy effective Hamiltonian of a cylindrical HgTe nanowire grown along the [001] crystallographic direction is constructed by using the perturbation theory. Both the anisotropic term and the bulk inversion asymmetry term of the Kane model are taken into account. Although the anisotropic term has converted the crossing between the $E_{1}$ and $H_{1}$ subbands into an anticrossing at $k_{z}R\!=\!0$, the gap-closing-and-reopening transition in the subband structure can still occur at the wave vectors $k_{z}R\!\approx\!\pm0.24$ for critical nanowire radius $R\!\approx\!3.45$ nm. The bulk inversion asymmetry does not contribute to the low-energy effective Hamiltonian, i.e., there is no spin splitting in the $E_{1}$, $H_{1}$, and $H_{2}$ subbands for a [001] oriented cylindrical nanowire.</description>

      <title>Precise computation of universal corner entanglement entropy at 2+1 dimension: From Ising to Gaussian quantum critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing the subleading logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy (EE) of (2+1)d quantum many-body systems remains a significant challenge, despite its critical role in revealing universal information about quantum states and quantum critical points (QCPs). Capitalizing on recent algorithmic advances that enable the stable calculation of EE as an exponential observable, we develop a {\it bubble basis} projector quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm to precisely and efficiently compute the universal corner EE along a parameter trajectory connecting the Ising and Gaussian QCPs; where in the latter case there exists an analytic value to benchmark with. Our approach eliminates the dominant area-law term directly within the QMC sampling, thereby promoting the coveted subleading logarithmic term to the leading contribution. We apply this technique to calculate the EE in a (2+1)d square-lattice transverse-field Ising model augmented with a four-body interaction, tracing a path from the Ising to the Gaussian QCPs and then to the first-order transition. The consistent values obtained for the universal corner EE along the path validate the reliability and precision of our approach for extracting challenging entanglement properties. These results establish the long-sought connection between the universal values of an exactly solvable limit and those of a strongly correlated regime at (2+1)d.</description>

      <title>Resonant states and nuclear dynamics in solid-state systems: the case of silicon-hydrogen bond dissociation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bond breaking in the presence of highly energetic carriers is central to many important phenomena in physics and chemistry, including radiation damage, hot-carrier degradation, activation of dopant-hydrogen complexes in semiconductors, and photocatalysis. Describing these processes from first principles has remained an elusive goal. Here we introduce a comprehensive theoretical framework for the dissociation process, emphasizing the need for a non-adiabatic approach. We benchmark the results for the case of silicon-hydrogen bond dissocation, a primary process for hot-carrier degradation. Passivation of Si dangling bonds by hydrogen is vital in all Si devices because it eliminates electrically active mid-gap states; understanding the mechanism for dissociation of these bonds is therefore crucial for device technology. While the need for a non-adiabatic approach has been previously recognized, explicitly obtaining diabatic states for solid-state systems has been an outstanding challenge. We demonstrate how to obtain these states by applying a partitioning scheme to the Hamiltonian obtained from first-principles density functional theory. Our results demonstrate that bond dissociation can occur when electrons temporarily occupy the antibonding states, generating a highly repulsive excited-state potential that causes the hydrogen nuclear wavepacket to shift and propagate rapidly. Based on the Menzel-Gomer-Redhead (MGR) model, we show that after moving on this excited-state potential on femtosecond timescales, a portion of the nuclear wavepacket can continue to propagate even after the system relaxes back to the ground state, allowing us to determine the dissociation probability. Our results provide essential insights into the fundamental processes that drive carrier-induced bond breaking in general, and specifically elucidate hydrogen-related degradation in Si devices.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the detection and control of individual Abrikosov vortices in superconducting microwave resonators. $\lambda/4$ resonators with a narrowed region near the grounded end acting as a vortex trap were fabricated and studied using microwave transmission spectroscopy at millikelvin temperatures. Sharp stepwise drops in resonance frequency are detected as a function of increasing external magnetic field, attributed to the entry of individual Abrikosov vortices in the narrow region. This interpretation is confirmed by NV center magnetometry revealing discrete vortex entry events on increasing field. Our results establish a method to investigate and manipulate the states of Abrikosov vortices with microwaves.</description>

      <title>Braided QM and Majorana qubits at third root of unity: a color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebra framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebras graded by the abelian groups $Z_3^2$, $Z_2^p\times Z_3^2$ for $p=1,2,3$, and investigate the properties of their associated multi-particle quantum paraoscillators. In the Rittenberg-Wyler's color Lie (super)algebras framework the above abelian groups are the simplest ones which induce mixed brackets interpolating commutators and anticommutators. These mixed brackets allow to accommodate two types of parastatistics: one based on the permutation group (beyond bosons and fermions in any space dimension) and an anyonic parastatistics based on the braid group. In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.</description>

Abstract: We present an exact diagonalization study of the spectral form factor and the power spectrum for externally impressed rotating bosons in a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap interacting via repulsive Gaussian potential. Our focus is on the spectral correlations arising from the condensate depletion as a result of the formation of quantized vortices and the strong interaction, which leads to chaos in the system. We consider two distinct interaction regimes: moderate, where the interaction energy is small compared to the trap energy, and strong, where it is comparable. For the non-rotating case, the spectral form factor (SFF) in the moderate interaction regime exhibits a dip-plateau structure characteristic of integrable systems, while in the strong interaction regime it develops a weak ramp, signalling a transition to pseudo-integrable behavior. For the rotating single-vortex state, the SFF in the moderate interaction regime shows the onset of a weak ramp consistent with pseudo-integrability, whereas in the strong interaction regime the ramp becomes significantly more pronounced, indicating strongly chaotic behavior. For the multi-vortex states in the strong interacting regime, the SFF exhibits a clear dip-ramp-plateau structure, indicative of chaotic behavior. The corresponding power spectrum results further corroborate these findings: integrable system exhibits the characteristic $1/f^{\alpha}$ (with $\alpha \approx2$) noise, chaotic system shows the ubiquitous $1/f^{\alpha}$ (with $\alpha \approx 1$) noise, and pseudo-integrable system yields intermediate exponents with $1 &lt; \alpha &lt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum dynamics of Fermi--Hubbard systems using the Gaussian phase-space representation with diffusion gauges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Gaussian Phase-Space Representation to solve the real-time dynamic of interacting fermions in 1D, 2D, and 3D systems. The method is exact up to a spiking point, which represents a limit on the practical simulation time. The spiking can be delayed, and the practical simulation time extended, by adjusting the gauges of the representation, resulting in different equivalent stochastic differential equations. Here, we work on the so-called diffusion gauge and propose an algorithm to find efficiently new implementations of the noise terms. Compared with our initial results [F. Rousse \textit{et al.} 2024, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. \textbf{57}, 015303], the new method achieves a significantly longer practical simulation time and can be applied to significantly larger systems.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum algorithm for anion exchange across electrolyzer membrane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a variational quantum algorithm that solves the one-dimensional diffusion problem with a space-dependent diffusion constant $D(x)$. This problem is relevant for the exchange of hydroxide ions across a multi-layer membrane in an alkaline electrolyzer. We use $16$ to $64$ grid points across the membrane, resulting from $n=4$ to $6$ data qubits for the ideal quantum simulations that are based on the Qiskit software. For these qubit numbers, the depth of the parametric quantum circuit has been chosen to ensure sufficient expressibility. The state preparation requires particular attention since the diffusivity $D$ is piecewise constant in the different layers with discontinuities at the interface. Furthermore, we compare different classical optimization schemes with respect to their convergence in the VQA method. We demonstrate the applicability of the quantum algorithm to a problem with non-trivial boundary conditions and jump conditions of the diffusion constant and outline possible extensions of the proof-of-concept application case of quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Mn dopant in a III-V semiconductor produces a highly-entangled, coherent triplet ground state not fully captured by single-determinant theories of electron structure. We directly construct an analytic form for its ground-state wavefunction, finding surprising spin-charge correlations not revealed by semiclassical calculations. Spin-correlated circulating currents associated with the dopant yield remarkably large magnetic fringe fields of $\sim$1$\,\mu$T at distances of $\sim 10$~nm from Mn in GaAs, potentially detectable by NV-diamond magnetometry while the dopant spin coherently precesses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The determination of the quantum chromatic number of graphs has attracted considerable attention recently. However, there are few families of graphs whose quantum chromatic numbers are determined. A notable exception is the family of orthogonality graphs, whose quantum chromatic numbers are fully determined. In this paper, we extend these results by determining the exact quantum chromatic number of several subgraphs of the orthogonality graphs. Using the technique of combinatorial designs, we also determine the quantum chromatic number of the distance-2 Hamming graph, whose edges consist of binary vectors of Hamming distance 2, for infinitely many length.</description>

      <title>Inductive van der Waals Force between Two Quantum Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.</description>

      <title>Programmable Switching of Molecular Transitions via Plasmonic Toroidal Nanoantennae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to switch and program molecular transitions via deterministically located plasmonic nanoantennae presents opportunities for wide spectrum of applications from biosensors to quantum computing. Due to its topology, toroidal nanoantenna (TNA) focuses immense amount of three-dimensional (3D) local electric field by toroidal moment while allowing pre and post positioning around quantum emitters (QEs). Here, we report complete switching of molecular transition energies of quantum objects (QOs) with modulation depth of 99.9% over 2840-fold radiative enhancement. At optimized TNA geometries, Fano interference between the broadband plasmonic continuum and narrow quantum transitions of QOs suppresses both radiative and non-radiative decay channels near 850 nm, yielding an observable full switching that traps energy within the hybrid mode instead of re-emitting it. To show the promises of the concept, we further demonstrate systems with multiple QOs where spectral degeneracy enhances the transparency bandwidth, while detuning generates distinct minima, enabling individually addressable spectral responses. These results establish plasmonic TNA as a promising architecture for spectral detection of single or multi-molecule configurations with high sensitivity and empowers the user for the implementation of quantum mode switches to be used in photonic processing.</description>

      <title>Field-free diode effects in one-dimensional superconductor: a complex interplay between Fulde-Ferrell pairing and altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of nonreciprocal dissipationless supercurrents in one-dimension manifested through the superconducting diode effect (SDE) and the Josephson diode effect (JDE) in the absence of any external magnetic field, where inversion symmetry (IS) and time-reversal symmetry (TRS) can be intrinsically broken by spin-orbit coupling (SOC), and altermagnetism (AM), respectively. We investigate Ising and Rashba SOC separately in two models where two-component AM, assembled with crystallographic angle, can lead to qualitatively similar indirect band-gap closing and non-reciprocal supercurrent in a Fulde-Ferrell (FF) superconductor. Interestingly, in the absence of the above SOCs, SDE persists and the sign of efficiency can be altered by tuning the angle only. Parallel spin components with complementary momentum functions, ensuring the breaking of IS and TRS, can induce SDE in the presence of FF pairing. Continuing the analysis in the context of JDE, we explore the interplay between SOCs and AM with the p-wave and Fulde-Ferrell superconductivity in three different setups. The bulk bands contributes to the non-reciprocity in the case of p-wave superconductivity while JDE is dominated by Andreev bound states for FF superconductivity. Importantly, JDE continues to exist due to finite momentum Cooper pair even without AM and SOC unlike the p-wave superconductivity. The sign of JD efficiency can be tuned with angle for p-wave superconductivity while absence of such sign reversal is a hallmark signature of FF superconductivity. Similar to SDE, parallel spin components in conjunction with p-wave superconductivity can lead to JDE that can also be mediated by only FF pairing in the absence of SOC and AM.</description>

      <title>QuantumCanvas: A Multimodal Benchmark for Visual Learning of Atomic Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite rapid advances in molecular and materials machine learning, most models still lack physical transferability: they fit correlations across whole molecules or crystals rather than learning the quantum interactions between atomic pairs. Yet bonding, charge redistribution, orbital hybridization, and electronic coupling all emerge from these two-body interactions that define local quantum fields in many-body systems. We introduce QuantumCanvas, a large-scale multimodal benchmark that treats two-body quantum systems as foundational units of matter. The dataset spans 2,850 element-element pairs, each annotated with 18 electronic, thermodynamic, and geometric properties and paired with ten-channel image representations derived from l- and m-resolved orbital densities, angular field transforms, co-occupancy maps, and charge-density projections. These physically grounded images encode spatial, angular, and electrostatic symmetries without explicit coordinates, providing an interpretable visual modality for quantum learning. Benchmarking eight architectures across 18 targets, we report mean absolute errors of 0.201 eV on energy gap using GATv2, 0.265 eV on HOMO and 0.274 eV on LUMO using EGNN. For energy-related quantities, DimeNet attains 2.27 eV total-energy MAE and 0.132 eV repulsive-energy MAE, while a multimodal fusion model achieves a 2.15 eV Mermin free-energy MAE. Pretraining on QuantumCanvas further improves convergence stability and generalization when fine-tuned on larger datasets such as QM9, MD17, and CrysMTM. By unifying orbital physics with vision-based representation learning, QuantumCanvas provides a principled and interpretable basis for learning transferable quantum interactions through coupled visual and numerical modalities. Dataset and model implementations are available at https://github.com/KurbanIntelligenceLab/QuantumCanvas.</description>

Abstract: Cold-atom systems have emerged as a highly promising avenue for quantum-enhanced position, navigation, and timing applications. However, their wider adoption is currently hampered in part by the large footprint of the systems. In leveraging the miniaturisation possible through photonic integrated circuits, cold-atom sensors would be able to reach much wider commercial adoption. In this paper, we introduce a platform for evanescently trapping 87Rb using strip silicon nitride waveguides buried in silica using red- and blue-detuned fundamental and higher-order modes, providing a three-dimensional adjustable trap for BEC-based, chip-scale work in quantum science and technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dots can confine single electrons or holes to define spin qubits that can be operated with high fidelity. Experimental work has progressed from linear to two-dimensional arrays of quantum dots, enabling qubit interactions that are essential for quantum simulation and computation. Here, we explore architectures beyond planar geometries by constructing quantum dot arrays in three dimensions. We realize an eight-quantum dot system in a silicon-germanium heterostructure comprising two stacked germanium quantum wells, where quantum dots are positioned at the vertices of a cuboid. Using electrostatic gate control, we load a single hole into any of the eight quantum dots. To demonstrate the potential of multilayer quantum dot systems, we show coherent spin control and hopping-induced spin rotations by shuttling between the quantum wells. The ability to extend quantum dot arrays in three dimensions provides opportunities for novel quantum hardware and high-connectivity quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Continuity inequalities for sandwiched R\'enyi and Tsallis conditional entropies with application to the channel entropy continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the sandwiched R\'enyi entropy the conditional entropy can be defined two ways: $\widetilde{H}^\downarrow_\alpha(A|B)_\rho, \widetilde{H}^\uparrow_\alpha(A|B)_\rho$. In the limiting case, $\alpha=1$, both definitions consolidate into conditional entropy $H(A|B)=S(AB)-S(B)$. The continuity inequality for conditional entropy $H(A|B)$, called the Alicki-Fannes-Winter (AWF) inequality, shows that if the states are close in trace-distance, then the conditional entropies are also close. Having the AWF inequality for conditional entropy, we show that the channel entropy defined through the relative entropy is continuous with respect to the diamond-distance between channels. Inspired by this, similar continuity inequalities for the R\'enyi conditional entropy $\widetilde{H}^\uparrow_\alpha$ were obtained in the work [A. Marwah and F. Dupuis, J. Math. Phys. 63, 052201 (2022)]. We provide continuity bounds for the sandwiched R\'enyi and Tsallis conditional entropies $\widetilde{H}^\downarrow_\alpha(A|B)_\rho, \widetilde{T}^\downarrow_\alpha(A|B)_\rho$ for states with the same marginal on the conditioning system. Similar to the previous bounds, our bound depends only on the dimension of the conditioning system. We apply this result to prove continuity of the channel entropy for R\'enyi and Tsallis channel entropies defined through the sandwiched R\'enyi and Tsallis relative entropies.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Eigenstates of a Doped Hole in the Ising Antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of a mobile hole doped into an antiferromagnet Mott insulator is believed to underly the rich physics of several paradigmatic strongly correlated electron systems, ranging from heavy fermions to high-Tc superconductivity. Arguably the simplest incarnation of this problem corresponds to a doped Ising antiferromagnet, a problem widely considered essentially solved since almost 60 years by a popular yet approximate mapping to a single-particle problem on the Bethe lattice. Here we show that, despite its deceptive simplicity, the local spectrum of a single hole in a classical Ising-N\'eel state contains a series of anomalous, long-lived states that go beyond the well-known ladder-like spectrum with excited energies spaced as $J^{2/3} t^{1/3}$. The anomalous states we find through exact diagonalization and within the self-avoiding path approximation have excitation energies scaling approximately linear with $J$ and lead to a series of avoided crossings with the more pronounced ladder spectrum. By also computing different local, rotational spectra we explain the origin of the anomalous states as rooted in an approximate emergent local $C_3$ symmetry of the problem. From their direct spectral signatures we further conclude that these states lead to anomalously slow thermalization behavior -- hence representing a new type of quantum many-body scar state, potentially related to many-body scars predicted in lattice gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: We consider coherently-coupled bosonic mixtures scattering at low energies in the presence of an external confinement along either one or two directions. We exactly solve the two-body scattering problem, showing that for large Rabi coupling the confinement-induced resonance can be displaced towards scattering lengths values much smaller than the oscillator length. Our results make the observation of confinement-induced resonances more tunable and accessible, offering yet another handle for the efficient control of strong interactions in ultracold quantum gases.</description>

      <title>On-chip high-order parametric downconversion in the excitonic Mott insulator Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ for programmable multiphoton entangled states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spontaneous parametric downconversion (SPDC) and four-wave mixing in $\chi^{(2)}$ and $\chi^{(3)}$ media underpin most entangled-photon sources, but direct generation of higher-order entangled multiphoton states by $n$-th order parametric downconversion remains extremely challenging because conventional materials exhibit tiny high-order nonlinearities. Here we show that single-layer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, an excitonic Mott insulator on a breathing Kagome lattice, supports exceptionally large nonlinear susceptibilities up to seventh order. Many-body GW--Bethe--Salpeter and time-dependent BSE / Kadanoff--Baym simulations yield resonant $\chi^{(2)}$--$\chi^{(7)}$ for monolayer Nb$_3$Cl$_8$, with $|\chi^{(4)}|$ and $|\chi^{(5)}|$ surpassing values in prototypical transition metal dichalcogenides by 5--9 orders of magnitude. We trace this enhancement to flat bands and strongly bound Frenkel excitons with ferroelectrically aligned out-of-plane dipoles. Building on experimentally demonstrated 1$\times N$ integrated beam splitters with arbitrary power ratios, we propose an on-chip architecture where each output arm hosts an Nb$_3$Cl$_8$ patch, optionally gated by graphene to tune the complex $n$-photon amplitudes. Using the ab-initio $\chi^{(3)}$ and $\chi^{(4)}$ values, we predict that three-photon GHZ$_3$ and four-photon cluster-state sources in this platform can achieve $n$-photon generation rates up to $\sim 10^8$ and $\sim 10^6$ times larger, respectively, than silica-fiber- and MoS$_2$-based implementations with comparable geometry. We derive the quantum Hamiltonian and explicit $n$-photon generation rates for this platform, and show how suitable interferometric networks enable electrically and spectrally tunable GHZ, $W$, and cluster states based on genuine high-order nonlinear processes in a 2D excitonic Mott insulator.</description>

      <title>High-Sensitivity NV Ensemble Imaging via AOD-Based Raster Scanning and Photodetection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a technique based on an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond capable of imaging magnetic fields with high spatio-temporal resolution. A focused laser beam is raster-scanned using an acousto-optic deflector (AOD) and NV center fluorescence is read out with a single photodetector, enabling low-noise detection with high dynamic range. The method operates in a previously unexplored regime, quasi-continuous wave optically detected magnetic resonance (qCW-ODMR). In this regime, NV centers experience short optical pump pulses for spin readout and repolarization, analogous to pulsed ODMR technique, while the microwave field remains continuously on resonance with the spin transitions. We systematically characterize this regime and show that the spin response is governed by a tunable interplay between coherent evolution and relaxation, determined by the temporal spacing between pump laser pulses. Notably, the technique does not require precise microwave pulse control, thus simplifying experimental implementation. To demonstrate its capabilities, we image time-varying magnetic fields from a microelectrode in a conductive medium with sub-millisecond temporal resolution. This approach enables flexible spatial sampling and with our diamond achieves nT$\cdot$Hz$^{-1/2}$ per pixel sensitivity, making it well suited for detecting weak, dynamic magnetic fields in biological and other complex systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic approximate state conversion for entanglement and general quantum resource theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.12646v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum resource theories provide a mathematically rigorous way of understanding the nature of various quantum resources. An important problem in any quantum resource theory is to determine how quantum states can be converted into each other within the physical constraints of the theory. The standard approach to this problem is to study approximate or probabilistic transformations. Here, we investigate the intermediate regime, providing limits on both, the fidelity and the probability of state transformations. We derive limitations on the transformations, which are valid in all quantum resource theories, by providing bounds on the maximal transformation fidelity for a given transformation probability. As an application, we show that these bounds imply an upper bound on the asymptotic rates for various classes of states under probabilistic transformations. We also show that the deterministic version of the single copy bounds can be applied for drawing limitations on the manipulation of quantum channels, which goes beyond the previously known bounds of channel manipulations. Furthermore, we completely solve the question of stochastic-approximate state conversion via local operations and classical communication in the following two cases: (i) Both initial and target states are pure bipartite entangled states of arbitrary dimensions. (ii) The target state is a two-qubit entangled state and the initial state is a pure bipartite state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.04319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observe that the existence of sequential and parallel composition supermaps in higher order theories of transformations can be formalised using enriched category theory. Encouraged by relevant examples such as unitary supermaps and layers within higher order causal categories (HOCCs), we treat the modelling of higher order physical theories with enriched monoidal categories in analogy with the modelling of physical theories with monoidal categories. We use the enriched monoidal setting to construct a suitable definition of structure preserving map between higher order physical theories via the Grothendieck construction. We then show that the convenient feature of currying in higher order physical theories can be seen as a consequence of combining the primitive assumption of the existence of parallel and sequential composition supermaps with an additional feature of linking. We then use our definition of structure preserving map to show that categories containing infinite towers of enriched monoidal categories with full and faithful structure preserving maps between them inevitably lead to closed monoidal structures. The aim of the proposed definitions is to step towards providing a broad framework for the study and comparison of novel causal structures in quantum theory, and, more broadly, a paradigm of physical theory where static and dynamical features are treated in a unified way.</description>

Abstract: We study the advantages of quantum communication models over classical communication models that are equipped with a limited number of qubits of entanglement. In this direction, we give explicit partial functions on $n$ bits for which reducing the entanglement increases the classical communication complexity exponentially. Our separations are as follows. For every $k\ge 1$:
  $Q\|^*$ versus $R2^*$: We show that quantum simultaneous protocols with $\tilde{\Theta}(k^5 \log^3 n)$ qubits of entanglement can exponentially outperform two-way randomized protocols with $O(k)$ qubits of entanglement. This resolves an open problem from [Gav08] and improves the state-of-the-art separations between quantum simultaneous protocols with entanglement and two-way randomized protocols without entanglement [Gav19, GRT22].
  $R\|^*$ versus $Q\|^*$: We show that classical simultaneous protocols with $\tilde{\Theta}(k \log n)$ qubits of entanglement can exponentially outperform quantum simultaneous protocols with $O(k)$ qubits of entanglement, resolving an open question from [GKRW06, Gav19]. The best result prior to our work was a relational separation against protocols without entanglement [GKRW06].
  $R\|^*$ versus $R1^*$: We show that classical simultaneous protocols with $\tilde{\Theta}(k\log n)$ qubits of entanglement can exponentially outperform randomized one-way protocols with $O(k)$ qubits of entanglement. Prior to our work, only a relational separation was known [Gav08].
  Our techniques can also be used to show advantages of quantum communication models over hybrid classical-quantum models, i.e., models that have a large amount of both classical communication and quantum simultaneous communication.</description>

      <title>Expanding bipartite Bell inequalities for maximum multi-partite randomness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlocal tests on multi-partite quantum correlations form the basis of protocols that certify randomness in a device-independent (DI) way. Such correlations admit a rich structure, making the task of choosing an appropriate test difficult. For example, extremal Bell inequalities are tight witnesses of nonlocality, but achieving their maximum violation places constraints on the underlying quantum system, which can reduce the rate of randomness generation. As a result there is often a trade-off between maximum randomness and the amount of violation of a given Bell inequality. Here, we explore this trade-off for more than two parties. More precisely, we study the maximum amount of randomness that can be certified by correlations with a particular violation of the Mermin-Ardehali-Belinskii-Klyshko (MABK) inequality. For any even number of parties, we find that maximum randomness cannot occur beyond a threshold quantum violation, which increases with the number of parties, and we give a conjectured form of the maximum randomness in terms of the MABK value. We also show that maximum randomness can be obtained for any MABK violation for odd numbers of parties. To obtain our results, we derive new families of Bell inequalities certifying maximum randomness from a technique for randomness certification, which we call "expanding Bell inequalities". Our technique allows a bipartite Bell expression to be used as a seed, and transformed into a multi-partite Bell inequality tailored for randomness certification, showing how intuition learned in the bipartite case can find use in more complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Time-Efficient Quantum Entropy Estimator via Samplizer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09947v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropy is a measure of the randomness of a system. Estimating the entropy of a quantum state is a basic problem in quantum information. In this paper, we introduce a time-efficient quantum approach to estimating the von Neumann entropy $S(\rho)$ and R\'enyi entropy $S_\alpha(\rho)$ of an $N$-dimensional quantum state $\rho$, given access to independent samples of $\rho$. Specifically, we provide the following:
  1. A quantum estimator for $S(\rho)$ with time complexity $\tilde O(N^2)$, improving the prior best time complexity $\tilde O(N^6)$ by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020) and Bavarian, Mehraba, and Wright (2016).
  2. A quantum estimator for $S_\alpha(\rho)$ with time complexity $\tilde O(N^{4/\alpha-2})$ for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and $\tilde O(N^{4-2/\alpha})$ for $\alpha&gt;1$, improving the prior best time complexity $\tilde O(N^{6/\alpha})$ for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and $\tilde O(N^6)$ for $\alpha&gt;1$ by Acharya, Issa, Shende, and Wagner (2020), though at a cost of a slightly larger sample complexity.
  Moreover, these estimators are naturally extensible to the low-rank case. We also provide a sample lower bound for estimating $S_\alpha(\rho)$.
  Technically, our method is quite different from the previous ones that are based on weak Schur sampling and Young diagrams. At the heart of our construction, is a novel tool called samplizer, which can "samplize" a quantum query algorithm to a quantum algorithm with similar behavior using only samples of quantum states; this suggests a unified framework for estimating quantum entropies. Specifically, when a quantum oracle $U$ block-encodes a mixed quantum state $\rho$, any quantum query algorithm using $Q$ queries to $U$ can be samplized to a $\delta$-close (in the diamond norm) quantum algorithm using $\tilde\Theta(Q^2/\delta)$ samples of $\rho$. Moreover, this samplization is proven to be optimal, up to a polylogarithmic factor.</description>

Abstract: The QMA-completeness of the local Hamiltonian problem is a landmark result of the field of Hamiltonian complexity that studies the computational complexity of problems in quantum many-body physics. Since its proposal, substantial effort has been invested in better understanding the problem for physically motivated important families of Hamiltonians. In particular, the QMA-completeness of approximating the ground state energy of local Hamiltonians has been extended to the case where the Hamiltonians are geometrically local in one and two spatial dimensions. Among those physically motivated Hamiltonians, stoquastic Hamiltonians play a particularly crucial role, as they constitute the manifestly sign-free Hamiltonians in Monte Carlo approaches. Interestingly, for such Hamiltonians, the problem at hand becomes more ''classical'', being hard for the class MA (the randomized version of NP) and its complexity has tight connections with derandomization. In this work, we prove that both the two- and one-dimensional geometrically local analogues remain MA-hard with high enough qudit dimension. Moreover, we show that related problems are StoqMA-complete.</description>

Abstract: We describe and analyze a quantum thermometer based on a multilayered collisional model. We propose a qubit system whose architecture provides significant sensitivity even for short interaction times between the ancillae that compose the thermometer probe and the system to be probed. The assessment of the flow of information taking place within the layered thermometer and between system and thermometer reveals that the tuning of the mutual backflow of information has a positive influence on the precision of thermometry, and helps unveiling the information-theoretic mechanisms behind the working principles of the proposed architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a precise test of two fundamental gravitational constants using a detector concept that exploits the dynamics of quantum phononic excitations in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), operable at the scale of tabletop experiments. In this setup, the sensitivity is enhanced by approximately 2 orders of magnitude through the use of a tritter operation, which mixes phononic excitations with the BEC's ground state. The BEC exhibits unique sensitivity to the two key components of the gravitational potential in $\Lambda$-gravity: the Newtonian $GM/r$ term and the cosmological constant $\Lambda r^2$, both entering the most general function following from a Gurzadyan's theorem. Using state-of-the-art experimental design, we predict that the gravitational constant $G$ could be measured with an accuracy up to $10^{-17}$ N m$^2$/kg$^2$, representing an improvement by 2 orders of magnitude over current measurements. Moreover, this experiment aims to establish the best Earth-based upper limit on $\Lambda$ at $&lt;10^{-31}$ m$^{-2}$, marking the first laboratory-based probe of the cosmological constant. Additionally, the setup allows for the measurement of the distance-dependent behavior of each term in the gravitational potential, providing a means to test modified gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Non-Abelian Topological Order against Heralded Noise via Local Lindbladian Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important open question for the current generation of highly controllable quantum devices is understanding which phases can be realized as stable steady-states under local quantum dynamics. In this work, we show how robust steady-state phases with both Abelian and non-Abelian mixed-state topological order can be stabilized, in two spatial dimensions (2d), against generic ``heralded" noise using active dynamics that incorporate measurement and feedback, modeled as a \emph{fully local} Lindblad master equation. These topologically ordered steady states are two-way connected to pure topologically ordered ground states using local quantum channels, and preserve quantum information for a time that is exponentially large in the system size. Specifically, we present explicit constructions of families of local Lindbladians for both Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_2$) and non-Abelian ($D_4$) topological order whose steady-states host mixed-state topological order when the noise is below a threshold strength. As the noise strength is increased, these models exhibit first-order transitions to intermediate mixed state phases where they encode robust classical memories, followed by (first-order) transitions to a trivial steady state at high noise rates. When the noise is imperfectly heralded, steady-state order disappears but our active dynamics significantly enhances the lifetime of the encoded logical information. To carry out the numerical simulations for the non-Abelian $D_4$ case, we introduce a generalized stabilizer tableau formalism that permits efficient simulation of the non-Abelian Lindbladian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Short Path Algorithms: Towards Super-Quadratic Speedup over Markov Chain Search for Combinatorial Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze generalizations of quantum algorithms based on the short path framework first proposed by Hastings~[\textit{Quantum} 2, 78 (2018)], which has been extended and shown by Dalzell~et~al.~[STOC~'23] to achieve super-Grover speedups for certain binary optimization problems. We demonstrate that, under some commonly satisfied technical conditions, an appropriate generalization can achieve super-quadratic speedups not only over unstructured search but also over a classical optimization algorithm that searches for the optimum by drawing samples from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. We employ this framework to obtain algorithms for problems including variants of Max Bisection, Max Independent Set, and finding the ground states of the Antiferromagnetic Ising Model and the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model, whose runtimes are asymptotically faster than those obtainable with previous short path techniques. In certain cases, our algorithms achieve super-quadratic speedups compared to the best known classical algorithms with rigorously established runtimes.</description>

Abstract: Owing to its fundamental principles, quantum theory holds the promise to enhance the security of modern cryptography, from message encryption to anonymous communication, digital signatures, online banking, leader election, one-time passwords and delegated computation. While quantum key distribution (QKD) has already enabled secure key exchange over hundreds of kilometers, a myriad of other quantum-cryptographic primitives are being developed to secure future applications against quantum adversaries. This review surveys the theoretical and experimental developments in quantum cryptography beyond QKD over the decades, along with advances in secure quantum computation. It provides an intuitive classification of the main quantum primitives and their security levels, summarizes their possibilities and limits, and discusses their implementation with current photonic technology.</description>

Abstract: Effective Hamiltonian calculations for large quantum systems can be both analytically intractable and numerically expensive using standard techniques. In this manuscript, we present numerical techniques inspired by Nonperturbative Analytical Diagonalization (NPAD) and the Magnus expansion for the efficient calculation of effective Hamiltonians. While these tools are appropriate for a wide array of applications, we here demonstrate their utility for models that can be realized in circuit-QED settings. Our numerical techniques are available as an open-source Python package, ${\rm qCH_{eff}}$, which is available on GitHub (https://github.com/NVlabs/qCHeff) and PyPI (https://pypi.org/project/qcheff/). We use the CuPy library for GPU-acceleration and report up to 15x speedup on GPU over CPU for NPAD, and up to 42x speedup for the Magnus expansion (compared to QuTiP), for large system sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07653v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel theory that generalizes the concept of anyon statistics to Abelian topological excitations of any dimension. We axiomatize excitations as a selected collection of states and operators satisfying the configuration axiom and the locality axiom, purely based on many-body quantum mechanics. Upon these axioms, we define a rigorous and self-contained theory of statistics using only basic algebra and can be implemented on a computer. While our theory is developed independently, the results align with existing physical theories.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Quantum Metrology Singularity through Sequential Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The simultaneous estimation of multiple unknown parameters is the most general scenario in quantum sensing. Quantum multi-parameter estimation theory provides fundamental bounds on the achievable precision of simultaneous estimation. However, these bounds can become singular (no finite bound exists) in multi-parameter sensing due to parameter interdependencies, limited probe accessibility, and insufficient measurement outcomes. Here, we address the singularity issue in quantum sensing through a simple mechanism based on a sequential measurement strategy. This sensing scheme overcomes the singularity constraint and enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters with a local and fixed measurement throughout the sensing protocol. This is because sequential measurements, involving consecutive steps of local measurements followed by probe evolution, inherently produce correlated measurement data that grows exponentially with the number of sequential measurements. Finally, through two different examples, namely a strongly correlated probe and a light-matter system, we demonstrate how such singularities are reflected when inferring the unknown parameters through Bayesian estimation.</description>

      <title>Almost Optimal Synthesis of Reversible Function in Qudit Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum oracles are widely adopted in problems, like query oracle in Grover's algorithm, cipher in quantum cryptanalytic and data encoder in quantum machine learning. Notably, the bit-flip oracle, capable of flipping the state based on a given classical function, emerges as a fundamental component in the design and construction of quantum algorithms. Devising methods to optimally implement the bit-flip oracle essentially translates to the efficient synthesis of reversible functions. Prior research has primarily focused on the qubit model, leaving the higher dimensional systems, i.e. qudit model, largely unexplored. By allowing more than two computational bases, qudit model can fully utilize the multi-level nature of the underlying physical mechanism. We propose a method to synthesize even permutations in $A_{d^{n}}$ using $\Theta(d)$ $(n - 1)$-qudit sub-circuits, which achieve asymptotic optimality in the count of sub-circuits. Moreover, we introduce a technique for synthesizing reversible functions employing $O\left( n d^{n} \right)$ gates and only a single ancilla. This is asymptotically tight in terms of $d$ and asymptotically almost tight in terms of $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are remarkable spectral degeneracies in a non-Hermitian system's parameter space, where both eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce. Here, we show that in non-Hermitian molecular chiral systems the position of EPs in the parameter space is enantiomer-specific. First, we show that encircling the EP of one enantiomer drives robust topological population transfer in the chiral molecule while its mirror twin remains unaffected, offering a new route for selective chiral control. Second, we reveal how resonant excitation of EPs in chiral molecules can amplify weak chiral effects, offering an alternative approach to the enhancement of chiral interactions. Third, we demonstrate that a twisted chiral fiber immersed in a liquid solution of chiral molecules exhibits topologically different behavior depending on the solution's enantiomeric excess, offering a new approach to the detection of molecular chirality. Our results combine high enantiosensitivity with topological robustness in chiral discrimination and control, paving the way for new approaches in the exploration of non-Hermitian and chiral phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A unitary evolution in time may be treated as a curve in the manifold of the special unitary group. The length of such a curve can be related to the energetic cost of the associated computation, meaning a geodesic curve identifies an energetically optimal path. In this work, we employ sub-Riemannian geometry on the manifold of the unitary group to obtain optimally designed Hamiltonians for generating single-qubit gates in an environment with the presence of dephasing noise as well as a two-qubit gate under a time-constant crosstalk interaction. The resulting geodesic equation involves knowing the initial conditions of the parameters that cannot be obtained analytically. We then introduce a random sampling method combined with a minimization function and a cost function to find initial conditions that lead to optimal control fields. We also compare the optimized control fields obtained from the solutions of the geodesic equation with those extracted from the well-known Krotov method. Both approaches provide high fidelity values for the desired quantum gate implementation, but the geodesic method has the advantage of minimizing the required energy to execute the same task. These findings bring new insights for the design of more efficient fields in the arsenal of optimal control theory.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a cardinal algorithm in quantum computing that plays a crucial role in various applications, including cryptography, molecular simulation, and solving systems of linear equations. However, the standard implementation of QPE faces challenges related to time complexity and circuit depth, which limit its practicality for large-scale computations. We introduce LuGo, a novel framework designed to enhance the performance of QPE by reducing circuit duplication, as well as using parallelization techniques to achieve faster generation of the QPE circuit and gate reduction. We validate the effectiveness of our framework by generating quantum linear solver circuits, which require both QPE and inverse QPE, to solve linear systems of equations. LuGo achieves significant improvements in both computational efficiency and hardware requirements without compromising on accuracy. Compared to a standard QPE implementation, LuGo reduces time consumption to generate a circuit that solves a $2^6\times 2^6$ system matrix by a factor of $50.68$ and over $31\times$ reduction of quantum gates and circuit depth, with no fidelity loss on an ideal quantum simulator. We demonstrated the versatility and scalability of LuGo enabled HHL algorithm by simulating a canonical Hele-Shaw fluid problem using a quantum simulator. With these advantages, LuGo paves the way for more efficient implementations of QPE, enabling broader applications across several quantum computing domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum generative modeling is emerging as a powerful tool for advancing data analysis in high-energy physics, where complex multivariate distributions are common. However, efficiently learning and sampling these distributions remains challenging. We propose a quantum protocol for a bivariate probabilistic model based on shifted Chebyshev polynomials, trained as a circuit-based representation of two correlated variables, with sampling performed via quantum Chebyshev transforms. As a key application we study fragmentation functions (FFs) of charged pions and kaons from single-inclusive hadron production in electron-positron annihilation. We learn the joint distribution of momentum fraction $z$ and energy scale $Q$, and infer their correlations from the entanglement structure. Building on the generalization capabilities of the quantum model and extended register architecture, we perform fine-grid multivariate sampling for FF dataset augmentation. Our results highlight the growing potential of quantum generative modeling to advance data analysis and scientific discovery in high-energy physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum groups have been widely explored as a tool to encode possible nontrivial generalisations of reference frame transformations, relevant in quantum gravity. In quantum information, it was found that the reference frames can be associated to quantum particles, leading to quantum reference frames transformations. The connection between these two frameworks is still unexplored, but if clarified it will lead to a more profound understanding of symmetries in quantum mechanics and quantum gravity. Here, we establish a correspondence between quantum reference frame transformations and transformations generated by a quantum deformation of the Galilei group with commutative time, taken at first order in the quantum deformation parameter. This is found once the quantum group noncommutative transformation parameters are represented on the phase space of a quantum particle, and upon setting the quantum deformation parameter to be proportional to the inverse of the mass of the particle serving as the quantum reference frame. These results allow us to show that quantum reference frame transformations are physically relevant when the state of the quantum reference frame is in a quantum superposition of semiclassical states. We conjecture that the all-order quantum Galilei group describes quantum reference frame transformations between more general quantum states of the quantum reference frame.</description>

Abstract: Distinguishing quantum states with minimal sampling overhead is of fundamental importance to teach quantum data to an algorithm. Recently, the quantum Wasserstein distance emerged from the theory of quantum optimal transport as a promising tool in this context. Here we show on general grounds that the quantum Wasserstein distance between two ground states of a quantum critical system exhibits critical scaling. We demonstrate this explicitly using known closed analytical expressions for the magnetic correlations in the transverse field Ising model, to numerically extract the critical exponents for the distance close to the quantum critical point, confirming our analytical derivation. Our results have implications for learning of ground states of quantum critical phases of matter.</description>

Abstract: We describe our investigations involving the sonification of data from experiments involving various mesoscopic mechanical oscillator systems cooled to close to their quantum ground states, as well as the sonification of measured data from a single qubit subject to various unitary rotations designed to test the Leggett-Garg inequality. "Listening" to data via their resulting sonifications facilitates the discovery of signals that might otherwise be hard to detect in common graphic (i.e., visual) representations, and for the qubit experiment provides a complementary way to discern when the data violates macroscopic realism with some prior listening training. The resulting soundscapes and music also provide a complementary window into the quantum realm that is accessible to non-experts with open ears.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic, or nonstabilizerness, is a crucial quantum resource, yet its dynamics in open quantum systems remain largely unexplored. We investigate magic in the open XXZ spin chain under either boundary gain and loss, or bulk dephasing using the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy $M_2$. To enable scalable simulations of large systems, we develop a novel, highly efficient algorithm for computing $M_2$ within the matrix product states formalism while maintaining constant bond dimension--an advancement over existing methods. For boundary driving, we uncover universal scaling laws, $M_2(t) \sim t^{1/z}$, linked to the dynamical exponent $z$ for several distinct universality classes. We also disentangle classical and quantum contributions to magic by introducing a mean-field approximation for magic, thus emphasizing the prominent role of quantum critical fluctuations in nonstabilizerness. For bulk dephasing, dissipation can transiently enhance magic before suppressing it, and drive it to a nontrivial steady-state value. These findings position magic as a powerful diagnostic tool for probing universality and dynamics in open quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we develop a unified inferential framework for macroscopic states, that is, coarse descriptions of microscopic quantum systems that can be inferred from macroscopic measurements. Building on quantum statistical sufficiency and Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through equivalent abstract (algebraic) and explicit (constructive) formulations. Central to our approach is the notion of observational deficit, which quantifies the degree of irretrodictability of a state relative to a prior and a measurement. This leads to a general definition of macroscopic entropy as an inferentially grounded measure of asymmetry under Bayesian inversion. We formalize this structure in terms of inferential reference frames, defined by the pair consisting of a prior and a measurement, which encapsulate the observer's informational perspective. We then formulate a resource theory of microscopicity, treating macroscopic states as free states and introducing a hierarchy of microscopicity-non-generating operations. This theory unifies and extends existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, and asymmetry. Finally, we apply the framework to study quantum correlations under observational constraints, introducing the notion of observational discord and deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for their vanishing in terms of information recoverability. This work is dedicated to Professor Ryszard Horodecki on the occasion of his 80th birthday, in deep admiration and gratitude for his pioneering contributions to quantum information theory.</description>

Abstract: Memory effects in a quantum system coupled to an environment are one of the central features in the theory of open quantum systems. The dynamics of such quantum systems are typically governed by an equation of motion with a time-convolution integral of the memory kernel. However, solving such integro-differential equations is challenging, especially when the memory kernel is nonstationary (not time-translation invariant). In this paper, we analytically and nonperturbatively solve such integro-differential equations with a nonstationary memory kernel by employing a train of Dirac-delta switchings. We then apply this method to the damped Jaynes-Cummings model and the damped harmonic oscillator model to demonstrate that (i) our solution asymptotes to the well-known exact solution in the continuum limit, and that (ii) our method also enables us to visualize the memory effect in the environment.</description>

Abstract: Training of neural networks (NNs) has emerged as a major consumer of both computational and energy resources. Quantum computers were coined as a root to facilitate training, but no experimental evidence has been presented so far. Here we demonstrate that quantum annealing platforms, such as D-Wave, can enable fast and efficient training of classical NNs, which are then deployable on conventional hardware. From a physics perspective, NN training can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition: the system evolves from an initial spin glass state to a highly ordered, trained state. This process involves eliminating numerous undesired minima in its energy landscape. The advantage of annealing devices is their ability to rapidly find multiple deep states. We found that this quantum training achieves superior performance scaling compared to classical backpropagation methods, with a clearly higher scaling exponent (1.01 vs. 0.78). It may be further increased up to a factor of 2 with a fully coherent quantum platform using a variant of the Grover algorithm. Furthermore, we argue that even a modestly sized annealer can be beneficial to train a deep NN by being applied sequentially to a few layers at a time.</description>

      <title>Local Rydberg blockade regimes for disk graph embedding and quantum optimization</title>

Abstract: Rydberg atom arrays are a powerful platform for solving combinatorial optimization problems, owing to the Rydberg blockade mechanism, which imposes effective constraints on simultaneous atomic excitations. These constraints have enabled the encoding of the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem on unit disk graphs, where atoms interact within a fixed, globally defined blockade radius. However, this restriction limits the class of addressable problems. A natural extension is to consider disk graphs, which generalize unit disk graphs by allowing arbitrary disk radii and correspond to the intersection graphs of disks in the plane. Embedding such graphs in Rydberg systems requires moving beyond the standard, globally uniform blockade model. In this work, we introduce a local Rydberg blockade regime, which emerges when local drives are applied to different pairs of atoms involved in a potential interaction. We develop a general theoretical framework for this regime and propose two novel metrics, the correlation matrix and the maximum independence violation, to quantify the quality of the embedding. Using these metrics, we demonstrate that disk graphs can be meaningfully embedded into Rydberg atom arrays under local drive schemes, thereby expanding the landscape of quantum-addressable optimization problems. Finally, when evaluating approximate solutions of the MIS problem, characterized by near-optimal independent sets, local drive approaches exhibit significantly improved performance over global ones. These results highlight the practical advantage of local blockade engineering for approximate combinatorial optimization and open a path toward leveraging the analog capabilities of Rydberg platforms beyond conventional geometric constraints.</description>

      <title>Detectability of post-Newtonian classical and quantum gravity via quantum clock interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15014v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding physical phenomena at the intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity remains a major challenge in modern physics. While various experimental approaches have been proposed to probe quantum systems in curved spacetime, most focus on the Newtonian regime, leaving post-Newtonian effects such as frame dragging largely unexplored. In this study, we propose and theoretically analyze an experimental scheme to investigate how post-Newtonian gravity affects quantum systems. We consider two setups: (i) a quantum clock interferometry setup designed to detect the gravitational field of a rotating mass, and (ii) a scheme exploring whether such effects could be used to generate gravity-induced entanglement. Due to the symmetry of the configuration, the proposed setup is insensitive to Newtonian gravitational contributions but remains sensitive to the frame-dragging effect. Furthermore, our scheme allows for testing whether the observed gravity-induced entanglement is consistent with the quantum equivalence principle. While the predicted effects appear too small to detect with current technology, our scheme offers a starting point for future experiments probing post-Newtonian quantum gravitational effects.</description>

      <title>Efficient implementation of quantum signal processing via the adiabatic-impulse model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here we investigate analogy between quantum signal processing (QSP) and the adiabatic-impulse model (AIM) in order to implement the QSP algorithm with fast quantum logic gates. QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to perform a polynomial function transformation. AIM effectively describes the evolution of a two-level quantum system under strong external driving field. We can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$, frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg-Limited Quantum Hamiltonian Learning via Randomly Spread Product-States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21374v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how one can asymptotically reach the Heisenberg limit in quantum Hamiltonian learning without entanglement, globally coherent measurements, or dynamical control, using only local quantum operations. Our protocol uses ensemble-averaging over the outcomes of experiments initialized in Haar-random local product states, accompanied by random Pauli measurements, leading to the effective cancellation of interference terms so that a Heisenberg-limited regime emerges for short-time experiments. Furthermore, we show that the act of ensemble averaging makes unbiased estimation data, meaning all Hamiltonian parameters can be simultaneously estimated from the same data-set, removing the need for parameter isolation. We supplement the theoretical results by showing empirically that, even away from the asymptotic limit, one can surpass the SQL using randomly spread product-state ensembles. We do so numerically by learning a selection of different disordered multi-qubit Hamiltonians in a black-box learning scenario.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical microwave radiation from the parametric dynamical Casimir effect in the reversed-dissipation regime of circuit optomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an experimentally feasible optomechanical system (OMS) that is dispersively driven and operates in the reversed dissipation regime (RDR), where the mechanical damping rate far exceeds the cavity decay rate. We demonstrate that coherent, fast-time modulation of the driving laser frequency on time scales longer than the mechanical decoherence time allows for adiabatic elimination of the mechanical mode, resulting in strong parametric amplification of quantum vacuum fluctuations of the intracavity field. This mechanism, known as the parametric dynamical Casimir effect (parametric-DCE), leads to the generation of Casimir photons. In the dispersive RDR, we find that the total system Hamiltonian-including the DCE term-is intrinsically modified by a generalized optomechanical Kerr-type nonlinearity. This nonlinearity not only saturates the mean number of radiated Casimir photons on short time scales, even without dissipation, but also induces oscillatory behavior in their dynamics and quantum characteristics. Remarkably, the presence of the Kerr nonlinearity causes the generated DCE photons to exhibit nonclassical features, including simultaneous sub-Poissonian statistics and negative Wigner function, as well as quadrature squeezing, which can be controlled by adjusting the system parameters. Surprisingly, the controllable simultaneous nonclassical dynamics in the same physical parameter regime, which is induced by the optomechanical Kerr nonlinearity to the parametric DCE cannot occur in the standard DCE or Kerr-type systems. The proposed nonclassical microwave radiation source possesses the potential to be applied in quantum information processing, quantum computing as well as microwave quantum sensing.</description>

Abstract: Within the "complexity=anything" proposal of holography, the complexity growth rate (CGR) can exhibit jumps, interpreted as phase transitions. We demonstrate that the location and amplitude of these jumps are governed by the dynamics of bulk fields, which, via the fluid-gravity correspondence, map to the boundary energy-momentum tensor. The behavior of the CGR near these critical points exhibits scaling and universality. We show that the CGR satisfies a Callan-Symanzik-like equation near the transitions. We suggest that this enables enhanced computational efficiency by tuning the energy scale.</description>

      <title>From Rotations to Unitaries: Reversible Quantum Processes and the Emergence of the $SU(2)-SO(3)$ Homomorphism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an operational reconstruction of the well-known two-to-one homomorphism between the groups $SU(2)$ and $SO(3)$, grounded in the physical description of quantum state preparation and evolution. Starting from the connection between vectors in three-dimensional physical space and quantum states of two-level systems, we investigate how reversible transformations-modeled as completely positive and trace-preserving maps-give rise to a correspondence between spatial rotations and unitary operations. Our approach reveals how this group-theoretic structure naturally emerges from physical constraints, particularly the preservation of purity and reversibility in quantum processes. Beyond its theoretical relevance, the construction offers a pedagogically accessible framework for introducing core ideas in quantum mechanics and symmetry groups, making the abstract correspondence between $SU(2)$ and $SO(3)$ tangible through experimentally meaningful procedures.</description>

      <title>Time Symmetry, Retrocausality and the Emergent: Arrow of Time the Quantum Time-Symmetric Interpretation (QTSI)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microscopic quantum laws are time-symmetric: nothing in the Schr\"odinger equation or its relativistic extensions distinguishes future from past. Yet measurements produce irreversible records, an apparently one-way causal flow, and the familiar notion that causes precede effects. Within the Quantum Time-Symmetric Interpretation (QTSI), this asymmetry is not fundamental but emergent. Isolated quantum systems are described by a two-component temporal state containing forward- and backward-propagating amplitudes. Their mixing, governed by a parameter $\Delta(\phi)$, defines a retrocausal coherence time $\tau_{RC}(\phi)$ beyond which advanced components are suppressed. As the system couples to amplifying environments characterized by a macroscopic parameter $\phi$, $\Delta(\phi)$ decreases and the backward component is dynamically eliminated, giving rise to classical causality and effective collapse. QTSI aligns naturally with time-symmetric approaches from Wheeler--Feynman, Aharonov, and Price, agrees with all weak-measurement and quantum eraser results in their operational regimes, and predicts specific signatures in temporal echoes and chaotic cavities. Detailed formal and experimental developments appear in the Supplementary Addenda.</description>

      <title>Classical algorithms for measurement-adaptive Gaussian circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian building blocks are essential for photonic quantum information processing, and universality can be practically achieved by equipping Gaussian circuits with adaptive measurement and feedforward. The number of adaptive steps then provides a natural parameter for computational power. Rather than assessing power only through sampling problems -- the usual benchmark -- we follow the ongoing shift toward tasks of practical relevance and study the quantum mean-value problem, i.e., estimating observable expectation values that underpin simulation and variational algorithms. More specifically, we analyze bosonic circuits with adaptivity and prove that when the number of adaptive measurements is small, the mean-value problem admits efficient classical algorithms even if a large amount of non-Gaussian resources are present in the input state, whereas less constrained regimes are computationally hard. This yields a task-level contrast with sampling, where non-Gaussian ingredients alone often induce hardness, and provides a clean complexity boundary parameterized by the number of adaptive measurement-and-feedforward steps between classical simulability and quantum advantage. Beyond the main result, we introduce classical techniques -- including a generalization of Gurvits' second algorithm to arbitrary product inputs and Gaussian circuits -- for computing the marginal quantities needed by our estimators, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Geometric Discord of any arbitrary dimensional bipartite system and its application in quantum key distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04927v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entangled quantum states are regarded as a key resource in quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols. However, quantum correlations, other than entanglement can also play a significant role the QKD protocols. In this work, we will focus on one such measure of quantum correlation, known as geometric quantum discord (GQD). Firstly, we derive an analytical expression of GQD for two-qutrit quantum systems and further generalize it for $d_1\otimes d_2$ dimensional systems. Next, we apply the concept of GQD in studying QKD. In particular, we derive the lower bound for a distillable secret key rate $K_D$ in terms of GQD when two communicating parties uses private states for generating a secret key in the presence of an eavesdropper. The lower bound of $K_D$ depends upon the GQD of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$, where $\sigma_i$'s, $i=0,1,2,3$ are the density matrices. We find that for a certain range of GQD, the successful generation of the secret key is not guaranteed. We further study the behavior of distillable key rate when the geometric discord of $\frac{\sigma_0+\sigma_1}{2}$ and $\frac{\sigma_2+\sigma_3}{2}$ increases, decreases or remains constant, with the help of a few examples. Moreover, we find that even when $\sigma_i$'s are separable or positive partial transpose entangled states, the distillable key can still be generated.</description>

      <title>Formalizing contextuality in sequential scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides a framework for characterizing sequential scenarios, allowing for the identification of contextuality given empirical data, and then provides precise operational interpretations in terms of the possible hidden variable model explanations. Sequential scenarios are different in essence from non-local scenarios as each instrument is allowed to change the state as it enters subsequent instruments. Thus, it is necessary to formulate the possible state update in any hidden variable model description. Here we develop such hidden variable models for sequential scenarios, and we develop on the notion of no-disturbance: an instrument $A$ does not disturb another instrument $B$ if the statistics of $B$ are independent of whether $A$ was measured or not. We define non-contextuality inequalities for the sequential scenario, and show that violation implies that the data cannot be explained by a hidden variable model that is both deterministic and not disturbing in this sense. We further provide a translation from standard contextuality frameworks to ours, providing sequential versions which carry over the same inequalities and measures of contextuality, but now with the sequential interpretations stated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classification of medical images plays a vital role in medical image analysis; however, it remains challenging due to the limited availability of labeled data, class imbalances, and the complexity of medical patterns. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural Network (HQCNN) for both binary and multi-class classification. The architecture of HQCNN integrates a five-layer classical convolutional backbone with a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit that incorporates quantum state encoding, superpositional entanglement, and a Fourier-inspired quantum attention mechanism. We evaluate the model on six MedMNIST v2 benchmark datasets. The HQCNN consistently outperforms classical and quantum baselines, achieving up to 99.91% accuracy and 100.00% AUC on PathMNIST (binary) and 99.95% accuracy on OrganAMNIST (multi-class) with strong robustness on noisy datasets like BreastMNIST (87.18% accuracy). The model demonstrates superior generalization capability and computational efficiency, accomplished with significantly fewer trainable parameters, making it suitable for data-scarce scenarios. Our findings provide strong empirical evidence that hybrid quantum-classical models can advance medical imaging tasks.</description>

      <title>Advantage of utilizing nonlocal magic resource in Haar-random circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic resources and entanglement are fundamental components for achieving the universal quantum computation, so is the interplay between them. Herein, we uncover an intrinsic scaling law of the magic resource and bond dimension of matrix product states in Haar-random quantum circuits, that is, the magic resource is converged on a bond dimension in logarithmic scale with the system size. From a practical perspective, this finding substantially enhances the classical simulability of nonstabilizerness. It also allows us to utilize the bond dimension as a bridge to link the entanglement and the nonlocal magic resource, which extends the capacity perspective that the entanglement plays the role of container for the nonlocal magic resource. Furthermore, the intrinsic scaling enables an information separation between the nonlocal magic resource and the extra entanglement. This, in turn, leads to the conclusion that, any dynamical relation between magic and entanglement resources is ruled out. In other words, it is inappropriate to regard the entanglement as the driving force of the growth and spreading of nonlocal magic resource.</description>

      <title>Analytic and Stochastic Approach to Quantum Advantages in Ground State and Quantum State Preparation Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problems of state preparation, ground state preparation and quantum state preparation. We propose an analytic approach to a stochastic quantum algorithm which prepares the ground state for $n$-qubit Hamiltonian that is represented by $\text{poly}(n)$ Pauli operators and has an inverse-polynomial gap, requiring only $\text{poly}(n)$ Pauli rotations, measurements, and classical time complexity when $n$ exceeds a threshold, to inverse-polynomial precision given the initial overlap being lower bounded by $\frac{1}{2^n}$. Extending this result, we prove that any $n$-qubit quantum state can be prepared in two regimes: (1) with a constant number of Pauli rotations to constant precision, or (2) with a polynomial number of rotations to inverse-polynomial precision. Our results improve over previous approaches to quantum state preparation in terms of gate complexity, thereby yielding quantum space advantage. As an application, we identify a practical condition under which quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems can be solved with exponential quantum speedups.</description>

      <title>Completeness for Fault Equivalence of Clifford ZX Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two circuits are considered to be equivalent under noise if the effect of faults on one circuit is no worse than the effect of faults on the other circuit. We call this relationship fault equivalence. Fault equivalence offers a way to transform circuits while provably preserving their fault-tolerant properties, enabling a framework for fault-tolerant circuit synthesis and optimisation that is correct by construction. The ZX calculus, a set of graphical rewrite rules for quantum computations, provides a useful tool for manipulating circuits while preserving fault equivalence. For this, the usual set of ZX rewrites has to be restricted to not only preserve the underlying linear map represented by the diagram but also fault equivalence.
  In this work, we provide a set of ZX rewrites that are sound and complete for fault equivalence of Clifford ZX diagrams. This means that any equivalence that can be derived using the proposed rules is certain to be correct, and any correct equivalence can be derived using only these rules. For this, we utilise diagrammatic constructions called fault gadgets to reason about arbitrary, possibly correlated Pauli faults in ZX diagrams. Fault gadgets allow us to separate the diagram into a fault-free part, which captures the noise-free behaviour of a diagram, and a noisy part that enumerates the effects of all possible faults. Using this, we provide a unique normal form for ZX diagrams under noise and show that any diagram can be brought into this normal form using our proposed rule set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the minimal query complexity for preparing $f(H)\ket{\psi_0}$ is exactly the optimal polynomial approximation degree of $f$ in $L^2(\mu)$, where $\mu$ is the spectral measure of $(H,\ket{\psi_0})$. This state-aware perspective refines the worst-case bounds, unifies Krylov/Favard approximation with quantum queries, and explains how state-dependent spectral structure can yield substantial savings over uniform designs.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Repeater Chains with Semiconductor Quantum Dots and Group-IV-Vacancy Color Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a hybrid quantum repeater architecture that combines two leading hardware platforms: quantum dots (QDs) as bright, deterministic sources of entangled photon pairs and group-IV-vacancy centers in diamond as efficient, heralded quantum memories. This combination leverages high-rate entanglement generation together with long-lived storage, enabling scalable entanglement distribution over long distances. A key challenge is the large bandwidth mismatch between QD photons and the narrow optical transitions of the memories. We combine a comprehensive model of the spin-photon interface, including full spin-photon coupling dynamics, and explore mitigation strategies such as frequency filtering and optimized magnetic-field orientation. Our results show that with optimized designs, photon-to-memory transfer can be achieved with high efficiency and fidelity, supporting the feasibility of such hybrid systems. Finally, we analyze a full repeater chain using experimentally achievable parameters and find that a network with thousands of memories across several repeater nodes could achieve a secret-key rate of 500 bit/s over 1,000 km, demonstrating the strong potential of this approach for next-generation quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Information phases of partial projected ensembles generated from random quantum states and scrambling dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The projected ensemble -- an ensemble of pure states on a subsystem conditioned on projective measurement outcomes on its complement -- provides a finer probe of ergodicity and information structure than the reduced density matrix of the subsystem in bipartite quantum states. This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. We contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures. Finally, we show that these information phases, as characterised by the Holevo information, emerge in the dynamics of chaotic quantum circuits and discuss the associated timescales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-lived storage of single photons is a fundamental requirement for enabling quantum communication and foundational tests of quantum physics over extended distances. While the implementation of a global-scale quantum network requires quantum storage times on the order of seconds to minutes, existing photonic quantum memories have so far been limited to subsecond lifetimes. Although $^{151}$Eu$^{3+}$:Y$_2$SiO$_5$ crystals exhibit substantially extended spin coherence times at the `magic' magnetic field, the concomitant weak optical absorption has until now prevented single-photon storage. Here, we overcome this challenge by integrating a noiseless photon echo protocol--which makes full use of the crystal's natural absorption for photonic storage--with a universally robust dynamical decoupling sequence incorporating adiabatic pulses to efficiently protect delocalized spin-wave excitation, enabling long-lived quantum storage at the `magic' magnetic field. At a storage time of 5.6 s, we achieve a time-bin qubit storage fidelity of 88.0 $\pm$ 2.1%, surpassing the maximum fidelity attainable via classical strategies. Our device reaches a $1/e$ storage lifetime of 27.6 $\pm$ 0.5 s, enabling single-photon-level storage for 42 s with a signal-to-noise ratio greater than unity. This work establishes photonic quantum memory in the minute-scale regime, laying a solid foundation for global-scale quantum network and deep-space quantum experiments.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Non-classical Properties of Entangled Coherent States via Post-Selected von Neumann Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14079v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present study systematically investigates the modulation mechanism of post-selected weak measurement (WM) on the non-classical properties of entangled coherent states (ECSs). The primary goal is achieving controllable enhancement of quantum resources such as entanglement and squeezing, while minimising disturbance to the quantum state. We theoretically analyze the post-selected weak measurement process, and its effectiveness in amplifying the non-classical features of ECSs. The von Neumann measurement model is employed to analytically describe the weak-value amplification of the pointer state. It is demonstrated that a significant enhancement of squeezing can be achieved by tuning the measurement coupling strength. The joint Wigner function analysis in phase space further reveals that, as the coupling strength increases, the coherent structure of the state evolves from symmetric double peaks to multi-branch quantum interference fringes. The entanglement, quantified by the Hillery-Zubairy criterion, exhibits a pronounced increase with stronger coupling, while the quantum Fisher information indicates a systematic improvement in phase estimation precision. The results obtained establish a tunable weak measurement framework for precise manipulation of continuous-variable entangled states. This provides a feasible theoretical pathway for enhancing quantum metrology and measurement-based state engineering.</description>

      <title>Kernelized Decoded Quantum Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) promises superpolynomial speedups for structured optimization; however, its practical realization is often hindered by significant sensitivity to hardware noise and spectral dispersion. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Kernelized Decoded Quantum Interferometry (k-DQI)}, a unified framework that integrates spectral engineering directly into the quantum circuit architecture. By inserting a unitary kernel prior to the interference step, k-DQI actively reshapes the problem's energy landscape, concentrating the solution mass into a ``decoder-friendly'' low-frequency head. We formalize this advantage through a novel robustness metric, the noise-weighted head mass $\Sigma_K$, and prove a \textbf{Monotonic Improvement Theorem}, which establishes that maximizing $\Sigma_K$ guarantees higher decoding success rates under local depolarizing noise. We substantiate these theoretical gains in Optimal Polynomial Interpolation (OPI) and LDPC-like problems, demonstrating that kernel tuning functions as a ``spectral lens'' to recover signal otherwise lost to isotropic noise. Crucially, we provide explicit, efficient circuit realizations using Chirp and Linear Canonical Transform (LCT) kernels that achieve significant boosts in effective signal-to-noise ratio with negligible depth overhead ($\tilde{O}(n)$ to $\tilde{O}(n^2)$). Collectively, these results reframe DQI from a static algorithm into a tunable, noise-aware protocol suited for near-term error-corrected environments.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Framework for Constructing Lie-Algebra Generator Pools: Application to Variational Quantum Eigensolvers for Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lie Algebras are powerful mathematical structures used in physics to describe sets of operators and associated combinations. A central task is to identify a minimal set of generators from which the algebra can be constructed. The classical search for such generators has so far relied on greedy construction steps applied to an exponentially growing number of candidate operators, making it rapidly computationally intractable. We propose a general, polynomial-scaling and optimal strategy, based on Lie-Algebraic basic properties, to overcome this bottleneck. It allows for the efficient construction of these generators, also known as Minimal Complete Pools (MCPs), for a target Lie Algebra. As an immediate application, efficiently constructing user-defined MCPs that respect fermionic algebra is crucial in the context of adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver for quantum chemistry. Thus, we introduce MB-ADAPT-VQE, which incorporates optimally constructed MCPs into batched ADAPT-VQE to reduce quantum resources and improve convergence under strong correlation. These MCPs also unlock fixed-ansatz methods based on a Lie-algebraic structure such as the gradient-free NI-DUCC-VQE, enabling simulations surpassing prior MCP limits. The presented mathematical framework is general and applicable well beyond chemistry in fields including quantum error correction, quantum control, quantum machine learning, and more universally wherever compact Pauli basis are required.</description>

      <title>Spectral analysis of the Koopman operator recovers Hamiltonian parameters in open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate identification of Hamiltonian parameters is essential for modeling and controlling open quantum systems. In this work, we demonstrate that the multichannel Hankel alternative view of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm is a robust and reliable spectral data-driven method for retrieving Hamiltonian parameters from the evolution of first-moment observables in open quantum systems. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain these parameters, which are computed using the mHAVOK algorithm; a theoretical connection to this affirmation is presented. The method is tested on noiseless quadratures of an open two-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator and shown to retrieve oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, the qubit-photon coupling strength of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and the modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5\% of their actual values. Compared with Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation. Overall, these findings suggest that Koopman operator theory provides a practical framework for studying quantum dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.12951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of operator systems and $k$-AOU spaces generated by a finite number of projections satisfying a set of linear relations. This family is universal in the sense that the map sending the generating projections to any other set of projections which satisfy the same relations is completely positive. These operator systems are constructed as inductive limits of explicitly defined operator systems. By choosing the linear relations to be the nonsignalling relations from quantum correlation theory, we obtain a hierarchy of ordered vector spaces dual to the hierarchy of quantum correlation sets. By considering another set of relations, we also find a new necessary condition for the existence of a SIC-POVM.</description>

      <title>Structural Conditions for Quadratic Degradability in Symmetric Quantum Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16312v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the role of symmetry in determining the low-noise behavior of high-dimensional quantum channels, with a focus on the modified Landau--Streater (MLS) family derived from spin-$j$ representations of $SU(2)$. We show that these channels exhibit a quadratic scaling of the approximate degradability parameter, $\eta = O(p^2)$, for every dimension $d=2j+1$, using an explicit degrading map whose structure is dictated by the $SU(2)$ Casimir operator. We further identify two algebraic features underlying this behavior: the tracelessness of the noise operators, which enforces a geometric orthogonality between signal and noise components, and an eigen-invariance property that preserves this structure under the channel action. These observations lead to a general sufficient condition under which a channel displays quadratic suppression of non-degradability, placing the MLS and generalized Pauli channels within a common analytical framework. Overall, the results clarify why certain symmetric noise models admit tighter low-noise capacity estimates and suggest a structural perspective for analyzing approximate degradability in higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Error-correcting codes for quantum computing are crucial to address the fundamental problem of communication in the presence of noise and imperfections. Audoux used Khovanov homology to define families of quantum error-correcting codes with desirable properties. We explore Khovanov homology and some of its many extensions, namely reduced, annular, and $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ homology, to generate new families of quantum codes and to establish several properties about codes that arise in this way, such as behavior of distance under Reidemeister moves or connected sums.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for relating the transition rate of an accelerated Unruh-deWitt detector to the rate of the same detector when stationary in Minkowski space. Furthermore, we show that when using the detector as a model for decay, its transition rate can be related directly to the decay rate obtained from QFT. Combined this provides a straightforward method for calculating the decay rate of accelerated particles to first order in the coupling constants.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of transient two-dimensional surfaces where a random-walking particle escapes to infinity in contrast to localization in standard flat 2D space. We first prove that any rotationally symmetric 2D membrane embedded in flat 3D space cannot be transient. Then we formulate a criterion for the transience of a general asymmetric 2D membrane. We use it to explicitly construct a class of transient 2D manifolds with a non-trivial metric and height function but ``zero average curvature,'' which we dub tablecloth manifolds. The absence of the logarithmic infrared divergence of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in turn implies the absence of weak localization, non-existence of bound states in shallow potentials, and breakdown of the Mermin-Wagner theorem and Kosterlitz-Thouless transition on the tablecloth manifolds, which may be realizable in both quantum simulators and corrugated two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04116v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work analyses the extent to which the "blurred orbits" of the current model for the atom, drafted by Heisenberg in 1926, fits the image of a bunch of wandering electrons around a nucleus. We will deal with early appearances of the concept of indistinguishable particles within the frame of quantum mechanics. There are few studies on the use of this concept in Heisenberg's 1926 papers on helium, in contrast with the large number of them on its use in Bose--Einstein's 1924 papers. We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's approach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will also study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months later. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are common explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an image is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the dynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of indistinguishability in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Tricritical Kibble-Zurek scaling in Rydberg atom ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12979v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism has been extensively studied in various second-order phase transitions, yet the case of tricriticality-the point where second-order phase transition lines terminate-remains experimentally elusive. Here, we theoretically propose probing KZ scaling at tricritical points using Rydberg atom arrays arranged as two- and three-leg ladders, which realize the tricritical Ising and tricritical Potts universality classes. By slowly ramping the Rabi frequency and detuning, we extract two relevant tricritical exponents, $\nu$ and $\nu'$, both via conventional paths from the disordered to the ordered phase and via "tangential" paths confined entirely within the disordered phase. At faster speeds, ramping dynamics go beyond the standard KZ paradigm: data collapse analysis using the parent critical exponents (rather than the tricritical ones) reveals renormalization group flows toward the adjacent second-order critical line, and we identify it as a dynamical analog of Zamolodchikov's $c$-theorem. Our protocol is readily implementable on existing Rydberg quantum simulators. This provides a direct route to measuring distinct tricritical exponents which can reveal an emergent spacetime supersymmetry constraint $1/\nu - 1/\nu' = 1$. Moreover, this work deepens our theoretical understanding and opens new avenues for exploring beyond-KZ quantum dynamics with rich renormalization group structure.</description>

      <title>Holstein mechanism in single-site model with unitary evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16020v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Holstein mechanism in a single-electron (one-site) system, where unitary evolution intrinsically involves both fermion and boson operators under nonadiabatic conditions. The resulting unitary dynamics and boson-frequency dependence reveal a quantum phase transition, evidenced by distinct short-time (power-law decay) and long-time (exponential decay) behaviors, which are manifested in the polaronic shift, bosonic energy, and dynamics of reduced density matrix. This observation is consistent with a non-Markovian to Markovian transition.</description>

      <title>Translation symmetry restoration in integrable systems: the noninteracting case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of symmetry restoration has recently emerged as a fruitful means to extract high-level information on the relaxation of quantum many-body systems. However, while the restoration of internal symmetries has been investigated intensively, that of spatial symmetries has hitherto only been considered in the context of random unitary circuits. Here we present a complementary study of translation symmetry restoration in integrable systems. In particular, we consider a one-dimensional chain of spinless, non-interacting fermions quenched from a $\nu&gt;1$ shift invariant state, and follow the local restoration of one-site shift invariance using the Frobenius distance $\Delta F_A$ between the state on a subsystem and its symmetrised counterpart. Distinct from the case of random unitary circuits, where symmetry restoration occurs abruptly for times proportional to the subsystem size, we find that symmetry here is restored smoothly and over timescales of the order of the subsystem size squared. We also find that the so-called `quantum Mpemba effect' is readily observed. Most importantly, we show that - in contrast to the case of continuous internal symmetries - this discrete symmetry restoration is not qualitatively described by a quasiparticle picture for $\Delta F_A$, and therefore goes beyond the hydrodynamic description. Our results can be directly extended to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Corrections to Quantum Observables in $h\to WW^*$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Higgs boson decay $h \to WW^* \to \ell^+ \nu_\ell \ell'^- \bar{\nu}_{\ell'}$ provides a unique window into the structure of the Higgs couplings to electroweak gauge bosons and has recently gained attention for its potential to unveil quantum properties such as quantum entanglement between the intermediate gauge bosons. In this work, we present a systematic study of next-to-leading order electroweak corrections to the angular coefficients characterizing this decay. While these coefficients are highly constrained at leading order, radiative corrections induce shifts of up to 5% to the existing terms and generate novel structures that vanish at leading order, breaking previous relations among coefficients. While higher-order effects influence the results, the two-qutrit quantum structure in the $h\to WW^*$ channel exhibits greater stability under such corrections than in the previously studied $h \to ZZ^*$ decay.</description>

      <title>Quantum state transfer and maximal entanglement between distant qubits using a minimal quasicrystal pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent quantum state transfer over macroscopic distances between non-neighboring elements in quantum circuits is a crucial component to increase connectivity and simplify quantum information processing. To facilitate such transfers, an efficient and easily controllable quantum pump would be highly beneficial. In this work, we demonstrate such a quantum pump based on a one-dimensional quasicrystal Fibonacci chain~(FC). In particular, we utilize the unique properties of quasicrystals to pump the edge-localized winding states between the two distant ends of the chain by only minimal manipulation of the FC at its end points. We establish the necessary conditions for successful state transfer within a fully time-dependent picture and also demonstrate robustness of the transfer protocol against disorder. We then couple external qubits to each end of the FC and establish highly adaptable functionality as a quantum bus with both on-demand switching of the qubit states and generation of maximally entangled Bell states between the qubits. Thanks to the minimal control parameters, the setup is well-suited for implementation across diverse experimental platforms, thus establishing quasicrystals as an efficient platform for versatile quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits Are Just a Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum programs today are written at a low level of abstraction - quantum circuits akin to assembly languages - and the unitary parts of even advanced quantum programming languages essentially function as circuit description languages. This state of affairs impedes scalability, clarity, and support for higher-level reasoning. More abstract and expressive quantum programming constructs are needed. To this end, we introduce a simple syntax for generating unitaries from "just a phase"; we combine a (global) phase operation that captures phase shifts with a quantum analogue of the "if let" construct that captures subspace selection via pattern matching. This minimal language lifts the focus from gates to eigendecomposition, conjugation, and controlled unitaries; common building blocks in quantum algorithm design. We demonstrate several aspects of the expressive power of our language in several ways. Firstly, we establish that our representation is universal by deriving a universal quantum gate set. Secondly, we show that important quantum algorithms can be expressed naturally and concisely, including Grover's search algorithm, Hamiltonian simulation, Quantum Fourier Transform, Quantum Signal Processing, and the Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation. Furthermore, we give clean denotational semantics grounded in categorical quantum mechanics. Finally, we implement a prototype compiler that efficiently translates terms of our language to quantum circuits, and prove that it is sound with respect to these semantics. Collectively, these contributions show that this construct offers a principled and practical step toward more abstract and structured quantum programming.</description>

      <title>Projective Representations, Bogomolov Multiplier, and Their Applications in Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a pedagogical review of projective representations of finite groups and their physical applications in quantum many-body systems. Some of our physical results are new. We begin with a self-contained introduction to projective representations, highlighting the role of group cohomology, representation theory, and classification of irreducible projective representations. We then focus on a special subset of cohomology classes, known as the Bogomolov multiplier, which consists of cocycles that are symmetric on commuting pairs but remain nontrivial in group cohomology. Such cocycles have important physical implications: they characterize (1+1)D SPT phases that cannot be detected by string order parameters and give rise, upon gauging, to distinct gapped phases with completely broken non-invertible $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry. We construct explicit lattice models for these phases and demonstrate how they are distinguished by the fusion rules of local order parameters. We show that a pair of completely broken $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ SSB phases host nontrivial interface modes at their domain walls. As an example, we construct a lattice model where the ground state degeneracy on a ring increases from 32 without interfaces to 56 with interfaces.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body scarring from Kramers-Wannier duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kramers-Wannier duality, a hallmark of the Ising model, has recently gained renewed interest through its reinterpretation as a non-invertible symmetry with a state-level action. Using sequential quantum circuits (SQC), we argue that this duality governs the stability of quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states in a nonintegrable model, depending on whether the dual preserves the embedding conditions for scarring. This is supported by good agreement between first-order perturbation theory and numerics, which capture scar dynamics despite chaotic spectra. Our results establish non-invertible dualities as both a generative mechanism and a diagnostic tool for quantum many- body scarring, offering a generalized symmetry-based route to weak ergodicity breaking.</description>

      <title>Quantum state spectrum and field theory of D$0$-brane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We quantize D$0$-brane, the simplest representative of the family of supersymmetric Dirichlet p-branes, in its spinor moving frame formulation and analyze its quantum state spectrum. Besides being a preparatory stage for quantization of the complete supersymmetric multiple D$0$-brane (mD$0$) model, which is presently known only in the frame of spinor moving frame formalism, this is interesting as its own: despite the covariant quantization of D=10 D$0$-brane was discussed before, its quantum state spectrum was not analyzed and its field theory, describing that, was not studied.
  We show that the quantum state vector of the D$0$-brane is described by an on-shell superfield that collects the fields of the massive counterpart of the linearized type IIA supergravity supermultiplet which can be obtained as massive Kaluza-Klein mode of the dimensional reduction of the eleven dimensional supergravity down to ten dimensions. In conclusion, we briefly discuss a spinor helicity formalism for D$0$-brane which can be used as one of the basic elements for developing type IIA string theory amplitude calculus based on multiparticle generalizations of the on-shell superfields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harnessing quantum correlations between photons is an emerging frontier in optical spectroscopy, yet experimental demonstrations have largely remained limited to molecular systems at room temperature. Here, we investigate heralded emission detection (HED) under continuous-wave entangled-photon excitation of near-infrared (NIR)-emitting colloidal III-V quantum dot (QD) solids at low temperatures. We demonstrate the advantages of superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) for high time resolution ($\sim$72 ps) and large-area NIR avalanche photodiodes (APDs) for high emission count rates ($\sim$2000 cps). Second-order photon-correlation analysis reveals exciton lifetimes and fine-structure energy splittings. These results establish NIR colloidal QDs as a bright, tunable model system for quantum-light spectroscopy and highlight their compatibility with optical cavities as a further experimental control parameter.</description>

      <title>Radio-frequency charge detection on graphene electron-hole double quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12061v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity detection of charge transitions in quantum dots (QDs) is a key ingredient in solid state quantum computation. We demonstrate high-bandwidth radio-frequency charge detection in bilayer graphene quantum dots (QDs) using a capacitively coupled quantum point contact (QPC). The device design suppresses screening effects and enables sensitive QPC-based charge readout. The QPC is arranged to maximize the readout contrast between two neighboring, coupled electron and hole QDs. We apply the readout scheme to a single-particle electron-hole double QD and demonstrate time-resolved detection of charge states as well as magnetic field dependent tunneling rates. This promises a high-fidelity readout scheme for individual spin and valley states, which is important for the operation of spin, valley or spin-valley qubits in bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>From Quantum Tsallis Entropy to Strange Metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified framework connecting quantum Tsallis statistics to electronic transport in strongly interacting systems. Starting from R\'enyi and Tsallis entropies, we construct a quantum Tsallis distribution that reduces to the conventional Fermi--Dirac distribution when $q=1$. For $q$ slightly deviating from unity, the correction term in the occupation function can be mapped to a $q$-deformed Schwarzian action, corresponding to soft reparametrization modes. Coupling these soft modes to electrons via the Fermi Golden Rule yields a modified scattering rate, which reproduces conventional Fermi-liquid behavior at low temperatures and linear-in-temperature resistivity at high temperatures. Using the memory matrix formalism, we analyze magnetotransport, finding a linear-in-field magnetoresistance and a Hall angle consistent with Anderson's two-lifetime scenario. At sufficiently low temperatures, both magnetoresistance and Hall response smoothly recover Fermi-liquid quadratic behaviors. This approach provides a controlled interpolation between Fermi-liquid and non-Fermi-liquid regimes, quantitatively linking $q$-deformation, soft-mode dynamics, and experimentally measurable transport coefficients in strange metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, based on an analogy of holographic confining geometries and using complexified fields, we build the holographic toy model of third order photonic exceptional points (EPs) of ternary coupled microrings with gain and loss, which makes an open, non-Hermitian quantum system. In our model, we discuss the Ferrell-Glover-Tinkham sum rule for various combinations of gain and loss systems, and numerically find the behavior of spectra which matches with the experiments. We also discuss the inhomogeneous case of a holographic lattice for three-site photonic EPs. Additionally, in our holographic model, we numerically find the behavior of phase rigidity and the Petermann factor around EPs versus various parameters of the model. We also discuss the connections between recent developments in complexified, time-dependent entanglement entropy and EPs, and finally, we connect EPs and the $\theta$-vacuum of QCD through topological structures, partition functions, and winding numbers, and find a second-order EP in a perturbed $\theta$-vacuum model.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the influence of collisions on the dynamics of an ultracold gas whose constituents interact via dipolar forces. This dynamics is governed by the elastic scattering cross section of the molecules, which is to some extent under the experimentalist's control. We compare side-by-side several different situations, highlighting their similarities and differences. These situations are collisions between: 1) point dipoles; 2) electric-field-shielded polar molecules; and 3) microwave-shielded polar molecules, including the effect of microwave ellipticity.</description>

Abstract: We establish a framework with reflection positivity as the first principle for establishing the boundary theory of topologically ordered quantum spin systems. For any reflection positive frustration-free Hamiltonian, We proved that the local topological quantum order (LTQO) condition of ground states on a disk holds if and only if the ground state on the sphere is non-degenerate. Furthermore, we show that the Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction produces the boundary local net of operator algebras from the local ground states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified perturbative framework for energy transport along a chiral quantum Hall edge coupled to a disordered, compressible strip. Treating the strip as a generic linear response environment characterized by its retarded susceptibility, we obtain leading corrections to both the heat flux carried by the edge plasmon and to its spectrum. Two generic regimes emerge: (i) a gapped, local dielectric response with finite-range coupling, producing a negative correction to the quantized heat flux that scales as T^4 at low temperatures together with a convex cubic shift of the plasmon dispersion; and (ii) a hydrodynamic (diffusive) response with relaxation, yielding a crossover from T^4 to T^{3/2} scaling and a change of sign in the correction. We further introduce a microscopic dipolar model in which the edge couples electrostatically to localized dipole moments inside a wide compressible strip. This long-range interaction amplifies the nonlocal dielectric back-action and generates new suppression laws, T^3 or even T^2 for smooth disorder profiles, together with a universal ratio connecting spectral curvature to thermal response. Across all regimes, the total heat flux remains quantized: the apparent deficit of the plasmon contribution reflects reversible heat drag into the compressible strip rather than a breakdown of quantization. The framework thus provides a coherent and quantitatively plausible explanation of the "missing heat flux" anomaly and unifies the thermal and spectral signatures of quantum Hall edge dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum vortices in entanglement: a novel idea for large vortex filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new approach to describing certain macroscopic objects
  that can arise in a quantum fluid. These objects are formed by means of quantum entanglement from the circular-shaped mesoscale and microscale vortices, and can be interpreted as a vortex filaments with any shape and size. The method is based on a quantization scheme for classical closed vortex filaments that was proposed by the author early \cite{Tal18,Tal22_1,Tal_Chaos25J}. The model we consider examines the instantaneous picture of the locations in space $\mathbb R_3$ of such filaments with a small, but non-zero, core diameter.
  Both energy and circulation of the studied filaments are calculated using the proposed approach. We demonstrate that the adopted concept leads to the emergence of secondary vortices around these investigated filament-like objects.
  We also study the specific mechanisms by which large vortex loops can disconnect and create the filament fragments . From our point of view, the proposed approach to describing vortex filaments within a vortex tangle can be seen as an important step toward understanding the appearance of quantum turbulence.</description>

      <title>Exploring Replica Symmetry Breaking and Topological Collapse in Spin Glasses with Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Replica symmetry breaking (RSB) underlies the complex organization of disordered systems, yet quantitative validation beyond $N \sim 100$ spins has remained computationally challenging. We use quantum annealing to access ground states of the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model up to $N = 4000$ spins, enabling the most extensive test of Parisi's Nobel Prize-winning RSB solution to date. Five independent observables confirm RSB predictions: ground-state energies converge to Parisi's value with characteristic $N^{-2/3}$ corrections, energy fluctuations scale as $N^{-3/4}$ ($\gamma = 0.739 \pm 0.036$), the chaos exponent $\theta = 0.51 \pm 0.02$ ($R^2 = 0.989$) confirms mean-field universality, the overlap distribution exhibits hierarchical structure ($\sigma_q = 0.19$), and the complexity remains invariant under 36\% network dilution. Beyond a critical threshold $0.8 &lt; D_c &lt; 0.9$, the hierarchy collapses discontinuously through a cooperative avalanche that converts the entire system to vacancies within a narrow parameter window $\Delta D = 0.1$. These findings establish quantum computation as a tool for probing emergent many-body phenomena and uncover the topological foundations of complexity in disordered systems, with implications for neural networks, optimization, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Thermalization of exact quantum many-body scars in spin-1 XY chain under perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are special eigenstates that violate the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis while residing at finite energy density along with thermalizing eigenstates. The spin-1 XY model is known to host a family of such exceptional states originating from long-lived quasiparticle excitations that exhibit anomalously low entanglement entropy and long-time periodic revivals, resulting in weak ergodicity breaking. We study the stability of these scarred states against typical U(1) symmetry preserving perturbation in the XY chain. While perturbation theory can describe the deformed scar states at small system sizes, finite-size scaling of the perturbation matrix elements indicate that the scars ultimately thermalize in larger chains. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that the long-range order associated with the scars decays under the perturbation, and we estimate the relaxation timescale of oscillatory dynamics in certain local observables to be of order $\lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is the perturbation strength.</description>

      <title>Dichroism from Chiral Thermoelectric Probes: Generalized Sum Rules for Orbital and Heat Magnetizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that relates orbital and heat magnetizations to experimentally accessible excitation spectra, through thermoelectric probes and generalized sum rules. By analyzing zero-temperature transport coefficients and applying Kramers-Kronig relations, we derive spectral representations of magnetization densities from thermoelectric correlation functions. Excitation rates under chiral thermoelectric drives then naturally emerge as direct probes of these Kubo-type correlators, placing orbital and heat magnetizations on equal footing with the topological Chern number. As a direct consequence of our formalism, we introduce a hierarchical construction that organizes orbital and heat magnetizations into distinct physical contributions accessible through sum rules, and also derive real-space markers of these magnetizations. From an experimental standpoint, we propose concrete implementations of thermoelectric dichroic measurements in quantum-engineered platforms based on modulated strain fields. These results establish thermoelectric dichroic measurements as a versatile route to access and disentangle fundamental ground-state properties.</description>
