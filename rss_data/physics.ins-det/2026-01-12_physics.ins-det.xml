      <title>Detector characterization for a new $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C reaction study at LUNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C fusion reaction plays a crucial role in stellar evolution, including the occurrence of supernova explosions, and in the synthesis of the chemical elements. However, our understanding of its cross section remains severely deficient, particularly below $E_\textrm{cm}=2.5$\,MeV, the energy range of interest for astrophysics. To address these unresolved issues, the LUNA collaboration will conduct a dedicated study of the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C reaction at the Bellotti Ion Beam Facility (Bellotti IBF) located deep underground within the Gran Sasso National Laboratory (LNGS) in Italy. Based on the combination of passive and active shields, this campaign aims to achieve unprecedented sensitivity in measuring the cross sections of the two key reaction channels, $^{12}$C($^{12}$C,$\alpha$)$^{20}$Ne and $^{12}$C($^{12}$C,$p$)$^{23}$Na in the low-energy regime via $\gamma$-ray detection. Here, we report on a sensitivity study for the upcoming campaign with a focus on the characterization of two detectors, namely a HPGe detector and a NaI(Tl) array. Furthermore, their intrinsic contamination is thoroughly investigated since this could potentially influence the overall sensitivity. Assuming typical beam intensities of the Bellotti IBF, we will be able to investigate reaction rates significantly below 100 counts per day. In case of the $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C reaction we therefore expect to acquire experimental data well below the current limit of $E_\textrm{cm}=2.1\,$MeV. The results are supported by simulations to highlight the advantageous low-background environment, essential for high-precision nuclear astrophysics studies.</description>

      <title>Impact of Cold Noise on the tracking performance of ATLAS ITk short strip barrel modules using a charged particle beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inner tracking system of the ATLAS experiment will be upgraded to a full silicon detector in 2030 for HL-LHC. The new tracking system is called ITk, the Inner Tracker. It is required to be operable with efficiency higher than 99\% and noise hit occupancy smaller than 0.1\%. During the pre-production phase of the ITk project, many short-strip modules were observed to exhibit so-called "Cold Noise (CN)", wherein clusters of strips displayed very high noise when the modules were operated at temperatures below~$-35\degree$C. To investigate the CN impact and ensure the quality of module production, huge amount of effort have been put in by the collaboration. This paper focuses on the impact of CN on the tracking performance by examining two short strip modules that exhibit CN: one is non-irradiated, while the other one has been irradiated to the maximum expected end-of-lifetime fluence. For each module, the global and single strip tracking performance are evaluated.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Dark Matter Sensitivity using a Hybrid SiPM-SNSPD-Qubit Detector in Liquid Argon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate novel strategies to extend the sensitivity of dark matter direct detection experiments to energy deposits well below the thresholds of conventional detectors. In liquid-argon time-projection chambers equipped with silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), we show that improved optical readout, combined with a nuclear dielectric constant (NDC) correction to the WIMP nucleus interaction, enhances the response to low-momentum-transfer nuclear recoils. The NDC effectively amplifies the interaction strength at small recoil energies, increasing the expected ionization and scintillation yields without modifying the high-energy behavior constrained by calibration data. When coupled to SiPM based light collection, this mechanism lowers the effective detection threshold to the subKeV regime, significantly improving sensitivity to low-mass WIMPs and other weakly interacting particles. Complementarily, we present the design and projected performance of a qubit-based detector optimized for ultra-low-energy depositions. A novel two-chip architecture is employed to minimize signal dissipation, while quantum parity measurements enable enhanced single-phonon sensitivity. Full simulations of phonon propagation and quasiparticle dynamics demonstrate that energy deposits at the level of $\gtrsim 30 meV$ can be detected with nearly unit efficiency and high energy resolution. This capability is expected to advance sensitivity to dark-matter scattering for masses $m_\chi \gtrsim 0.01 MeV$ by several orders of magnitude for both light and heavy mediators, and to enable competitive searches for axion and dark-photon absorption in the $0.04 - 0.2 eV$ mass range.</description>

      <title>Robust Bilinear-Noise-Optimal Control for Gravitational-Wave Detectors: A Mixed LQG/$H_\infty$ Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At its lowest frequencies, LIGO is limited by noise in its many degrees of freedom of suspended optics, which, in turn, introduce noise in the interferometer through their feedback control systems. Nonlinear interactions are a dominant source of low-frequency noise, mixing noise from multiple degrees of freedom. The lowest-order form is bilinear noise, in which the noise from two feedback-controlled subsystems multiplies to mask gravitational waves. Bilinear couplings require control trade-offs that simultaneously balance high- and low-frequency noise. Currently, there is no known lower limit to bilinear control noise. Here, we develop benchmark cost functions for bilinear noise and associated figures of merit. Linear-quadratic-Gaussian control then establishes aggressive feedback that saturates the lower bounds on the cost functions. We then develop a mixed LQG and $H_\infty$ approach to directly compute stable, robust, and optimal feedback, using the LIGO's alignment control system as an example. Direct computations are fast while ensuring a global optimum. By calculating optimal robust control, it is possible to construct the lower bound on controls noise along the Pareto front of practical controllers for LIGO. This method can be used to drastically improve controls noise in existing observatories as well as to set subsystem control noise requirements for next-generation detectors with parameterized design.</description>

      <title>Data acquisition from high-rate detectors at MAX IV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At MAX IV pixelated area detectors are operated at high frame rates to take advantage of the X-ray beam properties available from the fourth generation synchrotron in scattering, diffraction and imaging applications. A variety of photon counting and charge integrating detectors and sCMOS cameras have been integrated into a common data acquisition (DAQ) system in which data are streamed to a central Kubernetes cluster, mounting an IBM Storage Scale (GPFS) file system. The DAQ system provides live feedback from the detectors/cameras and extends to enable on-the-fly data processing. Control system integration via Tango provides a standardised single interface for controlling all DAQ components. Starting from an overview of the detector types in use, we describe the design and implementation of the MAX~IV detector-DAQ system and report a quantitative study of its performance in terms of data throughput and detector operating rates.</description>

      <title>Novel High-Radiopurity Doped Amorphous Silicon Resistors for Low-Background Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of a study of lightly doped amorphous silicon used as a resistive medium for high-radiopurity resistors in nuclear and particle physics research instrumentation. Prototypes are produced for a Time Projection Chamber design for the nEXO neutrinoless double-beta decay search experiment that meet requirements for ultra-high radiopurity, good mechanical, cryogenic and high voltage performance, as well as useful vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) reflectivity. Further study is warranted to refine production methods and to confirm that the technology used here is useful for more general applications.</description>

      <title>A universal vision transformer for fast calorimeter simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The high-dimensional complex nature of detectors makes fast calorimeter simulations a prime application for modern generative machine learning. Vision transformers (ViTs) can emulate the Geant4 response with unmatched accuracy and are not limited to regular geometries. Starting from the CaloDREAM architecture, we demonstrate the robustness and scalability of ViTs on regular and irregular geometries, and multiple detectors. Our results show that ViTs generate electromagnetic and hadronic showers statistically indistinguishable from Geant4 in multiple evaluation metrics, while maintaining the generation time in the $\mathcal{O}(10-100)$ ms on a single GPU. Furthermore, we show that pretraining on a large dataset and fine-tuning on the target geometry leads to reduced training costs and higher data efficiency, or altogether improves the fidelity of generated showers.</description>

      <title>Stray Field NMR: a powerful method to measure dynamics at the millisecond scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport properties in fluids and confined systems play a central role across a wide range of natural and technological contexts, from geology and environmental sciences to biology, energy storage, and membrane-based separation processes. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) provides a unique, non-destructive means to probe these properties through species-selective measurements of self-diffusion coefficients. While pulsed field gradient NMR (PFG-NMR) is routinely used, its access to diffusion times is typically limited to values no shorter than about 10 ms, restricting its applicability to systems with fast dynamics and long relaxation times. Diffusion NMR in a permanent magnetic field gradient (STRAFI) offers a complementary, multiscale approach, enabling diffusion measurements over an extended temporal window, from a few hundred microseconds to several tens of seconds. Despite its strong potential, this technique remains rarely implemented due to experimental and methodological challenges. In this work, we present a robust and versatile STRAFI-based methodology, including a specifically designed experimental setup, optimized pulse sequences, and rigorous data analysis, allowing accurate extraction of self-diffusion coefficients for a broad range of nuclei. The capabilities of the approach are illustrated through diverse applications, including the study of concentrated electrolytes using "NMR-exotic" nuclei ($^{35}$Cl, $^{79}$Br/$^{81}$Br, $^{127}$I, $^{17}$O) and the characterization of micrometre-scale porosity in membranes.</description>

      <title>Studies of ultrafast dynamics in substrate-free nanoparticles at ELI using Timepix3 optical camera</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel application of the Timepix3 optical camera (Tpx3Cam) for investigating ultrafast dynamics in substrate-free nanoparticles at the Extreme Light Infrastructure European Research Infrastructure Consortium (ELI ERIC). The camera, integrated into an ion imaging system based on a micro-channel plate (MCP) and a fast P47 scintillator, enables individual time-stamping of incoming ions with nanosecond timing precision and high spatial resolution. The detector successfully captured laser-induced ion events originating from free nanoparticles disintegrated by intense laser pulses. Owing to the broad size distribution of the nanoparticles (10-500 nm) and the variation in laser intensities within the interaction volume, the detected events range in occupancy from near-zero to extremely high, approaching the readout limits of the detector. By combining time-of-flight and velocity map imaging (VMI) techniques, detailed post-processing and analysis were performed. The results presented here focus on the performance of Tpx3Cam under high-occupancy conditions, which are of particular relevance to this study. These conditions approach the limitations imposed by the camera readout capabilities and challenge the effectiveness of standard post-processing algorithms. We investigated these limitations and associated trade-offs, and we present improved methods and algorithms designed to extract the most informative features from the data.</description>
