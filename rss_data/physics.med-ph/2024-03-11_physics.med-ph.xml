      <title>Development of novel ionization chambers for reference dosimetry in electron FLASH radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this study was to optimize the design and performance of parallel plate ion chambers for use in ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) dosimetry applications, and evaluate their potential as reference class chambers for calibration purposes. Three chambers were designed and produced: the A11-VAR (0.2-1.0 mm electrode gap, 20 mm diameter collector), the A11-TPP (0.3 mm electrode gap, 20 mm diameter collector), and the A30 (0.3 mm electrode gap, 5.4 mm diameter collector).The chambers underwent full characterization using an UHDR 9 MeV electron beam with individually varied beam parameters of pulse repetition frequency (PRF, 10-120Hz), pulse width (PW, 0.5-4us), and pulse amplitude (0.01-9 Gy/pulse). The response of the ion chambers was evaluated as a function of the dose per pulse (DPP), PRF, PW, dose rate, electric field strength, and electrode gap. The chamber response was found to be dependent on DPP and PW, whose dependencies were mitigated with larger electric field strengths and smaller electrode spacing. At a constant electric field strength, we measured a larger charge collection efficiency (CCE) as a function of DPP for ion chambers with a smaller electrode gap in the A11-VAR. For ion chambers with identical electrode gap (A11-TPP and A30), higher electric field strengths were found to yield better CCE at higher DPP. A PW dependence was observed at low electric field strengths (500 V/mm) for DPP values ranging from 1-5 Gy at PWs ranging from 0.5-4 {\mu}s, but at electric field strengths of 1000 V/mm and higher, these effects become negligible. This study confirmed that the charge collection efficiency of ion chambers depends strongly on the electrode spacing and the electric field strength, and also on the DPP and the PW of the UHDR beam. The new finding of this study is that the PW dependence becomes negligible with reduced electrode spacing and increased electric field.</description>

      <title>A molecular dynamics simulation of the abrupt changes in the thermodynamic properties of water after formation of nano-bubbles / nano-cavities induced by passage of charged particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-scale formalism that accounts for the formation of nano-scale bubbles/cavities owing to a burst of water molecules after the passage of high energy charged particles that leads to the formation of hot non-ionizing excitations or thermal spikes (TS). We demonstrate the coexistence of a rapidly growing condensed state of water and a hot spot that forms a stable state of diluted water at high temperatures and pressures, possibly at a supercritical phase. Depending on the temperature of TS, the thin shell of a highly dense state of water grows by three to five times the speed of sound in water, forming a thin layer of shock wave (SW) buffer, wrapping around the nano-scale cylindrical symmetric cavity. The stability of the cavity, as a result of the incompressibility of water at ambient conditions and the surface tension, allows the transition of supersonic SW to a subsonic contact discontinuity and dissipation to thermo-acoustic sound waves. We further study the mergers of nanobubbles that lead to fountain-like or jet-flow structures at the collision interface. We introduce a time delay in the nucleation of nano-bubbles, a novel mechanism, responsible for the growth and stability of much larger or even micro-bubbles, possibly relevant to FLASH ultra-high dose rate (UHDR). The current study is potentially significant at FLASH-UHDRs. Our analysis predicts the black-body radiation from the transient supercritical state of water localized in nano-cavities wrapping around the track of charged particles can be manifested in the (indirect) water luminescence spectrum.</description>

      <title>On the Echogenicity of Natural Starch-Based Blood Mimicking Fluids for Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound Imaging: Preliminary In-vitro Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural starch-based blood-mimicking fluid (BMF) has been used as an alternative to commercially available BMFs for in-vitro Doppler investigations in low-resource settings. Most reported works in the literature have used corn starch-based BMF. Evaluation of other natural starches for potential BMF and their characterization have relatively been unexplored in the literature. To this end, this work investigates the echogenicity of corn-, potato-, tapioca-, and wheat starch-based BMFs prepared using a liquid base of pure water-glycerol mixture with three different starch concentrations (1%, 3%, and 5%). The experiments were performed by manually pumping the BMFs to a PolyVinyl alcohol (PVA) based flow phantom using a syringe and raw datasets were acquired using a Verasonics Vantage 128 Research Ultrasound System. Echogenicity was measured as the mean pixel intensity in a selected region of interest (ROI) in the beamformed image. Among the four natural starch-based BMFs, potato starch-based BMF showed the highest echogenicity and contrast with almost 13%, 14%, and 10% higher pixel intensities (dB) than that of the least echoic BMF with 1%, 3%, and 5% starch concentrations respectively. Moreover, the echogenicity of corn, tapioca, and wheat starch-based BMF was observed to be similar, and the results suggest that these BMFs with higher starch concentrations shall be employed for in-vitro contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging.</description>

      <title>Fast-Track of F-18 Positron paths simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the use of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations in the domain of Medical Physics has become a state-of-the-art technology that consumes lots of computational resources for the accurate prediction of particle interactions. The use of generative adversarial network (GAN) has been recently proposed as an alternative to improve the efficiency and extending the applications of computational tools in both medical imaging and therapeutic applications. This study introduces a new approach to simulate positron paths originating from Fluorine 18 (18 F) isotopes through the utilization of GANs. The proposed methodology developed a pure conditional transformer least squares (LS)-GAN model, designed to generate positron paths, and to track their interaction within the surrounding material. Conditioning factors include the pre-determined number of interactions, and the initial momentum of the emitted positrons, as derived from the emission spectrum of 18 F. By leveraging these conditions, the model aims to quickly and accurately simulate electromagnetic interactions of positron paths. Results were compared to the outcome produced with Geant4 Application for Tomography Emission (GATE) MC simulations toolkit. Less than 10 % of difference was observed in the calculation of the mean and maximum length of the path and the 1-D point spread function (PSF) for three different materials (Water, Bone, Lung).</description>

      <title>Spectral Diffusion Posterior Sampling for Synergistic Reconstruction in Spectral Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using recent advances in generative artificial intelligence (AI) brought by diffusion models, this paper introduces a new synergistic method for spectral computed tomography (CT) reconstruction. Diffusion models define a neural network to approximate the gradient of the log-density of the training data, which is then used to generate new images similar to the training ones. Following the inverse problem paradigm, we propose to adapt this generative process to synergistically reconstruct multiple images at different energy bins from multiple measurements. The experiments suggest that using multiple energy bins simultaneously improves the reconstruction by inverse diffusion and outperforms state-of-the-art synergistic reconstruction techniques.</description>

      <title>UNICORN: Ultrasound Nakagami Imaging via Score Matching and Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nakagami imaging holds promise for visualizing and quantifying tissue scattering in ultrasound waves, with potential applications in tumor diagnosis and fat fraction estimation which are challenging to discern by conventional ultrasound B-mode images. Existing methods struggle with optimal window size selection and suffer from estimator instability, leading to degraded resolution images. To address this, here we propose a novel method called UNICORN (Ultrasound Nakagami Imaging via Score Matching and Adaptation), that offers an accurate, closed-form estimator for Nakagami parameter estimation in terms of the score function of ultrasonic envelope. Extensive experiments using simulation and real ultrasound RF data demonstrate UNICORN's superiority over conventional approaches in accuracy and resolution quality.</description>

      <title>A Prototype Scintillator Real-Time Beam Monitor for Ultra-high Dose Rate Radiotherapy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15306v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: FLASH Radiotherapy (RT) is a potentially new cancer radiotherapy technique where an entire therapeutic dose is delivered in about 0.1 s and at ~1000 times higher dose rate than in conventional RT. For clinical trials to be conducted safely, precise and fast beam monitoring that can generate an out-of-tolerance beam interrupt is required. A FLASH Beam Scintillator Monitor (FBSM) is being developed based in part on a novel proprietary inorganic hybrid scintillator material. The FBSM provides large area coverage, low mass profile, linear response over a broad dynamic range, radiation tolerance, and real-time analysis IEC-compliant fast beam-interrupt signal. This paper includes the design concept and test results from a prototype device in radiation beams that include heavy ions, FLASH level dose per pulse electron beams, anda hospital radiotherapy clinic with electron beams. Results include image quality, response linearity, radiation hardness, spatial resolution, and real-time data processing. The scintillator showed a small -0.02%/kGy signal decrease after a 212 kGy cumulative dose resulting from continuous exposure for 15 minutes at a FLASH compatible dose rate of 234 Gy/s. These tests established the linear response of the FBSM with respect to dose per pulse. Comparison with commercial Gafchromic film indicates that the FBSM produces a high resolution 2D beam image and can reproduce a nearly identical beam profile. At 20 kfps or 50 microsec/frame, the real-time FPGA based computation and analysis of beam position, beam shape, and beam dose takes &lt; 1 microsec.</description>

      <title>Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS): A Comprehensive Approach to Label-free Absorption Microscopy Across Biological Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Label-free optical absorption microscopy techniques have evolved as effective tools for non-invasive chemical specific structural, and functional imaging. Yet most modern label-free microscopy modalities target only a fraction of the contrast afforded by an optical absorption interaction. We introduce a comprehensive optical absorption microscopy technique, Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS), which simultaneously captures the dominant light matter interactions which occur as a pulse of light is absorbed by a molecule. In PARS, the optical scattering, attenuation, and the transient radiative and non-radiative relaxation processes are collected at each optical absorption event. This provides a complete representation of the absorption event, providing unique contrast presented here as the total absorption (TA) and quantum efficiency ratio (QER) measurements. By capturing a complete view of each absorption interaction, PARS bridges many of the specificity challenges associated with label-free imaging, facilitating recovery of a wider range of biomolecules than independent radiative or non-radiative modalities. To show the versatility of PARS, we explore imaging across a wide range of biological specimens, from single cells to in-vivo imaging of living subjects. These examples of label-free histopathological imaging, and vascular imaging illustrate some of the numerous fields where PARS may have profound impacts. Overall PARS may provide comprehensive label-free contrast in a wide variety of biological specimens, providing otherwise inaccessible visualizations, and representing a new a source of rich data to develop new AI and machine learning methods for diagnostics and visualization.</description>
