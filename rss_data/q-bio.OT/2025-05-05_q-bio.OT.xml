      <title>Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Biomedicine: A Survey of Technologies, Datasets, and Clinical Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in natural language processing tasks. However, their application in the biomedical domain presents unique challenges, particularly regarding factual accuracy and up-to-date knowledge integration. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to address these challenges by combining the generative capabilities of LLMs with external knowledge retrieval. This comprehensive survey examines the application of RAG in the biomedical domain, focusing on its technological components, available datasets, and clinical applications. We present a systematic analysis of retrieval methods, ranking strategies, and generation models, while also exploring the challenges and future directions in this rapidly evolving field. Our work provides researchers and practitioners with a thorough understanding of the current state of biomedical RAG systems and identifies key areas for future research and development.</description>

      <title>Technical Insights and Legal Considerations for Advancing Federated Learning in Bioinformatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning leverages data across institutions to improve clinical discovery while complying with data-sharing restrictions and protecting patient privacy. As the evolution of biobanks in genetics and systems biology has proved, accessing more extensive and varied data pools leads to a faster and more robust exploration and translation of results. More widespread use of federated learning may have the same impact in bioinformatics, allowing access to many combinations of genotypic, phenotypic and environmental information that are undercovered or not included in existing biobanks. This paper reviews the methodological, infrastructural and legal issues that academic and clinical institutions must address before implementing it. Finally, we provide recommendations for the reliable use of federated learning and its effective translation into clinical practice.</description>
