      <title>Electromagnetic form factors: A window into the $D\Lambda_c$, $D^*\Lambda_c$, and $D\Lambda_c^*$ molecular structure</title>

Abstract: The internal structure of exotic hadrons remains one of the most compelling puzzles in strong interaction physics. In this work, we provide crucial insights into the nature of doubly-charmed pentaquarks by investigating their electromagnetic properties. Using QCD light-cone sum rules, we present the first comprehensive calculation of the magnetic dipole moments of $D\Lambda_c$, $D^*\Lambda_c$, and $D\Lambda_c^*$ molecular pentaquarks with $J^P = \frac{1}{2}^-$, $\frac{3}{2}^-$, and $\frac{3}{2}^-$, respectively. Our analysis reveals a striking hierarchy of magnetic moments: $\mu_{D\Lambda_c^*} &gt; \mu_{D^*\Lambda_c} &gt; \mu_{D\Lambda_c}$, driven by distinct quark-level mechanisms. While light quarks dominate the overall response, we find that charm quark contributions become strategically important when light quark contributions partially cancel. Beyond dipole moments, we predict higher multipoles -- electric quadrupole and magnetic octupole moments -- that fingerprint the spatial deformation of these states, revealing prolate versus oblate charge distributions. These results provide the first systematic predictions for electromagnetic moments of molecular pentaquark configurations, establishing essential benchmarks for future theoretical and experimental studies. The distinctive patterns we uncover will enable quantitative comparisons with alternative structural models, ultimately helping to resolve the nature of doubly-charmed exotic hadrons.</description>

      <title>Hybrid renormalization for distribution amplitude of a light baryon in large momentum effective theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08971v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lightcone distribution amplitudes for a light baryon can be extracted through the simulation of the quasi-distribution amplitudes (quasi-DAs) on the lattice. We implement the hybrid renormalization for the quasi DAs of light baryons. Lattice simulations are performed using $N_f = 2+1$ stout-smeared clover fermions and a tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action, with three lattice spacings of ${0.105, 0.077, 0.052}$ fm. By analyzing zero-momentum matrix elements for different lattice spacings, we extract the linear divergence associated with the Wilson-line self-energy. Matching to perturbative matrix elements in the $\overline{\text{MS}}$ scheme yields the residual self-renormalization factors. Using these factors, we renormalize the quasi-DAs within the hybrid scheme, which combines self-renormalization at large separations and the ratio scheme at short distances. The renormalized results demonstrate effective cancellation of linear divergences and yield smooth, continuum-like coordinate-space distributions suitable for subsequent Fourier transformation and perturbative matching. These results establish the viability of both self and hybrid renormalization frameworks for light baryon quasi-DAs, providing a robust foundation for LaMET-based determinations of light-cone distribution amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Chiral Anomaly of Kogut-Susskind Fermion in (3+1)-dimensional Hamiltonian formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Kogut-Susskind fermions (also known as staggered fermions) in a $(3+1)$-dimensional Hamiltonian formalism and examine a chiral transformation and its associated chiral anomaly. The Hamiltonian of the massless Kogut-Susskind fermion has symmetry under the shift transformations in each space direction $S_k \, (k=1,2,3)$, and the product of the three shift transformations in particular (the odd shifts in general) may be regarded as a unitary discrete chiral transformation, modulo two-site translations. The hermitian part of the transformation kernel $\Gamma = i S_1 S_2 S_3$ can define an axial charge as $Q_A = (1/2)\sum_x \chi^\dagger(x) \left(\Gamma+\Gamma^\dagger \right)\chi(x)$, which is non-onsite, nonquantized, and commutative with the vector charge, analogous to $\tilde{Q}_A = (1/2) \sum_n ( \chi^\dagger_n \chi_{n+1} + \chi^\dagger_{n+1} \chi_{n} )$ for the $(1+1)$ dimensional Kogut-Susskind fermion. However, our $Q_A$ cannot be expressed in terms of any quantized charges in a generalized Onsager algebra. Although $Q_A$ does not commute with the fermion Hamiltonian in general when coupled to background link gauge fields, we show that they become commutative for a class of $U(1)$ link configurations carrying nontrivial magnetic and electric fields. We then verify numerically that the vacuum expectation value of $Q_A$ satisfies the anomalous conservation law of axial charge in the continuum two-flavor theory under an adiabatic evolution of the link gauge field.</description>

      <title>A geometric phase approach to quark confinement from stochastic gauge-geometry flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15986v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply a stochastic version of the geometric (Ricci) flow, complemented with the stochastic flow of the gauge Yang--Mills sector, in order to seed the chromo-magnetic and chromo-electric vortices that source the area-law for QCD confinement. The area-law is the key signature of quark confinement in Yang--Mills gauge theories with a non-trivial center symmetry. In particular, chromo-magnetic vortices enclosed within the chromo-electric Wilson loops instantiate the area-law asymptotic behaviour of the Wilson loop vacuum expectation values. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow is responsible for the topology changes that induce the appearance of the vortices. When vortices vanish, due to topology changes in the manifolds associated to the hadronic ground states, the evaluation of the Wilson loop yields a dependence on the length of the path, hence reproducing the perimeter law of the hadronic (Higgs) phase of real QCD. Confinement, instead, is naturally achieved within this context as a by-product of the topology change of the manifold over which the dynamics of the Yang--Mills fields is defined. It is then provided by the Aharonov--Bohm effect induced by the concatenation of the compact chromo-electric and chromo-magnetic fluxes originated by the topology changes. The stochastic gauge-geometry flow naturally accomplishes a treatment of the emergence of the vortices and the generation of turbulence effects. Braiding and knotting, resulting from topology changes, namely stochastic fluctuations, stabilize the chromo-magnetic vortices. Finally, we observe that dimensional transmutation for the Yang-Mills fields can be derived from the scaling property of the geometric part of the stochastic flow. Specifically, a relation that involves the infrared equilibrium limit of the Planck constant can be derived that yields the correct order of magnitude for $\Lambda_{\rm QCD}$.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium spinodal-like scaling behaviors across the magnetic first-order transitions of 2D and 3D Ising systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21286v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium scaling behavior of two-dimensional and three-dimensional Ising systems, when they are slowly driven across their {\em magnetic} first-order transitions at low temperature $T&lt;T_c$, where $T_c$ is the temperature of their continuous transition. We consider Kibble-Zurek (KZ) protocols in which a spatially homogenous magnetic field $h$ varies as $h(t)=t/t_s$ with a time scale $t_s$. The KZ dynamics starts from negatively-magnetized configurations equilibrated at $h_i&lt;0$ and stops at a positive value of $h$ where the configurations acquire a positive average magnetization. We consider the Metropolis and the heat-bath dynamics, which are two specific examples of a purely relaxational dynamics. We focus on two different dynamic regimes. We consider the out-equilibrium finite-size scaling (OFSS) limit in which the system size $L$ and the time scale $t_s$ diverge simultaneously, keeping an appropriate combination fixed. Then, we analyze the KZ dynamics in the thermodynamic limit (TL), obtained by taking first the $L\to\infty$ limit at fixed $t$ and $t_s$, and then considering the scaling behavior in the large-$t_s$ limit. Our numerical results provide evidence of OFSS, as predicted by general scaling arguments. The results in the TL show the emergence of spinodal-like behaviors: The passage from the negatively-magnetized phase to the positively-magnetized one occurs at positive values $h_*&gt;0$ of the magnetic field, which decrease as $h_* \sim 1/(\ln t_s)^\kappa$, with $\kappa = 2$ and $\kappa=1$ in two and three dimensions, respectively, for $t_s\to\infty$. We identify $\sigma \equiv t (\ln t)^\kappa/t_s$ as the relevant scaling variable associated with the KZ dynamics in the TL.</description>

      <title>Sample-Based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization for the Schwinger Model on Trapped-Ion and Superconducting Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the recently proposed Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD) method to lattice gauge theories, using the Schwinger model with a $\theta$-term as a benchmark. SKQD approximates the ground state of a Hamiltonian, employing a hybrid quantum-classical approach: (i) constructing a Krylov space from bitstrings sampled from time-evolved quantum states, and (ii) classically diagonalizing the Hamiltonian within this subspace. We study the dependence of the ground-state energy and particle number on the value of the $\theta$-term, accurately capturing the model's phase structure. The algorithm is implemented on trapped-ion and superconducting quantum processors, demonstrating consistent performance across platforms. We show that SKQD substantially reduces the effective Hilbert space, and although the Krylov space dimension still scales exponentially, the slower growth underscores its promise for simulating lattice gauge theories in larger volumes.</description>
