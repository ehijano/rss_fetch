      <title>CNN-based Robust Sound Source Localization with SRP-PHAT for the Extreme Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust sound source localization for environments with noise and reverberation are increasingly exploiting deep neural networks fed with various acoustic features. Yet, state-of-the-art research mainly focuses on optimizing algorithmic accuracy, resulting in huge models preventing edge-device deployment. The edge, however, urges for real-time low-footprint acoustic reasoning for applications such as hearing aids and robot interactions. Hence, we set off from a robust CNN-based model using SRP-PHAT features, Cross3D [16], to pursue an efficient yet compact model architecture for the extreme edge. For both the SRP feature representation and neural network, we propose respectively our scalable LC-SRP-Edge and Cross3D-Edge algorithms which are optimized towards lower hardware overhead. LC-SRP-Edge halves the complexity and on-chip memory overhead for the sinc interpolation compared to the original LC-SRP [19]. Over multiple SRP resolution cases, Cross3D-Edge saves 10.32~73.71% computational complexity and 59.77~94.66% neural network weights against the Cross3D baseline. In terms of the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, the most balanced version (EM) requires only 127.1 MFLOPS computation, 3.71 MByte/s bandwidth, and 0.821 MByte on-chip memory in total, while still retaining competitiveness in state-of-the-art accuracy comparisons. It achieves 8.59 ms/frame end-to-end latency on a Rasberry Pi 4B, which is 7.26x faster than the corresponding baseline.</description>

      <title>Nexus-O: An Omni-Perceptive And -Interactive Model for Language, Audio, And Vision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human beings perceive the real world through a spectrum of sensory modalities, encompassing auditory, visual, and linguistic faculties. The journey towards achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates the development of models that can emulate these multifaceted perceptual capabilities and comprehensively understand these diversified data. To this end, we introduce \textbf{Nexus-O}, an industry-level \textbf{omni-perceptive and -interactive} model capable of efficiently processing Audio, Image, Video, and Text data in any combination and output audio/text in an end-to-end way. We systematically investigate Nexus-O by addressing three key research questions: First, how can models be efficiently designed and trained to achieve tri-modal alignment, understanding and reasoning capabilities across multiple modalities? Second, what approaches can be implemented to evaluate tri-modal model robustness, ensuring reliable performance and applicability in real-world scenarios? Third, what strategies can be employed to curate and obtain high-quality, real-life scenario speech datasets? For the first question, we design and pre-train Nexus-O based on the vision-language model, rather than the language model. By pre-training the model over high-quality synthetic audio data, our model is capable of tri-modal perception and interaction. For the second question, we introduce a new audio testbed, Nexus-O-audio, comprising diverse Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) samples, spanning various real-world scenarios, such as corporate meetings and live stream. For the third question, we design the speech data synthesis pipeline to obtain high-quality speech training datasets, covering various real-world scenarios. Comprehensive experimentation and an in-depth analysis of tri-modal alignment over latent space demonstrate the advantages of our model on downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Robust detection of overlapping bioacoustic sound events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for accurately detecting bioacoustic sound events that is robust to overlapping events, a common issue in domains such as ethology, ecology and conservation. While standard methods employ a frame-based, multi-label approach, we introduce an onset-based detection method which we name Voxaboxen. It takes inspiration from object detection methods in computer vision, but simultaneously takes advantage of recent advances in self-supervised audio encoders. For each time window, Voxaboxen predicts whether it contains the start of a vocalization and how long the vocalization is. It also does the same in reverse, predicting whether each window contains the end of a vocalization, and how long ago it started. The two resulting sets of bounding boxes are then fused using a graph-matching algorithm. We also release a new dataset designed to measure performance on detecting overlapping vocalizations. This consists of recordings of zebra finches annotated with temporally-strong labels and showing frequent overlaps. We test Voxaboxen on seven existing data sets and on our new data set. We compare Voxaboxen to natural baselines and existing sound event detection methods and demonstrate SotA results. Further experiments show that improvements are robust to frequent vocalization overlap.</description>

      <title>Aggregation Strategies for Efficient Annotation of Bioacoustic Sound Events Using Active Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vast amounts of audio data collected in Sound Event Detection (SED) applications require efficient annotation strategies to enable supervised learning. Manual labeling is expensive and time-consuming, making Active Learning (AL) a promising approach for reducing annotation effort. We introduce Top K Entropy, a novel uncertainty aggregation strategy for AL that prioritizes the most uncertain segments within an audio recording, instead of averaging uncertainty across all segments. This approach enables the selection of entire recordings for annotation, improving efficiency in sparse data scenarios. We compare Top K Entropy to random sampling and Mean Entropy, and show that fewer labels can lead to the same model performance, particularly in datasets with sparse sound events. Evaluations are conducted on audio mixtures of sound recordings from parks with meerkat, dog, and baby crying sound events, representing real-world bioacoustic monitoring scenarios. Using Top K Entropy for active learning, we can achieve comparable performance to training on the fully labeled dataset with only 8% of the labels. Top K Entropy outperforms Mean Entropy, suggesting that it is best to let the most uncertain segments represent the uncertainty of an audio file. The findings highlight the potential of AL for scalable annotation in audio and time-series applications, including bioacoustics.</description>

      <title>A Hypernetwork-Based Approach to KAN Representation of Audio Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INR) have gained prominence for efficiently encoding multimedia data, yet their applications in audio signals remain limited. This study introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), a novel architecture using learnable activation functions, as an effective INR model for audio representation. KAN demonstrates superior perceptual performance over previous INRs, achieving the lowest Log-SpectralDistance of 1.29 and the highest Perceptual Evaluation of Speech Quality of 3.57 for 1.5 s audio. To extend KAN's utility, we propose FewSound, a hypernetwork-based architecture that enhances INR parameter updates. FewSound outperforms the state-of-the-art HyperSound, with a 33.3% improvement in MSE and 60.87% in SI-SNR. These results show KAN as a robust and adaptable audio representation with the potential for scalability and integration into various hypernetwork frameworks.

      <title>InSerter: Speech Instruction Following with Unsupervised Interleaved Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in speech large language models (SpeechLLMs) have attracted considerable attention. Nonetheless, current methods exhibit suboptimal performance in adhering to speech instructions. Notably, the intelligence of models significantly diminishes when processing speech-form input as compared to direct text-form input. Prior work has attempted to mitigate this semantic inconsistency between speech and text representations through techniques such as representation and behavior alignment, which involve the meticulous design of data pairs during the post-training phase. In this paper, we introduce a simple and scalable training method called InSerter, which stands for Interleaved Speech-Text Representation Pre-training. InSerter is designed to pre-train large-scale unsupervised speech-text sequences, where the speech is synthesized from randomly selected segments of an extensive text corpus using text-to-speech conversion. Consequently, the model acquires the ability to generate textual continuations corresponding to the provided speech segments, obviating the need for intensive data design endeavors. To systematically evaluate speech instruction-following capabilities, we introduce SpeechInstructBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for speech-oriented instruction-following tasks. Our proposed InSerter achieves SOTA performance in SpeechInstructBench and demonstrates superior or competitive results across diverse speech processing tasks.</description>

      <title>A Multimodal Symphony: Integrating Taste and Sound through Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, neuroscientific and psychological research has traced direct relationships between taste and auditory perceptions. This article explores multimodal generative models capable of converting taste information into music, building on this foundational research. We provide a brief review of the state of the art in this field, highlighting key findings and methodologies. We present an experiment in which a fine-tuned version of a generative music model (MusicGEN) is used to generate music based on detailed taste descriptions provided for each musical piece. The results are promising: according the participants' ($n=111$) evaluation, the fine-tuned model produces music that more coherently reflects the input taste descriptions compared to the non-fine-tuned model. This study represents a significant step towards understanding and developing embodied interactions between AI, sound, and taste, opening new possibilities in the field of generative AI. We release our dataset, code and pre-trained model at: https://osf.io/xs5jy/.</description>

      <title>Language model integration based on memory control for sequence to sequence speech recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.02162</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.02162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore several new schemes to train a seq2seq model to integrate a pre-trained LM. Our proposed fusion methods focus on the memory cell state and the hidden state in the seq2seq decoder long short-term memory (LSTM), and the memory cell state is updated by the LM unlike the prior studies. This means the memory retained by the main seq2seq would be adjusted by the external LM. These fusion methods have several variants depending on the architecture of this memory cell update and the use of memory cell and hidden states which directly affects the final label inference. We performed the experiments to show the effectiveness of the proposed methods in a mono-lingual ASR setup on the Librispeech corpus and in a transfer learning setup from a multilingual ASR (MLASR) base model to a low-resourced language. In Librispeech, our best model improved WER by 3.7%, 2.4% for test clean, test other relatively to the shallow fusion baseline, with multi-level decoding. In transfer learning from an MLASR base model to the IARPA Babel Swahili model, the best scheme improved the transferred model on eval set by 9.9%, 9.8% in CER, WER relatively to the 2-stage transfer baseline.</description>

      <title>A Frequency-aware Augmentation Network for Mental Disorders Assessment from Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Depression and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) stand out as the common mental health challenges today. In affective computing, speech signals serve as effective biomarkers for mental disorder assessment. Current research, relying on labor-intensive hand-crafted features or simplistic time-frequency representations, often overlooks critical details by not accounting for the differential impacts of various frequency bands and temporal fluctuations. Therefore, we propose a frequency-aware augmentation network with dynamic convolution for depression and ADHD assessment. In the proposed method, the spectrogram is used as the input feature and adopts a multi-scale convolution to help the network focus on discriminative frequency bands related to mental disorders. A dynamic convolution is also designed to aggregate multiple convolution kernels dynamically based upon their attentions which are input-independent to capture dynamic information. Finally, a feature augmentation block is proposed to enhance the feature representation ability and make full use of the captured information. Experimental results on AVEC 2014 and self-recorded ADHD dataset prove the robustness of our method, an RMSE of 9.23 was attained for estimating depression severity, along with an accuracy of 89.8\% in detecting ADHD.</description>

      <title>LLaSE-G1: Incentivizing Generalization Capability for LLaMA-based Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in semantic understanding and contextual modeling, which have flourished in generative speech enhancement (SE). However, many LM-based SE approaches primarily focus on semantic information, often neglecting the critical role of acoustic information, which leads to acoustic inconsistency after enhancement and limited generalization across diverse SE tasks. In this paper, we introduce LLaSE-G1, a LLaMA-based language model that incentivizes generalization capabilities for speech enhancement. LLaSE-G1 offers the following key contributions: First, to mitigate acoustic inconsistency, LLaSE-G1 employs continuous representations from WavLM as input and predicts speech tokens from X-Codec2, maximizing acoustic preservation. Second, to promote generalization capability, LLaSE-G1 introduces dual-channel inputs and outputs, unifying multiple SE tasks without requiring task-specific IDs. Third, LLaSE-G1 outperforms prior task-specific discriminative and generative SE models, demonstrating scaling effects at test time and emerging capabilities for unseen SE tasks. Additionally, we release our code and models to support further research in this area.</description>

Abstract: Creating Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that are robust and resilient to classroom conditions is paramount to the development of AI tools to aid teachers and students. In this work, we study the efficacy of continued pretraining (CPT) in adapting Wav2vec2.0 to the classroom domain. We show that CPT is a powerful tool in that regard and reduces the Word Error Rate (WER) of Wav2vec2.0-based models by upwards of 10%. More specifically, CPT improves the model's robustness to different noises, microphones and classroom conditions.</description>

      <title>Improving Pronunciation and Accent Conversion through Knowledge Distillation And Synthetic Ground-Truth from Native TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous approaches on accent conversion (AC) mainly aimed at making non-native speech sound more native while maintaining the original content and speaker identity. However, non-native speakers sometimes have pronunciation issues, which can make it difficult for listeners to understand them. Hence, we developed a new AC approach that not only focuses on accent conversion but also improves pronunciation of non-native accented speaker. By providing the non-native audio and the corresponding transcript, we generate the ideal ground-truth audio with native-like pronunciation with original duration and prosody. This ground-truth data aids the model in learning a direct mapping between accented and native speech. We utilize the end-to-end VITS framework to achieve high-quality waveform reconstruction for the AC task. As a result, our system not only produces audio that closely resembles native accents and while retaining the original speaker's identity but also improve pronunciation, as demonstrated by evaluation results.</description>
