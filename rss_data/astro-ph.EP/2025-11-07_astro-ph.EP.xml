      <title>Super amplification of lunar response to gravitational waves driven by thick crust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Moon has been long regarded as a natural resonator of gravitational waves (GWs) since 1960, showing great potential to fill the frequency gap left behind GW detections by ground- or space-based laser interferometry. However, the spatial variation of this amplification capacity on the Moon remains unclear. Here, we numerically simulate the lunar response to GWs by fully considering the fluctuant topography and laterally heterogeneous interior structures. Our results show that most regions on the Moon can amplify GWs with a ratio over 2, a finding significantly higher than previous estimations. Particularly, the amplification ratio can even reach factors of tens at the resonant frequency of ~0.015 Hz on the highlands surrounding the South Pole-Aitken (SPA) basin, where the regional crust is the thickest. Our findings establish the thick-crust regions as critical zones of GW amplification, which is essential for future landing site selection and instrumental setting for GW detection on the Moon.</description>

      <title>Early evidence for isotropic planetary obliquities in young super-Jupiter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This decade has seen the first measurements of extrasolar planetary obliquities, characterizing how an exoplanet's spin axis is oriented relative to its orbital axis. These measurements are enabled by combining projected rotational velocities, planetary rotation periods, and astrometric orbits for directly-imaged super-Jupiters. This approach constrains both the spin axis and orbital inclination relative to the line of sight, allowing obliquity measurements for individual systems and offering new insights into their formation. To test whether these super-Jupiters form more like scaled-up planets or scaled-down stars, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer their population-level obliquity distribution. Using a single-parameter Fisher distribution, we compare two models: a planet-like formation scenario ($\kappa=5$) predicting moderate alignment, versus a brown dwarf-like formation scenario ($\kappa=0$) predicting isotropic obliquities. Based on a sample of four young super-Jupiter systems, we find early evidence favoring the isotropic case with a Bayes factor of 15, consistent with turbulent fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Limiting Eccentricity in Restricted Hierarchical Three-Body Systems with Short-Range Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hierarchical three-body model can be widely applied to diverse astrophysical settings, from satellite-planet-star systems to binaries around supermassive black holes. The octupole-order perturbation on the inner binary from the tertiary can induce extreme eccentricities and cause orbital flips of the binary, but short-range forces such as those due to General Relativity (GR) may suppress extreme eccentricity excitations. In this paper, we consider restricted hierarchical three-body systems, where the inner binary has a test-mass component. We investigate the maximum possible eccentricity (called "limiting eccentricity") attainable by the inner binary under the influence of the tertiary perturbations and GR effect. In systems with sufficiently high hierarchy, the double averaging (DA) model is a good approximation; we show that the orbits which can flip under the octupole-order perturbation reach the same limiting eccentricity, which can be calculated analytically using the quadrupole-order Hamiltonian. In systems with moderate hierarchy, DA breaks down and the so-called Brown Hamiltonian is often introduced as a correction term; we show that this does not change the limiting eccentricity. Finally, we employ the single averaging (SA) model and find that the limiting eccentricity in the SA model is higher than the one in the DA model. We derive an analytical scaling for the modified limiting eccentricity in the SA model.</description>

      <title>Magnetohydrodynamic simulation assessment of a potential near-ultraviolet early ingress in WASP-189b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) in close orbits around early-type stars provide natural laboratories for studying atmospheric escape and star-planet interactions under extreme irradiation and wind conditions. The near-ultraviolet (NUV) regime is particularly sensitive to extended upper atmospheric and magnetospheric structures. We investigate whether star-planet interactions in the WASP-189 system could plausibly account for the early ingress feature suggested by NUV transit fitting models. We analyzed three NUV transits of WASP-189b observed as part of the Colorado Ultraviolet Transit Experiment (CUTE), which employs a 6U CubeSat dedicated to exoplanet spectroscopy. To explore whether the observed transit asymmetry could plausibly arise from a magnetospheric bow shock (MBS), we performed magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations using representative stellar wind velocities and planetary atmospheric densities. During Visit 3, we identified an approximately 31.5-minute phase offset that is consistent with an early ingress. Our MHD simulations indicate that with a wind speed of 573 km s-1 and an upper atmospheric density of about 4.6e-11 kg m-3, a higher-density zone due to compression can form ahead of the planet within five planetary radii where the fast-mode Mach number falls below ~0.56, even without a MBS. Shock cooling and crossing time estimates suggest that such a pileup could produce detectable NUV absorption. Our results indicate that while MBS formation is feasible for WASP-189b, low stellar-wind speeds favor NUV-detectable magnetic pileups over classical bow shocks and enhance the potential detectability of early-ingress signatures.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic analysis of hydrogen and silicon in bright fireballs: New insights into meteoroid composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the high-temperature spectral component in meteor fireballs, with a particular focus on neutral hydrogen at 656.28 nm and ionised silicon doublet at 634.71 nm and 637.14 nm. By analysing spectra from the European Fireball Network (EN) that exhibit H$\alpha$ and Si~II emissions, we investigated the relationship between H and Si abundances across different meteoroid types. The plasma temperature of the high-temperature component remains independent of meteor velocity. This allows us to directly compare relative intensities of volatile hydrogen with less volatile silicon in bodies with different velocities. Our results confirmed that the H/Si value remains largely independent of meteor velocity. We show a positive correlation with photometric mass for cometary meteoroids, suggesting that larger bodies better preserve their volatile content, namely hydrogen. This correlation persists across the meteor showers, showing a physical process related to volatile preservation rather than specific parent body composition. Our data suggest that the abundance of hydrogen in large cometary meteoroids is not only higher than in CI chondrites, but is also comparable to or higher than the measured abundances in small particles of dust from Halley's comet, depending on the assumed plasma conditions. This work brought new constraints on the distribution and preservation of volatile elements in Solar System bodies and new insights into the potential delivery mechanisms of water to Earth. The prevalence of hydrogen in larger cometary meteoroids supports models where comets could be significant contributors to Earth's volatile inventory.</description>

      <title>Transiting Exoplanets from Sharjah Astronomical Observatory (SAO-M47): The Exoplanet HAT-P-25b Using L and V Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis of observations carried out on the exoplanet HAT-P-25 b at the Sharjah Astronomical Observatory (SAO). We have employed two distinct filters, namely, the Luminoso (L) and Visual (V) filters. Our research aims to discern any variations in transit depth or exoplanet size resulting from the use of these different filters. The primary focus of this study is to determine the exoplanet's size relative to its host star using the transit method. The application of different filters was expected to introduce subtle variations in size, influenced by factors such as the exoplanet's atmosphere. Notably, our findings reveal that the exoplanet's size appears larger when observed through the L filter compared to the V filter. Throughout the analytical process, we employed the TRASCA model to determine the transit depth for each epoch. Fixed parameters, including the orbital period of the exoplanet (P, measured in days) and the transit duration (measured in minutes), were utilized in these calculations. Our results indicate that the transit depths observed with the L filter were greater than those with the V filter, measuring 0.0238 magnitudes and 0.0200 magnitudes, respectively. These values deviate from the reference result of 0.0204 magnitudes.</description>

      <title>How the gradient of $M_{\rm d}$ versus UV field strength yields insights into the ages of protoplanetary disc populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FUV radiation from massive stars launch photoevaporative winds from the outer regions of protoplanetary discs around other stars, removing gas and dust. Observations have identified a relation between the median dust disc mass and the external UV field strength. Here we use disc evolutionary models to explore how this relation evolves over time, and with respect to other stellar and disc properties. We find that the slope for the relationship $\lambda_{\rm UV}$ flattens over time as populations age, possibly explaining the differences seen between the L1641-N and L1641-S clusters in Orion A. We determine that $\lambda_{\rm UV}$ depends on the stellar mass where more massive stars exhibit steeper gradients than their lesser counterparts, in agreement with the differences seen between Herbig and T Tauri stars. Additionally, the strength of the mechanism for angular momentum transport, either viscosity or MHD disc winds, is found to significantly affect $\lambda_{\rm UV}$ with stronger $\alpha$ values reducing $\lambda_{\rm UV}$ due to more material accreting on to the central stars in weaker UV environments. Estimates of $\lambda_{\rm UV}$ from observations of L1641 place preliminary constraints on $\alpha$ to be between $10^{-3.5}$--$10^{-2.5}$, consistent with literature estimates. Further observations in different regions and better classifications of stellar masses will allow us to place stringent constraints on disc evolution properties, improving our understanding of how protoplanetary discs evolve.</description>

      <title>Dust Collisions in Protoplanetary Disks: Atomic Simulations of the Surface Free Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coagulation of dust particles in protoplanetary disks is the first step on the journey to the formation of planets. The surface free energy (SFE) of the dust particles determines the effectiveness of particles sticking to each other after collision, as well as the critical collision velocity above which fragmentation will occur. Studies of SFE have focused on the simplest silicate, silica, usually at standard temperature and pressure. However, protoplanetary dust grains have a wide variety of mineralogical compositions, temperatures, and a low-pressure environment lacking in water vapor. We perform molecular dynamics simulations using a ReaxFF-type potential of the SFE of silica, albite, and anorthite at temperatures ranging from 30 to 700 K in a true vacuum. We find that the SFE drops by tens of percent with increasing temperature or shifting to more complex silicate compositions. More dramatically, we find that the values of the SFE in a vacuum are two orders of magnitude higher than those usually measured in terrestrial laboratories. Our results confirm previous work that suggests that hydroxylation by monolayers of water produces this reduction in SFE in experiments. The coagulation of dust grains thus appears to depend critically on the cleanliness of their surfaces, as well as their temperature and composition.</description>

      <title>On the Exoplanet Yield of Gaia Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-examine the expected yield of Gaia astrometric planet detections using updated models for giant-planet occurrence, the local stellar population, and Gaia's demonstrated astrometric precision. Our analysis combines a semi-analytic model that clarifies key scaling relations with more realistic Monte Carlo simulations. We predict $7{,}500 \pm 2{,}100$ planet discoveries in the 5-year dataset (DR4) and $120{,}000 \pm 22{,}000$ over the full 10-year mission (DR5), with the dominant error arising from uncertainties in giant-planet occurrence. We evaluate the sensitivity of these forecasts to the detection threshold and the desired precision for measurements of planet masses and orbital parameters. Roughly $1{,}900 \pm 540$ planets in DR4 and $38{,}000 \pm 7{,}300$ planets in DR5 should have masses and orbital periods determined to better than $20$%. Most detections will be super-Jupiters ($3$ - $13 M_{\rm J}$) on $2$ - $5$AU orbits around GKM-type stars ($0.4$ - $1.3 M_\odot$) within $500$ pc. Unresolved binary stars will lead to spurious planet detections, but we estimate that genuine planets will outnumber them by a factor of $5$ or more. An exception is planets around M-dwarfs with $a &lt; 1$AU, for which the false-positive rate is expected to be about $50$%. To support community preparation for upcoming data releases, we provide mock catalogs of Gaia exoplanets and planet-impostor binaries.</description>

      <title>The Pre-Outburst Properties of the FU Ori Object HBC 722</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FU Ori outbursts are thought to play an important role in stellar assembly and the evolution of protoplanetary disks. However, the progenitor young stellar objects are largely uncharacterized. We obtained a low-resolution optical spectrum of HBC 722 before its FU Ori outburst as part of a survey of young stellar objects in the North America Nebula. The spectrum yields a spectral type of M3.3$\pm$0.4, which when combined with archival photometry allows us to measure the stellar and accretion properties of a young star prior to its FU Ori outburst. The pre-outburst accretion rate of $7\times10^{-9}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is high for a protoplanetary disk around an M3-M3.5 star, though about 15,000 times weaker than the accretion rate during the outburst. The pre-outburst variability, inferred from archival B-band photometry, is about a factor 5 with a standard deviation of 0.16 dex and is consistent with variable accretion onto young low-mass stars. The stellar radius is larger than the radius of accreting young stars of similar spectral type by a factor of two. The extinction to HBC 722 is $\sim 1.45\pm0.3$~mag, lower than the 2.5--3.7~mag extinction values measured during the outburst. The u-band photometry plays an especially important role in constraining the veiling at longer wavelengths and therefore also the extinction and photospheric luminosity.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Mean-Motion Resonances Can Form in Type-I Disk Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type-I disk migration can form a chain of planets engaged in first-order mean-motion resonances (MMRs) parked at the disk inner edge. However, while second- or even third-order resonances were deemed unlikely due to their weaker strength, they have been observed in some planetary systems (e.g. TOI-178 bc: 5:3, TOI-1136 ef: 7:5, TRAPPIST-1 bcd: 8:5-5:3). We performed $&gt;6,000$ Type-I simulations of multi-planet systems that mimic the observed {\it Kepler} sample in terms of stellar mass, planet size, multiplicity, and intra-system uniformity over a parameter space encompassing transitional and truncated disks. We found that Type-I migration coupled with a disk inner edge can indeed produce second- and third-order resonances (in a state of libration) in $\sim 10\%$ and 2\% of resonant-chain systems, respectively. Moreover, the relative occurrence of first- and second-order MMRs in our simulations is consistent with observations (e.g. 3:2 is more common than 2:1; while second-order 5:3 is more common than 7:5). The formation of higher-order MMRs favors slower disk migration and a smaller outer planet mass. Higher-order resonances do not have to form with the help of a Laplace-like three-body resonance as was proposed for TRAPPIST-1. Instead, the formation of higher-order resonance is assisted by breaking a pre-existing first-order resonance, which generates small but non-zero initial eccentricities ($e\approx10^{-3}$ to 10$^{-2}$). We predict that 1) librating higher-order resonances have higher equilibrium $e$ ($\sim 0.1$); 2) are more likely found as an isolated pair in an otherwise first-order chain; 3) more likely emerge in the inner pairs of a chain.</description>

      <title>Order-by-order Modeling of Exoplanet Radial Velocity Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16139v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise radial velocity (RV) measurements are a crucial tool for exoplanet discovery and characterization. Today, the majority of these measurements are derived from Echelle spectra in the optical wavelength region using cross-correlation techniques. Although for certain stars these approaches can produce RVs with sub-1 m~s$^{-1}$ measurement errors, for many others, we are now in a regime where instrumental precision is fundamentally below the intrinsic RV variations of the star that result from astrophysical processes that can be correlated in both time and wavelength. We explore new methods for measuring exoplanet orbital parameters that take advantage of the fact that RV data sets are fundamentally multi-wavelength. By analyzing NEID extremely precise radial velocity (EPRV) data of three known exoplanet systems, we show that fitting a single Keplerian model to multi-wavelength RVs can produce a factor of 1.5 -- 6.8 better $M_p \sin i$ uncertainties compared to fitting RVs that are derived from a weighted average across wavelength.</description>

Fixed aperture photometry of the comet is well described by a power law function of heliocentric distance, rH, with the exponent (``index") n = 3.8+/-0.3 across the 4.6 au to 1.8 au distance range (phase function 0.04+/-0.02 magnitude/degree assumed). This indicates that the dust production rates vary in proportion to rH**(-1.8+/-0.3). An rH**(-2) variation is expected of a strongly volatile material, and consistent with independent spectroscopic observations showing that carbon dioxide is the primary driver of activity. The measured heliocentric index is unremarkable in the context of solar system comets, for which n is widely dispersed, and provides no basis on which to describe 3I as either dynamically old (thermally processed) or new (pristine). The morphology of the comet changes from a Sun-facing dust fan in the early 2025 July observations, to one dominated by an antisolar dust tail at later dates. We attribute the delayed emergence of the tail to the large size (effective radius 0.1 mm) and slow ejection (5 m/s) of the optically dominant dust particles, and their consequently sluggish response to solar radiation pressure. Small (micron-sized) particles may be present but not in numbers sufficient to dominate the scattering cross-section. Their relative depletion possibly reflects interparticle cohesion, which binds small particles more effectively than large ones. A similar preponderance of 0.1 mm grains was reported in 2I/Borisov. However, 2I differed from 3I in having a much smaller (asteroid-like) heliocentric index, n = 1.9+/-0.1. Dust production rates in 3I are 180 kg/s at 2 au, compared with 70 kg/s in 2I/Borisov at the same distance.</description>

Abstract: The post-main sequence evolution of stars is expected to impact the exoplanets residing on close-in orbits around them. Using photometric data from the TESS Full-Frame-Images we have performed a transit search for exoplanets with post-main sequence hosts to search for the imprints of these impacts on the giant planet population. We detect 130 short period planets and candidates, thirty-three of which are newly discovered candidates, from a sample of 456,941 post-main sequence stars spanning the evolutionary stages from the end of the main sequence to the bottom of the red giant branch. We measure an occurrence rate of $0.28 \pm 0.04$% for short period giant planets orbiting post-main sequence stars. We also measure occurrence rates for two stellar sub-populations, measuring values of $0.35 \pm 0.05$% for a sub-population representing the earliest stages of post-main sequence evolution and $0.11^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$% for a sub-population of more evolved stars. We show that the giant planet occurrence rate decreases with increasing stellar evolution stage, with a larger occurrence rate decrease observed for shorter period planets. Our results are clear evidence that the population of short period giant planets is being sculpted by the post-main sequence evolution of the host stars, and we conclude that this is most likely through the destruction of these giant planets through the increased strength of planet-star tidal interactions resulting in the rapid tidal decay of the planets' orbits.</description>

      <title>Ionospheric responses over the Antarctic region to Intense Space Weather events: Plasma Convection vs. Auroral Precipitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present investigation is directed at exploring southern polar ionospheric responses to intense space weather events and their correlations with plasma convection and auroral precipitation. The main phases of six geomagnetic storms occurring in the year 2023 (ascending phase of the present solar cycle) are considered for this study. The ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements derived from GPS receivers covering the Antarctic region are used for probing the electron density perturbations during these events. Auroral precipitation maps are shown to illustrate the locations of the GPS stations relative to particle precipitation. SuperDARN maps are shown to understand the effects of plasma convection over these locations. Correlation between the enhanced TEC observations with the auroral precipitation (R $\sim$ 0.31) and the plasma convection (R $\sim$ 0.88) reveals that the latter is more responsible for causing significant enhancements in the diurnal maximum values of TEC over the Antarctic region in comparison to the former. Therefore, this work shows correlation studies between two physical processes and ionospheric density enhancements over the under-explored south polar region under strong levels of geomagnetic activity during 2023.</description>
