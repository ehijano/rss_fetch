      <title>Systematic biases in parameter estimation on LISA binaries. II. The effect of excluding higher harmonics for spin-aligned, high-mass binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will observe massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) with astoundingly high signal-to-noise ratio, leaving parameter estimation with these signals susceptible to seemingly small waveform errors. Of particular concern for MBHBs are errors due to neglected higher-order modes. We extend Yi et al. [arXiv:2502.12237] to examine errors due to neglected higher-order modes for MBHBs with nonzero (aligned) progenitor spins and total mass up to $10^8\,M_\odot$. For these very massive systems, there can be regions of parameter space in which the $(\ell, |m|)=(2,\,2)$ modes are no longer dominant with respect to higher-order ones. We find that the extent of systematic bias can change significantly when varying the progenitor spins of the binary. We also find that for the heaviest, and therefore shortest, MBHB signals, slight systematic errors can cause severe mis-inference of the sky localization parameters. We propose an improved likelihood optimization scheme with respect to previous work as a way to predict these effects in a computationally efficient manner.</description>

      <title>Optical Signatures of a Schwarzschild Black Hole in a Dehnen-Type Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the optical effects that occur near a Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) with a Dehnen-type $(1,4,2)$ dark matter (DM) halo are explored. We first derive the photon sphere radius and obtain an analytical expression for the deflection angle in the weak-field regime by applying the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT). For the strong-field regime, we perform ray-tracing calculations to examine the behavior of light trajectories and determine the corresponding number of orbits. We further compute the BH shadow and gravitational lensing in a plasma medium and provide constraints arising from the DM halo parameters. We also extend our analysis to weak gravitational lensing within plasma environments, considering both uniform and singular isothermal sphere (SIS) distributions. We find the analytical expressions for the deflection angle in the presence of plasma and examine the resulting effects on image magnification. The overall results highlight how DM halo properties and plasma characteristics jointly alter observable lensing signatures.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves in a minimal gravitational SME</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the generation and propagation of gravitational waves within a minimal gravitational SME (Standard Model Extension). Starting from the modified graviton dispersion relation derived in the linearized gravity sector, we analyze the polarization properties of gravitational waves in the transverse-traceless tensor sector. We then construct the retarded Green function associated with the Lorentz-violating wave operator, explicitly verifying the causal structure of the theory and identifying the modified propagation speeds of the tensorial modes. In addition, we study the source-induced emission of gravitational waves from a binary black-hole system. We show that the gravitational waveform preserves the standard quadrupolar amplitude and polarization structure, while Lorentz-violating effects enter exclusively through a modification of the retarded time. As a result, the spatial components of the metric perturbation $h_{ij}(t,r)$ acquire a phase shift determined by the SME coefficients. Finally, we estimate phenomenological bounds to the model under consideration.</description>

      <title>Temperature of a spinning black hole via a simple derivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to current theory a black hole has a nonzero temperature and thus radiates like any black body. This remarkable result was first shown by Hawking for a non-spinning black hole using general relativity to describe the black hole gravitational field and quantum field theory to describe the radiation. Since then the temperature of a spinning Kerr black hole has been calculated. There have also been many heuristic derivations for the temperature. In this work we derive the temperature of a Kerr spinning black hole using only classical general relativity and thermodynamics. It is very similar to Ref. 11 but is mathematically simpler and more self-contained. Our purpose is mainly pedagogical, to be more accessible to students and non-specialists with a knowledge of general relativity. We also call further attention to the expected explosive evaporation of small black holes, not yet observed, which would be an almost unique window into Planck scale physics. Finally, we discuss the idea that the cosmological dark matter, whose nature is currently unknown, may be composed of small primordial black hole remnants.</description>

      <title>Towards a quantitative characterization of gravitational universality classes for order-4 random tensor models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random tensor models can be used as combinatorial devices to generate Euclidean dynamical triangulations. A physical continuum limit of dynamical triangulations requires a suitable generalization of the double-scaling limit of random matrices. This limit corresponds to a fixed point of a pregeometric Renormalization Group flow in which the tensor size $N$ serves as the Renormalization Group scale. We search for corresponding fixed points in order-4 random tensor models associated to dynamical triangulations in 4 dimensions. In a $O(N)^{\otimes 4}$ symmetric setting, we discuss the resulting phase portrait as a function of the regulator parameters. We optimize our results, identifying parameter values for which the results are minimally sensitive to parameter changes. We find three fixed-point candidates: only one of them is real across the entire parameter range, but only has two relevant directions. This should be contrasted with the university class of the Reuter fixed point in continuum quantum gravity, very likely characterized by three relevant directions. We conclude that simple combinatorial models of Euclidean triangulations and the Reuter fixed point most likely lie in different universality classes.</description>

      <title>A Small Patch Hypothesis in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If our observable Universe is only a tiny region of a vastly larger and conformally older spacetime, then the usual formulations of the classical flatness and horizon problems of the Hot Big Bang can be reinterpreted as artifacts manifesting an observational selection effect; we occupy a small causal domain of a much larger causally-connected and possibly non-flat spacetime. A sufficiently large positive cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, sets the future asymptotic horizon scale of the observable Universe, $\sim$$\Lambda^{-1/2}$, thereby implying that the observable Universe may simply be a minute patch of a far larger pre-existing one, hereafter a Small Patch Hypothesis. Importantly, this observational bound is purely geometric; regardless of when the Universe is observed, the maximum accessible scale is finite and fixed by $\Lambda$, independent of inflationary dynamics, anthropic arguments, or assumptions about the global hosting spacetime. In this sense, inflation becomes one viable realization of the proposed Small Patch Hypothesis. Here, one particular non-inflationary alternative is considered for illustrative purposes in which a primordial spectrum grows logarithmically toward large scales, and in fact diverges at some finite $k_{c}$. If $k_{c}\ll \Lambda^{-1/2}$, then our local cosmic patch probes only the linear regime and appears exceptionally smooth. Over the comparatively narrow observable window, this power spectrum mimics a slightly red-tilted, inflation-like spectrum. Rather than introducing high-energy new fields, this perspective frames large-scale homogeneity, isotropy, Gaussianity, adiabaticity, and the observed thermodynamic Arrow of Time as possible consequences of restricted observational access to a much larger Universe in equilibrium, rather than signatures of a unique early-Universe mechanism.

      <title>Gravitational wave signatures from periodic orbits around a Schwarzschild-Bertotti-Robinson black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate periodic bound orbits and gravitational wave (GW) emission in the Schwarzschild-Bertotti-Robinson (Schwarzschild-BR) spacetime-an exact electrovacuum solution describing a static black hole (BH) immersed in a uniform magnetic field. We explore how the background magnetic field qualitatively alters the BH's gravitational dynamics, affecting timelike geodesics such as the marginally bound orbit (MBO) and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO). We then analyze periodic bound orbits using the frequency ratio ${\omega_{\varphi}}/{\omega_{r}}$, which characterizes the orbits by their azimuthal and radial motions. Based on the numerical kludge method we further compute the gravitational waveforms emitted from periodic orbits around a supermassive Schwarzschild-BR BH. We show that the background magnetic field significantly changes orbital frequencies, resonance conditions, zoom-whirl structures, and the resulting waveforms. Finally, we examine the frequency spectra in the mHz range and the detectability of these GW signals by computing the characteristic strain via a discrete Fourier transform on the time-domain waveforms, comparing the results with the sensitivity curves of space-based GW detectors such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin. Our results show that intrinsically magnetic fields modify spacetime and leave observable imprints on extreme mass-ratio inspiral GWs, which may be tested by future observations.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Interacting Early Dark Energy from a Modified Temperature-Redshift Relation and CMB Acoustic Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble tension, reflecting a persistent discrepancy between early- and late-time determinations of the Hubble constant, continues to motivate extensions of the standard cosmological model The Hubble tension motivates extensions of the standard cosmological model that modify pre-recombination physics. In this work we study an early dark energy scalar field coupled to radiation prior to recombination. The interaction leads to energy exchange between the two components and modifies the standard cosmic microwave background temperature redshift relation.
  We derive the modified temperature evolution from the background equations and interpret it in terms of effective photon non-conservation. We also study linear scalar perturbations in the tight-coupling regime relevant for cosmic microwave background acoustic physics. We show that the interaction affects the background evolution without introducing new dynamical degrees of freedom at the perturbation level.
  The dominant observational effect arises through a shift in the sound horizon at recombination, which modifies the angular acoustic scale. Using the Planck constraint on the acoustic scale we obtain a consistency bound on the coupling strength and show that deviations from the standard temperature redshift relation are tightly constrained.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy Signatures from a New Transition $Om(z)$ Parametrization in Flat FLRW Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a cosmic scenario using a new transition parameterization of the $Om(z)$ diagnostic, $Om(z) = \frac{z^l}{(1+z)^m}$, in the spatially flat Friedmann Lema\^itre Robertson-Walker (FLRW) framework. Using observational datasets such as Observational Hubble Data (OHD), Pantheon Plus (PP), and SH0ES, we analyze the evolution of the $Om(z)$ function to probe deviations from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and constrain free parameter space {$H_0$, l, m } using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis with the emcee sampler. Our analysis reveals a clear transition in the slope of $Om(z)$ from negative to positive at transition redshift values $z_t \approx 1.41$, $0.65$, and $0.33$ for the OHD, OHD+PP, and OHD+PP$\&amp;$SH0ES datasets, respectively. This behavior suggests a dynamical evolution of dark energy, indicating a transition from a quintessence-like phase to a phantom regime. From the combined OHD+PP$\&amp;$SH0ES dataset, we obtain a best-fit value of the Hubble constant \( H_0 = 73.01 \pm 0.36 \, \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}} \), which is consistent with the SH0ES calibration and supports the viability of our model. Additionally, our analysis indicates that the current age of the Universe is approximately $13 \sim 14$ Gyr from all available combinations of datasets, which is consistent with observational expectations. Further, we find that the deceleration-to-acceleration transition, which marks the beginning of cosmic acceleration, is inferred to occur within the redshift interval $z_t \in [0.5, 0.8]$, highlighting the emergence of dark energy as the dominant component in the Universe's recent expansion history. Our transition $Om(z)$ parameterization captured progressive cosmological changes and enabled seamless interpolation over cosmic epochs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically revisits the critical orbits of test particles moving in various black hole backgrounds, including the Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m, Kerr, and Kerr-Newman spacetimes. We identify the critical orbit cases directly from the root structure of the radial equation, and provide explicit expressions relating the relevant parameters -- energy, angular momentum, and charge-to-mass ratio -- to the critical radius, as well as explicit expressions for the critical orbits in each scenario. Special attention is given to the relationship between the photon spheres, black hole shadows and the critical null geodesics. Extensive numerical results are also provided.</description>

Abstract: The spatially homogeneous perfect fluid solutions by Kompanneets-Chernov-Kantowski-Sachs are interpreted as a thermodynamic perfect fluid in isentropic evolution, namely, the isentropic limit of their non-homogeneous generalizations, the T-models. Some specific solutions that model a generic ideal gas are examined, and the associated thermodynamic variables are obtained. We show that the necessary macroscopic conditions for physical reality are fulfilled in wide spacetime domains. The field equations for a classical ideal gas are established, and the behavior of the solution is analyzed. The models fulfilling a relativistic $\gamma$-law are also examined, and the solutions for some particular cases are obtained.</description>

      <title>Resummed energy loss in extreme-mass-ratio scattering using critical orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent efforts to bridge between weak-field and strong-field descriptions of black-hole binary dynamics, we develop a resummation scheme for post-Minkowskian radiative observables in extreme-mass-ratio scattering, augmented with post-Newtonian terms. Specifically, we derive universal interpolation formulas for the total energy emitted in gravitational waves out to infinity and down the event horizon of the large black hole, valid to leading order in the small mass ratio. We test our formulas using numerical results from direct calculations in black hole perturbation theory. The central idea of our approach is to utilize as a strong-field diagnostic the known form of divergence in the radiated energy along geodesics near the parameter-space separatrix between scattering and plunge. The dominant, logarithmic term of this divergence can be expressed in terms of instantaneous energy fluxes calculated along the unstable circular geodesics that form the separatrix, fluxes that we obtain using interpolation of highly accurate numerical data. The same idea could be applied to bound-orbit radiative observables via either unbound-to-bound mapping or a direct resummation of bound-orbit post-Newtonian expressions.</description>

      <title>FPIC: a new Particle-In-Cell code for stationary and axisymmetric black-hole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a newly developed GRPIC code framework called FPIC, providing a detailed description of the Maxwell-equations solver, of the particle ``pushers'', and of the other algorithms that are needed in this approach. We describe in detail the code, which is written in Fortran and exploits parallel architectures using MPI directives both for the fields and particles. FPIC adopts spherical Kerr-Schild coordinates, which encode the overall spherical topology of the problem while remaining regular at the event horizon. The Maxwell equations are evolved using a finite-difference time-domain solver with a leapfrog scheme, while multiple particle ``pushers'' are implemented for the evolution of the particles. In addition to well-known algorithms, we introduce a novel hybrid method that dynamically switches between the most appropriate scheme based on the violation of the Hamiltonian energy. We first present results for neutral particles orbiting around black holes, both in the Schwarzschild and Kerr metrics, monitoring the evolution of the Hamiltonian error across different integration schemes. We apply our hybrid approach, showing that it is capable of achieving improved energy conservation at reduced computational cost. We apply FPIC to investigate the Wald solution, first in electrovacuum and subsequently in plasma-filled configurations. In the latter case, particles with negative energy at infinity are present inside the ergosphere, indicating that the Penrose process is active. Finally, we present the split-monopole solution in a plasma-filled environment and successfully reproduce the Blandford-Znajek luminosity, finding very good agreement with analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Area Scaling of Dynamical Degrees of Freedom in Regularised Scalar Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How many canonical degrees of freedom does a quantum field theory actually use during its Hamiltonian evolution? For a UV/IR-regularised classical scalar field, we address this question directly at the level of phase-space dynamics by identifying the minimal symplectic dimension required to reproduce a single trajectory by an autonomous Hamiltonian system. Using symplectic model order reduction as a structure-preserving diagnostic, we show that for the free scalar field this minimal dimension is controlled not by the volume-extensive number of discretised field variables, but by the much smaller number of distinct normal-mode frequencies below the ultraviolet cutoff. In flat space, this leads to an area-type scaling with the size of the region, up to slowly varying corrections. On geodesic balls in maximally symmetric curved spaces, positive curvature induces mild super-area growth, while negative curvature suppresses the scaling, with the flat result recovered smoothly in the small-curvature limit. Numerical experiments further indicate that this behaviour persists in weakly interacting $\lambda\phi^4$ theory over quasi-integrable time scales. Beyond counting, the reduced dynamics exhibits a distinctive internal structure: it decomposes into independent oscillator blocks, while linear combinations of these blocks generate a larger family of apparent field modes whose Poisson brackets are governed by a projector rather than the identity. This reveals a purely classical and dynamical mechanism by which overlapping degrees of freedom arise, without modifying canonical structures by hand. Our results provide a controlled field-theoretic setting in which area-type scaling and overlap phenomena can be studied prior to quantisation, helping to identify which aspects of such structures--often discussed in holographic contexts--can already arise from classical Hamiltonian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Polarization Signatures of Inspiraling Hotspots around Kerr Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarimetric interferometry is a powerful tool for probing both black hole accretion physics and the background spacetime. Current models aimed at explaining the observed multiwavelength flares in Sgr A* often assume hotspots moving on geodesic, Keplerian orbits. In many scenarios, though, a hotspot may instead follow an inspiraling trajectory, potentially transitioning into a plunge toward the black hole. In this work, we present a general framework to simulate the polarized emission from generic equatorial inspiraling hotspots in Kerr spacetime using a parametric four-velocity profile. This parametrization defines a continuous family of flows, ranging from Cunningham's disk model (fixed radius orbits outside the innermost stable circular orbit and plunging motion within the innermost stable circular orbit) to purely radial motion, thereby extending the standard assumptions. Within this framework, we show that inspiral motion produces a distinctive observational signature: a precessing, unwinding evolution of the polarimetric Stokes Q-U looping pattern, in sharp contrast with the closed Q-U loops associated with stable orbits at a fixed radius. We then explore how the morphology of these signatures depends on black hole spin, observer inclination, and magnetic-field configuration. The presented model can be applied to current and near-future interferometric observations of linear polarization, offering a new avenue to probe the physics of matter spiraling inward and the relativistic velocities of plunging plasma.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Characterization of Gravitational Waves via Graviton Counting Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although gravitational waves are now routinely observed, the detection of individual gravitons has long been regarded as impossible. Recent work, however, has demonstrated that single-graviton detection can be achieved and may be feasible in the near future. Here we show that beyond mere particle detection, these detectors provide access to the quantum state and particle statistics of gravitational waves. We show that graviton detection probabilities enable the discrimination between squeezed, coherent, and thermal radiation. We further demonstrate that the full quantum statistics contained in the second-order correlation function of the passing wave can be directly measured at the detector, independent of the weak gravitational interaction strength. Building on recent quantum-optical techniques, this capability opens the way to full quantum state tomography of Gaussian states. Our results demonstrate that single-graviton detection is not only of foundational significance but also of practical value, allowing for the characterization of quantum statistics and the states of the gravitational radiation field, which remain currently unknown.</description>

      <title>NIAC project report: Solar system-scale VLBI to dramatically improve cosmological distance measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the feasibility and scientific potential of the Cosmic Positioning System (CPS), a space mission concept enabling purely geometric distance measurements to sources at hundreds of megaparsecs by directly detecting electromagnetic wavefront curvature. CPS consists of a constellation of radio antennas distributed across the outer Solar System, operating on baselines of tens of astronomical units. By precisely timing the arrival of repeating fast radio bursts (FRBs), CPS infers source distances via trilateration -- analogous to global navigation satellite systems such as GPS but on cosmological scales.
  We show that CPS distance measurements could result in sub-percent constraints on the Hubble constant with even a handful of detections, whereas we predict that 10-100 FRB sources are likely visible. We evaluate dominant sources of uncertainty -- wavefront timing precision, interstellar refractive delays, spacecraft positional knowledge, and onboard clock stability -- finding these controllable at required levels using near-term technologies. Our nominal design employs five spacecraft with 8 m deployable antennas, 3-6 GHz receivers with sub-30 K system temperatures, and space-qualified atomic clocks similar to those on GPS satellites, supported by a ground network for ranging calibration and FRB alerts.
  Beyond cosmic expansion, CPS may enable frontier measurements in astrophysics and fundamental physics, including constraints on small-scale dark matter structure, microhertz gravitational waves (bridging pulsar timing arrays and LISA), and the outer Solar System mass distribution. The most significant viability issue concerns FRB properties at several-GHz frequencies; we recommend observational campaigns to characterize repeating FRBs in this band.</description>

      <title>Towards a general field equation for galaxies and galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The MONDian theory of AQUAL (AQUAdratic Lagrangian) and the theory of GRAS (GRavitational Anti-Screening) are alternatives to the theory of dark matter. When these theories are applied to galaxy dynamics they are in excellent agreement with observations including the galactic RAR (Radial Acceleration Relationship). However, when applied to galaxy clusters they do not explain the bulk of the missing mass. This manuscript develops a modified version of the GRAS/AQUAL field equation that can be extended to galaxy clusters. It involves just a single free parameter. The new field equation is then applied to a sample of galaxy clusters and checked against modeled galaxies and solar system constraints. Further to this, the modified field equation leads to an understanding of the difference between the galactic RAR and the RAR recently found for clusters.</description>

      <title>Highly suppressed tensor-to-scalar ratio from a modified Lennard-Jones inflationary potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasingly stringent observational bounds on primordial gravitational waves strongly constrain inflationary model building, favoring scenarios that predict highly suppressed tensor perturbations. While many viable constructions rely on non-canonical kinetic terms, non-minimal couplings, or modifications of gravity, it remains an open question whether comparably small tensor amplitudes can emerge within a minimal, single-field framework driven solely by potential dynamics. In this work we propose a novel inflationary scenario based on a modified Lennard-Jones potential. Inspired by a well-known interaction potential in molecular physics, the proposed form naturally combines a smooth minimum with an extended flat plateau at large field values. This intrinsic structure supports slow-roll inflation and ensures a graceful exit without introducing additional degrees of freedom. We perform a detailed analysis of the inflationary dynamics and confront the model with current observational constraints. We find that the scalar spectral index is fully consistent with CMB data, while the tensor-to-scalar ratio is predicted to be extremely small, reaching values as low as $r\sim10^{-7}$. Finally, the running of the scalar spectral index is also found to be small, well withing the 1$\sigma$ recent observational bounds from Atacama Cosmology Telescope.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a first-order geometric Lagrangian for four-dimensional conformal gravity within the Cartan formulation, which yields, dynamically, the standard constraints on the fields, expected for conformal gravity. Upon imposing the dynamical constraints, together with the request of conformal invariance of the off-shell Lagrangian, the theory reduces to the standard expression for conformal gravity, in terms of quadratic curvature invariants. Our results clarify the geometric status of conformal gravity as a gauge theory and open the way to a similar dynamical implementation of the constraints in higher dimensions and supersymmetric extensions.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally Coupled Running Curvaton: A Unified Approach to Early-Universe Inflation and Phantom Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024, combined with CMB and SNIa data, indicate a preference for a dynamical dark energy equation of state that crosses the phantom divide ($w &lt; -1$). This finding challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and minimally coupled scalar field scenarios, including the original Running Curvaton model, which is typically constrained to the quintessence regime. In this work, we propose a unified cosmological framework by extending the Running Curvaton model via a non-minimal gravitational coupling of the form $\xi \chi^2 R$. We demonstrate that this geometric modification allows the effective equation of state to naturally evolve from a quintessence-like to a phantom-like regime in the Jordan frame, thereby providing a superior fit to the DESI observational contours ($w_0 &gt; -1, w_a &lt; 0$). Crucially, we show that the introduction of non-minimal coupling does not compromise the model's success in describing the early universe. Through a parameter re-tuning mechanism involving the coupling constant ($g_0^{obs} = g_0 + 2\xi$), the predictions for the primordial power spectrum (spectral index $n_s$) and local-type non-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$) remain strictly preserved and consistent with Planck data. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive stability analysis within the Horndeski framework, verifying that the model remains free from ghost and gradient instabilities ($c_s^2 = 1$). Our results suggest that the non-minimally coupled Running Curvaton offers a robust, stable, and unified description of inflation and late-time accelerated expansion compatible with the latest precision cosmology data.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Complex Phase Diagram for the Born-Infeld AdS Black Holes with Reentrant Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lee-Yang phase transition theory applied in the anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole has inspired the exploration of complex phase diagram and supercritical phenomena in black hole thermodynamics. In this study, we extend the approach to the four dimensional Born-Infeld AdS black hole. This system exhibits a rich phase structure, including reentrant phase transitions, due to the modulation of the Born-Infeld nonlinear parameter. Through the analysis by Lee-Yang zeros, we obtained the complex phase diagram of the Born-Infeld AdS black hole and derived the supercritical crossover line -- Widom line. It strictly originates from the first-order stable critical point. The results indicate that Born-Infeld nonlinear effects significantly alter the types and characteristics of phase transition in critical region, while do not disrupt the uniqueness of the Widom line in supercritical region. Our study uncovers a universal simplified feature of the thermodynamic behavior of nonlinear gravitational systems in supercritical region. It also deepens our understanding of the fundamental connection between critical phenomena and continuous phase transitions in the extended phase space of black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the quantization of Teukolsky scalars of spin $0$, $\pm 1$, and $\pm 2$ within the algebraic approach to quantum field theory. We first discuss the classical phase space, from which we subsequently construct the algebra. This sheds light on which fields are conjugates of each other. Further, we construct the Unruh state for this theory on Kerr and show that it is Hadamard on the black hole exterior and the interior up to the inner horizon. This shows not only that Hadamard states exist for this theory, but also extends the existence and Hadamard property of the Unruh state to (bosonic) Teukolsky fields on Kerr, where such a result was previously missing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine spectral- and split representations to factorize multi-loop momentum space diagrams, in the Schwinger-Keldysh formulation for cosmological correlators, with massive scalars in the loop. This allows us to extend the resummation of loop contributions from flat to de Sitter space. Furthermore, in our split representation the signal part of the correlators can be identified directly on the integrand level from the spectral function. We apply this to describe the non-perturbative flow of the EFT background and the cosmological collider signals in a large-N model.</description>

Abstract: We establish a lower bound on the total mass of the time slices of (n + 1)-dimensional asymptotically flat standard static spacetimes under the timelike convergence condition. The inequality can be viewed equivalently as a Minkowski-type inequality in these spaces, i.e. as a lower bound on the total mean curvature of the boundary, and thus extends inequalities from [3], [22], [19], and [10]. Equality is achieved only by slices of Schwarzschild space and is related to the characterization of quasi-spherical static vacuum metrics from [10]. As a notable special case of the main inequality, we obtain the Riemannian Penrose inequality in all dimensions for static spaces under the TCC.</description>

      <title>Coupling Electromagnetism to Torsion: Black Holes and Spin-Charge Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling between matter fields and gravity, encoded in the geometry of spacetime, can be realized in various ways. Most commonly, a minimal coupling principle is employed, meaning that all matter fields, except spinors, couple only to the spacetime metric, while spinors additionally couple to the spacetime connection. Non-minimal couplings between matter fields and spacetime curvature can arise, for example, from quantum field theory on curved spacetime through renormalization corrections, in gauge theories of gravity, and in effective field theories. In this article, we consider a non-minimal coupling $F^{\mu\nu}\tilde{R}_{\mu\nu}$ between the field strength tensor of the electromagnetic field $F_{\mu\nu}$ and the antisymmetric part of the Ricci tensor $\tilde{R}_{[\mu\nu]}$ in Riemann--Cartan geometry, which is based on a general metric-compatible connection with torsion. We find an exact four-dimensional vacuum solution that generalizes the Reissner--Nordstr{\"o}m black hole from Einstein--Maxwell and reveals new interactions between the intrinsic torsion-spin charge and the electric charge. Qualitatively, this solution exhibits two distinct features: the effective charge is not constrained to be positive, and the sign of the electric charge influences its gravitational effects. We also derive slowly rotating solutions in three dimensions, representing a generalized slowly rotating BTZ black hole solution with couplings among the magnetic and electric charges, the angular momentum, and the intrinsic torsion-spin charge.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact binaries with large mass asymmetries - such as Extreme and Intermediate Mass Ratio Inspirals - are unique probes of the astrophysical environments in which they evolve. Their long-lived and intricate dynamics allow for precise inference of source properties, provided waveform models are accurate enough to capture the full complexity of their orbital evolution. In this work, we develop a multi-parameter formalism, inspired by vacuum perturbation theory, to model asymmetric binaries embedded in general matter distributions with both radial and tangential pressures. In the regime of small deviations from the Schwarzschild metric, relevant to most astrophysical scenarios, the system admits a simplified description, where both metric and fluid perturbations can be cast into wave equations closely related to those of the vacuum case. This framework offers a practical approach to modeling the dynamics and the gravitational wave emission from binaries in realistic matter distributions, and can be modularly integrated with existing results for vacuum sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole ringdowns in extensions of General Relativity (GR) generically exhibit two distinct signatures: (1) theory-dependent shifts in the standard black-hole quasinormal modes, and (2) additional modes arising from extra fundamental fields -- such as scalar, vector, or tensor degrees of freedom -- that can also contribute to the gravitational-wave signal. As recently argued, in general both effects are present simultaneously, and accurately modeling them is essential for robust tests of GR in the ringdown regime. In this work, we investigate the impact of extra field-induced modes, which are often neglected in standard ringdown analyses, on the interpretation of gravitational-wave signals. To provide some concrete examples, we focus on dynamical Chern-Simons and Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories, well-motivated extensions of GR, characterized respectively by a parity-odd and a parity-even coupling between a dynamical scalar field and quadratic curvature invariants. We show that including extra field-induced modes improves the bounds on these theories compared to standard spectroscopy and also allows for equally constraining complementary tests not based on quasinormal mode shifts. Our analysis highlights the relevance of incorporating extra field-induced modes in ringdown templates and assesses their potential to either bias or enhance constraints on GR deviations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the time evolution of radial kinks in the background of boson stars. In particular, we consider two types of boson stars: the massive boson star and the solitonic boson star. For each boson star, we study the dynamics of the kinks with four different compactnesses. We observe that the greater the compactness is, the slower the kinks move towards the origin of the boson stars, indicating that the compactness will hinder the kinks to collide with the origin. Additionally, it is found that when the boson star is highly compact, a new kink may turn out after the kink colliding with the origin, instead of immediately dissipating into the background. We then propose that the radial kinks may potentially serve as a means to probe the internal structures of dense astrophysical objects, even the interior structure of black holes.</description>

      <title>Phantom cosmology with arbitrary potential: New accelerating scaling attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the existence of accelerating scaling solutions in coupled phantom cosmology without assuming any specific potential for the phantom scalar field. The coupling between phantom dark energy and dark matter is motivated by the warm inflationary paradigm, with the dissipation coefficient assumed to be either constant or variable. The evolution equations are written in the form of autonomous systems, whose stability is studied using methods of qualitative analysis of dynamical systems. For this analysis, the only requirement imposed on the otherwise arbitrary phantom potential is that a particular dynamical variable, defined in terms of the potential and its derivative, must be invertible. For such a generic potential, we show that accelerated scaling solutions do exist, for both constant and variable dissipation coefficients. Although there is a limitation to these scaling solutions -- specifically, the current stage of accelerated expansion is not preceded by a long enough matter-dominated era -- our results show that the existence of a direct coupling between phantom dark energy and dark matter yields great potential for addressing the cosmic coincidence problem.</description>

      <title>Constraining Black Hole Horizon Properties Through Long-Duration Gravitational Wave Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a long-duration Bayesian analysis of gravitational-wave data to constrain the near-horizon geometry of black holes formed in binary mergers. Deviations from the Kerr geometry are parameterized by replacing the horizon's absorbing boundary with a reflective surface at a fractional distance epsilon. This modification produces long-lived monochromatic quasinormal modes that can be probed through extended integration times. Building on previous work that set a bound of log10(epsilon) = -24 for GW150914, we reproduce and validate those results and extend the analysis to additional events from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs. By combining posterior samples from multiple detections, we construct a joint posterior yielding a tightened 90 percent upper bound of log10(epsilon) &lt; -38.64, demonstrating the statistical power of population-level inference through cumulative evidence. Finally, analyzing the newly observed high signal-to-noise ratio event GW250114 from the O4b run, we obtain the most stringent single-event constraint to date, log10(epsilon) &lt; -29.58 (90 percent credible region). Our findings provide the strongest observational support to date for the Kerr geometry as the correct description of post-merger black holes, with no detectable horizon-scale deviations.</description>

      <title>Constraining Zero-Point Length from Gravitational Baryogenesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of a fundamental zero-point length, $l_0$, a minimal spacetime scale predicted by T-duality in string theory or quantum gravity theories, modifies the entropy associated with the horizon of spacetime. In the cosmological setup, this leads to correction to the Friedmann equations governing the evolution of the Universe. In this paper, we investigate the implications of zero-point length $l_0$-corrected gravity for gravitational baryogenesis and early universe thermodynamics, deriving constraints on $l_0$ from observational baryon asymmetry data. We observe that under the condition of non-equilibrium thermodynamics, $l_0$ generates $\dot{\mathcal{R}}\neq 0$ during radiation epoch, where $\mathcal{R}$ is the Ricci scalar. This yields a baryon asymmetry parameter $\eta \propto l_0^2 T_D^9/M_{\rm Pl}^7$. The observed baryon asymmetry $\eta \sim 9.9 \times 10^{-11}$ constrains $l_0 \lesssim 7.1 \times 10^{-33} m$, approximately $440$ times the Planck length. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the zero-point length correction in the Friedmann equation, effectively slows the expansion rate at high energies, resulting in a modified time-temperature relationship where the Universe maintains higher temperatures for longer time during early epochs compared to standard cosmology. Our results establish zero-point length cosmology as a testable framework connecting quantum gravity to cosmological observables, with implications for early universe thermal history and fundamental length scales.</description>

      <title>From equivalent Lagrangians to inequivalent open quantum system dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14752v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lagrangians can differ by a total derivative without altering the equations of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is true both classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can lead to inequivalent reduced dynamics. While these Lagrangians are connected via unitary transformations at the level of the global system-plus-environment description, the equivalence breaks down after tracing out the environment. We argue that only those Lagrangians for which the canonical and mechanical momenta of the system coincide lead to operationally meaningful dynamics. Applying this insight to quantum electrodynamics (QED), we derive the master equation for bremsstrahlung due to an accelerated non-relativistic electron upto second order in the interaction. The resulting reduced dynamics predicts decoherence in the position basis and closely matches the Caldeira-Leggett form, thus resolving previous discrepancies in the literature. Our findings have implications for both QED and gravitational decoherence, where similar ambiguities arise.</description>

      <title>Inflation with the Chern-Simons term in the Palatini formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14983v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Chern--Simons term coupled to the inflaton in the Palatini formulation of general relativity. In contrast to the metric formulation, here the Chern--Simons term affects also the background evolution. We approximately solve for the connection, insert it back into the action, and reduce the order of the equations to obtain an effective theory in the gradient approximation. We consider three cases: when the connection is unconstrained, and when non-metricity or torsion is put to zero. In the first two cases, the inflaton kinetic term is modified with a term proportional to the square of the potential. For polynomial potentials dominated by the highest power of the field, the Chern--Simons term solves the problem that higher order corrections spoil the flatness of the potential. For Higgs inflation, the tensor-to-scalar ratio can be as large as the current observational bound, and the non-minimal coupling to the Ricci scalar can be as small as in the metric case. The Palatini contribution cures the known instability of the tensor modes due to the Chern--Simons term in the metric formulation.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Graviweak Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graviweak theory seeks to unify gravity (specifically in its self-dual formulation) with the weak interaction, preying on their parallel chiral $SU(2)$ structures. In this paper we further this idea by folding it with the concept of spontaneous symmetry breaking. We do this first with a standard Higgs field and potential, starting with a unifying parity-invariant theory which splits into the usual gravity and weak sector under spontaneous symmetry breaking. By rewriting the theory in the two-spin framework we are then prompted to discuss generalizations, within the generic approach known as MacDowell-Mansouri theories where a larger internal gauge group is broken. One of the predictions of the ensuing construction is a non-minimal coupling in the low energy broken phase between curvature and the weak gauge fields, translating at the quantum level to a direct channel between the graviton and the weak bosons.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlation beyond entanglement: Holographic discord and multipartite generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum theory and holography, quantum correlations arising from superposition, such as quantum discord, offer a broader perspective that has remained largely unexplored in holography. We construct gravity duals of quantum discord and classical correlation. In both holographic systems and Haar random states, discord exceeds entanglement, revealing an additional quantum correlation linked to the Markov gap and non-distillable entanglement, suggesting holographic states are intrinsically non-bipartite. In black hole setups, discord can increase despite decoherence and persists beyond the sudden death of distillable entanglement. Motivated by the holographic formula, we define reflected discord -- an optimization-free boundary quantity based on reflected entropy -- which remains effective even outside the holographic regime. We also propose several multipartite generalizations of correlation measures. It includes holography-inspired correlations based on multi-entropy, which are shown to be UV-finite and reduce to bipartite measures in the bipartite limit. These results provide new tools for quantifying quantum correlations beyond entanglement in strongly coupled many-body systems and offer a novel approach to multipartite correlation measures.</description>

      <title>Probing small-scale primordial power spectra with induced gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale primordial perturbations have been well constrained by current cosmological observations, but the properties of small-scale perturbations remain elusive. This study focuses on second-order induced gravitational waves generated by large-amplitude primordial scalar and tensor perturbations on small scales. In this case, the induced gravitational waves include contributions from three types of source terms: scalar-scalar, tensor-scalar, and tensor-tensor. To distinguish them from second-order scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), we refer to those generated by these three source terms as tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves (TSIGWs). We provide the analytical expressions for the kernel functions and the corresponding energy density spectra of second-order TSIGWs. By combining observations of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) across different scales, TSIGWs can be used to constrain small-scale primordial curvature perturbations and primordial gravitational waves. Furthermore, we discuss the feasibility of TSIGWs dominating the current pulsar timing array (PTA) observations under various primordial power spectra scenarios. Our results indicate that TSIGWs generated by monochromatic primordial power spectra might be more likely to dominate the current PTA observations.</description>

      <title>An algebra for covariant observers in de Sitter space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A consistent implementation of the gravitational constraints in de Sitter space requires gauging the full $SO(1,d)$ isometry group. In this paper, we develop a framework that enables the gauging of the full de Sitter isometry while consistently incorporating multiple observers on arbitrary geodesics. We achieve this by introducing the concept of \textit{covariant observer}, whose geodesic is a dynamical entity that transforms under the isometry group. Upon quantization, the geodesic becomes a fluctuating degree of freedom, providing a quantum reference frame for $SO(1,d)$. Inspired by the timelike tube theorem, we propose that the algebra of observables is generated by all degrees of freedom within the fluctuating static patch, including the quantum fields modes and other observers. The gauge-invariant subalgebra of observables is an averaged version of the modular crossed product algebra, and we establish its type II character by constructing a trace. This yields a well-defined von Neumann entropy. For semiclassical states, by imposing a UV cutoff in QFT and proposing a quantum generalization of the first law, we demonstrate that the algebraic and generalized entropies are in match.
  Our work generalizes the notion of a local algebra to that of a \textit{fluctuating region}, representing an average of algebras over all possible static patches and configurations of other geodesics. This provides a complete, covariant, and multi-observer extension of the CLPW construction and lays the foundation for a fully relational quantum gravitational description of de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential revisited in the context of Warm Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Warm Inflation is a scenario in which the inflaton field dissipates its energy during inflation to maintain a subdominant constant radiation bath. Two of its remarkable features are (i) inflation can be realized even by very steep potentials and (ii) such a scenario doesn't call for a separate post-inflation reheating phase. We exploit the first feature to show that Warm Inflation can successfully take place on the very steep left wing of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential while remaining in excellent agreement with current cosmological data (joint analysis of Planck, ACT and DESI). The Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential has a flatter right wing as well, which opens up the possibility of dark energy when the field rolls along this wing. However in order to successfully realize quintessential inflation one needs to (i) normalize the two wings of the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential differently in order to bridge between the two extreme energy scales of inflation and dark energy, (ii) allow the quintessence field to be dissipative, which is consistent with the presence of a dissipative term in warm inflation. The dissipative dynamics of the quintessence field is needed in order to sustain slow-roll in the right wing. With these modifications, we demonstrate that the Witten-O'Raifeartaigh potential can give rise to a unified model of warm inflation (on the left wing) and transient dark energy (on the right wing).</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: A Non-Hermitian Pilot-Wave Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03567v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Weyl's abandoned idea of local scale invariance has a natural realization at the quantum level in pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) theory. We obtain the Weyl covariant derivative by complexifying the electromagnetic gauge coupling parameter. The resultant non-hermiticity has a natural interpretation in terms of local scale invariance in pilot-wave theory. The conserved current density is modified from $|\psi|^2$ to the local scale invariant, trajectory-dependent ratio $|\psi|^2/ \mathbf 1^2[\mathcal C]$, where $\mathbf 1[\mathcal C]$ is a scale factor that depends on the pilot-wave trajectory $\mathcal C$ in configuration space. All physical predictions are local scale invariant, even in the presence of mass terms. Our approach is general, and we implement it for the Schr\"odinger and Pauli equations, and for the Dirac equation in curved spacetime, each coupled to an external electromagnetic field. We also implement it in quantum field theory for the case of a quantized axion field interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We discuss the equilibrium probability density and show that the corresponding trajectories are unique. Our results provide a pivotal understanding of local scale invariance in quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Cosmographic parameters from current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the capability of current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors, such as Advanced LIGO, Einstein Telescope and DECIGO, to constrain cosmographic parameters using electromagnetically bright standard sirens. By adopting a third-order Taylor expansion, we analyze how signal-to-noise ratios and the number of events impact the estimates of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), the deceleration ($q_0$) and jerk ($j_0$) parameters. Our results show that while Advanced LIGO provides a calibration-free measurement of $H_0$ at the few-percent level, it remains insensitive to higher-order parameters. In contrast, the Einstein Telescope and DECIGO reach sub-percent accuracy for $H_0$. Notably, DECIGO achieves a precision better than 10\% for the deceleration parameter $q_0$ and a few tens of percent for the jerk parameter $j_0$.</description>
