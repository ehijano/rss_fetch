      <title>Planckian Bounds via Spectral Moments of Optical Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of Planckian scattering, often inferred from Drude fits in strongly correlated metals, raises the question of how to extract an intrinsic timescale from measurable quantities in a model-independent way. We address this by focusing on a ratio (${\cal{B}}$) of spectral moments of the dissipative part of the optical conductivity and prove a rigorous upper bound on ${\cal{B}}$ in terms of the Planckian rate. The bound emerges from the analytic structure of thermally weighted response functions of the current operator. Crucially, the bounded quantity is directly accessible via optical spectroscopy and computable from imaginary-time correlators in quantum Monte Carlo simulations, without any need for analytic continuation. We evaluate ${\cal{B}}$ for simplified examples of both Drude and non-Drude forms of the optical conductivity with a single scattering rate in various asymptotic regimes, and find that ${\cal{B}}$ lies far below the saturation value. These findings demonstrate that Planckian bounds can arise from fundamental constraints on equilibrium dynamics, pointing toward a possibly universal structure governing transport in correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Hall Viscosity of the Laughlin State on Noisy Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hall viscosity is a quantized nondissipative stress response of a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluid to adiabatic geometric deformations. Despite strong theoretical interest, its experimental observation in the FQH state has remained elusive, making it a promising target for realization on current NISQ devices. In this work, we employ a quasi-one-dimensional model of an FQH state coupled to a background metric to probe the geometric response under a metric quench. We design and implement a quantum-circuit protocol that realizes a Hilbert-space-truncated version of the model and extracts the Hall viscosity from the geometric response encoded in the wavefunction dynamics of the device. While the truncation prevents us from accessing the fully quantized value of Hall viscosity, the hardware data nevertheless show excellent agreement with analytical and numerical predictions within this restricted regime.</description>

      <title>The magnetic structure of polar $G$-type charge and orbital ordered Hg-quadruple manganite perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic structure of the novel Hg$_{0.7}$Na$_{0.3}$Mn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$, a quadruple manganite perovskite that exhibits a unique $G$-type charge and orbital ordered state distinct to other $A^{2+}$Mn$_3$Mn$_4$O$_{12}$ equivalents ($A$ $=$ Ca, Sr, Cd, Pb), has been solved using powder neutron diffraction and symmetry-motivated analysis. A $G$-type-like antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Mn on the $A'$ sites and a `up--up--down--down' AFM moment configuration of Mn spins on the $B$ sites is found to occur. The mechanism for the onset and stabilization of $B$ site `up--up--down--down' AFM order is explored in terms of coupling between structural and magnetic distortions. The results presented here provide evidence of the exotic charge, orbital, electronic and magnetic orderings that quadruple manganite perovskites demonstrate, and further highlighting the distinct chemistry that Hg$^{2+}$ plays in stabilizing novel states compared to other divalent $A$-site cation equivalents.</description>

      <title>Gutzwiller approximation for paramagnetic ionic Hubbard model: Analytic expression for band - Mott insulator transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ionic Hubbard model is a paradigmatic setup for studying the competition between band and Mott insulating behavior. Within the variationally exact in infinite dimensions Gutzwiller approximation, we derive a compact analytic expression for the phase boundary between Mott and band insulator. While the method reproduces the expected band-Mott insulator phenomenology, it does not capture the correlated metallic state at finite staggered potential found for example in dynamical mean-field theory. This absence highlights that the metallic phase originates from incoherent Hubbard-band physics rather than Fermi-liquid behavior well captured by Gutzwiller approximation. Our formulation establishes a concise variational framework to ionic Hubbard model, with natural extensions to nonequilibrium setups and spin-exchange dynamics.</description>

      <title>Large Anomalous Hall Effect in Topologically Trivial Double-$Q$ Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-$Q$ magnets consist of superposed spin density waves with distinct magnetic modulation vectors, enabling a wide range of magnetic orders depending on their combination. Among them, topologically nontrivial spin textures, such as a magnetic skyrmion, has been extensively studied owing to the emergence of topological Hall effects induced by real-space scalar spin chirality. Contrary to this expectation, we theoretically investigate another route to enhancing the Hall response under a topologically \textit{trivial} double-$Q$ spin textures. Despite the cancellation of the scalar spin chirality, the double-$Q$ magnetism exhibits a pronounced Hall response with a nonmonotonic dependence on the uniform magnetization, which is in stark contrast to a ferromagnetic state and a single-$Q$ spiral state. Analyzing the multi-orbital Kondo lattice model, we show that orbital hybridization induced by the double-$Q$ superstructure enhances the Berry curvature in $\mathbf{k}$-space, leading to a large anomalous Hall effect. This mechanism accounts for the observed giant anomalous Hall effect in GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ and GdRu$_2$Ge$_2$, thereby highlighting topologically trivial double-$Q$ spin textures as promising spintronic materials.</description>

      <title>Evaluating covalency using RIXS spectral weights: Silver fluorides vs. cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of AgF2, AgFBF4, AgF and Ag2O using X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Ag L3 edge. XAS results were compared with density functional theory computations of the spectra, allowing an identification of main features and an assessment of the theoretical approximations. Our RIXS measurements reveal that AgF2 exhibits charge transfer excitations and dd excitations, analogous to those observed in La2CuO4. We propose to use the ratio of dd to CT spectral weight as a measure of the covalence of the compounds and provide explicit equations for the weights as a function of the scattering geometry for crystals and powders. The measurements at the metal site L3 edge and previous measurements at the ligand K edge reveal a striking similarity between the fluorides and cuprates materials, with fluorides somewhat more covalent than cuprates. These findings support the hypothesis that silver fluorides are an excellent platform to mimic the physics of cuprates, providing a promising avenue for exploring high-Tc superconductivity and exotic magnetism in quasi-two-dimensional (AgF2) and quasi-one-dimensional (AgFBF4) materials.</description>

      <title>Investigating the origin of topological-Hall-like resistivity in Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions and other chiral spin textures have been extensively studied as potential building blocks for novel spintronic devices. Hall-resistivity anomalies that deviate from magnetization scaling, known as the topological Hall effect, have been widely employed as evidence for the presence of chiral spin textures in magnetic materials. However, recent studies on magnetic thin films have revealed a drawback of this approach, as the presumed topological Hall contribution may in fact originate from trivial mechanisms. Here, we investigate the magnetic and transport properties of a Zn-doped Mn2Sb ferrimagnet, whose related compounds have previously been suggested to exhibit a topological Hall effect arising from chiral spin textures. Hall-resistivity anomalies are also observed in our sample, yet they show little correlation with the magnetic or metamagnetic transitions and are therefore clearly distinct from those in magnetic compounds hosting chiral spin textures. Most importantly, additional Lorentz transmission electron microscopy measurements rule out the existence of chiral spin textures in this ferrimagnet. Therefore, instead of a nontrivial origin, we attribute the Hall-resistivity anomalies to the combined effect of multiple anomalous Hall channels resulting from sample inhomogeneity. Our work shows that the difficulties of identifying chiral spin textures through transport measurements also apply to bulk systems, prompting some existing results to be revisited.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall effect and rich magnetic phase diagram of Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_{x}$ epitaxial films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A series of Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ ($20 \le x \le 50$) thin films were epitaxially grown on the MgO substrate using magnetron sputtering technique, and were systematically investigated by magnetization, longitudinal electrical resistivity, and transverse Hall resistivity. After optimizing the growth conditions, phase-pure Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films with a cubic CsCl-type structure were obtained, and their magnetic phase diagram was built. The manipulation of Rh content leads to a rich magnetic phase diagram, where three different regimes can be identified: for $x &lt; 40$, Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films undergo a ferromagnetic (FM) transition below $T_\mathrm{C} \approx$ 330-350 K; for $40 \le x \le 45$, in addition to the FM transition at $T_\mathrm{C} \approx$ 200 K, Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films undergo a FM-to-antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at $T_\mathrm{N} \approx$ 120 K; finally for $x &gt; 45$, only one AFM transition at $T_\mathrm{N} \approx$ 150 K can be tracked. All the Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films exhibit distinct anomalous Hall effect in their magnetically ordered state, which is most likely due to the intrinsic Berry-curvature mechanism. In addition, all the anomalous Hall transport properties, including the resistivity, conductivity, and angle exhibit a strong correlation with the magnetic properties of Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films, which become most evident for $x$ = 35. Our systematic investigations suggest a strong correlation between magnetic properties and electronic band topology in Mn$_{100-x}$Rh$_x$ films, highlighting their great potential for AFM spintronics.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure, orbital-dependent renormalizations, and magnetic correlations in double-layer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under doping tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the DFT+dynamical mean-field theory approach we study the effects of electronic correlations and doping on the normal state electronic structure of the double-layer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure. In agreement with experiments, we obtain significant orbital-dependent quasiparticle renormalizations of the Ni $x^2-y^2$ and $3z^2-r^2$ bands, accompanied by incoherence (bad metal behavior) of the $3z^2-r^2$ states, caused by the proximity of the Ni $3d$ states to orbital-dependent localization. Our results demonstrate a sensitive, non-monotonic dependence of $m^*/m$ on doping, with a remarkable, by about 20\%, increase for the Ni $x^2-y^2$ orbitals upon electron doping $x \sim 0.2$ (per Ni ion), implying a significant enhancement of orbital-dependent correlations with oxygen deficiency in LNO. We observe a reconstruction of the low-energy electronic structure of LNO upon doping above $x\sim -0.3$ and 0.2. It is associated with the Lifshitz transition, with a crossover to a self-doping regime characterized by partial occupation of the La $5d$ bands (upon an electron doping $x&gt;0.2$). Our analysis of the static magnetic susceptibility $\chi({\bf q})$ obtained within DFT+DMFT suggests the possible formation of the spin and charge (or bond) density wave stripes, implying strong spin and charge correlations in LNO. We show that this behavor is associated with suppression of the N\'eel $G$-type antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ni$^{2+}$ ions upon hole doping. Interestingly, upon a moderate electron doping of the Ni$^{2.5+}$ ions (e.g., with oxygen deficiency), we find a significant enhancement of the strength of in-plane spin and charge fluctuations. We note a close resembles of our results to those for the bilayer Hubbard model, which shows the boosting of superconductivity as one of the two electron bands approaches the Lifshitz transition (e.g., upon doping).</description>

      <title>Binding of holes and competing spin-charge order in simple and extended Hubbard model on cylindrical lattice: An exact diagonalization study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the binding of holes and the emergence of competing spin-charge order in the simple and extended Hubbard model using exact diagonalization on the 3x4 cylindrical lattice. For the simple Hubbard model (V=0), we find weakly bound hole pairing mediated by magnetic correlations at intermediate repulsive U, without any evidence of phase separation. Introducing nearest-neighbor interaction V reveals a rich phase diagram: attractive V drives multi-hole clustering and phase separation with localized magnetic quenching, while repulsive V stabilizes charge-density-wave (CDW) order that coexists with bound hole pairs within a modulated magnetic background. At strong coupling (U=10), the competition sharpens, with attractive V overcoming on-site repulsion to form magnetically quenched clusters and repulsive V producing robust CDW order that constrains pairing. Real-space analysis of spin and charge correlations provides microscopic evidence of distinct binding mechanisms -- phase separation versus correlation-mediated pairing -- depending on the sign and strength of intersite interaction V . Our results establish a comprehensive picture of how nonlocal Coulomb interactions reshape the landscape of hole-binding and collective order in correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic anisotropy and dipolar interactions in the frustrated triangular-lattice magnet NaGdS_2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this comprehensive study, we present results of bulk measurements (magnetization, specific heat, ac susceptibility, thermal expansion, and magnetostriction) combined with local methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (^23Na NMR) and electron spin resonance (ESR) and simulations (McPhase) on polycrystalline and single-crystalline NaGdS_2 samples. The rare-earth delafossite NaGdS_2 is a triangular-lattice magnet with S = 7/2 spin-only Gd^3+ moments with suppressed single-ion anisotropy. In our study, we estimate that NaGdS_2 has a weak antiferromagnetic exchange (J_H/k_B is about 52mK) and signs of long-range magnetic order are absent down to lowest temperature. However, indications of short range magnetic order are found below 180 mK in the ac susceptibility and thermal expansion. Our results indicate an interplay of Heisenberg-type and dipolar exchange. Due to the large moment of the Gd^3+ ions, one expects a strong impact of the dipolar coupling in NaGdS_2, in contrast to the related NaYbS_2. ESR and ^23Na NMR measurements, indeed, indicate the formation of short-range ferromagnetic correlations. NaGdS_2 appears to be a rare system, in which magnetic order is suppressed by a competition between Heisenberg and dipolar interactions.</description>

      <title>Phase structure of the one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory with second nearest-neighbor interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state phase diagram of a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) model with hard-core bosons at half-filling, extending previous studies by including second nearest-neighbor (2NN) interactions. Using matrix product state techniques within the density matrix renormalization group, we compute charge gap, static structure factor, and pair-pair correlation functions for various interaction strengths and field parameters. We analyze two representative neatest-neighbor interaction strengths ($V_1$) that correspond to the Luttinger liquid (LL) and Mott insulator (MI) phases in the absence of the 2NN interactions. We introduce the 2NN coupling $V_2$ and investigate its impact on the system. Our results reveal very rich behavior. As the 2NN repulsion increases, in the case of small $V_1$, we observe a direct transition from the LL phase to a charge-ordered insulator (COI) phase, whereas for large $V_1$, we observe a transition from the MI phase (previously found with only $V_1$ included), going through an intermediate LL region, and finally reaching the COI regime. Additionally, the inclusion of 2NN interactions enhances charge order and suppresses pair coherence, evidenced by sharp peaks in the structure factor and rapid decay in pair-pair correlators. Our work extends the well-studied phase structure of 1D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT models and demonstrates the interplay between gauge fields, confinement, and extended interactions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum-classical matrix-product state and Lanczos methods for electron-phonon systems with strong electronic correlations: Application to disordered systems coupled to Einstein phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two quantum-classical hybrid methods for simulating the time-dependence of electron-phonon systems that treat electronic correlations numerically exactly and optical-phonon degrees of freedom classically. These are a time-dependent Lanczos and a matrix-product state method, each combined with the multi-trajectory Ehrenfest approach. Due to the approximations, reliable results are expected for the adiabatic regime of small phonon frequencies. We discuss the convergence properties of both methods for a system of interacting spinless fermions in one dimension and provide a benchmark for the Holstein chain. As a first application, we study the decay of charge density wave order in a system of interacting spinless fermions coupled to Einstein oscillators and in the presence of quenched disorder. We investigate the dependence of the relaxation dynamics on the electron-phonon coupling strength and provide numerical evidence that the coupling of strongly disordered systems to classical oscillators leads to delocalization, thus destabilizing the (finite-size) many-body localization in this system.</description>

      <title>Electronic crystals and quasicrystals in semiconductor quantum wells: an AI-powered discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The homogeneous electron gas is a cornerstone of quantum condensed matter physics, providing the foundation for developing density functional theory and understanding electronic phases in semiconductors. However, theoretical understanding of strongly-correlated electrons in realistic semiconductor systems remains limited. In this work, we develop a neural network based variational approach to study quantum wells in three dimensional geometry for a variety of electron densities and well thicknesses. Starting from first principles, our unbiased AI-powered method reveals metallic and crystalline phases with both monolayer and bilayer charge distributions. In the emergent bilayer, we discover a new quantum phase of matter: the electronic quasicrystal.</description>

      <title>Reaching Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev physics by shaking the Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model has attracted widespread attention due to its relevance to diverse areas of physics, such as high temperature superconductivity, black holes, and quantum chaos. The model is, however, extremely challenging to realize experimentally. In this work, we show how a particular form of Floquet engineering, termed ``kinetic driving'', effectively eliminates single-particle processes and creates quasi-random all-to-all interactions when applied to models of Hubbard type. For the specific case of the Bose-Hubbard model, we explicitly verify that the driven system indeed reproduces SYK physics by direct comparison of the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs). Our findings indicate that a cold-atom realization of kinetic driving -- achieved through modulation of hopping amplitudes in an optical lattice -- offers a practical and accurate platform for quantum simulation of the SYK model.</description>

      <title>Haagerup Symmetry in $(E_8)_1$?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest that the chiral $(\mathfrak{e}_8)_1$ theory -- in many senses the simplest VOA -- may have Haagerup symmetry $\mathcal{H}_i$ for $i=1,2,3$. Likewise, we suggest that the non-chiral $(E_8)_1$ WZW model may have $\mathcal{H}_i \times \mathcal{H}_i^\textrm{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives a $c=8$ theory with $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{H}_3)$ symmetry, which is the theory predicted in \cite{Evans:2010yr}. Along the way, we show that $(E_8)_1$ also has a $\mathrm{Fib} \times \mathrm{Fib}^\text{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives the $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1$ WZW model, explaining the well-known conformal embedding $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1 \subset (E_8)_1$. Finally, we suggest a relation to theories with $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry at $c=2,6$, complimenting the discussion with new modular bootstrap results.</description>

      <title>Switchable half-quantum flux states in a ring of the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic flux quantization in units of $\Phi_0 = h/2e$ is a defining feature of superconductivity, rooted in the charge-2e nature of Cooper pairs. In a ring geometry, the flux quantization leads to oscillations in the critical temperature with magnetic flux, known as the Little-Parks effect. While the maximal critical temperature is conventionally at zero flux, departures from this rule, for instance shifts by a half-quantum flux $\Phi_0/2$, clearly signal unconventional superconducting states and require sign-changing order parameters. Historically, such $\pi$-phase shifts in Little-Parks oscillations have been found in tricrystals or engineered ring structures that intentionally incorporate a $\pi$-phase shift. Here we report the discovery of switchable half-quantum flux states in rings made from single crystals of the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. We observe Little-Parks oscillations with a $\pi$-phase shift at zero bias current, which can be reversibly tuned to conventional Little-Parks oscillations upon applying a bias current. Between the $\pi$-phase and 0-phase regimes, $h/4e$ periodic oscillations appear. Our observations suggest unconventional pairing, potentially in the form of a multicomponent order parameter in the kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, and reveal an electrically tunable landscape of competing superconducting condensates and fractional flux states.</description>

      <title>Switching of topological phase transition from semiconductor to ideal Weyl states in Cu$_2$SnSe$_3$ family of materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of topological phase transition (TPT) mechanisms constitutes a central theme in quantum materials research. Conventionally, transitions between Weyl semimetals (WSMs) and other topological states rely on the breaking of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) or precise manipulation of lattice symmetry, thus constraints the available control strategies and restrict the scope of viable material systems. In this work, we propose a novel mechanism for TPT that operates without TRS breaking or lattice symmetry modification: a class of semiconductors can be directly transformed into an ideal WSM via bandgap closure. This transition is driven by chemical doping, which simultaneously modulates the band gap and enhances spin-orbit coupling (SOC), leading to band inversion between the valence and conduction bands and thereby triggering the TPT. Using first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the feasibility of this mechanism in the Cu$_2$SnSe$_3$ family of materials, where two pairs of Weyl points emerge with energies extremely close to the Fermi level. The bulk Fermi surface becomes nearly point-like, while the surface Fermi surface consists exclusively of Fermi arcs. This symmetry-independent mechanism bypasses the constraints of conventional symmetry-based engineering, and also offers an ideal platform for probing the anomalous transport properties of WSMs.</description>

      <title>Yamaji effect and quantum oscillation in Yang-Rice-Zhang model of underdoped cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have revealed signatures of small Fermi pockets in the pseudogap phase of cuprate superconductors, most notably the Yamaji effect observed in $\mathrm{HgBa}_2\mathrm{CuO}_{4+\delta}$. The Yang-Rice-Zhang (YRZ) model provides a successful phenomenological description of the pseudogap state and naturally predicts such small pockets. In this work, we use a microscopic framework to calculate angle-dependent magnetoresistance and quantum oscillation within the YRZ model. Our calculations simultaneously reproduce the experimentally observed Yamaji oscillations and the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillation corresponding to a pocket area of about $p/8$, with $p$ the hole density. By further testing the effect of Green's-function zeros, we confirm that isolated zeros leave the oscillation period unchanged, whereas an extended zero segment suppresses and modifies the oscillation. Our findings demonstrate that the YRZ model captures essential features of the pseudogap regime and provides a general quantum approach that can be applied to more complex electronic structures.</description>

      <title>Stability of the symmetry-protected topological phase and Ising transitions in a disordered U(1) quantum link model on a ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the U(1) quantum link model in a ladder geometry, finding, by finite-size scaling, that the critical exponent $\nu=1$ and the central charge $c=1/2$ are consistent with the Ising universality class for all phase transitions observed. A blind application of the Harris criterion would suggest that this criticality is lost in the presence of the disorder. It turns out not to be the case. For the disorder affecting ladder's rung hoppings only, we have found that the transitions survive disappearing only for quite strong disorder. The disorder in the ladder's legs destroys the nonzero mass phase criticality, while the symmetry-protected topological phase for zero mass survives a small disorder. The observed robustness against disorder is explained qualitatively using field-theoretic arguments.</description>

      <title>Efficient simulation of low-entanglement bosonic Gaussian states in polynomial time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosonic Gaussian states appear ubiquitously in quantum optics and condensed matter physics but remain difficult to simulate classically due to the hafnian bottleneck. We present an efficient algorithm that converts pure bosonic Gaussian states into matrix product states (MPSs), with a computational cost governed solely by the entanglement and not by the number of bosonic modes. Our method combines a Gaussian singular value decomposition with a projected-creation-operator mapping that constructs local MPS tensors without computing hafnians. Benchmarking on covariance matrices from the Jiuzhang 2.0 and Jiuzhang 4.0 Gaussian boson sampling experiments demonstrates substantial speedups over previous tensor-network approaches in the low-entanglement regime relevant to lossy devices. The method provides a scalable classical simulation framework for bosonic Gaussian states with limited entanglement and extends the applicability of MPS-based methods to a broad range of bosonic systems.</description>

      <title>Disorder mediated fully compensated ferrimagnetic spin-gapless semiconducting behaviour in Cr3Al Heusler alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin-gapless semiconductors (SGSs) that simultaneously host fully compensated ferrimagnetism are highly sought for energy-efficient and stray-field-free spintronic technologies, yet their realization in chemically disordered systems has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the binary Heusler alloy Cr3Al despite adopting a fully A2-disordered structure exhibits a rare coexistence of SGS transport and a fully compensated ferrimagnetic (FCF) ground state. Single-crystalline and polycrystalline Cr3Al samples were synthesized, and comprehensive structural analyses using single crystal XRD, synchrotron powder XRD, and neutron powder diffraction reveal complete Cr/Al site mixing. Remarkably, this chemical disorder does not disrupt magnetic order; instead, magnetization, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD), and temperature-dependent neutron diffraction establish a robust compensated ferrimagnetic state with a vanishingly small ordered moment of 0.1(1) muB/f.u and a high Curie temperature of 773(2) K. Electrical and thermal transport measurements uncover clear SGS characteristics, including weak temperature-dependent conductivity, very low Seebeck coefficients, and electron-hole compensated transport. Hall measurements show unusual temperature-dependent carrier concentrations consistent with disorder-modified electronic states. First-principles calculations on an A2-disordered SQS structure reproduce the experimentally observed negligibly small magnetization (0.0072 muB/f.u) and reveal a vanishing spin-up band gap unambiguously supporting SGS behavior driven by chemical disorder. Our results identify Cr3Al as the first experimentally verified A2-disordered Heusler alloy exhibiting both fully compensated ferrimagnetism and spin-gapless semiconducting transport, positioning it as a robust and disorder-tolerant platform for next-generation, high-temperature spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Partitioned Expansions for Approximate Tensor Network Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for approximating the contraction of a tensor network by partitioning the network into a sum of computationally cheaper networks. This method, which we call a partitioned network expansion (PNE), builds upon recent work that systematically improves belief propagation (BP) approximations using loop corrections. However, in contrast to previous approaches, our expansion does not require a known BP fixed point to be implemented and can still yield accurate results even in cases where BP fails entirely. The flexibility of our approach is demonstrated through applications to a variety of example networks, including finite 2D and 3D networks, infinite networks, networks with open indices, and networks with degenerate BP fixed points. Benchmark numerical results for networks composed of Ising, AKLT, and random tensors typically show an improvement in accuracy over BP by several orders of magnitude (when BP solutions are obtainable) and also demonstrate improved performance over traditional network approximations based on singular value decomposition (SVD) for certain tasks.</description>

      <title>Pair-density-wave in quarter-metals from a repulsive fermionic interaction in graphene heterostructures: A renormalization group study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic bands in chirally stacked $n$ layer carbon-based honeycomb heterostructures, encompassing rhombohedral ($n \geq 3$), Bernal bilayer ($n=2$), and monolayer ($n=1$) graphene, possess four-fold valley and spin degeneracy. Such systems with $n \geq 2$, when subject to external perpendicular electric displacement fields, feature a fully degenerate metal at high doping, a spin non-degenerate but valley degenerate half-metal at moderate doping, and a non-degenerate quarter-metal at low doping. Due to the fully polarized nature of the quasiparticles in the quarter-metal, realized around one particular valley otherwise chosen spontaneously, it can sustain a single local superconducting ground state, representing a pair-density-wave that is chiral and odd parity in nature. From a leading order renormalization group analysis, here we show that repulsive density-density interaction among such polarized fermionic excitations can foster the pair-density-wave phase at low temperatures. Possible connections with experimentally observed superconducting states in the close vicinity of the quarter-metal in some members of such graphene heterostructures family are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shastry-Sutherland magnet is a typical frustrated spin system hosting rich phases. While the Heisenberg limit has been extensively studied, the role of spin-orbit coupling is not well explored. Motivated by newly discovered rare-earth Shastry-Sutherland magnets, we construct a generic effective-spin model that describes the interactions between Kramers doublet local moments on a Shastry-Sutherland lattice. Due to the strong spin-orbit coupling, the model takes the form of extended XYZ interactions on both intra- and inter-dimer bonds. We show that, in addition to the conventional "singlet" dimer phase, strong spin-orbit coupling can stabilize peculiar "triplet" dimer phases. These "triplet" dimer phases, though fully gapped, respond immediately to magnetic fields and evolve smoothly into the fully polarized phase. We present that the recently discovered Shastry-Sutherland magnet Yb$_2$Be$_2$GeO$_7$ belongs to the "triplet" dimer phase, and discuss the implication of our results to a broad class of quantum magnets in general.</description>

Abstract: Superconductivity in nickelates apparently takes place in two different Ni oxidation regimes, namely either for infinite-layer-type compounds close to Ni$^{+}$, or for Ruddlesden-Popper materials close to Ni$^{2+}$. The reduced La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_6$ bilayer with a nominal Ni$^{1.5+}$ oxidation state may therefore serve as a normal-state mediator between the two known families of $3d^8$-like and $3d^9$-like superconducting nickelates. Using first-principles many-body theory, we explain its experimental 50\,meV charge gap as originating from a new type of correlated (quasi-)insulator. Flat-band electrons of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ character become localized from scattering with orbital-selective Mott-localized Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, by trading in residual hopping energy for a gain in local exchange energy in a ferromagnetic Kondo-lattice scenario. Most importantly, the flat-band electrons offer another route to unconventional superconductivity in nickelates at ambient pressure.</description>

Abstract: We perform large scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the Hubbard model at half filling with a single Dirac cone close to the critical point, which separates a Dirac semi-metal from an antiferromagnetically ordered phase where SU(2) spin rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken. We discuss the implementation of a single Dirac cone in the SLAC formulation for eight Dirac components and the influence of dynamically induced long-range super-exchange interactions. The finite size behavior of dimensionless ratios and the finite size scaling properties of the Hubbard model with a single Dirac cone are shown to be superior compared to the honeycomb lattice. We extract the critical exponent believed to belong to the chiral Heisenberg Gross-Neveu-Yukawa universality class: The critical exponent ${\nu = 1.02(3)}$ coincides for the two lattice types once honeycomb lattices of linear dimension ${L\ge 15}$ are considered. In contrast to the SLAC formulation, where the anomalous dimensions are estimated to be ${\eta_{\phi}=0.73(1)}$ and ${\eta_{\psi}=0.09(1)}$, they remain less stable on honeycomb lattices, but tend towards the estimates from the SLAC formulation.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Anyon Clusters in Fractional Quantum Hall Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20257v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In fractional quantum Hall fluids, the quasiparticle excitations are anyons with fractional charges and statistics. Effective interactions among the anyons can be induced by either model or realistic electron-electron (e-e) interactions. Without losing the generality, we investigate such phenomena for the Laughlin 1/3 and Moore-Read (MR) non-Abelian phases. Anyons display rich internal dynamics in both cases that will lead to interesting experimental consequences. In particular, bound states of two Laughlin anyons are preferred under short-range e-e interactions, leading to 2e/3 -- instead of e/3 -- effective charge carriers at low temperatures, which have been seen in several experiments. MR phases host two topologically distinct fusion channels: 1 and psi. The different effective interactions of e/4 anyons in the two sectors suggest the vanishing of the degeneracy of fusion channels when the e-e interaction is no longer its model Hamiltonian, in which case different bound states could also appear. This indicates the possibility of energetically manipulating the two types of anyons by tuning the bare e-e interactions. We point out that the results of recently developed high-resolution STM measurements will be affected by the effective anyon interactions, where anyons are clustered together after the tunneling of electrons. The low-lying parts of the local density of states affected by various anyon clusters are simulated for both Abelian and non-Abelian systems with (screened) Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>Addressing the Infinite Variance Problem in Fermionic Monte Carlo Simulations: Retrospective Error Remediation and the Exact Bridge Link Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the infinite variance problem in fermionic Monte Carlo simulations, which is widely encountered in areas ranging from condensed matter to nuclear and high-energy physics. The different algorithms, which we broadly refer to as determinantal quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC), are applied in many situations and differ in details, but they share a foundation in field theory, and often involve fermion determinants whose symmetry properties make the algorithm sign-problem-free. We show that the infinite variance problem arises as the observables computed in DQMC tend to form heavy-tailed distributions. To remedy this issue retrospectively, we introduce a tail-aware error estimation method to correct the otherwise unreliable estimates of confidence intervals. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to perform DQMC calculations that eliminate the infinite variance problem for a broad class of observables. Our approach is an exact bridge link method, which involves a simple and efficient modification to the standard DQMC algorithm. The method introduces no systematic bias and is straightforward to implement with minimal computational overhead. Our results establish a practical and robust solution to the infinite variance problem, with broad implications for improving the reliability of a variety of fundamental fermion simulations.</description>

      <title>Magnon topology driven by altermagnetism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Altermagnets present a class of fully compensated collinear magnetic order, where the two sublattices are not related merely by time-reversal combined with lattice translation or inversion, but require an additional lattice rotation. This distinctive symmetry leads to a characteristic splitting of the magnon bands; however the splitting is only partial -- residual degeneracies persist along certain lines in the Brillouin zone as a consequence of the underlying altermagnetic rotation. We consider a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnetic spin model on the checkerboard lattice and introduce additional interactions such as an external magnetic field and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, that lift these degeneracies. The resulting magnon bands become fully gapped and acquire non-trivial topology, characterized by nonzero Chern numbers. We demonstrate the crucial role of altermagnetism for the generation of the Berry curvature. As a direct consequence of the topological magnons, we find finite thermal Hall conductivity $\kappa_{xy}$, which exhibits a characteristic low-temperature scaling, $\kappa_{xy}\propto T^4$. Moreover, $\kappa_{xy}$ changes sign under reversal of the magnetic field, exhibiting a sharp jump across zero field at low temperatures. We also demonstrate topologically protected chiral edge modes in a finite strip geometry.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Moment Fragmentation in an All-in-All-out Pyrochlore $\mathrm{Nd_2Sn_2O_7}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report single crystal neutron spectroscopy and bulk characterization on hydrothermally grown $\mathrm{Nd_2Sn_2O_7}$, revealing magnetic moment fragmentation embedded within the all-in-all-out ordered state. The spectra show a nearly flat band with pinch-point-like momentum dependence, accompanied by dispersive branches that generate half-moon features across multiple Brillouin zones. These defining signatures are captured quantitatively by a minimal dipolar-octupolar spin Hamiltonian, demonstrating excellent agreement between experiment and theory. The higher flat-mode energy helps account for the absence of dynamical interference in prior $\mathrm{\mu SR}$ studies, while the lack of any photon-like excitation imposes strict constraints on the proposed Coulombic antiferromagnet scenario. Our results extend moment fragmentation to $\mathrm{Nd_2Sn_2O_7}$ and identify it as a clean, tractable platform for quantitative exploration of emergent gauge field physics and multipolar spin-wave dynamics in frustrated magnets.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Induced Breakdown of Anderson Localization: Thermodynamic Segregation disguised as the Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between strong disorder and repulsive interactions in the one-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model under open boundary conditions. While uncorrelated disorder is widely accepted to localize all single-particle eigenstates, a phenomenon typically reinforced by interactions in the Many-Body Localization (MBL) regime, we report a counter-intuitive breakdown of this paradigm. We demonstrate that strong repulsive interactions can overcome disorder-induced localization, driving the system into a macroscopically segregated phase where spin species accumulate at opposite boundaries. Although this boundary accumulation phenomenologically mimics the Non-Hermitian Skin Effect (NHSE) observed in non-reciprocal systems, our comprehensive analysis reveals a fundamentally different origin. By performing a rigorous control experiment in the Hermitian limit, we prove that the segregation persists without non-reciprocity, identifying many-body energy minimization as the primary driver. This "interaction-induced segregation" manifests as a sharp thermodynamic crossover, characterized by a divergent energy susceptibility, challenging the conventional understanding of disorder-interaction competition in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Altermagnetism and Weak Magnetism in the Insulating Distorted Perovskite Antiferromagnet NaOsO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The GdFeO$_3$-type perovskite antiferromagnet NaOsO$_3$, calculated here to be altermagnetic for all three typical collinear antiferromagnetic orders, was suggested early on to be a Slater-type insulator, due in large part to its continuous metal-insulator transition and its small energy gap. Below the N\'eel temperature, the gap opens along with ``weak magnetism'', accompanied by a sharp change in the magnetic susceptibility and resistivity. Without explicit correlation in the band structure calculation, and neglecting spin-orbit coupling (SOC), already a gap opens. Inclusion of a modest on-site Coulomb repulsion ($U\sim$1 eV) is sufficient to eliminate a SOC-induced small band overlap, opening a gap similar to the experimentally observed gap of around 100 meV. Combined evidence supports the viewpoint that NaOsO$_3$ lies in an unusual crossover region between Slater and Mott insulator. The unreported altermagnetism in NaOsO$_3$ is demonstrated and its consequences are considered. The origin of the very weak magnetism has been investigated using a combination of {\it ab initio} calculations and symmetry analysis of the magnetic space group, confirming the origin lying in the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya SOC buttressed by altermagnetic order. After determining the easy axis, our calculation leads to an Os spin canting angle of about 3$^{\circ}$, accounting for the observed weak magnetism and sharp change in the susceptibility. The altermagnetism spin-split bands (up to $\sim$100 meV) are accompanied by a chiral-split magnon spectrum in both acoustic and optical modes in the THz range, and lead to significant anomalous Hall conductivity upon hole doping.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in imbalanced bilayer Hubbard model: enhanced $d$-wave and weakened $s^\pm$-wave pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the bilayer model with two layers of imbalanced densities coupled by the interlayer hybridization. Using the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we discovered that increased hybridization induces a transition in the superconducting pairing from $d$-wave to $s^{\pm}$-wave and the superconducting $T_c$ of $d$-wave pairing exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the density imbalance. Remarkably, the optimal superconductivity(SC) occurs at a moderate imbalance. Our results support the possibility of $T_c$ enhancement in composite picture where the underdoped layer provides the pairing strength while the overdoped layer promotes the phase coherence. In addition, the SC can be possibly hosted by a single layer, which is reminiscent of our recent exploration on the trilayer Hubbard model. Our present study thus provides new insight that the SC can be enhanced via the layer differentiation.</description>

      <title>From hidden order to skyrmions: Quantum Hall states in an extended Hofstadter-Fermi-Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplay between topology and strong interactions gives rise to a variety of exotic quantum phases, including fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states and their lattice analogs - fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Such topologically ordered states host fractionalized excitations and, for spinful systems, are often accompanied by ferromagnetism and skyrmions. Here, we study a Hofstadter-Hubbard model of spinful fermions on a square lattice, extended by nearest-neighbor interactions. Using large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate the emergence of a spin-polarized $\frac{1}{3}$-Laughlin-like FCI phase, characterized by a quantized many-body Chern number, a finite charge gap, and hidden off-diagonal long-range order. We further investigate the quantum Hall ferromagnet at $\nu=1$ and its skyrmionic excitations upon doping. In particular, we find that nearest-neighbor repulsion is sufficient to stabilize both particle- and hole-skyrmions in the ground state around $\nu=1$, whereas we do not find such textures around $\nu=\frac{1}{3}$. The diagnostic toolbox presented in this work, based on local densities, correlation functions, and spin-resolved observables, is directly applicable in quantum gas microscopy experiments. Our results open new pathways for experimental exploration of FCIs with spin textures in both ultracold atom and electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity suppression and bilayer decoupling in Pr substituted YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15078v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanism behind superconductivity suppression induced by Pr substitutions in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ (YBCO) has been a mystery since its discovery: in spite of being isovalent to Y$^{3+}$ with a small magnetic moment, it is the only rare-earth element that has a dramatic impact on YBCO's superconducting properties. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and DFT+$U$ calculations, we uncover how Pr substitution modifies the low-energy electronic structure of YBCO. Contrary to the prevailing Fehrenbacher-Rice (FR) and Liechtenstein-Mazin (LM) models, the low energy electronic structure contains no signature of any $f$-electron hybridization or new states. Yet, strong electron doping is observed primarily on the antibonding Fermi surface. Meanwhile, we reveal major electronic structure modifications to Cu-derived states with increasing Pr substitution: a pronounced CuO$_2$ bilayer decoupling and an enhanced CuO chain hopping, implying indirect electron-release pathways beyond simple 4$f$ state ionization. Our results challenge the long-standing FR/LM mechanism and establish Pr substituted YBCO as a potential platform for exploring correlation-driven phenomena in coupled 1D-2D systems.</description>

      <title>Higgs physics in superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As pointed out by Nambu&amp;Goldstone, continuous symmetry breaking gives rise to gapless bosonic excitation. In superconductors, continuous local U(1) gauge symmetry is broken. The gapless excitation thus created is the collective phase mode of a superconductor. In 1962, Anderson pointed out that Coulomb interaction lifts this gapless mode to the superconducting plasma frequency. Therefore, in a superconducting fluid there are no bosonic excitations below the Cooper pair binding energy. Anderson mechanism also implies that the massless photon becomes massive in a superconductor. It provides a microscopic theory for dissipationless charge transport (with Landau criterion for superfluidity) and the Meissner effect in a superconductor. Jumping to particle physics, to explain why the gauge bosons for electroweak interaction are massive, Higgs, Englert, Kibble et al. proposed the existence of the Higgs field. This matter field couples to the massless W, Z bosons and generates mass via the Higgs mechanism. Due to their conceptual similarities, these two mechanisms are referred to as the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. In 2013, the detection of the Higgs boson provided the final proof for the Higgs hypothesis decades after its conception. The amplitude mode of a superconductor, which corresponds to the Higgs boson in the above analogy, is referred to as the Higgs mode. Its spectroscopic detection has also remained elusive for decades. In recent years, the development of ultrafast techniques enabled an effective approach for studying the mode. Here, we introduce the Higgs mode from a perspective of why superconductors superconduct and review the recent development in Higgs spectroscopy, particularly in the field of nonlinear terahertz spectroscopy. We discuss the novel insights that may be learnt from these studies for future high-Tc superconductivity and correlated materials research in general.</description>
