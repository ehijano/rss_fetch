      <title>Validation of a Third Planet in the LHS 1678 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nearby LHS 1678 (TOI-696) system contains two confirmed planets and a wide-orbit, likely-brown-dwarf companion, which orbit an M2 dwarf with a unique evolutionary history. The host star occupies a narrow "gap" in the HR diagram lower main sequence, associated with the M dwarf fully convective boundary and long-term luminosity fluctuations. This system is one of only about a dozen M dwarf multi-planet systems to date that hosts an ultra-short period planet (USP). Here we validate and characterize a third planet in the LHS 1678 system using TESS Cycle 1 and 3 data and a new ensemble of ground-based light curves. LHS 1678 d is a 0.98 +/-0.07 Earth radii planet in a 4.97-day orbit, with an insolation flux of 9.1 +0.9/-0.8 Earth insolations. These properties place it near 4:3 mean motion resonance with LHS 1678 c and in company with LHS 1678 c in the Venus zone. LHS 1678 c and d are also twins in size and predicted mass, making them a powerful duo for comparative exoplanet studies. LHS 1678 d joins its siblings as another compelling candidate for atmospheric measurements with the JWST and mass measurements using high-precision radial velocity techniques. Additionally, USP LHS 1678 b breaks the "peas-in-a-pod" trend in this system, although additional planets could fill in the "pod" beyond its orbit. LHS 1678's unique combination of system properties and their relative rarity among the ubiquity of compact multi-planet systems around M dwarfs makes the system a valuable benchmark for testing theories of planet formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Encounter circumstances of asteroid 99942 Apophis with the catalogue of known asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroid 99942 Apophis will pass near the Earth in April 2029. Expected to miss our planet by a safe margin, that could change if Apophis' path was perturbed by a collision with another asteroid in the interim. Though the statistical chance of such a collision is minuscule, the high risk associated with Apophis motivates us to examine even this very unlikely scenario. In this work, we identify encounters between known asteroids and Apophis up to April 2029. Here we show that Apophis will encounter the 1300 meter diameter asteroid 4544 Xanthus in December 2026. Their Minimum Orbit Intersection Distance (MOID) is less than 10,000 km, with Xanthus passing that closest point just four hours after Apophis. Though a direct collision is ruled out, the encounter is close enough that material accompanying Xanthus (if any) could strike Apophis. We also identify other asteroid encounters that deserve monitoring.</description>

      <title>LV: A HeI survey of close-in giant planets hosted by M-K dwarf stars with GIANO-B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric escape plays a fundamental role in shaping the properties of exoplanets. The metastable near-infrared helium triplet at 1083.3 nm (HeI) is a powerful proxy of extended and evaporating atmospheres. We used the GIARPS (GIANO-B+HARPS-N) observing mode of the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo to search for HeI absorption in the upper atmosphere of five close-in giant planets hosted by the K and M dwarf stars of our sample, namely WASP-69b, WASP-107b, HAT-P-11b, GJ436b, and GJ3470b. We focused our analysis on the HeI triplet by performing high-resolution transmission spectroscopy. When nightly variability in the HeI absorption signal was identified, we investigated the potential influence of stellar magnetic activity by searching for variations in the H$\alpha$. We spectrally resolve the HeI triplet and confirm the published detections for WASP-69b (3.91$\pm$0.22%, 17.6$\sigma$), WASP-107b (8.17$^{+0.80}_{-0.76}$%, 10.5$\sigma$), HAT-P-11b (1.36$\pm$0.17%, 8.0$\sigma$), and GJ3470b (1.75$^{+0.39}_{-0.36}$%, 4.7$\sigma$). We do not find evidence of extra absorption for GJ436b. We observe night-to-night variations in the HeI absorption signal for WASP-69b, associated with variability in H$\alpha$, which likely indicates the influence of stellar activity. Additionally, we find that the HeI signal of GJ3470b originates from a single transit, thereby corroborating the discrepancies in the existing literature. An inspection of the H$\alpha$ reveals an absorption signal during the same transit. By combining our findings with previous analyses of GIANO-B HeI measurements of planets around K dwarfs, we explore potential trends with planetary/stellar parameters that are thought to affect the HeI absorption. Our analysis is unable to identify clear patterns, emphasising the need for further measurements and the exploration of additional potential parameters that might influence HeI absorption.</description>

      <title>The First Spatially-resolved Detection of $^{13}$CN in a Protoplanetary Disk and Evidence for Complex Carbon Isotope Fractionation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of carbon isotope ratios in both protoplanetary disks and exoplanet atmospheres have suggested a possible transfer of significant carbon isotope fractionation from disks to planets. For a clearer understanding of the isotopic link between disks and planets, it is important to measure the carbon isotope ratios in various species. In this paper, we present a detection of the $^{13}$CN $N=2-1$ hyperfine lines in the TW Hya disk with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. This is the first spatially-resolved detection of $^{13}$CN in disks, which enables us to measure the spatially resolved $^{12}$CN/$^{13}$CN ratio for the first time. We conducted non-local thermal equilibrium modeling of the $^{13}$CN lines in conjunction with previously observed $^{12}$CN lines to derive the kinetic temperature, ${\rm H_2}$ volume density, and column densities of $^{12}$CN and $^{13}$CN. The ${\rm H_2}$ volume density is found to range between $ (4 - 10)\times10^7 \ {\rm cm^{-3}}$, suggesting that CN molecules mainly reside in the disk upper layer. The $^{12}$CN/$^{13}$CN ratio is measured to be $ 70^{+9}_{-6}$ at $30 &lt; r &lt; 80$ au from the central star, which is similar to the $\rm ^{12}C/^{13}C$ ratio in the interstellar medium. However, this value differs from the previously reported values found for other carbon-bearing molecules (CO and HCN) in the TW Hya disk. This could be self-consistently explained by different emission layer heights for different molecules combined with preferential sequestration of $\rm ^{12}C$ into the solid phase towards the disk midplane. This study reveals the complexity of the carbon isotope fractionation operating in disks.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric entry and fragmentation of small asteroid 2024 BX1: Bolide trajectory, orbit, dynamics, light curve, and spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asteroid 2024 BX1 was the eighth asteroid discovered shortly before colliding with the Earth.The associated bolide was recorded by dedicated instruments of the European Fireball Network and the AllSky7 network on January 21, 2024 at 0:32:38-44 UT. Here we report a comprehensive analysis of this instrumentally observed meteorite fall, which occurred as predicted west of Berlin, Germany. The atmospheric trajectory was quite steep with an average slope to the Earth's surface 75.6 degrees. The entry speed was 15.20 km/s. The heliocentric orbit calculated from the bolide data agrees very well with the asteroid data. However, the bolide was fainter than expected for a reportedly meter-sized asteroid. The absolute magnitude reached -14.4 and the entry mass was estimated to 140 kg. The recorded bolide spectrum was low in iron from what an enstatite-rich meteorite was expected. Indeed, the recovered meteorites, called Ribbeck, were classified as aubrites. The high albedo of enstatite (E-type) asteroids can explain the size discrepancy. The asteroid was likely smaller than 0.5 meter and should be rather called a meteoroid. During the atmospheric entry, the meteoroid severely fragmented into much smaller pieces already at a height of 55 km under the aerodynamic pressure of 0.12 MPa. The primary fragments were then breaking-up again, most frequently at heights 39-29 km (0.9-2.2 MPa). Numerous small meteorites and up to four stones larger than 100g were expected to land. Within a few days of publishing the strewn field dozens of meteorites were found in the area we predicted.</description>

      <title>Resolved ALMA observations of water in the inner astronomical units of the HL Tau disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The water molecule is a key ingredient in the formation of planetary systems, with the water snowline being a favourable location for the growth of massive planetary cores. Here we present Atacama Large Millimeter/ submillimeter Array data of the ringed protoplanetary disk orbiting the young star HL Tauri that show centrally peaked, bright emission arising from three distinct transitions of the main water isotopologue. The spatially and spectrally resolved water content probes gas in a thermal range down to the water sublimation temperature. Our analysis implies a stringent lower limit of 3.7 Earth oceans of water vapour available within the inner 17 astronomical units of the system. We show that our observations are limited to probing the water content in the atmosphere of the disk, due to the high dust column density and absorption, and indicate that the main water isotopologue is the best tracer to spatially resolve water vapour in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Physical properties of asteroid Dimorphos as derived from the DART impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On September 26, 2022, NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission successfully impacted Dimorphos, the natural satellite of the binary near-Earth asteroid (65803) Didymos. Numerical simulations of the impact provide a means to explore target surface material properties and structures, consistent with the observed momentum deflection efficiency, ejecta cone geometry, and ejected mass. Our simulation, which best matches observations, indicates that Dimorphos is weak, with a cohesive strength of less than a few pascals (Pa), similar to asteroids (162173) Ryugu and (101955) Bennu. We find that a bulk density of Dimorphos, rhoB, lower than 2400 kg/m3, and a low volume fraction of boulders (&lt;40 vol%) on the surface and in the shallow subsurface, are consistent with measured data from the DART experiment. These findings suggest Dimorphos is a rubble pile that might have formed through rotational mass shedding and re-accumulation from Didymos. Our simulations indicate that the DART impact caused global deformation and resurfacing of Dimorphos. ESA's upcoming Hera mission may find a re-shaped asteroid, rather than a well-defined crater.</description>

      <title>Transiting exoplanets with the Mid-InfraRed Instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope: From simulations to observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has now started its exploration of exoplanetary worlds. In particular, the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) with its Low-Resolution Spectrometer (LRS) carries out transit, eclipse, and phase-curve spectroscopy of exoplanetary atmospheres with unprecedented precision in a so far almost uncharted wavelength range. The precision and significance in the detection of molecules in exoplanetary atmospheres rely on a thorough understanding of the instrument itself and accurate data reduction methods. This paper aims to provide a clear description of the instrumental systematics that affect observations of transiting exoplanets through the use of simulations. We carried out realistic simulations of transiting-exoplanet observations with the MIRI LRS instrument that included the model of the exoplanet system, the optical path of the telescope, the MIRI detector performances, and instrumental systematics and drifts that could alter the atmospheric features we are meant to detect in the data. After introducing our pipeline, we show its performance on the transit of L168-9b, a super-Earth-sized exoplanet observed during the commissioning of the MIRI instrument. This paper provides a better understanding of the data themselves and of the best practices in terms of reduction and analysis through comparisons between simulations and real data. We show that simulations validate the current data-analysis methods. Simulations also highlight instrumental effects that impact the accuracy of our current spectral extraction techniques. These simulations are proven to be essential in the preparation of JWST observation programs and help us assess the detectability of various atmospheric and surface scenarios.</description>

      <title>Lessons learned from NASA's DART impact about disrupting rubble-pile asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a series of numerical simulations using a shock physics smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code, investigating energetic impacts on small celestial bodies characterised by diverse internal structures, ranging from weak and homogeneous compositions to rubble-pile structures with varying boulder volume packing. Our findings reveal that the internal structure of these rubble-pile bodies significantly influences the impact outcomes. Specifically, we observe that the same impact energy can either catastrophically disrupt a target with a low boulder packing (&lt;30 vol%), or result in the ejection of only a small fraction of material from a target with the same mass but high boulder packing (&gt;40 vol%). This finding highlights the pivotal role played by the rubble-pile structure, effectively acting as a bulk shear strength, which governs the size and behaviour of the resulting impact. Consequently, understanding and characterising the internal structure of asteroids will be of paramount importance for any future efforts to deflect or disrupt an asteroid on a collision course with Earth.</description>

      <title>Towards Prebiotic Chemistry on Titan: Impact experiments on organic haze particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Impacts are critical to producing the aqueous environments necessary to stimulate prebiotic chemistry on Titan's surface. Furthermore, organic hazes resting on the surface are a likely feedstock of biomolecules. In this work, we conduct impact experiments on laboratory-produced organic haze particles and haze/sand mixtures and analyze these samples for life's building blocks. Samples of unshocked haze and sand particles are also analyzed to determine the change in biomolecule concentrations and distributions from shocking. Across all samples, we detect seven nucleobases, nine proteinogenic amino acids, and five other biomolecules (e.g., urea) using a blank subtraction procedure to eliminate signals due to contamination. We find that shock pressures of 13 GPa variably degrade nucleobases, amino acids, and a few other organics in haze particles and haze/sand mixtures; however, certain individual biomolecules become enriched or are even produced from these events. Xanthine, threonine, and aspartic acid are enriched or produced in impact experiments containing sand, suggesting these minerals may catalyze the production of these biomolecules. On the other hand, thymine and isoleucine/norleucine are enriched or produced in haze samples containing no sand, suggesting catalytic grains are not necessary for all impact shock syntheses. Uracil, glycine, proline, cysteine, and tyrosine are the most unstable to impact-related processing. These experiments suggest that impacts alter biomolecule distributions on Titan's surface, and that organic hazes co-occurring with fine-grained material on the surface may provide an initial source for further prebiotic chemistry on Titan.</description>

      <title>Stellar Surface Magnetic Fields Impact Limb Darkening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stars appear darker at their limbs than at their disk centers because at the limb we are viewing the higher and cooler layers of stellar photospheres. Limb darkening derived from state-of-the-art stellar atmosphere models systematically fails to reproduce recent transiting exoplanet light curves from the Kepler, TESS, and JWST telescopes -- stellar brightness obtained from measurements drops less steeply towards the limb than predicted by models. All previous models assumed atmosphere devoid of magnetic fields. Here we use our new stellar atmosphere models computed with the 3D radiative magneto-hydrodynamic code MURaM to show that small-scale concentration of magnetic fields on the stellar surface affect limb darkening at a level that allows us to explain the observations. Our findings provide a way forward to improve the determination of exoplanet radii and especially the transmission spectroscopy analysis for transiting planets, which relies on a very accurate description of stellar limb darkening from the visible through the infrared. Furthermore, our findings imply that limb darkening allows measuring the small-scale magnetic field on stars with transiting planets.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Robotic Arm Manipulation for Planetary Missions using Causal Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00470</link>

Abstract: Autonomous robotic arm manipulators have the potential to make planetary exploration and in-situ resource utilization missions more time efficient and productive, as the manipulator can handle the objects itself and perform goal-specific actions. We train a manipulator to autonomously study objects of which it has no prior knowledge, such as planetary rocks. This is achieved using causal machine learning in a simulated planetary environment. Here, the manipulator interacts with objects, and classifies them based on differing causal factors. These are parameters, such as mass or friction coefficient, that causally determine the outcomes of its interactions. Through reinforcement learning, the manipulator learns to interact in ways that reveal the underlying causal factors. We show that this method works even without any prior knowledge of the objects, or any previously-collected training data. We carry out the training in planetary exploration conditions, with realistic manipulator models.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Rapid Exploration in Close-Proximity of an Asteroid</title>

Abstract: The increasing number of space missions may overwhelm ground support infrastructure, prompting the need for autonomous deep-space guidance, navigation, and control (GN\&amp;C) systems. These systems offer sustainable and cost-effective solutions, particularly for asteroid missions that deal with uncertain environments. This study proposes a paradigm shift from the proposals currently found in the literature for autonomous asteroid exploration, which inherit the conservative architecture from the ground-in-the-loop approach that relies heavily on reducing uncertainties before close-proximity operations. Instead, it advocates for robust guidance and control to handle uncertainties directly, without extensive navigation campaigns. From a series of conservative assumptions, we demonstrate the feasibility of this autonomous GN\&amp;C for robotic spacecraft by using existing technology. It is shown that a bolder operational approach enables autonomous spacecraft to significantly reduce exploration time by weeks or months. This paradigm shift holds great potential for reducing costs and saving time in autonomous missions of the future.</description>

      <title>Retention of CO Ice and Gas Within 486958 Arrokoth</title>

Abstract: Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs) represent some of the most ancient remnants of our solar system, having evaded significant thermal or evolutionary processing. This makes them important targets for exploration as they offer a unique opportunity to scrutinize materials that are remnants of the epoch of planet formation. Moreover, with recent and upcoming observations of KBOs, there is a growing interest in understanding the extent to which these objects can preserve their most primitive, hypervolatile ices. Here, we present a theoretical framework that revisits this issue for small, cold classical KBOs like Arrokoth. Our analytical approach is consistent with prior studies but assumes an extreme cold end-member thermophysical regime for Arrokoth, enabling us to capture the essential physics without computationally expensive simulations. Under reasonable assumptions for interior temperatures, thermal conductivities, and permeabilities, we demonstrate that Arrokoth can retain its original CO stock for Gyrs if it was assembled long after the decay of radionuclides. The sublimation of CO ice generates an effective CO `atmosphere' within Arrokoth's porous matrix, which remains in near vapor-pressure equilibrium with the ice layer just below, thereby limiting CO loss. According to our findings, Arrokoth expels no more than $\approx 10^{22}$ particles s$^{-1}$, in agreement with upper limits inferred from \textit{New Horizons}' 2019 flyby observations. While our framework challenges recent predictions, it can serve as a benchmark for existing numerical models and be applied to future KBO observations from next-generation telescopes.</description>

      <title>A Tale of 3 Dwarf Planets: Ices and Organics on Sedna, Gonggong, and Quaoar from JWST Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We observed Sedna, Gonggong, and Quaoar with the NIRSpec instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). All three bodies were observed in the low-resolution prism mode at wavelengths spanning 0.7 to 5.2 $\mu$m. Quaoar was also observed at 10x higher spectral resolution from 0.97 to 3.16 $\mu$m using medium-resolution gratings. Sedna's spectrum shows a large number of absorption features due to ethane (C$_2$H$_6$), as well as acetylene (C$_2$H$_2$), ethylene (C$_2$H$_4$), H$_2$O, and possibly minor CO$_2$. Gonggong's spectrum also shows several, but fewer and weaker, ethane features, along with stronger and cleaner H$_2$O features and CO$_2$ complexed with other molecules. Quaoar's prism spectrum shows even fewer and weaker ethane features, the deepest and cleanest H$_2$O features, a feature at 3.2 $\mu$m possibly due to HCN, and CO$_2$ ice. The higher-resolution medium grating spectrum of Quaoar reveals several overtone and combination bands of ethane and methane (CH$_4$). Spectra of all three objects show steep red spectral slopes and strong, broad absorptions between 2.7 and 3.6 $\mu$m indicative of complex organic molecules. The suite of light hydrocarbons and complex organic molecules are interpreted as the products of irradiation of methane. We infer that the differences in apparent abundances of irradiation products are likely due to their distinctive orbits, which lead to different timescales of methane retention and to different charged particle irradiation environments. In all cases, however, the continued presence of light hydrocarbons implies a resupply of methane to the surface. We suggest that these three bodies have undergone internal melting and geochemical evolution similar to the larger dwarf planets and distinct from all smaller KBOs.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent Conditions for $^{26}$Al Injection into Protosolar Disk from a Nearby Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01948v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The early solar system contained a short-lived radionuclide, $^{26}$Al (its half-life time $t_{1/2} = 0.7$ Myr). The decay energy $^{26}$Al is thought to have controlled the thermal evolution of planetesimals and, possibly, the water contents of planets. Many hypotheses have been proposed for the origin of $^{26}$Al in the solar system. One of the possible hypotheses is the `disk injection scenario'; when the protoplanetary disk of the solar system had already formed, a nearby $(&lt;1 \,\mathrm{pc})$ supernova injected radioactive material directly into the disk. Such a $^{26}$Al injection hypothesis has been tested so far with limited setups for disk structure and supernova distance, and treated disk disruption and $^{26}$Al injection separately. Here, we revisit this problem to investigate whether there are self-consistent conditions under which the surviving disk radius can receive enough $^{26}$Al which can account for the abundance in the early solar system. We also consider a range of disk mass and structure, $^{26}$Al yields from supernova, and a large dust mass fraction $\eta_\mathrm{d}$. We find that $^{26}$Al yields of supernova are required as $\gtrsim 2.1\times10^{-3}M_\odot(\eta_\mathrm{d}/0.2)^{-1}$, challenging to achieve with known possible $^{26}$Al ejection and dust mass fraction ranges. Furthermore, we find that even if the above conditions are met, the supernova flow changes the disk temperature, which may not be consistent with the solar-system record. Our results place a strong constraint on the disk injection scenario. Rather, we suggest that the fresh $^{26}$Al of the early solar system must have been synthesized/injected in other ways.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jiao Tong University Spectroscopic Telescope (JUST) is a 4.4-meter f/6.0 segmentedmirror telescope dedicated to spectroscopic observations. The JUST primary mirror is composed of 18 hexagonal segments, each with a diameter of 1.1 m. JUST provides two Nasmyth platforms for placing science instruments. One Nasmyth focus fits a field of view of 10 arcmin and the other has an extended field of view of 1.2 deg with correction optics. A tertiary mirror is used to switch between the two Nasmyth foci. JUST will be installed at a site at Lenghu in Qinghai Province, China, and will conduct spectroscopic observations with three types of instruments to explore the dark universe, trace the dynamic universe, and search for exoplanets: (1) a multi-fiber (2000 fibers) medium-resolution spectrometer (R=4000-5000) to spectroscopically map galaxies and large-scale structure; (2) an integral field unit (IFU) array of 500 optical fibers and/or a long-slit spectrograph dedicated to fast follow-ups of transient sources for multimessenger astronomy; (3) a high-resolution spectrometer (R~100000) designed to identify Jupiter analogs and Earth-like planets, with the capability to characterize the atmospheres of hot exoplanets.</description>
