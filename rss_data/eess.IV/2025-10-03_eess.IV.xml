      <title>An Efficient Quality Metric for Video Frame Interpolation Based on Motion-Field Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video frame interpolation is a fundamental tool for temporal video enhancement, but existing quality metrics struggle to evaluate the perceptual impact of interpolation artefacts effectively. Metrics like PSNR, SSIM and LPIPS ignore temporal coherence. State-of-the-art quality metrics tailored towards video frame interpolation, like FloLPIPS, have been developed but suffer from computational inefficiency that limits their practical application. We present $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$, a novel full-reference quality metric that enhances PSNR through motion divergence weighting, a technique adapted from archival film restoration where it was developed to detect temporal inconsistencies. Our approach highlights singularities in motion fields which is then used to weight image errors. Evaluation on the BVI-VFI dataset (180 sequences across multiple frame rates, resolutions and interpolation methods) shows $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ achieves statistically significant improvements: +0.09 Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient over FloLPIPS, while being 2.5$\times$ faster and using 4$\times$ less memory. Performance remains consistent across all content categories and are robust to the motion estimator used. The efficiency and accuracy of $\text{PSNR}_{\text{DIV}}$ enables fast quality evaluation and practical use as a loss function for training neural networks for video frame interpolation tasks. An implementation of our metric is available at www.github.com/conalld/psnr-div.</description>

      <title>Median2Median: Zero-shot Suppression of Structured Noise in Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image denoising is a fundamental problem in computer vision and medical imaging. However, real-world images are often degraded by structured noise with strong anisotropic correlations that existing methods struggle to remove. Most data-driven approaches rely on large datasets with high-quality labels and still suffer from limited generalizability, whereas existing zero-shot methods avoid this limitation but remain effective only for independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise. To address this gap, we propose Median2Median (M2M), a zero-shot denoising framework designed for structured noise. M2M introduces a novel sampling strategy that generates pseudo-independent sub-image pairs from a single noisy input. This strategy leverages directional interpolation and generalized median filtering to adaptively exclude values distorted by structured artifacts. To further enlarge the effective sampling space and eliminate systematic bias, a randomized assignment strategy is employed, ensuring that the sampled sub-image pairs are suitable for Noise2Noise training. In our realistic simulation studies, M2M performs on par with state-of-the-art zero-shot methods under i.i.d. noise, while consistently outperforming them under correlated noise. These findings establish M2M as an efficient, data-free solution for structured noise suppression and mark the first step toward effective zero-shot denoising beyond the strict i.i.d. assumption.</description>

      <title>GFSR-Net: Guided Focus via Segment-Wise Relevance Network for Interpretable Deep Learning in Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success in medical image analysis, however its adoption in clinical practice is limited by a lack of interpretability. These models often make correct predictions without explaining their reasoning. They may also rely on image regions unrelated to the disease or visual cues, such as annotations, that are not present in real-world conditions. This can reduce trust and increase the risk of misleading diagnoses. We introduce the Guided Focus via Segment-Wise Relevance Network (GFSR-Net), an approach designed to improve interpretability and reliability in medical imaging. GFSR-Net uses a small number of human annotations to approximate where a person would focus within an image intuitively, without requiring precise boundaries or exhaustive markings, making the process fast and practical. During training, the model learns to align its focus with these areas, progressively emphasizing features that carry diagnostic meaning. This guidance works across different types of natural and medical images, including chest X-rays, retinal scans, and dermatological images. Our experiments demonstrate that GFSR achieves comparable or superior accuracy while producing saliency maps that better reflect human expectations. This reduces the reliance on irrelevant patterns and increases confidence in automated diagnostic tools.</description>

      <title>MSRepaint: Multiple Sclerosis Repaint with Conditional Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model for Bidirectional Lesion Filling and Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multiple sclerosis, lesions interfere with automated magnetic resonance imaging analyses such as brain parcellation and deformable registration, while lesion segmentation models are hindered by the limited availability of annotated training data. To address both issues, we propose MSRepaint, a unified diffusion-based generative model for bidirectional lesion filling and synthesis that restores anatomical continuity for downstream analyses and augments segmentation through realistic data generation. MSRepaint conditions on spatial lesion masks for voxel-level control, incorporates contrast dropout to handle missing inputs, integrates a repainting mechanism to preserve surrounding anatomy during lesion filling and synthesis, and employs a multi-view DDIM inversion and fusion pipeline for 3D consistency with fast inference. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of MSRepaint across multiple tasks. For lesion filling, we evaluate both the accuracy within the filled regions and the impact on downstream tasks including brain parcellation and deformable registration. MSRepaint outperforms the traditional lesion filling methods FSL and NiftySeg, and achieves accuracy on par with FastSurfer-LIT, a recent diffusion model-based inpainting method, while offering over 20 times faster inference. For lesion synthesis, state-of-the-art MS lesion segmentation models trained on MSRepaint-synthesized data outperform those trained on CarveMix-synthesized data or real ISBI challenge training data across multiple benchmarks, including the MICCAI 2016 and UMCL datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that MSRepaint's unified bidirectional filling and synthesis capability, with full spatial control over lesion appearance, enables high-fidelity simulation of lesion evolution in longitudinal MS progression.</description>

      <title>SpurBreast: A Curated Dataset for Investigating Spurious Correlations in Real-world Breast MRI Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in medical imaging, yet their real-world deployment remains challenging due to spurious correlations, where models can learn non-clinical features instead of meaningful medical patterns. Existing medical imaging datasets are not designed to systematically study this issue, largely due to restrictive licensing and limited supplementary patient data. To address this gap, we introduce SpurBreast, a curated breast MRI dataset that intentionally incorporates spurious correlations to evaluate their impact on model performance. Analyzing over 100 features involving patient, device, and imaging protocol, we identify two dominant spurious signals: magnetic field strength (a global feature influencing the entire image) and image orientation (a local feature affecting spatial alignment). Through controlled dataset splits, we demonstrate that DNNs can exploit these non-clinical signals, achieving high validation accuracy while failing to generalize to unbiased test data. Alongside these two datasets containing spurious correlations, we also provide benchmark datasets without spurious correlations, allowing researchers to systematically investigate clinically relevant and irrelevant features, uncertainty estimation, adversarial robustness, and generalization strategies. Models and datasets are available at https://github.com/utkuozbulak/spurbreast.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Guided Consistency Model Sampling for Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have become powerful generative priors for solving inverse imaging problems, but their reliance on slow multi-step sampling limits practical deployment. Consistency models address this bottleneck by enabling high-quality generation in a single or only a few steps, yet their direct adaptation to inverse problems is underexplored. In this paper, we present a modified consistency sampling approach tailored for inverse problem reconstruction: the sampler's stochasticity is guided by a measurement-consistency mechanism tied to the measurement operator, which enforces fidelity to the acquired measurements while retaining the efficiency of consistency-based generation. Experiments on Fashion-MNIST and LSUN Bedroom datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual and pixel-level metrics, including Fr\'echet Inception Distance, Kernel Inception Distance, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index measure, compared to baseline consistency sampling, yielding competitive or superior reconstructions with only a handful of steps.</description>

      <title>Development and Evaluation of an AI-Driven Telemedicine System for Prenatal Healthcare</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Access to obstetric ultrasound is often limited in low-resource settings, particularly in rural areas of low- and middle-income countries. This work proposes a human-in-the-loop artificial intelligence (AI) system designed to assist midwives in acquiring diagnostically relevant fetal images using blind sweep protocols. The system incorporates a classification model along with a web-based platform for asynchronous specialist reviews. By identifying key frames in blind sweep studies, the AI system allows specialists to concentrate on interpretation rather than having to review entire videos. To evaluate its performance, blind sweep videos captured by a small group of soft-trained midwives using a low-cost Point-of-Care Ultrasound (POCUS) device were analyzed. The system demonstrated promising results in identifying standard fetal planes from sweeps made by non-experts. A field evaluation indicated good usability and a low cognitive workload, suggesting that it has the potential to expand access to prenatal imaging in underserved regions.</description>

      <title>JaneEye: A 12-nm 2K-FPS 18.9-$\mu$J/Frame Event-based Eye Tracking Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eye tracking has become a key technology for gaze-based interactions in Extended Reality (XR). However, conventional frame-based eye-tracking systems often fall short of XR's stringent requirements for high accuracy, low latency, and energy efficiency. Event cameras present a compelling alternative, offering ultra-high temporal resolution and low power consumption. In this paper, we present JaneEye, an energy-efficient event-based eye-tracking hardware accelerator designed specifically for wearable devices, leveraging sparse, high-temporal-resolution event data. We introduce an ultra-lightweight neural network architecture featuring a novel ConvJANET layer, which simplifies the traditional ConvLSTM by retaining only the forget gate, thereby halving computational complexity without sacrificing temporal modeling capability. Our proposed model achieves high accuracy with a pixel error of 2.45 on the 3ET+ dataset, using only 17.6K parameters, with up to 1250 Hz event frame rate. To further enhance hardware efficiency, we employ custom linear approximations of activation functions (hardsigmoid and hardtanh) and fixed-point quantization. Through software-hardware co-design, our 12-nm ASIC implementation operates at 400 MHz, delivering an end-to-end latency of 0.5 ms (equivalent to 2000 Frames Per Second (FPS)) at an energy efficiency of 18.9 $\mu$J/frame. JaneEye sets a new benchmark in low-power, high-performance eye-tracking solutions suitable for integration into next-generation XR wearables.</description>

      <title>A Multicentric Dataset for Training and Benchmarking Breast Cancer Segmentation in H&amp;E Slides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated semantic segmentation of whole-slide images (WSIs) stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) is essential for large-scale artificial intelligence-based biomarker analysis in breast cancer. However, existing public datasets for breast cancer segmentation lack the morphological diversity needed to support model generalizability and robust biomarker validation across heterogeneous patient cohorts. We introduce BrEast cancEr hisTopathoLogy sEgmentation (BEETLE), a dataset for multiclass semantic segmentation of H&amp;E-stained breast cancer WSIs. It consists of 587 biopsies and resections from three collaborating clinical centers and two public datasets, digitized using seven scanners, and covers all molecular subtypes and histological grades. Using diverse annotation strategies, we collected annotations across four classes - invasive epithelium, non-invasive epithelium, necrosis, and other - with particular focus on morphologies underrepresented in existing datasets, such as ductal carcinoma in situ and dispersed lobular tumor cells. The dataset's diversity and relevance to the rapidly growing field of automated biomarker quantification in breast cancer ensure its high potential for reuse. Finally, we provide a well-curated, multicentric external evaluation set to enable standardized benchmarking of breast cancer segmentation models.</description>

      <title>SUPER-Net: Trustworthy Image Segmentation via Uncertainty Propagation in Encoder-Decoder Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.05978v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds great promise in reshaping the industry owing to its precision, efficiency, and objectivity. However, the brittleness of DL models to noisy and out-of-distribution inputs is ailing their deployment in sensitive fields. Current models often lack uncertainty quantification, providing only point estimates. We propose SUPER-Net, a Bayesian framework for trustworthy image segmentation via uncertainty propagation. Using Taylor series approximations, SUPER-Net propagates the mean and covariance of the model's posterior distribution across nonlinear layers. It generates two outputs simultaneously: the segmented image and a pixel-wise uncertainty map, eliminating the need for expensive Monte Carlo sampling. SUPER-Net's performance is extensively evaluated on MRI and CT scans under various noisy and adversarial conditions. Results show that SUPER-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models in robustness and accuracy. The uncertainty map identifies low-confidence areas affected by noise or attacks, allowing the model to self-assess segmentation reliability, particularly when errors arise from noise or adversarial examples.</description>

      <title>A Tutorial on MRI Reconstruction: From Modern Methods to Clinical Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MRI is an indispensable clinical tool, offering a rich variety of tissue contrasts to support broad diagnostic and research applications. Clinical exams routinely acquire multiple structural sequences that provide complementary information for differential diagnosis, while research protocols often incorporate advanced functional, diffusion, spectroscopic, and relaxometry sequences to capture multidimensional insights into tissue structure and composition. However, these capabilities come at the cost of prolonged scan times, which reduce patient throughput, increase susceptibility to motion artifacts, and may require trade-offs in image quality or diagnostic scope. Over the last two decades, advances in image reconstruction algorithms--alongside improvements in hardware and pulse sequence design--have made it possible to accelerate acquisitions while preserving diagnostic quality. Central to this progress is the ability to incorporate prior information to regularize the solutions to the reconstruction problem. In this tutorial, we overview the basics of MRI reconstruction and highlight state-of-the-art approaches, beginning with classical methods that rely on explicit hand-crafted priors, and then turning to deep learning methods that leverage a combination of learned and crafted priors to further push the performance envelope. We also explore the translational aspects and eventual clinical implications of these methods. We conclude by discussing future directions to address remaining challenges in MRI reconstruction. The tutorial is accompanied by a Python toolbox (https://github.com/tutorial-MRI-recon/tutorial) to demonstrate select methods discussed in the article.</description>

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely used in clinical practice due to its cost-effectiveness, mobility, and safety. However, current AI research often treats disease prediction and tissue segmentation as two separate tasks and their model requires substantial computational overhead. In such a situation, we introduce UltraUPConvNet, a computationally efficient universal framework designed for both ultrasound image classification and segmentation. Trained on a large-scale dataset containing more than 9,700 annotations across seven different anatomical regions, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on certain datasets with lower computational overhead. Our model weights and codes are available at https://github.com/yyxl123/UltraUPConvNet</description>

      <title>Improving Virtual Contrast Enhancement using Longitudinal Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are widely used in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to enhance lesion detection and characterisation, particularly in the field of neuro-oncology. Nevertheless, concerns regarding gadolinium retention and accumulation in brain and body tissues, most notably for diseases that require close monitoring and frequent GBCA injection, have led to the need for strategies to reduce dosage. In this study, a deep learning framework is proposed for the virtual contrast enhancement of full-dose post-contrast T1-weighted MRI images from corresponding low-dose acquisitions. The contribution of the presented model is its utilisation of longitudinal information, which is achieved by incorporating a prior full-dose MRI examination from the same patient. A comparative evaluation against a non-longitudinal single session model demonstrated that the longitudinal approach significantly improves image quality across multiple reconstruction metrics. Furthermore, experiments with varying simulated contrast doses confirmed the robustness of the proposed method. These results emphasize the potential of integrating prior imaging history into deep learning-based virtual contrast enhancement pipelines to reduce GBCA usage without compromising diagnostic utility, thus paving the way for safer, more sustainable longitudinal monitoring in clinical MRI practice.</description>

Abstract: The next decade will usher in a profound transformation of wireless communication, driven by the ever-increasing demand for data-intensive applications and the rapid adoption of emerging technologies. To fully unlock the potential of 5G and beyond, substantial advancements are required in signal processing techniques, innovative network architectures, and efficient spectrum utilization strategies. These advancements facilitate seamless integration of emerging technologies, driving industrial digital transformation and connectivity. This paper introduces a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based framework, Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouses using VAE (WISVA), designed for accurate indoor radio propagation modeling in automated Industry 4.0 environments such as warehouses and factory floors operating within 5G wireless bands. The research delves into the meticulous creation of training data tensors, capturing complex electromagnetic (EM) wave behaviors influenced by diverse obstacles, and outlines the architecture and training methodology of the proposed VAE model. The model's robustness and adaptability are showcased through its ability to predict signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) heatmaps across various scenarios, including denoising tasks, validation datasets, extrapolation to unseen configurations, and previously unencountered warehouse layouts. Compelling reconstruction error heatmaps are presented, highlighting the superior accuracy of WISVA compared to traditional autoencoder models. The paper also analyzes the model's performance in handling complex smart warehouse environments, demonstrating its potential as a key enabler for optimizing wireless infrastructure in Industry 4.0.</description>

      <title>World Model for AI Autonomous Navigation in Mechanical Thrombectomy</title>

Abstract: Autonomous navigation for mechanical thrombectomy (MT) remains a critical challenge due to the complexity of vascular anatomy and the need for precise, real-time decision-making. Reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches have demonstrated potential in automating endovascular navigation, but current methods often struggle with generalization across multiple patient vasculatures and long-horizon tasks. We propose a world model for autonomous endovascular navigation using TD-MPC2, a model-based RL algorithm. We trained a single RL agent across multiple endovascular navigation tasks in ten real patient vasculatures, comparing performance against the state-of-the-art Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) method. Results indicate that TD-MPC2 significantly outperforms SAC in multi-task learning, achieving a 65% mean success rate compared to SAC's 37%, with notable improvements in path ratio. TD-MPC2 exhibited increased procedure times, suggesting a trade-off between success rate and execution speed. These findings highlight the potential of world models for improving autonomous endovascular navigation and lay the foundation for future research in generalizable AI-driven robotic interventions.</description>
