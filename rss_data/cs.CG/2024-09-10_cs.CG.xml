      <title>COVID19-CBABM: A City-Based Agent Based Disease Spread Modeling Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to the ongoing pandemic and health emergency of COVID-19, several models have been used to understand the dynamics of virus spread. Some employ mathematical models like the compartmental SEIHRD approach and others rely on agent-based modeling (ABM). In this paper, a new city-based agent-based modeling approach called COVID19-CBABM is introduced. It considers not only the transmission mechanism simulated by the SEHIRD compartments but also models people movements and their interactions with their surroundings, particularly their interactions at different types of Points of Interest (POI), such as supermarkets. Through the development of knowledge extraction procedures for Safegraph data, our approach simulates realistic conditions based on spatial patterns and infection conditions considering locations where people spend their time in a given city. Our model was implemented in Python using the Mesa-Geo framework. COVID19-CBABM is portable and can be easily extended by adding more complicated scenarios. Therefore, it is a useful tool to assist the government and health authorities in evaluating strategic decisions and actions efficiently against this epidemic, using the unique mobility patterns of each city.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Accurate Geometry for Morse-Smale Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Morse-Smale complex is a standard tool in visual data analysis. The classic definition is based on a continuous view of the gradient of a scalar function where its zeros are the critical points. These points are connected via gradient curves and surfaces emanating from saddle points, known as separatrices. In a discrete setting, the Morse-Smale complex is commonly extracted by constructing a combinatorial gradient assuming the steepest descent direction. Previous works have shown that this method results in a geometric embedding of the separatrices that can be fundamentally different from those in the continuous case. To achieve a similar embedding, different approaches for constructing a combinatorial gradient were proposed. In this paper, we show that these approaches generate a different topology, i.e., the connectivity between critical points changes. Additionally, we demonstrate that the steepest descent method can compute topologically and geometrically accurate Morse-Smale complexes when applied to certain types of grids. Based on these observations, we suggest a method to attain both geometric and topological accuracy for the Morse-Smale complex of data sampled on a uniform grid.</description>

      <title>HyperSteiner: Computing Heuristic Hyperbolic Steiner Minimal Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose HyperSteiner -- an efficient heuristic algorithm for computing Steiner minimal trees in the hyperbolic space. HyperSteiner extends the Euclidean Smith-Lee-Liebman algorithm, which is grounded in a divide-and-conquer approach involving the Delaunay triangulation. The central idea is rephrasing Steiner tree problems with three terminals as a system of equations in the Klein-Beltrami model. Motivated by the fact that hyperbolic geometry is well-suited for representing hierarchies, we explore applications to hierarchy discovery in data. Results show that HyperSteiner infers more realistic hierarchies than the Minimum Spanning Tree and is more scalable to large datasets than Neighbor Joining.</description>

      <title>3D Data Long-Term Preservation in Cultural Heritage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The report explores the challenges and strategies for preserving 3D digital data in cultural heritage. It discusses the issue of technological obsolescence, emphasising the need for ustainable storage solutions and ongoing data management strategies. Key topics include understanding technological obsolescence, the lifecycle of digital content, digital continuity, data management plans (DMP), FAIR principles, and the use of public repositories. The report also covers the importance of metadata in long-term digital preservation, including types of metadata and strategies for building valuable metadata. It examines the evolving standards and interoperability in 3D format preservation and the importance of managing metadata and paradata. The document provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges and solutions for preserving 3D cultural heritage data in the long term.</description>

      <title>Approximating the Fr\'echet distance when only one curve is $c$-packed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One approach to studying the Fr\'echet distance is to consider curves that satisfy realistic assumptions. By now, the most popular realistic assumption for curves is $c$-packedness. Existing algorithms for computing the Fr\'echet distance between $c$-packed curves require both curves to be $c$-packed. In this paper, we only require one of the two curves to be $c$-packed. Our result is a nearly-linear time algorithm that $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximates the Fr\'echet distance between a $c$-packed curve and a general curve in $\mathbb R^d$, for constant values of $\varepsilon$, $d$ and $c$.</description>

      <title>Upward Pointset Embeddings of Planar st-Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study upward pointset embeddings (UPSEs) of planar $st$-graphs. Let $G$ be a planar $st$-graph and let $S \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ be a pointset with $|S|= |V(G)|$. An UPSE of $G$ on $S$ is an upward planar straight-line drawing of $G$ that maps the vertices of $G$ to the points of $S$. We consider both the problem of testing the existence of an UPSE of $G$ on $S$ (UPSE Testing) and the problem of enumerating all UPSEs of $G$ on $S$. We prove that UPSE Testing is NP-complete even for $st$-graphs that consist of a set of directed $st$-paths sharing only $s$ and $t$. On the other hand, for $n$-vertex planar $st$-graphs whose maximum $st$-cutset has size $k$, we prove that it is possible to solve UPSE Testing in $O(n^{4k})$ time with $O(n^{3k})$ space, and to enumerate all UPSEs of $G$ on $S$ with $O(n)$ worst-case delay, using $O(k n^{4k} \log n)$ space, after $O(k n^{4k} \log n)$ set-up time. Moreover, for an $n$-vertex $st$-graph whose underlying graph is a cycle, we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an UPSE on a given poinset, which can be tested in $O(n \log n)$ time. Related to this result, we give an algorithm that, for a set $S$ of $n$ points, enumerates all the non-crossing monotone Hamiltonian cycles on $S$ with $O(n)$ worst-case delay, using $O(n^2)$ space, after $O(n^2)$ set-up time.</description>
