      <title>Deep Complex-valued Radial Basis Function Neural Networks and Parameter Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ever-evolving field of artificial neural networks and learning systems, complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) have become a cornerstone, achieving exceptional performance in image processing and telecommunications. More precisely, in digital communication systems, CVNNs have been delivering significant results in tasks like equalization, channel estimation, beamforming, and decoding. Among the CVNN architectures, the complex-valued radial basis function neural network (C-RBF) stands out, especially when operating in noisy environments such as 5G multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In such a context, this paper extends the classical shallow C-RBF to deep architectures, increasing its flexibility for a wider range of applications. Also, based on the parameter selection of the phase transmittance radial basis function (PT-RBF) neural network, we propose an initialization scheme for the deep C-RBF. Via rigorous simulations conforming to 3GPP TS 38 standards for digital communications, our method not only outperforms conventional initialization strategies like random, $K$-means, and constellation-based methods but it also seems to be the only approach to achieve successful convergence for deep C-RBF architectures. These findings pave the way to more robust and efficient neural network deployments in complex-valued digital communication systems.</description>

      <title>MPADA: Open source framework for multimodal time series antenna array measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an open-source framework for collecting time series S-parameter measurements across multiple antenna elements, dubbed MPADA: Multi-Port Antenna Data Acquisition. The core of MPADA relies on the standard SCPI protocol to be compatible with a wide range of hardware platforms. Time series measurements are enabled through the use of a high-precision real-time clock (RTC), allowing MPADA to periodically trigger the VNA and simultaneously acquire other sensor data for synchronized cross-modal data fusion. A web-based user interface has been developed to offer flexibility in instrumentation, visualization, and analysis. The interface is accessible from a broad range of devices, including mobile ones. Experiments are performed to validate the reliability and accuracy of the data collected using the proposed framework. First, we show the framework's capacity to collect highly repeatable measurements from a complex measurement protocol using a microwave tomography imaging system. The data collected from a test phantom attain high fidelity where a position-varying clutter is visible through coherent subtraction. Second, we demonstrate timestamp accuracy for collecting time series motion data jointly from an RF kinematic sensor and an angle sensor. We achieved an average of 11.8 ms MSE timestamp accuracy at a mixed sampling rate of 10 to 20 Hz over a total of 16-minute test data. We make the framework openly available to benefit the antenna measurement community, providing researchers and engineers with a versatile tool for research and instrumentation. Additionally, we offer a potential education tool to engage engineering students in the subject, fostering hands-on learning through remote experimentation.</description>

      <title>Coverage Analysis of Multi-Environment Q-Learning Algorithms for Wireless Network Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Q-learning is widely used to optimize wireless networks with unknown system dynamics. Recent advancements include ensemble multi-environment hybrid Q-learning algorithms, which utilize multiple Q-learning algorithms across structurally related but distinct Markovian environments and outperform existing Q-learning algorithms in terms of accuracy and complexity in large-scale wireless networks. We herein conduct a comprehensive coverage analysis to ensure optimal data coverage conditions for these algorithms. Initially, we establish upper bounds on the expectation and variance of different coverage coefficients. Leveraging these bounds, we present an algorithm for efficient initialization of these algorithms. We test our algorithm on two distinct real-world wireless networks. Numerical simulations show that our algorithm can achieve %50 less policy error and %40 less runtime complexity than state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms. Furthermore, our algorithm exhibits robustness to changes in network settings and parameters. We also numerically validate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for XL-IRS Assisted Wireless Systems with Double-sided Visibility Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study efficient channel estimation design for an extremely large-scale intelligent reflecting surface (XL-IRS) assisted multi-user communication systems, where both the base station (BS) and users are located in the near-field region of the XL-IRS. Two unique channel characteristics of XL-IRS are considered, namely, the near-field spherical wavefronts and double-sided visibility regions (VRs) at the BS and users, which render the channel estimation for XL-IRS highly challenging. To address this issue, we propose in this paper an efficient three-step XL-IRS channel estimation method. Specifically, in the first step, an anchor node is delicately deployed near the XL-IRS to estimate the cascaded BS-IRS-anchor channel. Then, an efficient VR detection method is devised to estimate the VR information between the BS and XL-IRS. In this way, only the channels from the visible XL-IRS elements to the BS are estimated, thereby reducing the dimension of the cascaded BS-IRS-users channels to be estimated. Third, by leveraging the common BS-IRS channel, the cascaded channels for all users are consecutively estimated accounting for the VRs of the IRS-user channels. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed channel estimation scheme as compared to various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Particle Flows for Source Localization in 3-D Using TDOA Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization using time-difference of arrival (TDOA) has myriad applications, e.g., in passive surveillance systems and marine mammal research. In this paper, we present a Bayesian estimation method that can localize an unknown number of static sources in 3-D based on TDOA measurements. The proposed localization algorithm based on particle flow (PFL) can overcome the challenges related to the highly nonlinear TDOA measurement model, the data association (DA) uncertainty, and the uncertainty in the number of sources to be localized. Different PFL strategies are compared within a unified belief propagation (BP) framework in a challenging multisensor source localization problem. In particular, we consider PFL-based approximation of beliefs based on one or multiple Gaussian kernels with parameters computed using deterministic and stochastic flow processes. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method can correctly determine the number of sources and provide accurate location estimates. The stochastic flow demonstrates greater accuracy compared to the deterministic flow when using the same number of particles.</description>

      <title>A Homogeneous Graph Neural Network for Precoding and Power Allocation in Scalable Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning is widely used in wireless communications but struggles with fixed neural network sizes, which limit their adaptability in environments where the number of users and antennas varies. To overcome this, this paper introduced a generalization strategy for precoding and power allocation in scalable wireless networks. Initially, we employ an innovative approach to abstract the wireless network into a homogeneous graph. This primarily focuses on bypassing the heterogeneous features between transmitter (TX) and user entities to construct a virtual homogeneous graph serving optimization objectives, thereby enabling all nodes in the virtual graph to share the same neural network. This "TX entity" is known as a base station (BS) in cellular networks and an access point (AP) in cell-free networks. Subsequently, we design a universal graph neural network, termed the information carrying graph neural network (ICGNN), to capture and integrate information from this graph, maintaining permutation invariance. Lastly, using ICGNN as the core algorithm, we tailor the neural network's input and output for specific problem requirements and validate its performance in two scenarios: 1) in cellular networks, we develop a matrix-inverse-free multi-user multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) precoding scheme using the conjugate gradient (CG) method, adaptable to varying user and antenna numbers; 2) in a cell-free network, facing dynamic variations in the number of users served by APs, the number of APs serving each user, and the number of antennas per AP, we propose a universal power allocation scheme. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach not only significantly reduces computational complexity but also achieves, and potentially exceeds, the spectral efficiency (SE) of conventional algorithms.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Cardiac and Non-cardiac Diagnosis from Electrocardiogram Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Ensuring timely and accurate diagnosis of medical conditions is paramount for effective patient care. Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals are fundamental for evaluating a patient's cardiac health and are readily available. Despite this, little attention has been given to the remarkable potential of ECG data in detecting non-cardiac conditions.
  Methods: In our study, we used publicly available datasets (MIMIC-IV-ECG-ICD and ECG-VIEW II) to investigate the feasibility of inferring general diagnostic conditions from ECG features. To this end, we trained a tree-based model (XGBoost) based on ECG features and basic demographic features to estimate a wide range of diagnoses, encompassing both cardiac and non-cardiac conditions.
  Results: Our results demonstrate the reliability of estimating 23 cardiac as well as 21 non-cardiac conditions above 0.7 AUROC in a statistically significant manner across a wide range of physiological categories. Our findings underscore the predictive potential of ECG data in identifying well-known cardiac conditions. However, even more striking, this research represents a pioneering effort in systematically expanding the scope of ECG-based diagnosis to conditions not traditionally associated with the cardiac system.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Pair-wise Symbol Detection in Uplink NOMA-ISaC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the bit error rate (BER) and outage probability performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISaC) in uplink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) based Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Specifically, we consider an ISaC system where the radar signal is designed to be orthogonal to the communication signal over two symbol periods so that its interference on the communication signal is completely eliminated when detecting the data in pairs of consecutive symbols. This is akin to multi-symbol rate NOMA systems except in this case as the radar bears no data, its waveform is manipulated to be orthogonal to the transmitted communication signal. To eliminate potential decision ambiguity during the pair-wise data detection, a constant phase-offset between adjacent communication symbols is applied at the transmitter. The performance of such a system is analyzed through deriving analytical expressions for the exact BER of zero-forcing (ZF) based receivers. In addition, close-form expressions for the upper BER bound and the outage probability for both ZF and the joint maximum likelihood (JML) receivers are presented. The results show that the derived expressions are perfectly matched with the simulation results. The obtained expressions provide an insight into the performance of this novel ISaC system including demonstrating the impact of various parameters and showing how the ZF receiver provides a useful trade-off between performance and complexity relative to the JML receiver.</description>

      <title>Optimal UCA Design for OAM Based Wireless Backhaul Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM), which is considered as a novel way to achieve high capacity, has been attracted much attention recently. OAM signals emitted by uniform circular array (UCA) are widely regarded to go through the Bessel-form channels. However, the channel gains corresponding to the Bessel-form channels are with low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) on OAM-modes and it is difficult to achieve high capacity using all OAM modes. To achieve maximum capacity offered by OAM multiplexing for wireless backhaul communications, in this paper we propose the optimal UCA design, which selects the optimal OAM-modes and radius of receive UCA. We formulate the capacity maximization problem and divide it into two subproblems for obtaining the corresponding optimal UCA design for OAM multiplexing based wireless backhaul communications. In particular, the optimal radius of the receive UCA is firstly derived. Then, we propose an mode selection scheme to choose appropriate OAM-modes for data transmission to maximize the capacity. Extensive simulations obtained validate that the capacity of OAM multiplexing can be significantly increased with our developed scheme.</description>

      <title>Jammer Mitigation in Absorptive RIS-Assisted Uplink NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising technology for next-generation wireless communication systems due to its enhanced spectral efficiency. In this paper, we consider an uplink NOMA system operating together with a high-dimensional absorptive reconfigurable intelligent surface (A-RIS). We aim to minimize the total power transmitted by the users in order to meet signal-to-interference-plus-noise constraints at the base station in the presence of a jammer. We propose an iterative algorithm to solve the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem using linear programming to find the transmit powers and a fractional programming algorithm based on the Dinkelbach algorithm with a sequential convex relaxation procedure to optimize the reflection coefficients. We show that our algorithm converges on large optimization problems, with a jammer comprising as many as $64$ antennas, and an A-RIS with $128$ elements. Our numerical results show that, compared with a standard RIS that reflects all impinging energy, the A-RIS can dramatically reduce the users' required transmit power and successfully mitigate interference from the jammer. The absorption capability of the A-RIS is in particular useful in cases when the number of jammer antennas is of the same order as the number of A-RIS elements.</description>

      <title>RIS-Aided Backscattering Tag-to-Tag Networks: Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backscattering tag-to-tag networks (BTTNs) represent a passive radio frequency identification (RFID) system that enables direct communication between tags within an external radio frequency (RF) field. However, low spectral efficiency and short-range communication capabilities, along with the ultra-low power nature of the tags, create significant challenges for reliable and practical applications of BTTNs. To address these challenges, this paper introduces integrating an indoor reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into BTTN and studying RIS's impact on the system's performance. To that end, we first derive compact analytical expressions of the probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver tag by exploiting the moment matching technique. Then, based on the derived PDF and CDF, we further derive analytical expressions of outage probability (OP), bit error rate (BER), and average capacity (AC) rate. Eventually, the Monte Carlo simulation is used to validate the accuracy of the analytical results, revealing that utilizing RIS can greatly improve the performance of BTTNs in terms of AC, BER, OP, and coverage region relative to traditional BTTNs setups that do not incorporate RIS.</description>

      <title>A Spintronic Nano-Antenna Activated by Spin Injection from a Three-Dimensional Topological Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A charge current flowing through a three-dimensional topological insulator (3D-TI) can inject a spin current into a ferromagnet placed on the surface of the 3D-TI. Here, we report leveraging this mechanism to implement a nano-antenna that radiates an electromagnetic wave (1-10 GHz) into the surrounding medium efficiently despite being orders of magnitude smaller than the radiated free space wavelength. An alternating charge current of 1-10 GHz frequency is injected into a thin film of the 3D-TI Bi2Se3, resulting in the injection of an alternating spin current (of the same frequency) into a periodic array of cobalt nanomagnets deposited on the surface of the 3D-TI. This causes the magnetizations of the nanomagnets to oscillate in time and radiate electromagnetic waves in space, thereby implementing a nano-antenna. Because it is so much smaller than the free space wavelength, the nano-antenna is effectively a "point source" and yet it radiates anisotropically because of internal anisotropy. One can change the anisotropic radiation pattern by changing the direction of the injected alternating charge current, which implements beam steering. This would normally not have been possible in a conventional extreme sub-wavelength antenna.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of automation in robotics necessitates the use of high-quality perception systems, often through the use of multiple sensors. A crucial aspect of a successfully deployed multi-sensor systems is the calibration with a known object typically named fiducial. In this work, we propose a novel fiducial system for millimeter wave radars, termed as \name. \name addresses the limitations of traditional corner reflector-based calibration methods in extremely cluttered environments. \name leverages millimeter wave backscatter technology to achieve more reliable calibration than corner reflectors, enhancing the overall performance of multi-sensor perception systems. We compare the performance in several real-world environments and show the improvement achieved by using \name as the radar fiducial over a corner reflector.</description>

      <title>Characterization of point-source transient events with a rolling-shutter compressed sensing system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point-source transient events (PSTEs) - optical events that are both extremely fast and extremely small - pose several challenges to an imaging system. Due to their speed, accurately characterizing such events often requires detectors with very high frame rates. Due to their size, accurately detecting such events requires maintaining coverage over an extended field-of-view, often through the use of imaging focal plane arrays (FPA) with a global shutter readout. Traditional imaging systems that meet these requirements are costly in terms of price, size, weight, power consumption, and data bandwidth, and there is a need for cheaper solutions with adequate temporal and spatial coverage. To address these issues, we develop a novel compressed sensing algorithm adapted to the rolling shutter readout of an imaging system. This approach enables reconstruction of a PSTE signature at the sampling rate of the rolling shutter, offering a 1-2 order of magnitude temporal speedup and a proportional reduction in data bandwidth. We present empirical results demonstrating accurate recovery of PSTEs using measurements that are spatially undersampled by a factor of 25, and our simulations show that, relative to other compressed sensing algorithms, our algorithm is both faster and yields higher quality reconstructions. We also present theoretical results characterizing our algorithm and corroborating simulations. The potential impact of our work includes the development of much faster, cheaper sensor solutions for PSTE detection and characterization.</description>

      <title>Point Neuron Learning: A New Physics-Informed Neural Network Architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning and neural networks have advanced numerous research domains, but challenges such as large training data requirements and inconsistent model performance hinder their application in certain scientific problems. To overcome these challenges, researchers have investigated integrating physics principles into machine learning models, mainly through: (i) physics-guided loss functions, generally termed as physics-informed neural networks, and (ii) physics-guided architectural design. While both approaches have demonstrated success across multiple scientific disciplines, they have limitations including being trapped to a local minimum, poor interpretability, and restricted generalizability. This paper proposes a new physics-informed neural network (PINN) architecture that combines the strengths of both approaches by embedding the fundamental solution of the wave equation into the network architecture, enabling the learned model to strictly satisfy the wave equation. The proposed point neuron learning method can model an arbitrary sound field based on microphone observations without any dataset. Compared to other PINN methods, our approach directly processes complex numbers and offers better interpretability and generalizability. We evaluate the versatility of the proposed architecture by a sound field reconstruction problem in a reverberant environment. Results indicate that the point neuron method outperforms two competing methods and can efficiently handle noisy environments with sparse microphone observations.</description>

      <title>Study And Implementation of Unitary Gates in Quantum Computation Using Schrodinger Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis explores the concept of realizing quantum gates using physical systems like atoms and oscillators perturbed by electric and magnetic fields. The basic idea is that if a time-independent Hamiltonian $H_0$ is perturbed by a time-varying Hamiltonian of the form $f(t)V$, where $f(t)$ is a scalar function of time and $V$ is a Hermitian operator that does not commute with $H_0$, then a large class of unitary operators can be realized via the Schrodinger evolution corresponding to the time-varying Hamiltonian $H_0+f(t)V$. This is a consequence of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula in Lie groups and Lie algebras.
  The thesis addresses two problems based on this idea: first, taking a Harmonic oscillator and perturbing it with a time-independent anharmonic term, and then computing $U_g=e^{-\iota T H_1}$. Then, perturbing the harmonic Hamiltonian with a linear time-dependent term, and calculating the unitary evolution corresponding to $H(t)$ at time $T$. This gate can be expressed as $U(T)=U(T,\epsilon,f)=T\{e^{-\iota\int_0^TH(t)dt}\}$.
  The anharmonic gate $U_g$ is replaced by a host of commonly used gates in quantum computation, such as controlled unitary gates and quantum Fourier transform gates. The control electric field is selected appropriately.
  The thesis also addresses the controllability issue, determining under what conditions there exists a scalar real valued function of time $f(t), 0\leq t\leq T$ such that if $|\psi_\iota\rangle$ is any initial wave function and $|\psi_f\rangle$ is any final wave function, then $U(T,f)|\psi_i\rangle=|\psi_f\rangle$. A partial solution was obtained by replacing the unitary evolution kernel by its Dyson series truncated version.
  In all design procedures, the gates that appear are infinite-dimensional, with an interaction between the atom and the electromagnetic field modulated by a controllable function of time.</description>

      <title>Secure Integrated Sensing and Communication Under Correlated Rayleigh Fading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenario, in which a signal is transmitted through a state-dependent wiretap channel with one legitimate receiver with which the transmitter communicates and one honest-but-curious target that the transmitter wants to sense. The secure ISAC channel is modeled as two state-dependent fast-fading channels with correlated Rayleigh fading coefficients and independent additive Gaussian noise components. Delayed channel outputs are fed back to the transmitter to improve the communication performance and to estimate the channel state sequence. We establish and illustrate an achievable secrecy-distortion region for degraded secure ISAC channels under correlated Rayleigh fading. We also evaluate the inner bound for a large set of parameters to derive practical design insights for secure ISAC methods. The presented results include in particular parameter ranges for which the secrecy capacity of a classical wiretap channel setup is surpassed and for which the channel capacity is approached.</description>

      <title>A New Method for the Identification of a Wiener-Hammerstein Model in a Communication Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new algorithm to identify a Wiener-Hammerstein system. This model represents a communication channel where two linear filters are separated by a non-linear function modelling an amplifier. The algorithm enables to recover each parameter of the model, namely the two linear filters and the non-linear function. This is to be opposed with estimation algorithms which identify the equivalent Volterra system. The algorithm is composed of three main steps and uses three distinct pilot sequences. The estimation of the parameters is done in the time domain via several instances of the least-square algorithm. However, arguments based on the spectral representation of the signals and filters are used to design the pilot sequences. We also provide an analysis of the proposed algorithm. We estimate, via the theory and simulations, the minimum required size of the pilot sequences to achieve a target mean squared error between the output of the true channel and the output of the estimated model. We obtain that the new method requires reduced-size pilot sequences: The sum of the length of the pilot sequences is approximately the one needed to estimate the convolutional product of the two linear filters with a back-off. A comparison with the Volterra approach is also provided.</description>

      <title>The Transferability of Downsampling Sparse Graph Convolutional Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17274v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a large-scale sparse graph downsampling method based on a sparse random graph model, which allows for the adjustment of different sparsity levels. We combine sparsity and topological similarity: the sparse graph model reduces the node connection probability as the graph size increases, while the downsampling method preserves a specific topological connection pattern during this change. Based on the downsampling method, we derive a theoretical transferability bound about downsampling sparse graph convolutional networks (GCNs), that higher sampling rates, greater average degree expectations, and smaller initial graph sizes lead to better downsampling transferability performance.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Learning for Task-Oriented Semantic Communications Over MIMO Channels: An Information-Theoretic Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of end-to-end (E2E) design of learning and communication in a task-oriented semantic communication system. In particular, we consider a multi-device cooperative edge inference system over a wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) multiple access channel, where multiple devices transmit extracted features to a server to perform a classification task. We formulate the E2E design of feature encoding, MIMO precoding, and classification as a conditional mutual information maximization problem. However, it is notoriously difficult to design and train an E2E network that can be adaptive to both the task dataset and different channel realizations. Regarding network training, we propose a decoupled pretraining framework that separately trains the feature encoder and the MIMO precoder, with a maximum a posteriori (MAP) classifier employed at the server to generate the inference result. The feature encoder is pretrained exclusively using the task dataset, while the MIMO precoder is pretrained solely based on the channel and noise distributions. Nevertheless, we manage to align the pretraining objectives of each individual component with the E2E learning objective, so as to approach the performance bound of E2E learning. By leveraging the decoupled pretraining results for initialization, the E2E learning can be conducted with minimal training overhead. Regarding network architecture design, we develop two deep unfolded precoding networks that effectively incorporate the domain knowledge of the solution to the decoupled precoding problem. Simulation results on both the CIFAR-10 and ModelNet10 datasets verify that the proposed method achieves significantly higher classification accuracy compared to various baselines.</description>

      <title>EEGMatch: Learning with Incomplete Labels for Semi-Supervised EEG-based Cross-Subject Emotion Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is an objective tool for emotion recognition and shows promising performance. However, the label scarcity problem is a main challenge in this field, which limits the wide application of EEG-based emotion recognition. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning framework (EEGMatch) to leverage both labeled and unlabeled EEG data. First, an EEG-Mixup based data augmentation method is developed to generate more valid samples for model learning. Second, a semi-supervised two-step pairwise learning method is proposed to bridge prototype-wise and instance-wise pairwise learning, where the prototype-wise pairwise learning measures the global relationship between EEG data and the prototypical representation of each emotion class and the instance-wise pairwise learning captures the local intrinsic relationship among EEG data. Third, a semi-supervised multi-domain adaptation is introduced to align the data representation among multiple domains (labeled source domain, unlabeled source domain, and target domain), where the distribution mismatch is alleviated. Extensive experiments are conducted on two benchmark databases (SEED and SEED-IV) under a cross-subject leave-one-subject-out cross-validation evaluation protocol. The results show the proposed EEGmatch performs better than the state-of-the-art methods under different incomplete label conditions (with 6.89% improvement on SEED and 1.44% improvement on SEED-IV), which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed EEGMatch in dealing with the label scarcity problem in emotion recognition using EEG signals.

      <title>Spatial Distribution of Data Capacity for the Reduction of Number of Repeaters in Ultra Long-Haul Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel method to reduce the number of repeaters and amplifiers in trans-oceanic links by distributing a given data capacity in spatial channels. We analytically, numerically and experimentally demonstrate the principle and show that about 40 % of the repeaters can be omitted compared to a recently deployed cable. The method predicts that a single-fiber transmission link with 50 km amplifier spacing would be better off, repeater-wise, if the targeted single-fiber capacity is distributed in two fibers, each with an amplifier spacing of 150 km. In this scenario, one would thus only require 2/3 of the original number of amplifiers, and only 1/3 of the number of repeaters, housing the amplifiers. To test the principle of the proposed method, we experimentally and numerically investigate a 6900-km long link with amplifier spacing of 50 and 150 km using a recirculating fiber transmission loop, and find that the result supports the analytical model and thus the proposed method. We then use this concept to analytically investigate a realistic $12$-fiber pair cable, and find that the same capacity could be distributed in 19 fiber pairs requiring only about 56 % of the original number of repeaters.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Trade-Offs in Monostatic ISAC: A Holistic Investigation Towards 6G</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.18011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper undertakes a holistic investigation of two fundamental trade-offs in monostatic OFDM integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems-namely, the time-frequency trade-off and the spatial trade-off, originating from the choice of modulation order for random data and the design of beamforming strategies, respectively. To counteract the elevated side-lobe levels induced by varying-amplitude data in high-order QAM signaling, we propose a novel linear minimum mean-squared-error (LMMSE) estimator, capable of maintaining robust sensing performance across a wide range of SNRs. Moreover, we explore spatial domain trade-offs through two ISAC transmission strategies: concurrent, employing joint beams, and time-sharing, using separate, time-non-overlapping beams for sensing and communications. Simulations demonstrate superior performance of the LMMSE estimator, especially in detecting weak targets in the presence of strong ones with high-order QAM, consistently yielding more favorable ISAC trade-offs than existing baselines under various modulation schemes, SNR conditions, RCS levels and transmission strategies. We also provide experimental results to validate the effectiveness of the LMMSE estimator in reducing side-lobe levels, based on real-world measurements.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Networks in EEG-based Emotion Recognition: A Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared to other modalities, EEG-based emotion recognition can intuitively respond to the emotional patterns in the human brain and, therefore, has become one of the most concerning tasks in the brain-computer interfaces field. Since dependencies within brain regions are closely related to emotion, a significant trend is to develop Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for EEG-based emotion recognition. However, brain region dependencies in emotional EEG have physiological bases that distinguish GNNs in this field from those in other time series fields. Besides, there is neither a comprehensive review nor guidance for constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In the survey, our categorization reveals the commonalities and differences of existing approaches under a unified framework of graph construction. We analyze and categorize methods from three stages in the framework to provide clear guidance on constructing GNNs in EEG-based emotion recognition. In addition, we discuss several open challenges and future directions, such as Temporal full-connected graph and Graph condensation.</description>

      <title>Optimum Beamforming and Grating Lobe Mitigation for Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring adequate wireless coverage in upcoming communication technologies such as 6G is expected to be challenging. This is because user demands of higher datarate require an increase in carrier frequencies, which in turn reduce the diffraction effects (and hence coverage) in complex multipath environments. Intelligent reflecting surfaces have been proposed as a way of restoring coverage by adaptively reflecting incoming electromagnetic waves in desired directions. This is accomplished by judiciously adding extra phases at different points on the surface. In practice, these extra phases are only available in discrete quantities due to hardware constraints. Computing these extra phases is computationally challenging when they can only be picked from a discrete distribution, and existing approaches for solving this problem were either heuristic or based on evolutionary algorithms. We solve this problem by proposing fast algorithms with provably optimal solutions. Our algorithms have linear complexity, and are presented with rigorous proofs for their optimality. We show that the proposed algorithms exhibit better performance. We analyze situations when unwanted grating lobes arise in the radiation pattern, and discuss mitigation strategies, such as the use of triangular lattices and prephasing techniques, to eliminate them. We also demonstrate how our algorithms can leverage these techniques to deliver optimum beamforming solutions.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection in Time Series of EDFA Pump Currents to Monitor Degeneration Processes using Fuzzy Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a novel fuzzy clustering based anomaly detection method for pump current time series of EDFA systems. The proposed change detection framework (CDF) strategically combines the advantages of entropy analysis (EA) and principle component analysis (PCA) with fuzzy clustering procedures. In the framework, EA is applied for dynamic selection of features for reduction of the feature space and increase of computational performance. Furthermore, PCA is utilized to extract features from the raw feature space to enable generalization capability of the subsequent fuzzy clustering procedures. Three different fuzzy clustering methods, more precisely the fuzzy clustering algorithm, a probabilistic clustering algorithm and a possibilistic clustering algorithm are evaluated for performance and generalization. Hence, the proposed framework has the innovative feature to detect changes in pump current time series at an early stage for arbitrary points of operation, compared to state-of-the-art predefined alarms in commercially used EDFAs. Moreover, the approach is implemented and tested using experimental data. In addition, the proposed framework enables further approaches of applying decentralized predictive maintenance for optical fiber networks.</description>

      <title>FAST functional connectivity implicates P300 connectivity in working memory deficits in Alzheimer's disease</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measuring transient functional connectivity is an important challenge in Electroencephalogram (EEG) research. Here, the rich potential for insightful, discriminative information of brain activity offered by high temporal resolution is confounded by the inherent noise of the medium and the spurious nature of correlations computed over short temporal windows. We propose a novel methodology to overcome these problems called Filter Average Short-Term (FAST) functional connectivity. First, long-term, stable, functional connectivity is averaged across an entire study cohort for a given pair of Visual Short Term Memory (VSTM) tasks. The resulting average connectivity matrix, containing information on the strongest general connections for the tasks, is used as a filter to analyse the transient high temporal resolution functional connectivity of individual subjects. In simulations, we show that this method accurately discriminates differences in noisy Event-Related Potentials (ERPs) between two conditions where standard connectivity and other comparable methods fail. We then apply this to analyse activity related to visual short-term memory binding deficits in two cohorts of familial and sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Reproducible significant differences were found in the binding task with no significant difference in the shape task in the P300 ERP range. This allows new sensitive measurements of transient functional connectivity, which can be implemented to obtain results of clinical significance.</description>

      <title>BiomedBench: A benchmark suite of TinyML biomedical applications for low-power wearables</title>

Abstract: The design of low-power wearables for the biomedical domain has received a lot of attention in recent decades, as technological advances in chip manufacturing have allowed real-time monitoring of patients using low-complexity ML within the mW range. Despite advances in application and hardware design research, the domain lacks a systematic approach to hardware evaluation. In this work, we propose BiomedBench, a new benchmark suite composed of complete end-to-end TinyML biomedical applications for real-time monitoring of patients using wearable devices. Each application presents different requirements during typical signal acquisition and processing phases, including varying computational workloads and relations between active and idle times. Furthermore, our evaluation of five state-of-the-art low-power platforms in terms of energy efficiency shows that modern platforms cannot effectively target all types of biomedical applications. BiomedBench is released as an open-source suite to standardize hardware evaluation and guide hardware and application design in the TinyML wearable domain.</description>

      <title>CaFNet: A Confidence-Driven Framework for Radar Camera Depth Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00697</link>

Abstract: Depth estimation is critical in autonomous driving for interpreting 3D scenes accurately. Recently, radar-camera depth estimation has become of sufficient interest due to the robustness and low-cost properties of radar. Thus, this paper introduces a two-stage, end-to-end trainable Confidence-aware Fusion Net (CaFNet) for dense depth estimation, combining RGB imagery with sparse and noisy radar point cloud data. The first stage addresses radar-specific challenges, such as ambiguous elevation and noisy measurements, by predicting a radar confidence map and a preliminary coarse depth map. A novel approach is presented for generating the ground truth for the confidence map, which involves associating each radar point with its corresponding object to identify potential projection surfaces. These maps, together with the initial radar input, are processed by a second encoder. For the final depth estimation, we innovate a confidence-aware gated fusion mechanism to integrate radar and image features effectively, thereby enhancing the reliability of the depth map by filtering out radar noise. Our methodology, evaluated on the nuScenes dataset, demonstrates superior performance, improving upon the current leading model by 3.2% in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and 2.7% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
