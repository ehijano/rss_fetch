      <title>Hitting and Covering Affine Families of Convex Polyhedra, with Applications to Robust Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometric hitting set problems, in which we seek a smallest set of points that collectively hit a given set of ranges, are ubiquitous in computational geometry. Most often, the set is discrete and is given explicitly. We propose new variants of these problems, dealing with continuous families of convex polyhedra, and show that they capture decision versions of the two-level finite adaptability problem in robust optimization. We show that these problems can be solved in strongly polynomial time when the size of the hitting/covering set and the dimension of the polyhedra and the parameter space are constant. We also show that the hitting set problem can be solved in strongly quadratic time for one-parameter families of convex polyhedra in constant dimension. This leads to new tractability results for finite adaptability that are the first ones with so-called left-hand-side uncertainty, where the underlying problem is non-linear.</description>

      <title>Drainability and Fillability of Polyominoes in Diverse Models of Global Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tilt models offer intuitive and clean definitions of complex systems in which particles are influenced by global control commands. Despite a wide range of applications, there has been almost no theoretical investigation into the associated issues of filling and draining geometric environments. This is partly because a globally controlled system (i.e., passive matter) exhibits highly complex behavior that cannot be locally restricted. Thus, there is a strong need for theoretical studies that investigate these models both (1) in terms of relative power to each other, and (2) from a complexity theory perspective. In this work, we provide (1) general tools for comparing and contrasting different models of global control, and (2) both complexity and algorithmic results on filling and draining.</description>

      <title>Hardness of Median and Center in the Ulam Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical rank aggregation problem seeks to combine a set X of n permutations into a single representative "consensus" permutation. In this paper, we investigate two fundamental rank aggregation tasks under the well-studied Ulam metric: computing a median permutation (which minimizes the sum of Ulam distances to X) and computing a center permutation (which minimizes the maximum Ulam distance to X) in two settings.
  $\bullet$ Continuous Setting: In the continuous setting, the median/center is allowed to be any permutation. It is known that computing a center in the Ulam metric is NP-hard and we add to this by showing that computing a median is NP-hard as well via a simple reduction from the Max-Cut problem. While this result may not be unexpected, it had remained elusive until now and confirms a speculation by Chakraborty, Das, and Krauthgamer [SODA '21].
  $\bullet$ Discrete Setting: In the discrete setting, the median/center must be a permutation from the input set. We fully resolve the fine-grained complexity of the discrete median and discrete center problems under the Ulam metric, proving that the naive $\widetilde{O}(n^2 L)$-time algorithm (where L is the length of the permutation) is conditionally optimal. This resolves an open problem raised by Abboud, Bateni, Cohen-Addad, Karthik C. S., and Seddighin [APPROX '23]. Our reductions are inspired by the known fine-grained lower bounds for similarity measures, but we face and overcome several new highly technical challenges.</description>
