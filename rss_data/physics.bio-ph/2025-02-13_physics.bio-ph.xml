      <title>Stochastic Kinetics of Transcription: Analysis and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic gene expression is a fundamental yet complicated problem in biophysics, aiming to quantitatively describe the central dogma. Lack of thorough analysis and computationally efficient approach for fine-grained transcription models has confined relevant research to canonical Telegraph model. We study a general model of transcription and exactly solve the time-dependent chemical master equation. An approach highlighting computational efficiency is presented and analyzed for stationary distribution of mRNA molecules. Our result features generality, outstanding computational performance and explicit error estimation, unifying existing theoretical results on transcription kinetics and exhibiting applicability in practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Rapid prediction of organisation in engineered corneal, glial and fibroblast tissues using machine learning and biophysical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a machine learning approach for predicting the organisation of corneal, glial and fibroblast cells in 3D cultures used for tissue engineering. Our machine-learning-based method uses a powerful generative adversarial network architecture called pix2pix, which we train using results from biophysical contractile network dipole orientation (CONDOR) simulations. In the following, we refer to the machine learning method as the RAPTOR (RApid Prediction of Tissue ORganisation) approach. A training data set containing a range of CONDOR simulations is created, covering a range of underlying model parameters. Validation of the trained neural network is carried out by comparing predictions with cultured glial, corneal, and fibroblast tissues, with good agreements for both CONDOR and RAPTOR approaches. An approach is developed to determine CONDOR model parameters for specific tissues using a fit to tissue properties. RAPTOR outputs a variety of tissue properties, including cell densities of cell alignments and tension. Since it is fast, it could be valuable for the design of tethered moulds for tissue growth.</description>

      <title>Impact of Electric Spatially Discordant Alternans on Cardiac Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially discordant alternans (SDA) play a crucial role in cardiac arrhythmogenesis by creating steep repolarization gradients facilitating conduction block and reentry. While traditionally studied using electrical indicators, this work provides a novel perspective by characterizing SDA through their magnetic field signatures. Using a one-dimensional cardiac fiber model, we demonstrate that magnetic field measurements effectively detect SDA and temperature dependent changes in cardiac action potentials, offering a non-invasive alternative to conventional electrophysiological metrics. Our results reveal that the spatial organization of SDA is mirrored in the magnetic field distribution, with SDA nodes clearly identifiable via spatial mapping. Notably, magnetic restitution curves exhibit a distinct pattern from APD-based indicators, closely following the dynamics of the action potential upstroke. These findings establish the cardiac magnetic field as a powerful diagnostic tool for detecting SDA, opening new avenues for biomagnetic monitoring of arrhythmic risk.</description>

      <title>Rhythmic sharing: A bio-inspired paradigm for zero-shot adaptation and learning in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08644v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brain can rapidly adapt to new contexts and learn from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence algorithms have struggled to mimic. Inspired by oscillatory rhythms of the mechanical structures of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm that is based on oscillations in link strengths and associates learning with the coordination of these oscillations. We find that this paradigm yields rapid adaptation and learning in artificial neural networks. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, endowing the network with the ability to sense subtle context changes in an unsupervised manner. In other words, the network generates the missing contextual tokens required to perform as a generalist AI architecture capable of predicting dynamics in multiple contexts. Oscillations also allow the network to extrapolate dynamics to never-seen-before contexts. These capabilities make our learning paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of learning and cognition. Furthermore, learning through link coordination is agnostic to the specifics of the neural network architecture, hence our study opens the door for introducing rapid adaptation and learning capabilities into leading AI models.</description>

      <title>Intercellular Friction and Motility Drive Orientational Order in Cell Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal patterns in multicellular systems are important to understanding tissue dynamics, for instance, during embryonic development and disease. Here, we use a multiphase field model to study numerically the behavior of a near-confluent monolayer of deformable cells with intercellular friction. Varying friction and cell motility drives a solid-liquid transition, and near the transition boundary, we find the emergence of local nematic order of cell deformation driven by shear-aligning cellular flows. Intercellular friction contributes to the monolayer's viscosity, which significantly increases the spatial correlation in the flow and, concomitantly, the extent of nematic order. We also show that local hexatic and nematic order are tightly coupled and propose a mechanical-geometric model for the colocalization of +1/2 nematic defects and 5-7 disclination pairs, which are the structural defects in the hexatic phase. Such topological defects coincide with regions of high cell-cell overlap, suggesting that they may mediate cellular extrusion from the monolayer, as found experimentally. Our results delineate a mechanical basis for the recent observation of nematic and hexatic order in multicellular collectives in experiments and simulations and pinpoint a generic pathway to couple topological and physical effects in these systems.</description>

      <title>Attractive and repulsive terms in multi-object dispersion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filamentary objects such as nano-wires, nanotubes and DNA are of current interest in physics, nanoscience, chemistry, biology and medicine. They can interact via exceptionally long-ranged many-object van der Waals (vdW, dispersion) forces, causing them to cluster into multi-object bundles. We analyse their vdW interactions quantitatively, predicting $N$-object vdW energy contributions that alternate in sign with increasing $N$. We also provide novel insights permitting these tendencies to be understood simply in terms of electronic screening and anti-screening. Relevant systems include polyelectrolyte double layers, Nafion exclusion zone, endothelial surface layer of cells, microemulsion interfaces and hexagonal phases, salt fingers in Gibbs Marangoni effects, myosin fibres in muscle, multiple nanotubes in the interior of neuronal axons, and carbon fibre materials.</description>
