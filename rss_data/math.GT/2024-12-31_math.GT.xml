      <title>Rep-Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $n$-dimensional rep-tile is a compact, connected submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with non-empty interior, which can be decomposed into pairwise isometric rescaled copies of itself whose interiors are disjoint. Given any finite bouquet of spheres $X$, we construct a rep-tile homotopy equivalent to $X$. We also show that every smooth compact $n$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with connected boundary is topologically isotopic to a rep-tile. Consequently, there is a rep-tile in the homotopy type of any finite CW complex.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of knot groups and knot symmetric quandles of surface-links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Artin-Alexander theorem characterizes the knot groups of classical links, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for a group to be the knot group of some classical link. This result was shown using the closed braid method. Gonzalez-Acuna and Kamada independently extended this characterization to the knot groups of orientable surface-links. Kamada applied the closed 2-dimensional braid method to show this result. In this paper, we generalize these results to characterize the knot groups of surface-links, including non-orientable ones. Our approach relies on a plat form presentation for surface-links. Furthermore, we show a similar characterization for the knot symmetric quandles of surface-links. As an application, we show that every dihedral quandle with an arbitrarily good involution can be realized as the knot symmetric quandle of a surface-link.</description>

      <title>Alexander-Conway and Bracket Polynomials of Pretzel Links $\boldsymbol{P(1,1,n)}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polynomial invariants constitute a dynamic and essential area of study in the mathematical theory of knots. From the pioneer Alexander polynomial, the revolutionary Jones polynomial, to the collectively discovered HOMFLYPT polynomial, just to mention a few, these algebraic expressions have been central to the understanding of knots and links. The introduction of Khovanov homology has sparked significant interest in the categorification of these polynomials, offering deeper insights into their topological and algebraic properties. In this work, we revisit two prominent polynomial invariants, the Alexander-Conway and the Kauffman bracket polynomials, and focus specifically on the polynomials associated with the family of three strand pretzel links $P(1,1,n)$.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic knots with arbitrarily large torsion order in knot Floer homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In knot Floer homology, there are two types of torsion order. One is the minimal power of the action of the variable $U$ to annihilate the $\mathbb{F}_2[U]$-torsion submodule of the minus version of knot Floer homology $\mathrm{HFK}^-(K)$. This is introduced by Juh\'{a}sz, Miller and Zemke, and denoted by $\mathrm{Ord}(K)$. The other, $\mathrm{Ord}'(K)$, introduced by Gong and Marengon, is similarly defined for the $\mathbb{F}_2[U]$-torsion submodule of the unoriented knot Floer homology $\mathrm{HFK}'(K)$.
  For both torsion orders, it is known that arbitrarily large values are realized by torus knots. In this paper, we prove that they can be realized by hyperbolic knots, most of which are twisted torus knots. Two torsion orders are argued in a unified way by using the Upsilon torsion function introduced by Allen and Livingston. We also give the first infinite family of hyperbolic knots which shares a common Upsilon torsion function.</description>

      <title>Property (QT) of relatively hierarchically hyperbolic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the projection complex machinery, Bestvina-Bromberg-Fujiwara, Hagen-Petyt and Han-Nguyen-Yang prove that several classes of nonpositively-curved groups admit equivariant quasi-isometric embeddings into finite products of quasi-trees, i.e. having property (QT). In this paper, we unify and generalize the above results by establishing a sufficient condition for relatively hierarchically hyperbolic groups to have property (QT).
  As applications, we show that a group has property (QT) if it is residually finite and belongs to one of the following classes of groups: admissible groups, hyperbolic--$2$--decomposable groups with no distorted elements, Artin groups of large and hyperbolic type. We also introduce a slightly stronger version of property (QT), called property (QT'), and show the invariance of property (QT') under graph products.</description>

      <title>Topological Gauge Theories with Sixteen Supercharges: Higher $A_\infty$-categorification of Floer Homologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to [arXiv:2410.18575], and a third and final installment of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We will show how, via a 3d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of certain topologically-twisted 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ and 8d $\mathcal{N} = 1$ gauge theories, one can derive novel Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories that 2-categorify the 3d-Haydys-Witten, Haydys-Witten, and holomorphic Donaldson-Thomas Floer homology of two, four, and five-manifolds, respectively. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the aforementioned twisted gauge theories, these Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories can be shown to be equivalent to corresponding Fukaya-Seidel type $A_{\infty}$-categories. Together with previous results from [arXiv:2410.18575] and [arXiv:2311.18302], we will furnish purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Bousseau [3] and Doan-Rezchikov [4].</description>

      <title>Can solvents tie knots? Helical folds of biopolymers in liquid environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Helices are the quintessential geometric motif of microscale self-assembly, from $\alpha$-helices in proteins to double helices in DNA. Assembly of the helical geometry of biopolymers is a foundational step in a hierarchy of structure that eventually leads to biological activity. Simulating self-assembly in a simplified and controlled setting allows us to probe the relevance of the solvent as a component of the system of collaborative processes governing biomaterials. Using a simulation technique based on the morphometric approach to solvation, we performed computer experiments which fold a short open flexible tube, modelling a biopolymer in an aqueous environment, according to the interaction of the tube with the solvent alone. Different fluid environments may favour quite different solute geometry: We find an array of helical geometries that self-assemble depending on the solvent conditions, including overhand knot shapes and symmetric double helices where the strand folds back on itself. Interestingly these shapes-in all their variety-are energetically favoured over the $\alpha$-helix. In differentiating the role of solvation in self-assembly our study helps illuminate the energetic background scenery in which all soluble biomolecules live, indeed our results demonstrate that the solvent is capable of quite fundamental rearrangements even up to tying a simple overhand knot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a correlation number for two strictly positive, locally H\"older continuous, independent potentials with strong entropy gaps at infinity on a topologically mixing countable state Markov shift with BIP. We define in this way a correlation number for pairs of cusped Hitchin representations. Furthermore, we explore the connection between the correlation number and the Manhattan curve, along with several rigidity properties of this correlation number.</description>

      <title>Drinfeld centralizers and Rouquier complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Drinfeld centralizer of a monoidal category $\mathcal{A}$ in a bimodule category $\mathcal{M}$ is the category $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{M})$ of objects in $\mathcal{M}$ for which the left and right actions by objects of $\mathcal{A}$ coincide, naturally. In this paper we study the interplay between Drinfeld centralizers of $\mathcal{A}$ and its homotopy category $\mathcal{K}^b(\mathcal{A})$, culminating with our ``lifting lemma,'' which provides a sufficient condition for an object of $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{K}^b(\mathcal{M}))$ to lift to an object of $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{K}^b(\mathcal{A}), \mathcal{K}^b(\mathcal{M}))$.
  The central application of this lifting lemma is a proof of some folklore facts about conjugation by Rouquier complexes in the Hecke category: the centrality of the full twist, and related properties of half twists and Coxeter braids.
  We also prove stronger, homotopy coherent versions of these statements, stated using the notion of the $A_{\infty}$-Drinfeld centralizer, which we believe is new.</description>

Abstract: These notes are an introduction to knot theory from the perspective of surfaces. The notes cover fundamental concepts such as isotopies, Reidemeister moves, torus knots, and (orientable, connected) surfaces with one boundary component. They also present knot invariants defined through Seifert surfaces and their associated matrices, including the 3-genus, the Alexander polynomial, and the signature. Finally, starting from the notion of concordance and the connected sum operation, a group structure on the set of knots is introduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any smooth one-dimensional link in the real projective three-plane is the fixed-point locus of a smooth symplectic surface in the complex projective three-plane which is invariant under complex conjugation. The degree of the surface can be taken to be either one or two, depending on the homology class of the link. In other words, there are no obstructions to finding a symplectic representative of a flexible link beyond the classical topology.</description>

Abstract: We study knots which behave like prime numbers. We discuss the planetary link raised from a hyperbolic fibered link in $S^3$ with an emphasis on surgeries, point out certain subtleness, and refine the construction. In addition, we point out a version of McMullen's theorem for the cases over cusped orbifolds and deduce that the family of modular knots around any torus knot $K_{a,b}$ in $S^3$ together with the missing knot $K_{a,b}$ obey the Chebotarev law. Furthermore, we attach several remarks in the view of arithmetic topology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.08827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a wide range of homologically-defined representations of surface braid groups and of mapping class groups of surfaces, including the Lawrence-Bigelow representations of the classical braid groups. These representations naturally come in families, defining homological representation functors on categories associated to surface braid groups or all mapping class groups. We prove that many of these homological representation functors are polynomial. This has applications to twisted homological stability and to understanding the structure of the representation theory of the associated families of groups. Our polynomiality results are consequences of more fundamental results establishing relations amongst the coherent representations that we consider via short exact sequences of functors. As well as polynomiality, these short exact sequences also have applications to understanding the kernels of the homological representations under consideration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In earlier work of two of the authors, two 1-loop polynomial invariants of cusped 3-manifolds were constructed using combinatorial data of ideal triangulations, and conjectured to be equal to the $\mathbb{C}^2$ and the $\mathbb{C}^3$-torsion polynomials. Here, we prove this conjecture for layered triangulations of fibered 3-manifolds with toroidal boundary, and we illustrate our theorems with exact computations of the 1-loop and the torsion polynomials. As further evidence for the conjecture, we confirm it for more than 6,600 nonfibered manifolds, and use this data to explore the extent to which the $\mathbb{C}^2$-torsion determines the Thurston norm.</description>

Abstract: We show that given an infinite triangulation $K$ of a surface with punctures (i.e., with no vertices at the punctures) and a set of target cone angles smaller than $\pi$ at the punctures that satisfy a Gauss-Bonnet inequality, there exists a hyperbolic metric that has the prescribed angles and supports a circle packing in the combinatorics of $K$. Moreover, if $K$ is very symmetric, then we can identify the underlying Riemann surface and show that it does not depend on the angles. In particular, this provides examples of a triangulation $K$ and a conformal class $X$ such that there are infinitely many conical hyperbolic structures in the conformal class $X$ with a circle packing in the combinatorics of $K$. This is in sharp contrast with a conjecture of Kojima-Mizushima-Tan in the closed case.</description>

      <title>Patterns of Geodesics, Shearing, and Anosov Representations of the Modular Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X=SL_3(\R)/SO(3)$. Let $\cal DFR$ be the space of discrete faithful representations of the modular group into ${\rm Isom\/}(X)$ which map the order $2$ generator to an isometry with a unique fixed point. I prove many things about the component $\cal B$ of $\cal DFR$ known as the Barbot component: It is homeomorphic to $\R^2 \times [0,\infty)$. The boundary parametrizes the Pappus representations from [{\bf S0\/}]. The interior parametrizes the complete extension of the family of Anosov representations from [{\bf BLV\/}]. The members of $\cal B$ are isometry groups of embedded patterns of geodesics in $X$ which have asymptotic properties like the edges of the Farey triangulation or shears thereof. The Anosov representations are obtained from the Pappus representations by either of two shearing operations in $X$. The shearing structure is encoded by two proper foliations of $\cal B$ into rays.</description>

      <title>Strictification and non-strictification of monoidal categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this survey paper we give account of several approaches to the strictification and non-strictification of monoidal categories, which are constructions that turn a monoidal category into a (non-)strict one monoidally equivalent to the original category, and how they are related to analogous notions in higher categorical structures. We first provide explicit, elementary models for the (non-)strictification and show that these two constructions give the free (non-)strict monoidal category generated by a monoidal category. Moreover, we prove in detail that these two constructions are part of a pair of free-forgetful 2-adjunctions. We later show that these constructions can be recovered from Power's general coherence theorem for 2-monads. Lastly we describe another model for the strictification based on right-module endofunctors and provide a detailed, self-contained proof that this is a particular instance of strictification of bicategories via the bicategorical analogue of the Yoneda embedding.</description>

      <title>Deformation Cohomology for Braided Commutativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02663v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Braided algebras are algebraic structures consisting of an algebra endowed with a Yang-Baxter operator, satisfying some compatibility conditions. Yang-Baxter Hochschild cohomology was introduced by the authors to classify infinitesimal deformations of braided algebras, and determine obstructions to quadratic deformations. Several examples of braided algebras satisfy a weaker version of commutativity, which is called braided commutativity and involves the Yang-Baxter operator of the algebra. We extend the theory of Yang-Baxter Hochschild cohomology to study braided commutative deformations of braided algebras. The resulting cohomology theory classifies infinitesimal deformations of braided algebras that are braided commutative, and provides obstructions for braided commutative quadratic deformations. We consider braided commutativity for Hopf algebras in detail, and obtain some classes of nontrivial examples.</description>

      <title>Bounded cohomology of groups acting on trees with almost prescribed local actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the vanishing of bounded cohomology of the groups acting on trees with almost prescribed local actions $G(F, F')$, where $F&lt;F'$ are finite permutation groups such that $F'$ is 2-transitive. By contrast, when $F'$ is not 2-transitive, we prove that the second bounded cohomology with real coefficients of the groups $G(F, F')$ is infinite dimensional.</description>
