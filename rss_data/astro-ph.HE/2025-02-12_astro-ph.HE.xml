      <title>Emergence of a neutrino flux above 5 PeV and implications for ultrahigh energy cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rare detections of astrophysical neutrinos with energies above 5 PeV by two neutrino telescopes underscore the existence of a flux at these energies. In addition to over a decade of data taken by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, the KM3NeT neutrino telescope has recently highlighted their discovery of a possible $\mathcal{O}(100~\mathrm{PeV})$ neutrino candidate. A connection between the highest-energy astrophysical neutrinos and the highest-energy cosmic rays is expected, and well-established theoretically. Here, we model the global multimessenger dataset by simultaneously fitting the neutrino data and the ultrahigh energy cosmic ray spectrum and composition data from the Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger). We show that the model is able to describe the combined data across these three observatories, and, depending on the true energy of the event detected by KM3NeT, suggests an additional cosmic ray source population not yet robustly detected by Auger. Although a measurement of the neutrino flux in this energy regime is at the sensitivity limit of cubic-kilometer-scale neutrino telescopes, next-generation observatories, such IceCube-Gen2, will have the sensitivity to make a significant detection of this flux.</description>

      <title>Multi-band study of the flaring mode emission in the transitional millisecond pulsar PSR J1023+0038</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the flaring mode of the transitional millisecond pulsar (tMSP) PSR J1023+0038 during its X-ray sub-luminous state, using strictly simultaneous X-ray, UV, optical, and radio observations. The X-ray flares exhibit UV and optical counterparts and coincide with the brightest radio flare observed in the past decade, reaching 1.2 mJy at 6 GHz and lasting ~1 hour. During the flare, the optical polarization drops from ~1.4% to ~0.5%, indicating the emergence of an unpolarized component. We propose that the thickening of the disc, which enlarges the shock region between the pulsar wind and the accretion flow and may drive the X-ray flaring observed in tMSPs, enhances the ionization level of the disc, thereby generating an increased number of free electrons. These electrons could then be channelled by magnetic field lines into the jet. This increased jet mass-loading could drive the associated radio and optical variability. The radio spectral evolution during flares is consistent with synchrotron self-absorption in jet ejecta or internal shocks within the compact jet. We infer radio polarization upper limits (&lt;8.7%, &lt;2.3%, and &lt;8.2%, before, during, and after the radio flare) that further support a compact jet origin but do not rule out discrete ejections. Our findings suggest that tMSPs could serve as essential laboratories for investigating jet-launching mechanisms, mainly because they operate under very low mass accretion rates. This accretion regime has not been explored before in the context of the accretion-ejection coupling.</description>

      <title>Resonances of compressible stars in precessing orbits around a spinning black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous paper, we reported the presence of a new resonance of an incompressible star orbiting a spinning black hole and showed that it can set in before the tidal disruption limit if the star has an inclined spherical orbit around the black hole. Using the affine model developed by Carter and Luminet, we extend our result to the stars with polytropic equations of state. We give further credence to the result previously given. We also derive the formula for the growth rate of the resonant motion, which is useful for checking the results of hydrodynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Neutron star evolution by combining discontinuous Galerkin and finite volume methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here a new hybrid scheme that combines a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with finite volume (FV) and finite difference (FD) methods. The computational mesh is divided into smaller elements that touch but do not overlap. Like a pure DG method, our new hybrid scheme requires information exchange only at the surface of neighboring elements. This avoids the need for ghostzones that are usually many points deep in traditional FV implementations. Furthermore, unlike traditional FV implementations, that require information exchange between each element and its 26 surrounding neighbors on non-cuboid meshes, our new hybrid method exchanges information only between each element and its six nearest neighbors. Through this reduction in communication, we aim to retain the high scalability of DG when using large supercomputers. The goal is to use DG in elements with smooth matter fields and to fall back onto the more robust FV/FD method in elements that contain non-smooth shocks or star surfaces. For this we devise trouble criteria to decide whether an element should be evolved with DG or FV/FD. We use the Nmesh program to implement and test the new scheme. We successfully evolve various single neutron star cases. These include the challenging cases of a neutron star initially in an unstable equilibrium migrating to a stable configuration and a boosted neutron star. These cases are simulated for the first time here in full 3D with general relativistic hydrodynamics using DG methods. We also describe additional numerical methods, such as the limiters and the atmosphere treatment we need for our simulations.</description>

      <title>Candidate intermediate-mass black hole discovered in an extremely young low-metallicity cluster in the tadpole galaxy KUG 1138+327</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore what unusual products a starburst of about 6% solar metallicity and a mean estimated age of ~0.5 Myr can produce in KUG 1138 + 327 at a distance of 24.5 Mpc. Chandra X-ray observations show a dominant point-like source with an average 0.3-10 keV luminosity of 10^{40.3} erg/s and variability by a factor of ~2 over months. This extreme ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) is apparently associated with the young central cluster. A multicolor disk modeling of the X-ray spectrum of the source suggests a standard accretion around a black hole. It also has a morphologically elongated nonthermal radio continuum counterpart on the scale of ~200 pc, probably the longest detected from such a source. The radio, optical, and X-ray findings suggest that it could well be an intermediate-mass black hole undergoing sub-Eddington accretion from a massive star companion. Accounting for the presence of the ULX and the prominent emission lines HeII\lambda4658 and [ArIV]\lambda4711 while lacking Wolf-Rayet spectral features, we estimate the true age of the starburst to be about 2-4 Myr. Only with such a moderate age can the starburst host this extraordinary ULX, probably triggered by a recent influx of extremely low-metallicity gas. This study demonstrates the potential of multiwavelength studies of low-metallicity starbursts to provide insights into what may commonly occur in high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Photons through Gravitational Decoupling of Mass-State Oscillations in Interstellar Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism for photon-dark photon mass state oscillations mediated by gravitational separation during propagation through the interstellar medium. This phenomenon establishes a new avenue for the detection of dark matter. By analyzing gravitational lensing data from quasars, we investigate the sensitivity of this approach to dark photons. Our analysis demonstrates constraints of$\epsilon&lt;10^-2$ in the dark photon mass range of $10^{-14}eV$. Furthermore, we propose potential applications of this mechanism to astrophysical systems with strong gravitational fields, such as neutron stars and black hole accretion disks.</description>

      <title>Scaling relations for the uncertainty in neutron star radius inferred from pulse profile modelling: the effect of spin rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulse profile modelling using X-ray data from NICER permits the inference of mass and radius for rotation-powered millisecond pulsars. This in turn constrains the equation of state of cold dense matter. Previous studies indicate that the uncertainty in the inferred radius should reduce as neutron star spin rate increases. Here we test this using one of the pipelines currently being used for pulse profile modelling with NICER data. We synthesize a set of pulse profiles, assuming different neutron star spin frequencies, spanning the range (25-700) Hz. All of the simulated data sets are generated with the same (single) hot spot configuration, assuming a neutron star mass and radius of $1.6\,M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ and $10$ km. For this restricted set of synthetic data, we find no improvement in the radius credible interval once spin frequency exceeds a certain value (in this specific case $\sim 200$ Hz). If this result were to apply more generally, it would have important implications for the observing strategy for current and future pulse profile modelling missions: targets can be prioritized based on properties other than their spin frequencies, as long as we are in the millisecond range.</description>

      <title>The Interaction of a Supernova Remnant with background interstellar turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova explosions (SNe) are among the most energetic events in the Universe. After the explosion, the material ejected by the Supernova expands throughout the interstellar medium (ISM) forming what is called Supernova Remnant (SNR). Shocks associated with the expanding SNR are sources of galactic cosmic rays, that can reach energy of the PeV order. In these processes, a key role is played by the magnetic field. It is known that the ISM is turbulent with an observed magnetic field of about a few $\mu$G, made by the superposition of a uniform and a fluctuating component. During the SNR expansion, the shock interacts with a turbulent environment, leading to a distortion of the shock front and a compression of the medium. In this work, we use the MagnetoHydroDynamics (MHD) PLUTO code to mimic the evolution of the blast wave associated with the SNR. We make a parametric study varying the level of density and magnetic field fluctuations in the interstellar medium, with the aim of understanding the best parameter values able to reproduce real observations. We introduce a novel analysis technique based on two-dimensional autocorrelation function $C({\ell})$ and the second order structure function $S_2(\ell)$, quantifying the level of anisotropy and the turbulence correlation lengths. By interpolating the autocorrelation function on a polar grid, we extract the power spectra of turbulence at the SNR. Finally, a preliminary comparison with Chandra observations of SN 1006 is also presented.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on Cool Gas Clouds in M82's Starburst-Driven Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star formation feedback can drive large-scale, multi-phase galactic outflows. The dynamical and thermodynamical interaction between the hot and cooler phases is a prime focus of both observational and theoretical work. Here, we analyze H$\alpha$-emitting structures in the extraplanar wind of the nearby starburst M82. We use high-resolution, narrow-band, observations from the Hubble Legacy Archive (Mutchler et al. 2007). Our analysis constrains the morphology, number density, and column density of the structures. We highlight conspicuous arc-like structures that differ significantly from the linear cometary clouds that emerge from galactic wind simulations and discuss their possible origins, such as bow shocks or instabilities driven by cosmic rays. The most prominent structures range in size from $\sim24 -110$ pc. Using the H$\alpha$ brightness and assumptions about the depth of the emitting structures, we estimate number densities of $\sim1-23$ cm$^{-3}$, which are lower than previous constraints from spectroscopic nebular line studies. The derived column densities, $\sim10^{20}-10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, along the path of the outflow are above theoretical thresholds for cool cloud survival in a hot supersonic background, but small enough that the structures could be accelerated by the hot wind momentum. Using diffuse X-ray emission maps from $\textit{Chandra}$, we also find that even on small ($\sim100$ pc) scales, the H$\alpha$ "leads" the X-rays, a behavior long noted in the literature on kiloparsec scales, and one we observe in the brightness profiles of the structures we analyze. This behavior, along with previous observational studies of ionization in the wind, may signal that shock ionization is responsible for the H$\alpha$ emission we observe.</description>

      <title>Collective flavor conversions are interactions of neutrinos with quantized flavor waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective oscillations in dense neutrino gases (flavor waves) are notable for their instabilities that cause fast flavor conversion. We develop a quantum theory of interacting neutrinos and flavor wave quanta, which are analogous to plasmons, but also carry flavor. The emission or absorption of such flavor plasmons $\psi$, or flavomons, changes the neutrino flavor. When an angular crossing occurs, the process $\nu_\mu\to\nu_e+\psi$ is more rapid than its inverse along the direction of the crossing, triggering stimulated $\psi$ emission and fast instability. Calculating the rate via Feynman diagrams matches the fast instability growth rate. Our novel $\nu$ and $\psi$ kinetic equations, corresponding to quasi-linear theory, describe instability evolution without resolving the small scales of the flavomon wavelength, potentially overcoming the main challenge of fast flavor evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Cryoscope -- a new 50 sq. deg field-of-view, 1.2 m aperture, K-dark survey telescope to be located at Dome C, Antarctica. Cryoscope has an innovative optical-thermal design wherein the entire telescope is cryogenically cooled. Cryoscope also explores new detector technology to cost-effectively tile the full focal plane. Leveraging the dark Antarctic sky and minimizing telescope thermal emission, Cryoscope achieves unprecedented deep, wide, fast and red observations, matching and exceeding volumetric survey speeds from the Ultraviolet Explorer, Vera Rubin Observatory, and Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. By providing coverage beyond wavelengths of 2 $\mu$m, we aim to create the most comprehensive dynamic movie of the most obscured reaches of the Universe. Cryoscope will be a dedicated discovery engine for electromagnetic emission from coalescing compact binaries, Earth-like exoplanets orbiting cold stars, and multiple facets of time-domain, stellar and solar system science. In this paper, we describe the scientific drivers and technical innovations for this new discovery engine operating in the K-dark passband, why we choose to deploy it in Antarctica, and the status of a fifth-scale prototype designed as a Pathfinder to retire technological risks prior to full-scale implementation.</description>

      <title>WilloWISPs: A New Dark Growth Channel for Black Holes Suggests a Full-Spectrum Hierarchical MACHO Mass Function for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence of neutron stars with deconfined quark-matter cores suggest a new pathway for the evolution of black holes. New theories about the cores of neutron stars support the idea that quarkonium is likely to grow there as the neutron star ages. Surveys of stellar remnants have shown that there is no major mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Black holes, specifically primordial ones (PBHs), have been suggested as an explanation for dark matter before. However, the way that very large black holes can form in the lifetime of the visible universe has only recently been explained with the solution to The Final Parsec Problem. If neutron stars can become exotic stars or black holes, then they may persist long enough to quiescently provide enough mass in dense matter regions to allow Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBH) and Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH) to form quickly via coalescence. We find that a hierarchical clustering of Massive and Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) with axion-dominated mini-halos can help to explain all of the missing dark matter. The model presented here suggests that this type of MACHO is likely equivalent to black holes above an unknown critical mass, which is less than ~5 $M_{\odot}$, and that they ought to form quark stars below this mass. If quark stars are a metastable transition between neutron stars and black holes, then black holes ought to be equivalent to boson stars with event horizons, after all the residual quark material has formed a Bose-Einstein condensate of mesons.</description>

      <title>Stereograph: Stereoscopic event reconstruction using graph neural networks applied to CTAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The CTAO (Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory) is an international observatory currently under construction. With more than sixty telescopes, it will eventually be the largest and most sensitive ground-based gamma-ray observatory. CTAO studies the high-energy universe by observing gamma rays emitted by violent phenomena (supernovae, black hole environments, etc.). These gamma rays produce an atmospheric shower when entering the atmosphere, which emits faint blue light, observed by CTAO's highly sensitive cameras. The event reconstruction consists of analyzing the images produced by the telescopes to retrieve the physical properties of the incident particle (mainly direction, energy, and type). A standard method for performing this reconstruction consists of combining traditional image parameter calculations with machine learning algorithms, such as random forests, to estimate the particle's energy and class probability for each telescope. A second step, called stereoscopy, combines these monoscopic reconstructions into a global one using weighted averages. In this work, we explore the possibility of using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a suitable solution for combining information from each telescope. The "graph" approach aims to link observations from different telescopes, allowing analysis of the shower from multiple angles and producing a stereoscopic reconstruction of the events. We apply GNNs to CTAO-simulated data from the Northern Hemisphere and show that they are a very promising approach to improving event reconstruction, providing a more performant stereoscopic reconstruction. In particular, we observe better energy and angular resolutions(before event selection) and better separation between gamma photons and protons compared to the Random Forest method.</description>

      <title>Modified theories of gravity at different curvature scales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) remains the cornerstone of gravitational physics, providing remarkable success in describing a wide range of astrophysical and cosmological phenomena. However, several challenges underscore the urgent need to explore modified gravity theories. GR struggles to reconcile with quantum mechanics, fails to provide fundamental explanations for dark matter and dark energy, and faces limitations in describing extreme regimes such as black hole singularities and the very early universe. This review provides an organized perspective on modified gravity theories by classifying them based on the principles of GR they preserve or violate. Specifically, we consider three broad categories: (1) metric theories that uphold local Lorentz invariance (LLI) and gauge invariance, (2) theories that break gauge invariance, LLI, or parity, and (3) beyond-metric theories that violate the Einstein's equivalence principle (EEP). This classification highlights the underlying assumptions of GR that these theories challenge or extend, providing a framework for understanding their motivations and implications. The review also discusses the current and upcoming experimental and observational tests of GR, including those probing its foundational principles, such as LLI, gauge invariance, and EEP. For each class of modified theories, we examine their ability to address critical open questions in cosmology and black hole physics. These include their potential to explain the accelerated expansion of the current universe, the nature of dark matter, and deviations in black hole dynamics from GR predictions. This review aims to provide a structured understanding of modified gravity theories and their observational implications in the multimessenger era by focusing on the principles preserved or violated.

      <title>Gaia~19cwm - a dwarf nova of WZ Sge type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral and photometric studies of the cataclysmic variable Gaia 19cwm (or ZTF19aamkwxk) have been performed. Based on the analysis of long-term variability, it is concluded that the object belongs to WZ Sge type stars. The light curves show eclipses recurring with an orbital period of $86.32048 \pm 0.00005$ min, as well as an out-of-eclipse variability with a period of $\approx 6.45$ min. The latter period is stable for $\sim 4$ years and appears to correspond to the rotation of a magnetic white dwarf, i.e., Gaia 19cwm is an intermediate polar. The Gaia 19cwm spectra show photospheric lines of the white dwarf, and Doppler tomograms demonstrate the presence of an accretion disk and a hot spot. Analysis of the eclipse light curve gives an estimates of the white dwarf mass $M_1 = 0.66\pm0.06$ M$_{\odot}$, the donor mass $M_2 = 0.073 \pm 0.015$ M$_{\odot}$, and the orbital inclination $i=83.8 \pm 1.1^{\circ}$. Modeling of the spectral energy distribution gives the white dwarf temperature of $T_{eff}\approx 13000 $ K. The X-ray luminosity $L_X = (1.6 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{31}$ erg/s allows to assign Gaia 19cwm to a small group of low-luminosity intermediate polars.</description>

      <title>Signatures of modified gravity from the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To date, no observational confirmation of dark matter particles has been found. In this paper, we put forward an alternative approach to inferring evidence for dark matter through modified gravity, without invoking fundamental dark matter particles. Specifically, we explore the possibility of extracting signatures of Kaluza-Klein gravity through the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect. Kaluza-Klein theory has recently been proposed as an alternative to the dark sector, and predicts a tower of particles, including spin-0 and spin-1 gravitons alongside the usual spin-2 gravitons, which can gravitationally couple to matter. We thus analyze a quantum system in free fall around a gravitating body in the presence of a modified Yukawa-like gravitational potential, and determine the gravitational phase induced by the additional degrees of freedom introduced by the Kaluza-Klein model. Our results reveal that, in addition to the usual result from General Relativity, the quantum wave function of the system exhibits an additional effect: a splitting of the energy levels with a new quantum number due to the extra vector gravitational degrees of freedom. The energy splitting difference between general relativity and Kaluza-Klein gravity is found to be of the order of meV for an atomic system and eV for a nuclear system. Similar values also arise in generic modified gravity models and can be feasibly tested in the future. Numerical estimates for the graviton mass are also provided, and potential imprints on gravitational waves are mentioned.</description>

      <title>AsterX: a new open-source GPU-accelerated GRMHD code for dynamical spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present AsterX, a novel open-source, modular, GPU-accelerated, fully general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) code designed for dynamic spacetimes in 3D Cartesian coordinates, and tailored for exascale computing. We utilize block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) through CarpetX, the new driver for the Einstein Toolkit, which is built on AMReX, a software framework for massively parallel applications. AsterX employs the Valencia formulation for GRMHD, coupled with the Z4c formalism for spacetime evolution, while incorporating high resolution shock capturing schemes to accurately handle the hydrodynamics. AsterX has undergone rigorous testing in both static and dynamic spacetime, demonstrating remarkable accuracy and agreement with other codes in literature. Using subcycling in time, we find an overall performance gain of factor 2.5 to 4.5. Benchmarking the code through scaling tests on OLCF's Frontier supercomputer, we demonstrate a weak scaling efficiency of about 67%-77% on 4096 nodes compared to an 8-node performance.</description>

      <title>Probing the Galactic neutrino flux at neutrino energies above 200 TeV with the Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent observations of the Galactic component of the high-energy neutrino flux, together with the detection of the diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission up to sub-PeV energies, open new possibilities to study the acceleration and propagation of cosmic rays in the Milky Way. At the same time, both large non-astrophysical backgrounds at TeV energies and scarcity of neutrino events in the sub-PeV band currently limit these analyses. Here we use the sample of cascade events with estimated neutrino energies above 200 TeV, detected by the partially deployed Baikal Gigaton Volume Detector (GVD) in six years of operation, to test the continuation of the Galactic neutrino spectrum to sub-PeV energies. We find that the distribution of the arrival directions of Baikal-GVD cascades above 200 TeV in the sky suggests an excess of neutrinos from low Galactic latitudes with the chance probability of 1.4e-2. We find the excess above 200 TeV also in the most recent IceCube public data sets, both of cascades and tracks. The chance probability of the excess in the combined IceCube and Baikal-GVD analysis is 3.4e-4. The flux of Galactic neutrinos above 200~TeV challenges often-used templates for neutrino search based on cosmic-ray simulations.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamic structure and large-scale structure filament in MACS J0717.5+3745</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of Chandra and XMM-Newton X-ray imaging and spatially-resolved spectroscopy, as well as new MUSTANG2 90~GHz observations of the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect from MACS J0717.5+3745, an intermediate redshift ($z=0.5458$) and exceptionally massive ($3.5 \pm 0.6\ times 10^{15}~\rm M_\odot$) Frontier Fields cluster experiencing multiple mergers and hosting an apparent X-ray bright large scale structure filament. Thermodynamical maps are produced from Chandra, XMM-Newton, and ROSAT data using a new method for modeling the astrophysical and instrumental backgrounds. The temperature peak of $24 \pm 4$ keV is also the pressure peak of the cluster and closely correlates spatially with the Sunyaev-Zeldovich peak from the MUSTANG2 data. The cluster center hosts shock fronts to the north and south, for which we report estimates for the shock Mach numbers of $M = 1.6 \pm 0.4$ and $M = 1.9 \pm 0.3$, respectively. Bayesian X-ray Analysis methods were used to disentangle different projected spectral signatures for the filament structure, with Akaike and Bayes criteria being used to select the most appropriate model to describe the various temperature components. We report an X-ray filament temperature of $3.1_{-0.3}^{+0.6}$ keV and a density $(3.78\pm0.05)\times10^{-4}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$, corresponding to an overdensity of $\sim400$ relative to the critical density of the Universe. We estimate the hot gas mass of the filament to be $\sim6.1\times10^{12}~\rm M_\odot$, while its total projected weak lensing measured mass is $\sim(6.8\pm2.7)\times10^{13}~\rm M_\odot$, indicating a hot baryon fraction of 4--10\%.</description>

Abstract: UHECR are evaluated in the frame role of different nuclei composition. Most of the past and present models are considering proton or iron as their main courier. Some attention has been paid to the role of the UHECR light nuclei in recent years. We update here the lightest nuclei UHECR model, able to explain the nearest AGN or Star Burst sources with the few observed Hot Spot clustering in AUGER and TA array data. Any additional components of the heaviest nuclei with the highest energy, more bent and smeared, may also fit recent AUGER and TA homogeneous records at those energy edges.</description>

      <title>Is the Spin of the Black Hole in GX 339-4 Negative?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied the accreting black hole binary GX 339--4 using two highly accurate broad-band X-ray data sets in very soft spectral states from simultaneous NICER and NuSTAR observations. Joint fitting of both data sets with relativistic models of the disk, its Comptonization and reflection allows us to relatively accurately determine the black-hole mass and spin, and the distance and inclination. However, we find the measured values strongly depend on the used disk model. With widely used Kerr disk models treating departures from local blackbody spectra using color corrections, we find relatively low black-hole masses and strongly negative spins (i.e., retrograde accretion). Then, models employing radiative transfer calculations of the disk atmosphere predict moderately positive spins and high masses. When adding a warm corona above the disk (as proposed before for both AGNs and accreting binaries), we find the spin is weakly constrained, but consistent with zero. In all cases, the fitted inclination is low, $\approx 30$--$34^\circ$. For the spin axis aligned with the binary axis, the mass function for this source implies large values of the mass, consistent only with those obtained with either disk-atmosphere models or the presence of a warm corona. We also test different disk models for an assumed set of mass, distance and inclination. We find that different models yield values of the spin parameter differing up to $\sim$0.3. Our results confirm previously found strong model dependencies of the measured black-hole spin, now by comparing different disk models and for a low-mass X-ray binary.</description>

      <title>X-ray Dips and Polarization Angle Swings in GX 13+1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the result from the April 2024 observation of the low-mass X-ray binary GX 13+1 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), together with NICER and Swift-XRT coordinated observations. Two light curve dips were observed; during them, the harder Comptonized spectral component was dominant and the polarization degree higher than in the softer, off-dip intervals. Through a joint analysis of the three IXPE observations, which also included the dip from the first observation, we demonstrate that the polarization properties varied in response to the intensity and spectral hardness changes associated with the dips. The polarization degree attained values up to ~4%. The polarization angle showed a swing of ~70{\deg} across the dip and off-dip states, comparable to the continuous rotation seen during the first IXPE observation. We discuss these results in the context of models for polarized emission from the accretion disk and the boundary/spreading layer on the neutron star surface. We also draw attention to the role that an extended accretion disk corona or disk wind can play in generating high polarization degrees and, possibly, swings of the polarization angle.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for the Analysis of Traced Particles in Kinetic Plasma Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray acceleration processes in astrophysical plasmas are often investigated with fully-kinetic or hybrid kinetic numerical simulations, which enable us to describe a detailed microphysics of particle energization mechanisms. Tracing of individual particles in such simulations is especially useful in this regard. However, visually inspecting particle trajectories introduces a significant amount of bias and uncertainty, making it challenging to pinpoint specific acceleration mechanisms. Here, we present a novel approach utilising neural networks to assist in the analysis of individual particle data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using the dataset from our recent particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of non-relativistic perpendicular shocks that consists of 252,000 electrons, each characterised by their position, momentum and electromagnetic field at particle's position, recorded in a time series of 1200 time steps. These electrons cross a region affected by the electrostatic Buneman instability, and a small percentage of them attain high energies. We perform classification, regression, and anomaly detection algorithms on the dataset by using a convolutional neural network, a multi-layer perceptron, and an autoencoder. Despite the noisy and imbalanced dataset, all methods demonstrate the capability to differentiate between thermal and accelerated electrons with remarkable accuracy. The proposed methodology may considerably simplify particle classification in large-scale PIC and hybrid simulations.</description>

      <title>Modulation of X-ray flux by obscuration of neutron star boundary layer</title>

Abstract: The quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in the X-ray variability of both black hole (BH) and neutron star (NS) systems provide a tool for probing strong gravity and dense matter equations of state. Nevertheless, the mechanism of QPO modulation in NS systems, where the amplitudes of QPOs with frequencies approaching kHz range are very high in comparison to BH high-frequency QPOs, remains an unsolved puzzle. Relativistic ray tracing of photons emitted from the immediate vicinity of compact objects has, to date, been used to investigate various mechanisms that explain the observed weak BH QPOs. However, it has not been applied to model the NS QPO signal, which requires incorporating the NS surface and a bright boundary layer (BL) on it. Here, we explore the QPO modulation mechanisms based on the BL obscuration. Using simplified models of axisymmetric oscillations of thick accretion discs (tori), we demonstrate that the disc oscillations drive the high NS QPO amplitudes through BL obscuration, which is relevant especially for vertical oscillations. We also demonstrate that obscuration effects enable the observability of the Keplerian frequency in the case of discs that decay due to instabilities.</description>

      <title>Light curves and spectra for stellar collisions between main-sequence stars in galactic nuclei</title>

Abstract: High-velocity stellar collisions in galactic nuclei produce ejecta that generate potentially observable electromagnetic radiation, making them promising nuclear transients. However, the photometric and spectroscopic properties of these collisions, which would more frequently involve main-sequence stars, remain largely unexplored. Here, using 3D hydrodynamics and 1D radiation-transfer simulations, we investigate the properties and observables of the debris produced in high-velocity collisions between terminal-age main-sequence stars, covering a wide range of collision configurations. The ejecta produce bright UV flares with bolometric luminosities typically peaking at $\gtrsim10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, declining steeply as $t^{-2}-t^{-4}$ to reach $\gtrsim10^{41}-10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 0.5 d and leveling off on a plateau at $10^{39}-10^{41.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($M_V$ between $-$10 to $-$15 mag) after a few days. Their spectra evolve considerably during the first few days, morphing from UV- to optical-dominated. The UV range shows numerous resonance transitions from metals like C, N, and O, whereas the optical primarily shows H I Balmer lines. These properties are qualitatively similar to those observed, as well as obtained in models of Type II supernovae. Observables from these events exhibit clear correlations with collision configurations, including impact parameter, relative velocity, and stellar masses. We provide fitting formulae to describe these correlations. Detecting these flares requires sub-day cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT, combined with spectroscopic observations to disentangle degeneracies and infer collision characteristics.</description>

      <title>Fundamental MHD scales -- II: the kinematic phase of the supersonic small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17036v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many astrophysical small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify weak magnetic fields via highly compressible, supersonic turbulence, but established SSD theories have overlooked these compressible effects. To address this, we perform visco-resistive SSD simulations across a range of sonic Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}$), hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$), and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pm}$). We develop robust methods to measure kinetic and magnetic energy dissipation scales ($\ell_\nu$ and $\ell_\eta$) and the scale of strongest magnetic fields ($\ell_\mathrm{p}$) during the kinematic phase. We demonstrate that $\ell_\nu/\ell_\eta \sim \mathrm{Pm}^{1/2}$ is a universal feature for $\mathrm{Pm} \geq 1$ SSDs, regardless of $\mathcal{M}$ or $\mathrm{Re}$. Incompressible SSDs (either $\mathcal{M} \leq 1$ or $\mathrm{Re} &lt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit} \approx 100$) concentrate magnetic energy at $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim \ell_\eta$ with inversely correlated field strength and curvature. However, for compressible SSDs ($\mathcal{M} &gt; 1$ and $\mathrm{Re} &gt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit}$), shocks concentrate magnetic energy in large structures with $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim (\ell_\mathrm{turb} / \ell_\mathrm{shock})^{1/3} \ell_\eta \gg \ell_\eta$, where $\ell_\mathrm{shock}$ is the characteristic shock width, and $\ell_\mathrm{turb}$ is the outer scale of the turbulent field. In this regime, magnetic field-line curvature becomes nearly independent of field strength. These results have implications for galaxy mergers and cosmic ray transport models in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Wide Binary Evaporation by Dark Solitons: Implications from the GAIA Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An analytic calculation is given for binary star evaporation under the tidal perturbation from randomly distributed, spatially extended dark objects. In particular, the Milky Way's wide binary star population is susceptible to such disruption from dark matter solitons of comparable and larger sizes. We identify high-probability `halo-like' wide binaries in GAIA EDR3 with separations larger than 0.1 parsec. Survival of the farthest-separated candidates will provide a novel gravitational probe to dark matter in the form of solitons. In the case of dilute axion-like boson stars, the observational sensitivity extends into the axion mass range $m_a \sim 10^{-17}-10^{-15}$ eV.</description>

      <title>flashcurve: A machine-learning approach for the simple and fast generation of adaptive-binning light curves with Fermi-LAT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gamma rays measured by the Fermi-LAT satellite tell us a lot about the processes taking place in high-energetic astrophysical objects. The fluxes coming from these objects are, however, extremely variable. Hence, gamma-ray light curves optimally use adaptive bin sizes in order to retrieve most information about the source dynamics and to combine gamma-ray observations in a multi-messenger perspective. However, standard adaptive binning approaches are slow, expensive and inaccurate in highly populated regions. Here, we present a novel, powerful, deep-learning-based approach to estimate the necessary time windows for adaptive binning light curves in Fermi-LAT data using raw photon data. The approach is shown to be fast and accurate. It can also be seen as a prototype to train machine-learning models for adaptive binning light curves for other astrophysical messengers.</description>
