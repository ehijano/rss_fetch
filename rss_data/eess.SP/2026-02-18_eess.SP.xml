      <title>Transforming Computational Lithography with AC and AI -- Faster, More Accurate, and Energy-efficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From climate science to drug discovery, scientific computing demands have surged dramatically in recent years -- driven by larger datasets, more sophisticated models, and higher simulation fidelity. This growth rate far outpaces transistor scaling, leading to unsustainably rising costs, energy consumption, and emissions. Semiconductor manufacturing is no exception. Computational lithography -- involving transferring circuitry to silicon in diffraction-limited conditions -- is the largest workload in semiconductor manufacturing. It has also grown exceptionally complex as miniaturization has advanced in the angstrom-era, requiring more accurate modeling, intricate corrections, and broader solution-space exploration. Accelerated computing (AC) offers a solution by dramatically freeing up the compute and power envelope. AI augments these gains by serving as high-fidelity surrogates for compute-intensive steps. Together, they present a sustainable, next-generation computing platform for scientific workloads. This new paradigm needs a fundamental redesign of the software stack. For computational lithography, NVIDIA cuLitho reinvents the core primitives -- diffractive optics, computational geometry, multi-variant optimization, data processing -- to achieve a transformative 57X end-to-end acceleration. Beyond dramatically faster cycles, this expanded compute envelope enables more rigorous solutions, including curvilinear masks, high-numerical aperture extreme ultraviolet (high-NA EUV) lithography, and subatomic modeling. We reinvest a small fraction of the freed-up compute to include through-focus correction for better process resilience. Silicon experiments at IMEC show significant benefits compared to conventional methods -- 35% better process window and 19% better edge placement error. This is the first quantified chip-scale demonstration of the lithography benefits of AC and AI in silicon.</description>

      <title>Combining scEEG and PPG for reliable sleep staging using lightweight wearables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable sleep staging remains challenging for lightweight wearable devices such as single-channel electroencephalography (scEEG) or photoplethysmography (PPG). scEEG offers direct measurement of cortical activity and serves as the foundation for sleep staging, yet exhibits limited performance on light sleep stages. PPG provides a low-cost complement that captures autonomic signatures effective for detecting light sleep. However, prior PPG-based methods rely on full night recordings (8 - 10 hours) as input context, which is less practical to provide timely feedback for sleep intervention. In this work, we investigate scEEG-PPG fusion for 4-class sleep staging under short-window (30 s - 30 min) constraints. First, we evaluate the temporal context required for each modality, to better understand the relationship of sleep staging performance with respect to monitoring window. Second, we investigate three fusion strategies: score-level fusion, cross-attention fusion enabling feature-level interactions, and Mamba-enhanced fusion incorporating temporal context modeling. Third, we train and evaluate on the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) dataset and perform cross-dataset validation on the Cleveland Family Study (CFS) and the Apnea, Bariatric surgery, and CPAP (ABC) datasets. The Mamba-enhanced fusion achieves the best performance on MESA (Cohen's Kappa $\kappa$ = 0.798, Acc = 86.9%), with particularly notable improvement in light sleep classification (F1-score: 85.63% vs. 77.76%, recall: 82.85% vs. 69.95% for scEEG alone), and generalizes well to CFS and ABC datasets with different populations. These findings suggest that scEEG-PPG fusion is a promising approach for lightweight wearable based sleep monitoring, offering a pathway toward more accessible sleep health assessment.

      <title>Large elements and advanced beamformers for increased field of view in 2-D ultrasound matrix arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) ultrasound promises various medical applications for abdominal, obstetrics, and cardiovascular imaging. However, ultrasound matrix arrays have extremely high element counts limiting their field of view (FOV). This work seeks to demonstrate an increased field-of-view using a reduced element count array design. The approach is to increase the element size and use advanced beamformers to maintain image quality. The delay and sum (DAS), Null Subtraction Imaging (NSI), directional coherence factor (DCF), and Minimum Variance (MV) beamformers were compared. K-wave simulations of the 3D point-spread functions (PSF) of NSI, DCF, and MV display reduced side lobes and narrowed main lobes compared to DAS. Experiments were conducted using a multiplexed 1024-element matrix array on a Verasonics 256 system. Elements were electronically coupled to imitate a larger pitch and element size. Then, a virtual large aperture was created by using a positioning system to collect data in sections with the matrix array. High-quality images were obtained using a coupling factor of two, doubling the FOV while maintaining the same element count in the virtual large aperture as the original matrix array. The NSI beamformer demonstrated the best resolution performance in simulations and on the large aperture, maintaining the same resolution as uncoupled DAS for coupling factors up to 4. Our results demonstrate how larger matrix arrays could be constructed with larger elements, with resolution maintained by advanced beamformers.</description>

      <title>Secure High-Resolution ISAC via Multi-Layer Intelligent Metasurfaces: A Layered Optimization Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a pivotal technology for next-generation wireless networks, enabling simultaneous data transmission and environmental sensing. However, existing ISAC systems face fundamental limitations in achieving high-resolution sensing while maintaining robust communication security and spectral efficiency. This paper introduces a transformative approach leveraging stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) to overcome these challenges. We propose a multi-functional SIM-assisted system that jointly optimizes communication secrecy and sensing accuracy through a novel layered optimization framework. Our solution employs a multi-objective optimization formulation that balances secrecy rate maximization with sensing error minimization under practical hardware constraints. The proposed layered block coordinate descent algorithm efficiently coordinates sensing configuration, secure beamforming, communication metasurface optimization, and resource allocation while ensuring robustness to channel uncertainties. Extensive simulations demonstrate significant performance gains over conventional approaches, achieving 32-61\% improvement in sensing accuracy and 15-35\% enhancement in secrecy rates while maintaining computational efficiency. This work establishes a new paradigm for secure and high-precision multi-functional wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Multiplierless DFT Approximation Based on the Prime Factor Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix approximation methods have successfully produced efficient, low-complexity approximate transforms for the discrete cosine transforms and the discrete Fourier transforms. For the DFT case, literature archives approximations operating at small power-of-two blocklenghts, such as \{8, 16, 32\}, or at large blocklengths, such as 1024, which are obtained by means of the Cooley-Tukey-based approximation relying on the small-blocklength approximate transforms. Cooley-Tukey-based approximations inherit the intermediate multiplications by twiddled factors which are usually not approximated; otherwise the effected error propagation would prevent the overall good performance of the approximation. In this context, the prime factor algorithm can furnish the necessary framework for deriving fully multiplierless DFT approximations. We introduced an approximation method based on small prime-sized DFT approximations which entirely eliminates intermediate multiplication steps and prevents internal error propagation. To demonstrate the proposed method, we design a fully multiplierless 1023-point DFT approximation based on 3-, 11- and 31-point DFT approximations. The performance evaluation according to popular metrics showed that the proposed approximations not only presented a significantly lower arithmetic complexity but also resulted in smaller approximation error measurements when compared to competing methods.</description>

      <title>SCENE OTA-FD: Self-Centering Noncoherent Estimator for Over-the-Air Federated Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SCENE (Self-Centering Noncoherent Estimator), a pilot-free and phase-invariant aggregation primitive for over-the-air federated distillation (OTA-FD). Each device maps its soft-label (class-probability) vector to nonnegative transmit energies under constant per-round power and constant-envelope signaling (PAPR near 1). At the server, a self-centering energy estimator removes the noise-energy offset and yields an unbiased estimate of the weighted soft-label average, with variance decaying on the order of 1/(SM) in the number of receive antennas M and repetition factor S. We also develop a pilot-free ratio-normalized variant that cancels unknown large-scale gains, provide a convergence bound consistent with coherent OTA-FD analyses, and present an overhead-based crossover comparison. SCENE targets short-coherence and hardware-constrained regimes, where avoiding per-round CSI is essential: it trades a modest noncoherent variance constant for zero uplink pilots, unbiased aggregation, and hardware-friendly transmission, and can outperform coherent designs when pilot overhead is non-negligible.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Selection of Codebook Using Assistance Information and Artificial Intelligence for 6G Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of adaptive codebook (CB) selection for downlink (DL) precoder quantization in channel state information (CSI) reporting. The accuracy of precoder quantization depends on propagation conditions, requiring independent parameter adaptation for each user equipment (UE). To enable optimal CB selection, this paper proposes UE-assisted CB selection at the base station (BS) using reported by the UE statistical channel properties across time, frequency, and spatial domains. The reported assistance information serves as input to a neural network (NN), which predicts the quantization accuracy of various CB types for each served user. The predicted accuracy is then used to select the optimal CB while considering the associated CSI reporting overhead and precoding performance. System-level simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces total CSI overhead while maintaining the target system throughput performance.</description>

      <title>Waveform Design for ISAC System: A Consensus ADMM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study joint transmit-waveform and receive-filter design for a multi-user downlink integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system under practical constant-modulus and similarity constraints. We cast the design as a unified multi-objective program that balances communication sum rate and sensing signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). To address this, we introduce an efficient algorithm that use consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework to alternately update the transmit waveform and radar filter. The proposed method effectively handles the non-convex fractional sensing's SINR formulation and ensures fast convergence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves better trade-offs between communication sum rate and sensing's SINR compared to existing benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Tracking Time-Varying Multipath Channels forActive Sonar Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable detection and tracking in active sonar require accurate and efficient learning of the acoustic multipath background environment. Conventionally, background learning is performed after transforming measurements into the range-Doppler domain, a step that is computationally expensive and can obscure phase-coherent structure useful for monitoring and tracking. This paper proposes a framework for learning and tracking the multipath background directly in the raw measurement domain. Starting from a wideband Doppler linearization of the impulse response of a time-varying multipath channel, a state-space model with a heteroscedastic measurement equation is derived. This model enables channel tracking using an extended Kalman filter (EKF), and unknown model parameters are learned from the marginalized likelihood. The statistical adequacy of the proposed models is assessed via a p-value significance test. Finally, this paper integrates the learned channel model into a sequential likelihood-ratio test for target detection. BELLHOP-based simulations show that the proposed model better captures channel dynamics induced by sea-surface fluctuations and transmitter and receiver drift, yielding more reliable detection in time-varying shallow-water environments</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Anomaly Detection of Terrain Material Change in Radar Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider physics-informed detection of terrain material change in radar imagery (e.g., shifts in permittivity, roughness or moisture). We propose a lightweight electromagnetic (EM) forward model to simulate bi-temporal single-look complex (SLC) images from labelled material maps. On these data, we derive physics-aware feature stacks that include interferometric coherence, and evaluate unsupervised detectors: Reed-Xiaoli (RX)/Local-RX with robust scatter (Tyler's M-estimator), Coherent Change Detection (CCD), and a compact convolutional auto-encoder. Monte Carlo experiments sweep dielectric/roughness/moisture changes, number of looks and clutter regimes (gamma vs K-family) at fixed probability of false alarm. Results on synthetic but physically grounded scenes show that coherence and robust covariance markedly improve anomaly detection of material changes; a simple score-level fusion achieves the best F1 in heavy-tailed clutter.</description>

      <title>Passive Imaging with Ambient Noise Under Wave Speed Mismatch: Mathematical Analysis and Wave Speed Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that waves generated by ambient noise sources and recorded by passive receivers can be used to image the reflectivities of an unknown medium. However, reconstructing the reflectivity of the medium from partial boundary measurements remains a challenging problem, particularly when the background wave speed is unknown. In this paper, we investigate passive correlation-based imaging in the daylight configuration, where uncontrolled noise sources illuminate the medium and only ambient fields are recorded by a sensor array. We first analyze daylight migration for a point reflector embedded in a homogeneous background. By introducing a searching wave speed into the migration functional, we derive an explicit characterization of the deterministic shift and defocusing effects induced by wave-speed mismatch. We show that the maximum of the envelope of the resulting functional provides a reliable estimator of the true wave speed. We then extend the analysis to a random medium with correlation length smaller than the wavelength. Leveraging the shift formula obtained in the homogeneous case, we introduce a virtual guide star that remains fixed under migration with different searching speeds. This property enables an effective wave-speed estimation strategy based on spatial averaging around the virtual guide star. For both homogeneous and random media, we establish resolution analyses for the proposed wave-speed estimators. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical result.</description>

      <title>Latency-aware Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning for Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication promises task-aligned transmission but must reconcile semantic fidelity with stringent latency guarantees in immersive and safety-critical services. This paper introduces a time-constrained human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning (TC-HITL-RL) framework that embeds human feedback, semantic utility, and latency control within a semantic-aware Open radio access network (RAN) architecture. We formulate semantic adaptation driven by human feedback as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) whose state captures semantic quality, human preferences, queue slack, and channel dynamics, and solve it via a primal--dual proximal policy optimization algorithm with action shielding and latency-aware reward shaping. The resulting policy preserves PPO-level semantic rewards while tightening the variability of both air-interface and near-real-time RAN intelligent controller processing budgets. Simulations over point-to-multipoint links with heterogeneous deadlines show that TC-HITL-RL consistently meets per-user timing constraints, outperforms baseline schedulers in reward, and stabilizes resource consumption, providing a practical blueprint for latency-aware semantic adaptation.</description>

      <title>NYUSIM: A Roadmap to AI-Enabled Statistical Channel Modeling and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into wireless channel modeling requires large, accurate, and physically consistent datasets derived from real measurements. Such datasets are essential for training and validating models that learn spatio-temporal channel behavior across frequencies and environments. NYUSIM, introduced by NYU WIRELESS in 2016, generates realistic spatio-temporal channel data using extensive outdoor and indoor measurements between 28 and 142 GHz. To improve scalability and support 6G research, we migrated the complete NYUSIM framework from MATLAB to Python, and are incorporating new statistical model generation capabilities from extensive field measurements in the new 6G upper mid-band spectrum at 6.75 GHz (FR1(C)) and 16.95 GHz (FR3) [1]. The NYUSIM Python also incorporates a 3D antenna data format, referred to as Ant3D, which is a standardized, full-sphere format for defining canonical, commercial, or measured antenna patterns for any statistical or site-specific ray tracing modeling tool. Migration from MATLAB to Python was rigorously validated through Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) tests, moment analysis, and end-to-end testing with unified randomness control, confirming statistical consistency and reproduction of spatio-temporal channel statistics, including spatial consistency with the open-source MATLAB NYUSIM v4.0 implementation. The NYUSIM Python version is designed to integrate with modern AI workflows and enable large-scale parallel data generation, establishing a robust, verified, and extensible foundation for future AI-enabled channel modeling.</description>

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) offer programmable control of radio propagation for future wireless systems. For configuration, geometry-driven analytical approaches are appealing for their simplicity and real-time operation, but their performance in challenging environments such as industrial halls with dense multipath and metallic scattering is not well established. To this end, we present a measurement-based evaluation of geometry-driven RIS beam steering in a large industrial hall using a 5 GHz RIS prototype. A novel RIS configuration is proposed in which four patch antennas are mounted in close proximity in front of the RIS to steer the incident field and enable controlled reflection. For this setup, analytically computed, quantized configurations are implemented. Two-dimensional received power maps from two measurement areas reveal consistent, spatially selective focusing. Configurations optimized near the receiver produce clear power maxima, while steering to offset locations triggers a rapid 20-30 dB reduction. With increasing RIS-receiver distance, elevation selectivity broadens due to finite-aperture and geometric constraints, while azimuth steering remains robust. These results confirm the practical viability of geometry-driven RIS beam steering in industrial environments and support its use for spatial field control and localization under non-ideal propagation.</description>

      <title>Tomography by Design: An Algebraic Approach to Low-Rank Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algebraic algorithm for quantum state tomography that leverages measurements of certain observables to estimate structured entries of the underlying density matrix. Under low-rank assumptions, the remaining entries can be obtained solely using standard numerical linear algebra operations. The proposed algebraic matrix completion framework applies to a broad class of generic, low-rank mixed quantum states and, compared with state-of-the-art methods, is computationally efficient while providing deterministic recovery guarantees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intellicise (Intelligent and Concise) wireless network is the main direction of the evolution of future mobile communication systems, a perspective now widely acknowledged across academia and industry. As a key technology within it, Agentic AI has garnered growing attention due to its advanced cognitive capabilities, enabled through continuous perception-memory-reasoning-action cycles. This paper first analyses the unique advantages that Agentic AI introduces to intellicise wireless networks. We then propose a structured taxonomy for Agentic AI-enhanced secure intellicise wireless networks. Building on this framework, we identify emerging security and privacy challenges introduced by Agentic AI and summarize targeted strategies to address these vulnerabilities. A case study further demonstrates Agentic AI's efficacy in defending against intelligent eavesdropping attacks. Finally, we outline key open research directions to guide future exploration in this field.</description>

      <title>Corrected-Inverse-Gaussian First-Hitting-Time Modeling for Molecular Communication Under Time-Varying Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a tractable analytical channel model for first-hitting-time molecular communication systems under time-varying drift. While existing studies of nonstationary transport rely primarily on numerical solutions of advection--diffusion equations or parametric impulse-response fitting, they do not provide a closed-form description of trajectory-level arrival dynamics at absorbing boundaries. By adopting a change-of-measure formulation, we reveal a structural decomposition of the first-hitting-time density into a cumulative-drift displacement term and a stochastic boundary-flux modulation factor. This leads to an explicit analytical expression for the Corrected-Inverse-Gaussian (C-IG) density, extending the classical IG model to strongly nonstationary drift conditions while preserving constant-complexity evaluation. High-precision Monte Carlo simulations under both smooth pulsatile and abrupt switching drift profiles confirm that the proposed model accurately captures complex transport phenomena, including phase modulation, multi-pulse dispersion, and transient backflow. The resulting framework provides a physics-informed, computationally efficient channel model suitable for system-level analysis and receiver design in dynamic biological and molecular communication environments.</description>

      <title>A Universal Neural Receiver that Learns at the Speed of Wireless</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Today we design wireless networks using mathematical models that govern communication in different propagation environments. We rely on measurement campaigns to deliver parametrized propagation models, and on the 3GPP standards process to optimize model-based performance, but as wireless networks become more complex this model-based approach is losing ground. Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are counting on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to transform wireless by increasing spectral efficiency, reducing signaling overhead, and enabling continuous network innovation through software upgrades. They may also be interested in new use cases like integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). All we need is an AI-native physical layer, so why not simply tailor the offline AI algorithms that have revolutionized image and natural language processing to the wireless domain? We argue that these algorithms rely on off-line training that is precluded by the sub-millisecond speeds at which the wireless interference environment changes. We present an alternative architecture, a universal neural receiver based on convolution, which governs transmit and receive signal processing of any signal in any part of the wireless spectrum. Our neural receiver is designed to invert convolution, and we separate the question of which convolution to invert from the actual deconvolution. The neural network that performs deconvolution is very simple, and we configure this network by setting weights based on domain knowledge. By telling our neural network what we know, we avoid extensive offline training. By developing a universal receiver, we hope to simplify discussions about the proper choice of waveform for different use cases in the international standards. Since the receiver architecture is largely independent of technologies introduced at the base station, we hope to increase the rate of innovation in wireless.</description>

      <title>Bottleneck Transformer-Based Approach for Improved Automatic STOI Score Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we have presented a novel approach to predict the Short-Time Objective Intelligibility (STOI) metric using a bottleneck transformer architecture. Traditional methods for calculating STOI typically requires clean reference speech, which limits their applicability in the real world. To address this, numerous deep learning-based nonintrusive speech assessment models have garnered significant interest. Many studies have achieved commendable performance, but there is room for further improvement.
  We propose the use of bottleneck transformer, incorporating convolution blocks for learning frame-level features and a multi-head self-attention (MHSA) layer to aggregate the information. These components enable the transformer to focus on the key aspects of the input data. Our model has shown higher correlation and lower mean squared error for both seen and unseen scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art model using self-supervised learning (SSL) and spectral features as inputs.</description>

      <title>Estimating Human Muscular Fatigue in Dynamic Collaborative Robotic Tasks with Learning-Based Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assessing human muscle fatigue is critical for optimizing performance and safety in physical human-robot interaction(pHRI). This work presents a data-driven framework to estimate fatigue in dynamic, cyclic pHRI using arm-mounted surface electromyography(sEMG). Subject-specific machine-learning regression models(Random Forest, XGBoost, and Linear Regression predict the fraction of cycles to fatigue(FCF) from three frequency-domain and one time-domain EMG features, and are benchmarked against a convolutional neural network(CNN) that ingests spectrograms of filtered EMG. Framing fatigue estimation as regression (rather than classification) captures continuous progression toward fatigue, supporting earlier detection, timely intervention, and adaptive robot control. In experiments with ten participants, a collaborative robot under admittance control guided repetitive lateral (left-right) end-effector motions until muscular fatigue. Average FCF RMSE across participants was 20.8+/-4.3% for the CNN, 23.3+/-3.8% for Random Forest, 24.8+/-4.5% for XGBoost, and 26.9+/-6.1% for Linear Regression. To probe cross-task generalization, one participant additionally performed unseen vertical (up-down) and circular repetitions; models trained only on lateral data were tested directly and largely retained accuracy, indicating robustness to changes in movement direction, arm kinematics, and muscle recruitment, while Linear Regression deteriorated. Overall, the study shows that both feature-based ML and spectrogram-based DL can estimate remaining work capacity during repetitive pHRI, with the CNN delivering the lowest error and the tree-based models close behind. The reported transfer to new motion patterns suggests potential for practical fatigue monitoring without retraining for every task, improving operator protection and enabling fatigue-aware shared autonomy, for safer fatigue-adaptive pHRI control.</description>

      <title>Random Wavelet Features for Graph Kernel Machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Node embeddings map graph vertices into low-dimensional Euclidean spaces while preserving structural information. They are central to tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and signal reconstruction. A key goal is to design node embeddings whose dot products capture meaningful notions of node similarity induced by the graph. Graph kernels offer a principled way to define such similarities, but their direct computation is often prohibitive for large networks. Inspired by random feature methods for kernel approximation in Euclidean spaces, we introduce randomized spectral node embeddings whose dot products estimate a low-rank approximation of any specific graph kernel. We provide theoretical and empirical results showing that our embeddings achieve more accurate kernel approximations than existing methods, particularly for spectrally localized kernels. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of randomized spectral constructions for scalable and principled graph representation learning.</description>

      <title>Matched Filtering-Based Channel Estimation for AFDM Systems in Doubly Selective Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) has recently emerged as an excellent backward-compatible 6G waveform. In this paper, we study matched filtering (MF) assisted channel estimation (CE) for AFDM systems in complex doubly selective channels. By deriving the complete input-output relationship of the continuous-time signal, the inter-chirp-carrier interference, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), and the effective SINR loss of AFDM, are investigated in discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) domain. Further, we propose two low-complexity methods for constructing the channel matrix by taking advantage of its inherent discrete Fourier transform structure and the staircase structure of the piecewise functions in the channel matrix, respectively. It is shown that complexity reduction by at least two orders of magnitude can be achieved for a large number of chirp subcarriers. For the CE problem in doubly selective channels, we introduce an MF assisted CE scheme. This allows us to sequentially estimate the parameters of each path by exploiting the separability and approximate orthogonality of different paths in the DAFT domain, thus leading to significantly reduced complexity. Furthermore, based on generalized Fibonacci search (GFS), an MF-GFS scheme is proposed to avoid significantly redundant computation, which can be extended to typical wide-band systems. Extensive simulation results indicate that the proposed schemes offer superior advantages in terms of their improved communication performance and lower complexity.</description>

Abstract: A mixed precision Fast Fourier transform (FFT) implementation is presented. The procedure uses per-block microscaling (MX), a global power-of-two prescale, and prequantized low bit twiddles. We evaluate forward and round-trip FFT fidelity on two public MRI datasets and compare the effect of various low precision formats, image sizes, and MX block sizes on image quality. Results show that mantissa precision is the primary limiter under MX scaling while ablations suggest weak dependence on image size but a clear block-size trade-off with larger block sizes resulting in better numerical performance.</description>

      <title>A Covariance Matching Approach to Graph Topology Identification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph topology identification (GTI) is a central challenge in networked systems, where the underlying structure is often hidden, yet nodal data are available. Conventional solutions to address these challenges rely on probabilistic models or complex optimization formulations, commonly suffering from non-convexity or requiring restrictive assumptions on acyclicity or positivity. In this paper, we propose a novel covariance matching (CovMatch) framework that directly aligns the empirical covariance of the observed data with the theoretical covariance implied by an underlying graph. We show that as long as the data-generating process permits an explicit covariance expression, CovMatch offers a unified route to topology inference.
  We showcase our methodology on linear structural equation models (SEMs), showing that CovMatch naturally handles both undirected and general sparse directed graphs - whether acyclic or positively weighted - without explicit knowledge of these structural constraints. Through appropriate reparameterizations, CovMatch simplifies the graph learning problem to either a conic mixed integer program for undirected graphs or an orthogonal matrix optimization for directed graphs. Numerical results confirm that, even for relatively large graphs, our approach efficiently recovers the true topology and outperforms standard baselines in accuracy. These findings highlight CovMatch as a powerful alternative to log-determinant or Bayesian methods for GTI, paving the way for broader research on learning complex network topologies with minimal assumptions.</description>

      <title>Sub Specie Aeternitatis: Fourier Transforms from the Theory of Heat to Musical Signals</title>

Abstract: J. B. Fourier in his \emph{Th\'{e}orie Analytique de la Chaleur} of 1822 introduced, amongst other things, two ideas that have made a fundamental impact in fields as diverse as Mathematical Physics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Music. The first one of these, a method to find the coefficients for a trigonometric series describing an arbitrary function, was very early on picked up by G. Ohm and H. Helmholtz as the foundation for a theory of \emph{musical tones}. The second one, which is described by Fourier's double integral, became the basis for treating certain kinds of infinity in discontinuous functions, as shown by A. De Morgan in his 1842 \emph{The Differential and Integral Calculus}. Both make up the fundamental basis for what is now commonly known as the \emph{Fourier theorem}. With the help of P. A. M. Dirac's insights into the nature of these infinities, we can have a compact description of the frequency spectrum of a function of time, or conversely of a waveform corresponding to a given function of frequency. This paper, using solely primary sources, takes us from the physics of heat propagation to the modern theory of musical signals. It concludes with some considerations on the inherent duality of time and frequency emerging from Fourier's theorem.</description>

      <title>XAI-Driven Spectral Analysis of Cough Sounds for Respiratory Disease Characterization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI)-driven methodology to enhance the understanding of cough sound analysis for respiratory disease management. We employ occlusion maps to highlight relevant spectral regions in cough spectrograms processed by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Subsequently, spectral analysis of spectrograms weighted by these occlusion maps reveals significant differences between disease groups, particularly in patients with COPD, where cough patterns appear more variable in the identified spectral regions of interest. This contrasts with the lack of significant differences observed when analyzing raw spectrograms. The proposed approach extracts and analyzes several spectral features, demonstrating the potential of XAI techniques to uncover disease-specific acoustic signatures and improve the diagnostic capabilities of cough sound analysis by providing more interpretable results.</description>

      <title>A XAI-based Framework for Frequency Subband Characterization of Cough Spectrograms in Chronic Respiratory Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands, enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum. Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions, and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation and translational respiratory disease diagnostics.</description>
