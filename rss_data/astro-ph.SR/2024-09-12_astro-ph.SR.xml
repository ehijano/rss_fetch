      <title>Using Neural Network Models to Estimate Stellar Ages from Lithium Equivalent Widths: An EAGLES Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model of photospheric lithium depletion in cool stars (3000 &lt; Teff / K &lt; 6500), producing estimates and probability distributions of age from Li I 6708A equivalent width (LiEW) and effective temperature data inputs. The model is trained on the same sample of 6200 stars from 52 open clusters, observed in the Gaia-ESO spectroscopic survey, and used to calibrate the previously published analytical EAGLES model, with ages 2 - 6000 Myr and -0.3 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; 0.2. The additional flexibility of the ANN provides some improvements, including better modelling of the "lithium dip" at ages &lt; 50 Myr and Teff ~ 3500K, and of the intrinsic dispersion in LiEW at all ages. Poor age discrimination is still an issue at ages &gt; 1 Gyr, confirming that additional modelling flexibility is not sufficient to fully represent the LiEW - age - Teff relationship, and suggesting the involvement of further astrophysical parameters. Expansion to include such parameters - rotation, accretion, and surface gravity - is discussed, and the use of an ANN means these can be more easily included in future iterations, alongside more flexible functional forms for the LiEW dispersion. Our methods and ANN model are provided in an updated version 2.0 of the EAGLES software.</description>

      <title>Can slow pulsars in Milky Way globular clusters form via partial recycling?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alongside the population of several hundred radio millisecond pulsars currently known in Milky Way globular clusters, a subset of six slowly spinning pulsars (spin periods $0.3-4$\,s) are also observed. With inferred magnetic fields $\gtrsim 10^{11}\,$G and characteristic ages $\lesssim10^8\,$yr, explaining the formation of these apparently young pulsars in old stellar populations poses a major challenge. One popular explanation is that these objects are not actually young but instead have been partially spun up via accretion from a binary companion. In this scenario, accretion in a typical low-mass X-ray binary is interrupted by a dynamical encounter with a neighboring object in the cluster. Instead of complete spin up to millisecond spin periods, the accretion is halted prematurely, leaving behind a ``partially recycled'' neutron star. In this Letter, we use a combination of analytic arguments motivated by low-mass X-ray binary evolution and $N$-body simulations to show that this partial-recycling mechanism is not viable. Realistic globular clusters are not sufficiently dense to interrupt mass transfer on the short timescales required to achieve such slow spin periods. We argue that collapse of massive white dwarfs and/or neutron star collisions are more promising ways to form slow pulsars in old globular clusters.</description>

      <title>Confirming the Tidal Tails of the Young Open Cluster Blanco 1 with TESS Rotation Periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blanco 1 is an $\approx 130\,\mathrm{Myr}$ open cluster located 240 pc from the Sun below the Galactic plane. Recent studies have reported the existence of diffuse tidal tails extending 50-60 pc from the cluster center based on the positions and velocities measured by Gaia. To independently assess the reality and extent of this structure, we used light curves generated from TESS full-frame images to search for photometric rotation periods of stars in and around Blanco 1. We detected rotation periods down to a stellar effective temperature of $\approx 3100\,\mathrm{K}$ in 347 of the 603 cluster member candidates for which we have light curves. For cluster members in the core and candidate members in the tidal tails, both within a temperature range of 4400 to 6200 K, 74% and 72% of the rotation periods are consistent with the single-star gyrochronological sequence, respectively. In contrast, a comparison sample of field stars yielded gyrochrone-consistent rotation periods for only 8.5% of stars. The tidal tail candidates' overall conformance to the core members' gyrochrone sequence implies that their contamination ratio is consistent with zero and &lt; 0.33 at the $2\sigma$ level. This result confirms the existence of Blanco 1 tidal tails and doubles the number of Blanco 1 members for which there are both spatio-kinematic and rotation-based cluster membership verification. Extending the strategy of using TESS light curves for gyrochronology to other nearby young open clusters and stellar associations may provide a viable strategy for mapping out their dissolution and broadening the search for young exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Sun-as-a-star Analysis of the X1.6 Flare on 2023 August 5: Dynamics of Post-flare Loops in Spatially Integrated Observational Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Post-flare loops are loop-like plasmas observed during the decay phase of solar flares, and they are expected to exist for stellar flares. However, it is unclear how post-flare loops are observed in stellar flares' cases. To clarify behaviors of post-flare loops in spatially integrated data, we performed the Sun-as-a-star analysis of the X1.6 flare that occurred on 2023 August 5, using GOES X-ray flux ($\sim10^7$ K), extreme ultraviolet (EUV) images taken by Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamic Observatory ($\ge10^{4.9}$ K) and H$\alpha$ data taken by Solar Dynamics Doppler Imager on board the Solar Magnetic Activity Research Telescope at Hida Observatory, Kyoto University ($\sim10^4$ K). As a result, this flare showed signatures corresponding to the important dynamics of the post-flare loops even in the spatially integrated data: (1) The H$\alpha$ light curve showed two distinct peaks corresponding to the flare ribbons and the post-flare loops. The plasma cooling in the post-flare loops generated different peak times in soft X-rays, EUV, and H$\alpha$ light curves. (2) Downflows were confirmed as simultaneous redshifted/blueshifted absorptions in the H$\alpha$ spectra. (3) The apparent rise of post-flare loops was recognized as a slowing of the decay for the H$\alpha$ light curve. These results are keys to investigating stellar post-flare loops with spatially integrated data. We also discuss the dependence of our results on flare locations and their possible applications to stellar observations.</description>

      <title>Super-slowly rotating Ap (ssrAp) stars: Spectroscopic study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To gain better understanding of the Ap stars with the longest rotation periods, we obtained high resolution spectra of a sample of super-slowly rotating Ap (ssrAp) star candidates identified by a TESS photometric survey, to confirm that they are indeed Ap stars, to check that their v sin i values are compatible with super-slow rotation, and to obtain a first estimate of their magnetic field strengths. We determined whenever possible their mean magnetic field modulus, their mean quadratic magnetic field, and an upper limit of their projected equatorial velocities. Eighteen of the 27 stars studied are typical Ap stars; most of the other nine appear to be misclassified. One of the Ap stars is not a slow rotator; it must be seen nearly pole-on. The properties of the remaining 17 are compatible with moderately to extremely long rotation periods. Eight new stars with resolved magnetically split lines in the visible range were discovered; their mean magnetic field modulus and their mean quadratic magnetic field were measured. The mean quadratic field could also be determined in five more stars. Five new spectroscopic binaries containing an Ap star were identified. Among the misclassified stars, one SB2 system with two similar, sharp-lined Am components was also discovered. The technique that we used to carry out a search for ssrAp star candidates using TESS data is validated, but appears limited by uncertainties in the spectral classification of Ap stars. The new magnetic field measurements obtained as part of this study lend further support to the tentative conclusions of our previous studies: the absence of periods longer than ~150 d in stars with magnetic fields stronger than ~7.5 kG, the lower rate of occurrence of super-slow rotation for field strengths less than ~2 kG than in the range ~3-7.5 kG, and the deficiency of slowly rotating Ap stars with field strengths between ~2 and ~3 kG.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Evolution of the Solar Active Region 13664</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On 2024 May 10/11, the strongest geomagnetic storm since November 2003 has occurred, with a peak Dst index of -412 nT. The storm was caused by NOAA Active Region (AR) 13664, which was the source of a large number of coronal mass ejections and flares, including 12 X-class flares. Starting from about May 7, AR 13664 showed a steep increase in its size and (free) magnetic energy, along with increased flare activity. In this study, we perform 3D magnetic field extrapolations with the NF2 nonlinear-force free code based on physics informed neural networks (Jarolim et al. 2023). In addition, we introduce the computation of the vector potential to achieve divergence-free solutions. We extrapolate vector magnetograms from SDO/HMI at the full 12 minute cadence from 2024 May 5-00:00 to 11-04:36 UT, in order to understand the active regions magnetic evolution and the large eruptions it produced. The computed change in magnetic energy and free magnetic energy shows a clear correspondence to the flaring activity. Regions of free magnetic energy and depleted magnetic energy indicate the flare origin and are in good correspondence with observations in Extreme Ultraviolet. Our results suggest that the modeled solar flares are related to significant topological reconfigurations. We provide a detailed analysis of the X4.0-class flare on May 10, where we show that the interaction between separated magnetic domains is directly linked to major flaring events. With this study, we provide a comprehensive data set of the magnetic evolution of AR 13664 and make it publicly available for further analysis.</description>

      <title>A Model for Flux Rope Formation and Disconnection in Pseudostreamer Coronal Mass Ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from pseudostreamers represent a significant fraction of large-scale eruptions from the Sun. In some cases, these CMEs take a narrow jet-like form reminiscent of coronal jets; in others, they have a much broader fan-shaped morphology like CMEs from helmet streamers. We present results from a magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a broad pseudostreamer CME. The early evolution of the eruption is initiated through a combination of breakout interchange reconnection at the overlying null point and ideal instability of the flux rope that forms within the pseudostreamer. This stage is characterised by a rolling motion and deflection of the flux rope toward the breakout current layer. The stretching out of the strapping field forms a flare current sheet below the flux rope; reconnection onset there forms low-lying flare arcade loops and the two-ribbon flare footprint. Once the CME flux rope breaches the rising breakout current layer, interchange reconnection with the external open field disconnects one leg from the Sun. This induces a whip-like rotation of the flux rope, generating the unstructured fan shape characteristic of pseudostreamer CMEs. Interchange reconnection behind the CME releases torsional Alfv\'en waves and bursty dense outflows into the solar wind. Our results demonstrate that pseudostreamer CMEs follow the same overall magnetic evolution as coronal jets, although they present different morphologies of their ejecta. We conclude that pseudostreamer CMEs should be considered a class of eruptions that are distinct from helmet-streamer CMEs, in agreement with previous observational studies.</description>

      <title>The inflated, eccentric warm Jupiter TOI-4914 b orbiting a metal-poor star, and the hot Jupiters TOI-2714 b and TOI-2981 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of giant planets have revealed unexpected bulk densities. Hot Jupiters, in particular, appear larger than expected for their masses compared to planetary evolution models, while warm Jupiters seem denser than expected. These differences are often attributed to the influence of the stellar incident flux, but could they also result from different planet formation processes? Is there a trend linking the planetary density to the chemical composition of the host star? In this work we present the confirmation of three giant planets in orbit around solar analogue stars. TOI-2714 b ($P \simeq 2.5$ d, $R_{\rm p} \simeq 1.22 R_{\rm J}$, $M_{\rm p} = 0.72 M_{\rm J}$) and TOI-2981 b ($P \simeq 3.6$ d, $R_{\rm p} \simeq 1.2 R_{\rm J}$, $M_{\rm p} = 2 M_{\rm J}$) are hot Jupiters on nearly circular orbits, while TOI-4914 b ($P \simeq 10.6$ d, $R_{\rm p} \simeq 1.15 R_{\rm J}$, $M_{\rm p} = 0.72 M_{\rm J}$) is a warm Jupiter with a significant eccentricity ($e = 0.41 \pm 0.02$) that orbits a star more metal-poor ([Fe/H]$~= -0.13$) than most of the stars known to host giant planets. Our radial velocity (RV) follow-up with the HARPS spectrograph allows us to detect their Keplerian signals at high significance (7, 30, and 23$\sigma$, respectively) and to place a strong constraint on the eccentricity of TOI-4914 b (18$\sigma$). TOI-4914 b, with its large radius and low insolation flux ($F_\star &lt; 2 \times 10^8~{\rm erg~s^{-1}~cm^{-2}}$), appears to be more inflated than what is supported by current theoretical models for giant planets. Moreover, it does not conform to the previously noted trend that warm giant planets orbiting metal-poor stars have low eccentricities. This study thus provides insights into the diverse orbital characteristics and formation processes of giant exoplanets, in particular the role of stellar metallicity in the evolution of planetary systems.</description>

      <title>On the dynamical evolution of Cepheid multiplicity in star clusters and its implications for B-star multiplicity at birth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical Cepheid variable stars provide a unique probe to binary evolution in intermediate-mass stars over the course of several tens to hundreds of Myr. We studied the binary and multiple properties of Cepheids, assuming that all mid-B stars form in binaries inside star clusters. The binaries were subjected both to stellar evolution and dynamical encounters with other stars in the cluster. The dynamical cluster environment results in a higher binary fraction among the Cepheids that remain in star clusters ($\approx 60$%) than among the Cepheids which have escaped to the field ($\approx 35$%). In clusters, the binary, triple, and multiple fraction decreases with increasing cluster mass. More massive clusters have binaries of shorter orbital periods than lower mass clusters and field Cepheids. Mergers are very common with $\approx 30$% of mid-B stars not evolving to Cepheids because of the interaction with their companion. Approximately $40$ % of Cepheids have merged with their companion, and the merger event impacts stellar evolution; the age of Cepheids expected from their mass can differ from the age of their host cluster. Our models predict that one in five Cepheids is the result of a merger between stars with mass below the lower mass limit for Cepheids; in clusters, these objects occur substantially later than expected from their mass. Approximately $3$ to $5$ % of all Cepheids have a compact companion ($\approx 0.15$ % of all Cepheids are accompanied by a black hole).
  The binary fraction derived from our simulations (42%) underestimates the observed binary Cepheid fraction by approximately a factor of 2. This suggests that the true multiplicity fraction of B-stars at birth could be substantially larger than unity and, thus, that mid-B stars may typically form in triple and higher order systems.</description>

      <title>Transit Timing Variation of K2-237b: Hints Toward Planet Disk Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters should initially form at considerable distances from host stars and subsequently migrate towards inner regions, supported directly by transit timing variation (TTV). We report the TTV of K2-237b, using reproduced timings fitted from \textit{Kepler} K2 and \textit{TESS} data. The timings span from 2016 to 2021, leading to an observational baseline of 5 years. The timing evolution presents a significant bias to a constant period scenario. The model evidence is evaluated utilizing the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), which favours the scenario of period decay with a $\Delta$BIC of 14.1. The detected TTV induces a period decay rate ($\dot{P}$) of -1.14$\pm$0.28$\times$10$^{-8}$ days per day ($-$0.36 s/year). Fitting the spectral energy distribution, we find infrared excess at the significance level of 1.5 $\sigma$ for WISE W1 and W2 bands, and 2 $\sigma$ level for W3 and W4 bands. This potentially reveals the existence of a stellar disk, consisting of hot dust at 800$\pm$300 K, showing a $L_{dust}/L_{\ast}$ of 5$\pm$3$\times$10$^{-3}$. We obtain a stellar age of 1.0$^{+1.4}_{-0.7}$$\times$10$^{9}$ yr from isochrone fitting. The properties of K2-237b potentially serve as a direct observational support to the planet disk migration though more observation are needed.</description>

      <title>The April 2023 SYM-H = -233 nT Geomagnetic Storm: A Classical Event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08118</link>

Abstract: The 23-24 April 2023 double-peak (SYM-H intensities of -179 and -233 nT) intense geomagnetic storm was caused by interplanetary magnetic field southward component Bs associated with an interplanetary fast-forward shock-preceded sheath (Bs of 25 nT), followed by a magnetic cloud (MC) (Bs of 33 nT), respectively. At the center of the MC, the plasma density exhibited an order of magnitude decrease, leading to a sub-Alfvenic solar wind interval for ~2.1 hr. Ionospheric Joule heating accounted for a significant part (~81%) of the magnetospheric energy dissipation during the storm main phase. Equal amount of Joule heating in the dayside and nightside ionosphere is consistent with the observed intense and global-scale DP2 (disturbance polar) currents during the storm main phase. The sub-Alfvenic solar wind is associated with disappearance of substorms, a sharp decrease in Joule heating dissipation, and reduction in electromagnetic ion cyclotron wave amplitude. The shock/sheath compression of the magnetosphere led to relativistic electron flux losses in the outer radiation belt between L* = 3.5 and 5.5. Relativistic electron flux enhancements were detected in the lower L* &lt; 3.5 region during the storm main and recovery phases. Equatorial ionospheric plasma anomaly structures are found to be modulated by the prompt penetration electric fields. Around the anomaly crests, plasma density at ~470 km altitude and altitude-integrated ionospheric total electron content are found to increase by ~60% and ~80%, with ~33% and ~67% increases in their latitudinal extents compared to their quiet-time values, respectively.</description>

      <title>The Retrieved Atmospheric Properties of the Sub-stellar Object VHS 1256 b from Analyzing HST, VLT and JWST Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the observed ~30% variations in flux from the L7 dwarf VHS 1256 b, we subjected its time-resolved Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFC3 spectra (measured in two epochs in 2018 and 2020), as well as medium-resolution Very Large Telescope (VLT) X-shooter and Early Release Science James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) spectra to a suite of both standard Bayesian (nested sampling) and machine-learning (random forest) retrievals. We find that both HST and VLT data require vertically varying abundance profiles of water in order to model the spectra accurately. Despite the large flux variations observed in the HST data, the temporal variability cannot be attributed to a single varying atmospheric property. The retrieved atmospheric quantities are consistent with being invariant across time. However, we find that model grids provide generally poor fits to the measured HST spectra and are unsuitable for quantifying the temporal variability of atmospheric properties. Additionally, our analysis of JWST spectra using model grids indicates consistency in retrieved properties across different wavelength channels. Despite the temporal variability in flux, the retrieved properties between HST and VLT, as well as between HST and JWST, are consistent within the respective posterior uncertainties. Such an outcome bodes well for future retrieval analyses of exoplanetary atmospheres, which are expected to exhibit weaker flux variations.</description>

      <title>Time Series of Magnetic Field Parameters of Merged MDI and HMI Space-Weather Active Region Patches as Potential Tool for Solar Flare Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05591v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solar flare prediction studies have been recently conducted with the use of Space-Weather MDI (Michelson Doppler Imager onboard Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) Active Region Patches (SMARP) and Space-Weather HMI (Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager onboard Solar Dynamics Observatory) Active Region Patches (SHARP), which are two currently available data products containing magnetic field characteristics of solar active regions. The present work is an effort to combine them into one data product, and perform some initial statistical analyses in order to further expand their application in space weather forecasting. The combined data are derived by filtering, rescaling, and merging the SMARP with SHARP parameters, which can then be spatially reduced to create uniform multivariate time series. The resulting combined MDI-HMI dataset currently spans the period between April 4, 1996, and December 13, 2022, and may be extended to a more recent date. This provides an opportunity to correlate and compare it with other space weather time series, such as the daily solar flare index or the statistical properties of the soft X-ray flux measured by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES). Time-lagged cross-correlation indicates that a relationship may exist, where some magnetic field properties of active regions lead the flare index in time. Applying the rolling window technique makes it possible to see how this leader-follower dynamic varies with time. Preliminary results indicate that areas of high correlation generally correspond to increased flare activity during the peak solar cycle.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of "Maia variables"</title>

Abstract: There are different classes of pulsating stars in the H-R diagram. While many of those classes are undisputed, some remain a mystery such as the objects historically called "Maia variables". Whereas the presence of such a class was suggested seven decades ago, no pulsational driving mechanism is known that could excite short-period oscillations in these late B to early A-type stars. Alternative hypotheses that would render the reports of variability of those stars erroneous have been proposed such as incorrect effective temperatures, binarity or rapid rotation, but no certain conclusions have been reached yet. Therefore the existence of these variables as a homogeneous class of pulsating star is still under discussion. Meanwhile, many new candidates of these variables have been claimed especially by using photometric observations of space telescopes. In this study, we examined 31 objects that are alleged members of this hypothetical group and carried out detailed spectroscopic and photometric analyses to test the proposed hypotheses for their cause of variability. The Teff, log g, v sin i, and chemical abundances of the targets were determined and the TESS photometric data were examined. As a result, we found that most of these targets are located inside the delta Scuti, beta Cep, or SPB star instability strips, a few show evidence for binarity and others for rapid rotation. We give arguments that none of the apparently rapid pulsations in our targets is caused by a star outside any known instability strip. By extrapolation, we argue that most stars proposed as pulsators outside well-established instability domains are misclassified. Hence there is no sufficient evidence justifying the existence of a class of pulsating stars formerly known as the "Maia variables".</description>

      <title>White dwarf eccentricity fluctuation and dissipation by AGB convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars with white dwarf companions have typical eccentricities $e\sim 10^{-6}-10^{-3}$. The eccentricities of helium white dwarfs are explained well by applying the fluctuation-dissipation theorem to convective eddies in their red giant progenitors. We extend this theory to more massive carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs with asymptotic giant branch (AGB) progenitors. Due to the radiation pressure in AGB stars, the dominant factor in determining the remnant white dwarf's eccentricity is the critical residual hydrogen envelope mass $m_{\rm env}$ required to inflate the star to giant proportions. Using a suite of MESA stellar evolution simulations with $\Delta m_{\rm c}=10^{-3}\,{\rm M}_\odot$ core-mass intervals, we resolved the AGB thermal pulses and found that the critical $m_{\rm env}\propto m_{\rm c}^{-6}$. The resulting eccentricity $e\sim 3\times 10^{-3}$ is almost independent of the remnant CO white dwarf's mass $m_{\rm c}$. Nearly all of the measured eccentricities lie below this robust theoretical limit, indicating that the eccentricity is damped during the common-envelope inspiral that follows the unstable Roche-lobe overflow of the AGB star. Specifically, we focused on white dwarfs with median masses $m_{\rm c}&gt;0.6\,{\rm M}_\odot$. These massive white dwarfs begin their inspiral with practically identical orbital periods and eccentricities, eliminating any dependence on the initial conditions. For this sub-sample, we find an empirical relation $e\propto P^{3/2}$ between the final period and eccentricity that is much tighter than previous studies - motivating theoretical work on the eccentricity evolution during the common envelope phase. The eccentricities of lower mass CO white dwarfs may be explained by alternative formation channels.</description>

      <title>CORINOS II. JWST-MIRI detection of warm molecular gas from an embedded, disk-bearing protostar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) observations of warm CO and H$_2$O gas in emission toward the low-mass protostar IRAS 15398-3359, observed as part of the CORINOS program. The CO is detected via the rovibrational fundamental band and hot band near 5 $\mu$m, whereas the H$_2$O is detected in the rovibrational bending mode at 6-8 $\mu$m. Rotational analysis indicates that the CO originates in a hot reservoir of $1598\pm118$ K, while the water is much cooler at $204\pm 7$ K. Neither the CO nor the H$_2$O line images are significantly spatially extended, constraining the emission to within $\sim$40 au of the protostar. The compactness and high temperature of the CO are consistent with an origin in the embedded protostellar disk, or a compact disk wind. In contrast, the water must arise from a cooler region and requires a larger emitting area (compared to CO) to produce the observed fluxes. The water may arise from a more extended part of the disk, or from the inner portion of the outflow cavity. Thus, the origin of the molecular emission observed with JWST remains ambiguous. Better constraints on the overall extinction, comparison with realistic disk models, and future kinematically-resolved observations may all help to pinpoint the true emitting reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Younger age for the oldest magnetic white dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sufficiently old white dwarfs cool down through a convective envelope that directly couples their degenerate cores to the surface. Magnetic fields may inhibit this convection by stiffening the criterion for convective instability. We consistently implemented the modified criterion in the stellar evolution code MESA, and computed the cooling of white dwarfs as a function of their mass and magnetic field $B$. In contrast to previous estimates, we find that magnetic fields can significantly change the cooling time $t$ even if they are relatively weak $B^2\ll 8\pi P$, where $P$ is the pressure at the edge of the degenerate core. Fields $B\gtrsim 1\textrm{ MG}$ open a radiative window that decouples the core from the convective envelope, effectively lowering the luminosity to that of a fully radiative white dwarf. We identified a population of observed white dwarfs that are younger by $\Delta t\sim$ Gyr than currently thought due to this magnetic inhibition of convective energy transfer - comparable to the cooling delay due to carbon-oxygen phase separation. In volume-limited samples, the frequency and strength of magnetic fields increase with age. Accounting for magnetic inhibition is therefore essential for accurate cooling models for cosmic chronology and for determining the origin of the magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>First Indication of Solar $^8$B Neutrino Flux through Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering in PandaX-4T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The PandaX-4T liquid xenon detector at the China Jinping Underground Laboratory is used to measure the solar $^8$B neutrino flux by detecting neutrinos through coherent scattering with xenon nuclei. Data samples requiring the coincidence of scintillation and ionization signals (paired), as well as unpaired ionization-only signals (US2), are selected with energy threshold of approximately 1.1 keV (0.33 keV) nuclear recoil energy. Combining the commissioning run and the first science run of PandaX-4T, a total exposure of 1.20 and 1.04 tonne$\cdot$year are collected for the paired and US2, respectively. After unblinding, 3 and 332 events are observed with an expectation of 2.8$\pm$0.5 and 251$\pm$32 background events, for the paired and US2 data, respectively. A combined analysis yields a best-fit $^8$B neutrino signal of 3.5 (75) events from the paired (US2) data sample, with $\sim$37\% uncertainty, and the background-only hypothesis is disfavored at 2.64$\sigma$ significance. This gives a solar $^8$B neutrino flux of ($8.4\pm3.1$)$\times$10$^6$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, consistent with the standard solar model prediction. It is also the first indication of solar $^8$B neutrino ``fog'' in a dark matter direct detection experiment.</description>
