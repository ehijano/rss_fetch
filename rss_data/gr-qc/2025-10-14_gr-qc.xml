      <title>The Gravitational Wave Memory from Binary Neutron Star Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave signal produced by the merger of two compact objects includes both an oscillatory transient and a non-oscillatory part, the so-called memory effect. This produces a permanent displacement of test masses and has not yet been measured. We use general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, including neutrinos, with several representative viable equations of state, to quantify--for the first time--the effects of the neutron star magnetic field, neutrino emission, and the ejected mass on the linear and nonlinear displacement memory in binary neutron star mergers. We find that the additional contributions due to the emission of electromagnetic radiation, neutrinos and baryonic ejecta can be ~15% of the total memory for moderate magnetic fields and up to ~50% for extreme magnetic fields. The memory is most affected by changes in the equation of state, the binary mass, and the magnetic field. In particular, for moderate premerger field strengths, the dominant impact of the electromagnetic field is the change in the gravitational wave luminosity, and the associated gravitational wave null memory, due to the unstable growth of the magnetic field and the resulting redistribution of angular momentum it induces in the remnant. While the direct electromagnetic contribution to the null memory is additive, the change in the gravitational wave null memory can--in some cases--result in the total memory being smaller than that from the corresponding nonmagnetized binary. Furthermore, in contrast to binary black hole mergers, the growth of the memory in binary neutron star mergers is extended due to the long emission timescale of electromagnetic fields, neutrinos, and ejecta. These results necessitate the consideration of the magnetic field, as well as the equation of state, for accurate parameter estimation in future analyses of gravitational wave memory data.</description>

      <title>Image of a quantum-corrected black hole without Cauchy horizons illuminated by a static thin accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latest advances in effective quantum gravity propose a quantum-corrected black hole solution that avoids Cauchy horizons. In this paper, we study the image of the black hole and explore the influence of the quantum parameter $\zeta$ on its image. First, we investigate the influence of $\zeta$ on the event horizon, photon sphere, critical impact parameter, and innermost stable circular orbit associated with the black hole. We find that all these quantities exhibit an increase with increasing $\zeta$. Meanwhile, we analyze the allowed range of $\zeta$ from both theoretical and observational perspectives. We then derive the photon trajectory equation and analyze briefly the behavior of the trajectories. A detailed analysis shows that as $\zeta$ increases, the photon trajectories near the event horizon undergo modifications. Finally, by plotting the optical appearance of the black hole under three emission models, we find that as $\zeta$ increases, the quantum-corrected black hole exhibits a larger shadow, along with a brightening of the bright rings and a reduction in the spacing between them near the critical impact parameter. Therefore, we can distinguish the quantum-corrected black hole from the Schwarzschild one by its unique optical appearance.</description>

      <title>Weyl symmetry without the traceless condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the requirement that the trace of the stress-energy tensor of matter must vanish if invariance under Weyl rescalings is a symmetry of a given gravitational theory, is not a general result but depends on the gravitational theory and on whether the matter action is form-invariant under Weyl rescalings or not. We focus on conformal general relativity with a Weyl form-invariant matter action. In this case, a linear dependence of the variations of the metric and of the Brans-Dicke scalar field arises, which is a direct consequence of invariance under infinitesimal Weyl rescalings. We demonstrate how to apply the variational procedure properly and obtain the correct equations of motion. It results that the Klein-Gordon type equation for the Brans-Dicke scalar coincides with the trace of the Einstein-type equation of motion. In consequence, any matter fields, no matter whether the trace of their stress-energy tensor vanishes or not, can be coupled to gravity. The phenomenological consequences of the modified result are drawn.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Love number of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10036v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tidal deformation of compact objects, characterised by their Love numbers, provides insights into the internal structure of neutron stars and black holes. While bosonic tidal Love numbers vanish for black holes in general relativity, it has been recently revealed that fermionic tidal perturbations can induce non-zero Love numbers for Kerr black holes. In this paper, we investigate the response of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole to the fermionic Weyl field. As a result, we find that the corresponding fermionic tidal Love numbers are also non-vanishing for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes except for the extremal ones, which highlights the universal distinct behavior of the fermionic tidal Love numbers compared to the bosonic counterparts.</description>

      <title>Constant Roll Inflationary Dynamics with Generalized Potentials in $f(R,\phi,X)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study early-time inflation within a class of $f(R, \phi, X)$ gravity models under a constant-roll condition. Employing a generalized potential of the form $V(\phi)^\sigma$, we derive expressions for the spectral index $n_s$ and tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, demonstrating that the inflationary dynamics are primarily governed by the parameter $\sigma$ and the shape of the potential. At the upper limit of $n_s$, we obtain a de Sitter-like phase, while at the lower limit, the model transitions to a quintessence-like phase through an effective oscillating equation of state parameter (EoS). Therefore, under the tuning parameter $\sigma &lt; 1$, the model exhibits a smooth transition from a de Sitter-like phase to a quintessence-like phase via the oscillating EoS parameter. The resulting predictions are consistent with recent observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), combined with CMB lensing and DESI BAO data.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Inspiral Transition and Induction to Plunge of a Compact Body in Equatorial Plane Around a Massive Kerr Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reconstructs the derivation process from the Kerr metric to the adiabatic inspiral, transition, and plunge regimes, aiming to highlight the details and logical connections often overlooked in previous derivations. The first half provides a comprehensive roadmap for readers familiar with advanced general relativity to follow the entire logic of the inspiral-transition-plunge regime from this paper alone. The second half addresses the discontinuity between the adiabatic inspiral and the plunge, including analyses and reinterpretations of the Ori-Thorne and Ori-Thorne-Kesden transition procedures, and proposes two new interpretations: a variant of the Kesden Y-correction and the Adiabatic Inspiral Perturbation-Induced Plunge. The paper also introduces the concept of the Most Stable Circular Orbit (MSCO) and analyzes its properties as a characteristic radius of Kerr black holes.</description>

      <title>Microlensing of non-singular black holes at finite size: a ray tracing approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the gravitational microlensing of various static and spherically symmetric non-singular black holes (and horizonless, non-singular compact objects of similar size). For pointlike sources we extend the parametrized post-Newtonian lensing framework to fourth order, whereas for extended sources we develop a ray tracing approach via a simple radiative transfer model. Modelling non-relativistic proper motion of the lens in front of a background star we record the apparent brightness as a function of time, resulting in a photometric lightcurve. Taking the star radius to smaller values, our numerical results approach the theoretical predictions for point-like sources. Compared to the Schwarzschild metric in an otherwise unmodified lensing geometry, we find that non-singular black hole models (and their horizonless, non-singular counterparts) at finite size tend to feature larger magnifications in microlensing lightcurves, contrary to the point-source prediction.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity of Causal Killing Vectors and Geometry of ADM Mass Minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address two problems concerning the ADM mass-minimizing initial data sets. First, we show that the equality case of the positive mass theorem embeds into a pp-wave spacetime. Second, we show that positive Bartnik mass minimizers embed into strongly stationary vacuum spacetimes, thereby confirming the Bartnik stationary vacuum conjecture. A key ingredient is a new monotonicity formula for the Lorentzian length of a causal Killing vector field, which, among other applications, yields a strong maximum principle for the length.</description>

      <title>Cosmological implications of LRS Bianchi type-I cosmological model in $f(T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the dynamical system analysis of the Locally Rotationally Symmetric (LRS) Bianchi type-I cosmological model in f(T) gravity in the presence of energy interaction . A cosmologically viable form of $f(T)$ is chosen (where $T$ is the torsion scalar in teleparallelism) in the background of homogenous and anisotropic. For our model, we take $f(T) = T+\zeta T^{2}$ where $\zeta$ is a constant. The evolution equations are reduced to the autonomous system of differential equations by suitable transformation of variables. The behaviour of the equilibrium points is examined by calculating the eigenvalues corresponding to these equilibrium points. We get four equilibrium points for our cosmological model out of which one equilibrium point is stable, two are saddle points and one is an unstable equilibrium point. Corresponding to equilibrium point $T_{2}$, our model is consistent with the quintessence dark energy cosmological model. Along the equilibrium points $T_{1},T_{3}$ and $T_{4}$, our model is consistent to phantom dark energy model. After that, we utilize the autonomous equations to analyse the cosmographic parameters along with the state-finder parameter. We demonstrate the phase plot analysis for our model.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Implications of Thermodynamic Split Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on initial work on the Thermodynamic Split Conjecture (TSC), which posits that black hole and cosmological horizon thermodynamics are generically inequivalent, we examine the consequences of that split for the Gibbons Hawking temperature and its role across cosmology. We consider many key results in both early and late universe cosmology and show that many important results such as those governing eternal inflation, vacuum tunneling, quantum breaking and primordial black holes can change. The analysis further reveals that small, TSC motivated corrections to horizon thermodynamics can subtly modify Friedmann dynamics, potentially helping to address the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. The work thus provides a unified route from quantum gravity motivated thermodynamics to observational cosmology and motivates dedicated tests of the thermal laws governing the Universe itself.</description>

      <title>Grey-body factors and absorption cross-sections of scalar and Dirac fields in the vicinity of dilaton-de Sitter black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of a massive scalar field and a massless Dirac field in the geometry of a dilaton--de Sitter black hole. Starting from the covariant perturbation equations, we derive the corresponding effective potentials and analyze their dependence on the dilaton charge, field mass, and cosmological constant. Using the WKB approximation, we compute the grey-body factors and study the associated absorption cross-sections. The results show that increasing the field mass or dilaton charge raises the effective potential barrier, leading to a suppression of transmission at low frequencies, while a larger cosmological constant lowers the barrier and enhances transmission. The partial absorption cross-sections for different multipole numbers display the expected oscillatory structure, with the lowest multipoles dominating at small frequencies. After summation over multipoles, the oscillations average out and the total cross-section interpolates between strong suppression in the infrared regime and the geometric capture limit at high frequencies. These findings provide a systematic description of scattering and absorption properties of dilaton--de Sitter black holes for both scalar and fermionic perturbations.</description>

      <title>Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints on space-time noncommutativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the implications of the modified dispersion relations, due to the noncommutativity of the spacetime, for a photon gas filling the early Universe in the framework of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) processes, during the period of light elements formation. We consider three types of deformations present in the dispersion relations for the radiation gas, from which we obtain the low temperature corrections to the energy density and pressure. The cosmological implications of the modified equations of state in the BBN era are explored in detail for all radiation models. The effects induced on the nucleosynthesis process by spacetime noncommutativity are investigated by evaluating the abundances of relic nuclei (Hydrogen, Deuterium, Helium-3, Helium-4, and Lithium-7). The primordial mass fraction estimates and their deviations due to changes in the freezing temperature impose an upper limit on the energy density of the deformed photon gas, which follows from the modified Friedmann equations. The deviations from the standard energy density of the radiative plasma are therefore constrained by the abundances of the Helium-4 nuclei. Upper limits on the free parameters of the spacetime noncommutativity are obtained via a numerical analysis performed using the \texttt{PRyMordial} software package. The primordial abundances of the light elements are obtained by evaluating the thermonuclear reaction rates for the considered noncommutative spacetime models. An MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) analysis allows to obtain restrictions on the free parameters of the modified dispersion relations. The numerical and statistical approach is implemented in the python code \texttt{PRyNCe}, available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Thermal gravitational waves from warm inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time, the possibility of generation of thermal gravitational waves from warm inflation is investigated with cosmic microwave background. Gravitons produced from the quantum fluctuations during warm inflation are found to carry the thermal features if they exist in a thermal squeezed vacuum state. Thermal squeezing reduces the amplitude of the BB mode angular power spectrum of CMB when compared with the conventional cold inflation. This work inspects the thermal nature of tensor power spectrum from warm inflation and the relevance of quantum fluctuations over the thermal fluctuations. The dust corrected lensed BB modes from joint analysis of $Planck$ and BICEP2/$Keck$ for warm inflation provide compelling evidence for the existence of thermal gravitons.</description>

      <title>Mass-Centered GCM Framework in Perturbations of Kerr(-Newman)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear stability problem for black hole solutions of the Einstein equations critically depends on choosing an appropriate geometric gauge. In the vacuum setting, the use of Generally Covariant Modulated (GCM) spheres and hypersurfaces has played a central role in the proof of stability for slowly rotating Kerr spacetime. In this work, we develop an alternative GCM framework, that we call mass-centered, designed to overcome the breakdown of the standard GCM construction in the charged case, where electromagnetic-gravitational coupling destroys the exceptional behavior of the $\ell=1$ mode of the center-of-mass quantity used in the vacuum analysis. This construction is aimed at the nonlinear stability of Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr-Newman spacetimes. Our approach replaces transport-based control of the center-of-mass quantity with a sphere-wise vanishing condition on a renormalized $\ell=1$ mode, yielding mass-centered GCM hypersurfaces with modified gauge constraints. The resulting elliptic-transport system remains determined once an $\ell=1$ basis is fixed via effective uniformization and provides an alternative construction in vacuum in the uncharged limit.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Maxwell Equations on Mass-Centered GCM Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The resolution of the nonlinear stability of black holes as solutions to the Einstein equations relies crucially on imposing the right geometric gauge conditions. In the vacuum case, the use of Generally Covariant Modulated (GCM) spheres and hypersurfaces has been successful in the proof of stability for slowly rotating Kerr spacetime. For the charged setting, our companion paper introduced an alternative mass-centered GCM framework, adapted to the additional difficulties of the Einstein-Maxwell system.
  In this work, we solve the Einstein-Maxwell equations on such a mass-centered spacelike GCM hypersurface, which is equivalent to solving the constraint equations there. We control all geometric quantities of the solution in terms of some seed data, corresponding to the gauge-invariant fields describing coupled gravitational-electromagnetic radiation in perturbations of Reissner-Nordstr\"om or Kerr-Newman, first identified by the second author and expected to be governed by favorable hyperbolic equations. This provides the first step toward controlling gauge-dependent quantities in the nonlinear stability analysis of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr-Newman families.</description>

      <title>Spinning into Quantum Geometry: Dirac and Wheeler-DeWitt Dynamics from Stochastic Helicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin networks in loop quantum gravity provide a kinematical picture of quantum geometry but lack a natural mechanism for dynamical Dirac-type evolution, while the Wheeler--DeWitt equation typically enters only as an imposed constraint. We propose a stochastic framework in which each spin-network edge carries helicity-resolved amplitudes -- two-state internal labels that undergo Poisson-driven flips. The resulting coupled master equations, after analytic continuation and the introduction of a fundamental length scale, generate Dirac-type dynamics on discrete geometry. At long times, the same process relaxes to helicity-symmetric equilibrium states, which are shown to satisfy a Wheeler--DeWitt-type condition. In this way, both quantum evolution and the gravitational constraint emerge within a single probabilistic framework. Our approach thus provides a background-independent and stochastic route to quantum geometry, offering an alternative to canonical quantization and a fresh perspective on the problem of time.</description>

      <title>Detecting gravitational waves with spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of gravitational waves has opened a new window into the Universe through gravitational-wave astronomy. However, high-frequency gravitational waves remain undetected. In this work, we propose that spin systems can be employed to detect gravitational waves in this unexplored frequency regime. We derive the spin's response to gravitational waves and identify three distinct effects: the well-known Gertsenshtein effect, a metric-induced interaction, and the gravitational spin Hall effect. We focus on nuclear spins and utilize nuclear magnetic resonance to enhance the gravitational response, leveraging the advantages of long coherence time, high polarization, and a small gyromagnetic ratio. The proposed experimental scheme is capable of probing gravitational waves in the kilohertz to gigahertz range, with projected sensitivities reaching $\sqrt{S_h}\approx10^{-20}~\mathrm{Hz}^{-1/2}$.</description>

      <title>A novel quantum memory effect and thermal modulation in graviton-mediated entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in probing the quantum nature of gravity is to distinguish effects that are genuinely quantum from those that can be explained classically. In this work, we study how quantized gravitational waves interact with thermal quantum systems, modeled as harmonic oscillators. We show that, unlike classical waves, quantized gravitons generate entanglement and leave behind a persistent ``graviton-induced quantum memory'' even after the wave has passed. This effect is further shaped by the presence of thermal noise, which does not simply wash out quantum correlations but can in fact amplify them in distinctive ways. Our analysis reveals clear signatures - such as nonlinear thermal corrections and a prethermal time-crystal-like phase-that cannot arise from any classical treatment. These results identify experimentally relevant markers of gravitons and provide a framework for exploring how finite-temperature environments may help uncover the quantum nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing and resampling: a guide to utilising posterior samples from gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA (LVK) gravitational-wave observatories have opened new scientific research in astrophysics, fundamental physics, and cosmology. The collaborations that build and operate these observatories release the interferometric strain data as well as a catalogue of observed signals with accompanying Bayesian posterior distributions. These posteriors, in the form of equally-weighted samples, form a dataset that is used by a multitude of further analyses seeking to constrain the population of merging black holes, identify lensed pairs of signals, and much more. However, many of these analyses rely, often implicitly, on the ability to reconstruct the likelihood and prior from the inputs to the analysis and apply resampling (a statistical technique to generate new samples varying the underlying analysis assumptions). In this work, we first provide a guide on how to reconstruct and modify the posterior density accurately from the inputs for analyses performed with the Bilby inference library. We then demonstrate and compare resampling techniques to produce new posterior sample sets and discuss Pareto-smoothing to improve the efficiency. Finally, we provide examples of how to use resampling to study observed gravitational-wave signals. We hope this guide provides a useful resource for those wishing to use open data products from the LVK for gravitational-wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Cyclic universe and uniform rate inflation in loop quantum cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate uniform rate inflationary universe in the framework of Loop quantum cosmology. The potential for uniform rate inflation in a loop quantized FRW spacetime turns out to be a polymerized version of the corresponding potential in general relativity, which mimics the potentials for a polymerized scalar field and that for hybrid natural inflation (HNI). The potential leads to a cyclic universe with identical epochs separated by quantum bounces which replace the classical singularity. The energy density and Hubble rate are bounded. The predictions for cosmological perturbations depend on the value of the field at the end of inflation. The parameter space is explored to compare the results for spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio with observational constraints.</description>

      <title>P-V Criticality and Microstructure of Hayward Black Holes in Anti-de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the $P$-$V$ criticality and Ruppeiner geometry in the extended phase space of Hayward anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes. Through thermodynamic analysis, we confirm that Hayward-AdS black holes undergo distinct $P$-$V$ phase transitions and exhibit well-defined critical phenomena in the vicinity of their critical points. These behaviors are characterized by four critical exponents that typically obey the scaling laws predicted by mean-field theory--indicating a consistent thermodynamic framework with classical phase transition systems ($e.g.,$ van der Waals fluids). Furthermore, we employ Ruppeiner geometry to probe the thermodynamic fluctuations of Hayward-AdS black holes, and by calculating the corresponding curvature scalar, we gain direct insights into the interaction nature of the black hole's microscopic constituents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Penrose process of energy extraction in the context of rotating regular black holes. For the Neves-Saa class of regular black hole solutions, which includes the Bardeen, Hayward and Fan-Wang spacetimes as special cases, the extraction efficiency is bounded above by the known value for Kerr spacetime. However, in the case of a new rotating regular black hole which does not have a Schwarzschild singular limit for zero rotation, the extraction efficiency can indeed become very large, as shown in our analysis here.</description>

      <title>Charged wormholes can be long-lived</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes suffer from an unstable radial mode. Here we investigate the evolution of the unstable mode(s) for charged wormholes. We show that the instability remains in the presence of charge, but exhibits a very fast decrease to zero, suggesting that wormholes that approach a near-extremal metric could be long-lived. For so-called supercritical wormholes, two purely imaginary unstable modes merge and continue with degenerate imaginary parts and opposite real parts. By analogy, we conjecture an analogous behavior for rotating wormholes.</description>

      <title>Exponential Suppression of the Unruh Effect and Geometric Enhancement in a Fermionic Cavity QED Setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Unruh effect -- the prediction that an accelerated observer perceives the vacuum as a thermal bath -- remains one of the most profound yet experimentally unverified consequences of quantum field theory. This work analyzes the decay of an excited state within a uniformly accelerated cavity to explain the historical null results and identify an alternative measurable signature. We model a massless Dirac field confined to a uniformly accelerated cavity, coupled to an external massive Dirac field of mass $M$. Our analysis reveals that for fundamental particles with mass $M$, the condition $Mc^2 \gg \hbar a/c$ is satisfied for all achievable accelerations, placing the system in an exponentially suppressed decay regime ($\Gamma_{\text{acc}} \sim e^{-2Mc^2/(\hbar a/c)}$) that holds universally across all cavity sizes, explaining why direct observation of Unruh effects has remained elusive. However, for intermediate-sized cavities ($a l\sim c^2$) with light external fields ($Mc^2 \ll \hbar a/c$), we identify a geometric enhancement of the decay rate, scaling as $\Gamma_{\text{acc}}\sim \Gamma_{\text{in}} \frac{a l/c^2}{\ln(1+a l/c^2)}$ (with $\Gamma_{\text{in}}$ the inertial decay rate), which arises from non-inertial acceleration effects rather than thermal stimulation. This geometric enhancement, reaching up to 26\% for realistic parameters ($a\sim 10^{20}~\text{m/s}^2$, $l\sim 100-500~\mu\text{m}$), provides a measurable signature accessible through quantum simulation platforms. Our results provide a unified theoretical framework that explains historical null results while offering a viable path toward detecting non-inertial quantum effects in accelerated systems. </description>

      <title>Non-exotic wormholes in $f(R,L_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present analysis, we examine the potential existence of generalized wormhole models within the framework of newly developed extended $f(R,L_m)$ gravity. We investigate both a linear model, $f(R,L_m)=\alpha R+\beta L_m$, and a non-linear model, $f(R,L_m)=\frac{R}{2}+ L^\alpha_m$, to analyze traversable wormholes. By employing the variational approach, we derive modified versions of the field equations under the influence of an anisotropic matter source. A power-law shape function is applied, resulting in a linear equation of state for both radial and lateral pressures. Furthermore, we explore solutions characterized by a variable equation of state parameter. It was observed that the violation of energy conditions is influenced by the parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. A wide range of non-exotic wormhole solutions was discovered, dependent on the specific parameters of the model. We demonstrate that wormholes with power-law shape functions yield solutions that comply with the energy conditions in both linear and non-linear forms of $f(R, L_m)$. It is shown that the non-exotic wormhole solutions obtained within this framework are not isotropic.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave echos from physical black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave echos from the coalescence of black hole binaries are often viewed as signals beyond general relativity or standard model. In this work, we show that these echos are inevitable in the black holes coalescence described by standard general relativity. This is because it is the physical black holes formed through gravitational collapse serve as the true description of astronomical black holes. For physical black holes, only their asymptotic structure before the horizon forms are detectible to the outside probes. Here, by investigating the scattering of a gravitational wave burst on a physical black hole and pay special attention to the echos in the waveform, we uncover distinct features of the echos both in the time and frequency domains.</description>

      <title>Note on Kaniadakis Holographic Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that any modification to the entropy expression not only change the energy density of the holographic dark energy, but also modifies the cosmological field equations through thermodynamics-gravity correspondence. Here we revisit the Kaniadakis holographic dark energy (KHDE) in the background of the modified Kaniadakis cosmology by incorporating the effects of Kaniadakis entropy into the Friedmann equations. We choose the Hubble radius, $L=H^{-1}$, as system's IR cutoff and determine the cosmological implications of this model. We first consider a dark energy (DE) dominated universe and reveal that this model mimics the cosmological constant with $w_{DE}=-1$. This implies that the theoretical origin of the cosmological constant, $\Lambda$, may be understood through KHDE in the context of Kaniadakis cosmology. Remarkably, we observe that in the absence of interaction between DE and dark matter (DM), and in contrast to HDE in standard cosmology, our model can explain the current acceleration of the cosmic expansion for the Hubble radius as IR cutoff. When the interaction between DE and DM is taken into account, we see that the total equation of state parameter (EoS), $w_{tot}=p_{tot}/\rho_{tot}$ can cross the phantom line at the present time. We also analyze the squared speed of sound, $v_s^2$, for this model and find out that $(v_s^2&lt;0)$ for interacting KHDE. Investigating the statefinder, confirms the distinction between KHDE and $\Lambda$CDM model. It is seen that the statefinder diagram move away from the point of $\left\lbrace r,s\right\rbrace= \left\lbrace 1,0\right\rbrace$ with increasing the interaction parameter.</description>

      <title>Scattering and Absorption of Standard Model Fields by Brane-Localized Schwarzschild--de Sitter Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation and absorption of Standard Model fields -- scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac -- on a 3+1-dimensional brane embedded in a higher-dimensional Schwarzschild--de Sitter (SdS) spacetime. Using the effective four-dimensional projection of the Tangherlini metric, we compute grey-body factors (GBFs) and absorption cross-sections for each spin sector by means of the sixth-order WKB method and, independently, via the recently proposed correspondence between quasinormal modes (QNMs) and transmission coefficients. The results demonstrate that the cosmological constant and field mass crucially affect the transmission probabilities: increasing $\Lambda$ lowers the potential barrier and enhances the transparency of the geometry, while a larger field mass $\mu$ suppresses low-frequency emission and shifts the absorption spectrum to higher energies. For all fields, the QNM--GBF correspondence proves reliable to within about one percent for multipoles $\ell \ge 2$, while the correspondence remains less accurate for the lowest multipoles. The total absorption cross-sections exhibit the expected transition from the low-frequency suppression to the geometric-optics regime. Overall, these findings provide quantitative insight into the interplay between dimensionality, cosmological expansion, and black-hole radiation on the brane.</description>

      <title>Hybridization of second-order gravitational self-force and numerical relativity waveforms for quasi-circular and non-spinning black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past few decades, the waveform community has made advances in producing waveforms that span the inspiral-merger-ringdown of comparable-mass-ratio black hole binaries using advances in post-Newtonian and numerical relativity (NR) theory along with state-of-the-art gravitational wave models. Current methods in NR have shown progress towards producing stable simulations reaching mass ratios of 1:100; however, the computational cost becomes prohibitively expensive as the mass ratio and the length of the simulation increases. Meanwhile, the gravitational self-force (GSF) community has developed waveform models that not only generate extreme mass ratio inspiral waveforms, but also generate near-equal-mass-ratio waveforms with high fidelity. To assess the limits of both the GSF and NR waveforms and alleviate the computational costs of NR, we present hybridized GSF-NR waveforms for non-spinning binary black hole systems in which GSF provides the inspiral, and NR the merger and ringdown. The hybrid waveforms are generated from a set of 68 non-spinning NR waveforms from the SXS catalogue with mass ratios spanning 1:1 to 1:20 and include the (2,2), (2,1), (3,3), (3,2), (4,4), (4,3), and (5,5) spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes. In this paper, we will highlight a selection of these hybrid waveforms and examine the error in the hybridization procedure. We will investigate the impact of subdominant modes on the accuracy of the hybrid waveforms by performing mismatch comparisons with surrogate models. To address the feasibility of hybridizing GSF inspirals with short, high-mass ratio NR waveforms, thereby alleviating computational costs, we will discuss the relationship between mass ratio and the placement of the matching window, which can be used to predict the necessary and optimal number of NR cycles that contribute to the hybrid waveform.</description>

      <title>Elusive Plunges and Heavy Intermediate-mass-ratio Inspirals from Single and Binary Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most massive galaxies in the Universe also host the largest supermassive black holes (SMBHs), with masses of $10^9 \: \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ and above. During their hierarchical assembly, these galaxies have experienced only a few major mergers at low redshift, but have accreted many low-mass galaxies across cosmic time, possibly hosting intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs). If some of these IMBHs migrate to the galactic center, they may form compact subsystems around the central SMBH. We investigate the evolution of such subsystems, consisting of ten $10^5 \: \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ IMBHs at three different concentrations around a $10^9 \: \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ SMBH. We evolve these systems both in isolation and in the presence of a companion SMBH, using \texttt{MSTAR}, a regularized integration method including relativistic effects up to post-Newtonian order 3.5PN. Our analysis focuses on gravitational--wave--driven intermediate--mass--ratio inspirals (heavy IMRIs) and direct plunges. We show that perturbations from a secondary SMBH enhance the number of IMBH direct plunges by more than a factor of two, making them the dominant merger channel. These plunges and IMRIs with a central $10^9 \: \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ SMBH will contribute to SMBH growth but will likely evade detection with future gravitational-wave interferometers and pulsar timing arrays (PTAs). However, for galaxies with lower--mass SMBHs ($M_\bullet \lesssim 10^8 \:\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$), heavy IMRIs will be detectable with the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) and can provide direct observational constraints on the existence of IMBHs, while the more numerous plunges will still remain hidden.</description>

      <title>Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients as "Failed" Gravitational Wave Sources: Helium Core$-$Black Hole Mergers Following Delayed Dynamical Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binaries in which a massive donor star undergoes an extended ($\gtrsim$ kyr) phase of stable mass transfer onto a black hole (BH) accretor offer a promising channel for creating LIGO gravitational wave sources. However, in many systems the mass transfer terminates prematurely in a dynamical instability at orbital periods of a few days, culminating in the BH plunging into the donor and potentially disrupting and accreting its helium core at highly super-Eddington rates. Combining a suite of binary evolution models with analytic estimates and population synthesis, we predict the population of luminous transients from delayed dynamical instability (DDI) and attribute them to the "luminous" class of fast blue optical transients (LFBOTs). The initial plunge of the BH into the partially stripped envelope typically ejects $\sim 10M_{\odot}$ of H/He-enriched material at speeds $\sim 10^{2}-10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$, generating a compact circumstellar medium (CSM) of radius $\lesssim 1000R_{\odot}$ by the time the BH meets and tidally disrupts the HeC. Rapid BH accretion generates a highly aspherical wind-driven explosion into the environment, powering UV/optical emission via CSM interaction and X-ray reprocessing that rises over a few days to a luminosity $\sim 10^{44}-10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ before fading as the disk spreads outwards and accretion rate drops. Luminous radio/sub-mm emission is generated over several months as the jet collides with the slow quasi-spherical binary outflow, generated by the stable mass transfer preceding DDI, extending to radii $\sim 10^{17}$ cm, in agreement with the inferred CSM environments of LFBOTs. We estimate local rates of DDI merger transients $5-300$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$, with a preference for low-metallicities, in agreement with LFBOT demographics. Taken together, our results support LFBOTs as being luminous signposts of "failed" gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Literature Review of Machine Learning Techniques for Observational Constraints in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic literature review focusing on the application of machine learning techniques for deriving observational constraints in cosmology. The goal is to evaluate and synthesize existing research to identify effective methodologies, highlight gaps, and propose future research directions. Our review identifies several key findings: (1) various machine learning techniques, including Bayesian neural networks, Gaussian processes, and deep learning models, have been applied to cosmological data analysis, improving parameter estimation and handling large datasets. However, models achieving significant computational speedups often exhibit worse confidence regions compared to traditional methods, emphasizing the need for future research to enhance both efficiency and measurement precision. (2) Traditional cosmological methods, such as those using Type Ia Supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic microwave background data, remain fundamental, but most studies focus narrowly on specific datasets. We recommend broader dataset usage to fully validate alternative cosmological models. (3) The reviewed studies mainly address the $H_0$ tension, leaving other cosmological challenges-such as the cosmological constant problem, warm dark matter, phantom dark energy, and others-unexplored. (4) Hybrid methodologies combining machine learning with Markov chain Monte Carlo offer promising results, particularly when machine learning techniques are used to solve differential equations, such as Einstein Boltzmann solvers, as prior to Markov chain Monte Carlo models, accelerating computations while maintaining precision. (5) There is a significant need for standardized evaluation criteria and methodologies, as variability in training processes and experimental setups complicates result comparability and reproducibility (abridged).</description>

      <title>Accretion onto Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m naked singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearly every galactic core contains a supermassive compact object, hypothesized to be a Kerr black hole. It was only with the advent of Event Horizon Telescope observations that the predictions of this hypothesis could be observationally tested for our own Galaxy, and the nearby elliptical M87, on spatial scales comparable to the gravitational radius. At the same time it became possible to test whether alternatives such as naked singularities in general relativity, or similar objects in alternative theories of gravity, are excluded by the data. These and other observational developments renewed interest in non-Kerr spacetime metrics, also in the context of active galactic nuclei at cosmological distances. Recently, we have shown that accreting naked singularities in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m metric of general relativity tend to produce strong outflows. The geometry and origin of these winds is studied here, and their parameter dependence is investigated. To this end we performed numerical GR hydrodynamical simulations of accretion of electrically neutral matter in the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m metric and discussed the results in the context of analytic predictions of fluid motion in this spacetime.</description>

      <title>Detection of Earth's free oscillations utilizing TianQin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The measurement of Earth's free oscillations plays an important role in studying the Earth's large-scale structure. Space technology development presents a potential method to observe these normal modes by measuring inter-satellite distances. However, the disturbance from the Earth's low-degree gravity field makes it challenging for low Earth orbit gravity measurement satellites such as Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and TianQin-2 to extract signals from Earth's free oscillations directly. Here, we propose that by taking advantage of the high Earth orbit, the TianQin satellites can effectively avoid this disturbance, enabling direct measurement of Earth's free oscillations. We derive an analytical waveform to describe the response of Earth's free oscillations in TianQin. Based on this waveform, we use Bayesian analysis to extract the normal modes from numerical simulation data and perform parameter estimation. Our findings reveal that for a magnitude 7.9, Wenchuan-like earthquake, the resulting free oscillations will generate a signal that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 73 in TianQin, and approximately 9 different modes can be distinguished. This result shows TianQin can open a new window to examine the Earth's free oscillations and study the Earth's interior and earthquakes independently from ground-based gravity measurement.</description>

      <title>Thermal Deformations in Super-Eddington Magnetized Neutron Stars: Implications for Continuous Gravitational-Wave Detectability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating neutron stars (NSs) are promising targets for continuous gravitational-wave (CGW) searches with current and next-generation ground-based GW detectors. In this Letter, we present the first study of thermal deformations in super-Eddington magnetized NSs with column accretion, where magnetic fields induce anisotropic heat conduction that leads to crustal temperature asymmetries. We compute the resulting mass quadrupole moments and estimate the associated CGW strain amplitudes. Our results show that Galactic magnetized NSs undergoing super-Eddington column accretion can emit detectable CGWs in upcoming observatories. Assuming a 2-yr coherent integration, the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer could detect such CGW signals from rapidly spinning NSs with spin periods $P \lesssim 20\,\rm ms$, while the LIGO O5 run may detect systems with $P \lesssim 6 \,{\rm ms}$. These findings suggest that super-Eddington magnetized NSs could represent a new class of CGW sources, providing a unique opportunity to probe the NS crust and bridge accretion physics with GW astronomy.</description>

      <title>Metallic transports from Taub-NUT AdS black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute holographic DC conductivity associated with the Taub-NUT-$AdS_4$ black holes following the probe D-brane approach. In particular, we examine the effects of frame dragging on charge transport in both low and high temperature regimes. Our analysis reveals that in the low temperature regime, the conductivity is sensitive to the presence of the Misner string that causes frame dragging. Notably, the increase in the conductivity near the Misner string is sharper as compared to points farther away from it. On the other hand, in the high temperature regime, the effects due to frame dragging are significantly suppressed, and the thermal contribution to the charge transport takes over that due to the U(1) charge carriers.</description>

      <title>Integrability in Three-Dimensional Gravity: Eigenfunction-Forced KdV Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover a direct connection between three-dimensional gravity with chiral boundary conditions and a class of forced integrable systems. Starting from the Chern-Simons formulation, we derive consistent boundary conditions on a non-compact spatial slice, leading to boundary dynamics described by the potential modified KdV hierarchy. The dynamics reduce to a forced KdV equation, where the forcing term is determined self-consistently by the eigenfunctions of the associated Schr\"{o}dinger operator. Using the inverse scattering transform, the reflectionless sector is solved via the Gelfand-Levitan-Marchenko method, while the radiative sector exhibits universal dispersive decay. This framework unifies AdS$_3$ boundary dynamics with integrable hierarchies and elucidates the roles of solitons and radiation in the dual conformal field theory.</description>

Abstract: Freelance holography program is an extension of the gauge/gravity correspondence in which the boundary theory can reside on any timelike codimension-one surface in AdS space, and the boundary conditions on the bulk fields can be chosen arbitrarily. Freelance holography provides the framework for a systematic study of various boundary conditions and associated bulk geometries. In this work, we analyze in detail the AdS$_3$ freelance holography. One can explicitly solve for the bulk AdS$_3$ Einstein gravity equations of motion. For generic boundary conditions, the solutions are described by two arbitrary functions of one variable. We study holographic renormalization group (RG) flows, the interpolation between different boundary conditions at different boundaries and associated surface charges and their algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crucial role of hydrodynamic instabilities in soliton field theory is revealed. We demonstrate that the essential of soliton formation mechanism is the sound mode instability induced by thermodynamic instability. This instability triggers phase separation, where new thermal phases are generated to produce solitons. These solitons can be regarded as a coexistence state composed of a matter phase and a vacuum phase, with an interface proving surface tension to maintain dynamical equilibrium. The phase separation mechanism naturally allows the existence of vacuum bubbles, characterized by a vacuum phase surrounded by a matter phase with negative pressure. Furthermore, we show that the soliton interface resemble a fluid membrane, whose interface pressure satisfies a Young-Laplace-type relation, resulting in the emergence of the membrane instability induced by surface tension. In the thin-wall limit, the dispersion relation is analytically derived. This instability triggers topological transition of the interface, splitting a cylindrical interface into multiple spheres with a smaller total surface area. Such results highlight the duality between solitons and fluids.</description>

      <title>Updated constraints on interacting dark energy: A comprehensive analysis using multiple CMB probes, DESI DR2, and supernovae observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements, combined with Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data and DESY5 type Ia supernova (SN) data, indicate a significant deviation from $\Lambda$CDM, which seems to suggest that this deviation can be explained by an interaction between dark energy and dark matter. In this work, we perform a comprehensive analysis by utilizing the latest DESI DR2 BAO data in conjunction with CMB data from ACT, SPT, Planck, and WMAP, along with SN data from PantheonPlus and DESY5. We consider four interacting dark energy (IDE) models with different forms of the interaction term $Q$. Our analysis indicates that CMB experiments other than Planck enhance the evidence for an interaction in the IDE models with $Q \propto \rho_{\rm de}$. In particular, when using the SPT+DESI+DESY5 data, the IDE model with $Q = \beta H_0 \rho_{\rm de}$ gives $\beta = -0.4170 \pm 0.1220$, with a deviation from zero reaching $3.4\sigma$ level. When replacing DESY5 with PantheonPlus, this deviation weakens to $2.1\sigma$ level, but remains relatively significant. Furthermore, the Bayes factors of the IDE model with $Q = \beta H_0 \rho_{\rm de}$ are positive in all cases, providing a moderate-to-strong preference over $\Lambda$CDM. Overall, our comprehensive analysis clearly suggests that the IDE models with $Q \propto \rho_{\rm de}$ (especially, $Q = \beta H_0 \rho_{\rm de}$) provide strong evidence supporting the existence of interaction and are more preferred by the current cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Islands in Simulated Cosmos: Probing the Hubble Flow around Groups and Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local Hubble flow offers a powerful laboratory to study the interplay between cosmic expansion and gravitational dynamics. On large scales, galaxy velocities follow Hubble's law, but within groups and clusters local gravitational effects introduce significant departures from linearity. Using the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations, we investigate whether dark energy leaves detectable imprints on the local velocity-radius relation. We model the kinematics with extensions of the Lemaitre-Tolman framework and apply Bayesian inference to recover halo masses and the Hubble constant H0. The fits reveal systematic biases: halo masses are underestimated with a median ratio $M_{fit}/M_{true} = 0.95 \pm 0.28$, while the inferred Hubble constant clusters around $H_0 = 64 \pm 16 km/s/Mpc$, compared to the simulation input of 67.74. This corresponds to an average 25\% uncertainty in H0 recovery from the local flow method. While the mass and expansion rate can be constrained, different model variants whether including angular momentum, friction, or altered radial scaling-remain statistically indistinguishable. Our results highlight both the promise and the limitations of using local kinematics as a precision probe of dark energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are a compelling dark matter candidate and a unique probe of small-scale cosmological fluctuations. Their formation is usually attributed to large positive curvature perturbations, which collapse upon Hubble re-entry during radiation domination. In this work we investigate instead the role of negative curvature perturbations, corresponding to the growth of primordial void (PV) like regions. Using numerical relativity simulations, we show that sufficiently deep PV can undergo a nonlinear rebounce at the center, generating an effective overdensity that eventually collapses into a PBH. We determine the critical threshold for this process for a variety of equations of state, and demonstrate that the resulting black holes obey a scaling relation analogous to the standard overdensity case. These results establish primordial voids as a novel channel for PBH formation and highlight their potential impact on PBH abundances and cosmological signatures.</description>

      <title>Hints of Dark Matter Spikes in Low-mass X-ray Binaries: a critical assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three black-hole low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in the Milky Way show rates of period decay which cannot be easily explained by standard mechanisms. Recently, it has been claimed that the anomalous period decays in two of these systems may be explained by dynamical friction due to very high dark matter (DM) densities around the black holes. We critically assess these claims by performing $N$-body simulations of binaries embedded in dense DM ``spikes". We simulate the previously-studied systems XTE J1118+480 and A0620--00, as well as studying the third binary Nova Muscae 1991 for the first time in this context. These simulations show that feedback on the DM distribution plays a crucial role and we rule out previously-claimed shallow DM spikes. We set lower limits on the steepness $\gamma$ of DM density profiles required to explain the period decay in these LMXBs, requiring $\gamma \gtrsim 2.15-2.20$ in XTE J1118+480 and A0620--00 and $\gamma \gtrsim 2.3$ in Nova Muscae 1991. Improved modeling of the long-term evolution of binaries embedded in DM spikes may allow us to exclude even larger densities in future.</description>

      <title>GraviGUT unification with revisited Pati-Salam model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a graviGUT unification scheme based on the simple orthogonal group $\mathrm{SO}(1,9 ,\mathbb{C})$ that resolves the chiral duplication of weak isospin in Pati--Salam models. In the conventional $SU(4)\times SU(2)_+\times SU(2)_-$ framework, the unobserved second chiral $SU(2)$ is typically removed by ad hoc high-energy scale breaking. Here we instead \emph{geometrize} it: one $SU(2)$ factor is identified with a chiral half of the Lorentz group, so it belongs to gravity rather than to an additional weak force. This identification becomes natural inside $\mathrm{SO}(1,9 ,\mathbb{C})$, where the algebra decomposes as $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)_{\mathbb{C}}\oplus\mathfrak{so}(6)_{\mathbb{C}}\oplus(\text{coset})$. We construct a parity-symmetric chiral action that, upon breaking \emph{dynamically} selects one chirality: the surviving Yang--Mills factor is identified with $SU(2)_+$, while the opposite chirality persists as the gravitational chiral connection. These lead to concrete phenomenological handles, including graviton and weak-boson vertices with the other fundamental forces in $SU(3)$ and $U(1)$ and parity-sensitive gravitational-wave signatures, that distinguish the $\mathrm{SO}(1,9,\mathbb{C})$ construction from both traditional Pati--Salam and larger, less economical unifications.</description>

      <title>Tetrads in SU(3) X SU(2) X U(1) Yang-Mills geometrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:1207.0912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relationship between gauge and gravity amounts to understanding underlying new geometrical local structures. These structures are new tetrads specially devised for Yang-Mills theories, Abelian and Non-Abelian in four-dimensional Lorentzian curved spacetimes. In the present manuscript a new tetrad is introduced for the Yang- Mills SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) formulation. These new tetrads establish a link between local groups of gauge transformations and local groups of spacetime transformations that we previously called LB1 and LB2. New theorems are proved regarding isomorphisms between local internal SU(3) x SU(2) x U(1) groups and local tensor products of spacetime LB1 and LB2 groups of transformations. These new tetrads define at every point in spacetime two orthogonal planes that we called blades or planes one and two. These are the local planes of covariant diagonalization of the stress-energy tensor. These tetrads are gauge dependent. Tetrad local gauge transformations leave the tetrads inside the local original planes without leaving them. These local tetrad gauge transformations enable the possibility to connect local gauge groups Abelian or non-Abelian with local groups of tetrad transformations. These new tetrads have displayed manifestly and non-trivially the coupling between Yang-Mills fields and gravity. The new tetrads and the stress-energy tensor allow for the introduction of three new local gauge invariant objects. Using these new gauge invariant objects and in addition a new general local duality transformation, a new algorithm for the gauge invariant diagonalization of the Yang-Mills stress-energy tensor is developed as an application. This is a paper about grand Standard Model gauge theories - General Relativity gravity unification and grand group unification in four-dimensional curved Lorentzian spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Assumptions of Randomness in Cosmology Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:1707.03262v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-compact symmetries cannot be fully broken by randomness since non-compact groups have no invariant probability distributions. In particular, this makes trickier the "Copernican" random choice of the place of the observer in infinite cosmology models.
  This problem may be circumvented with what topologists call Pointed Spaces. Then randomness will be used only in building (infinite) models around the pre-designated "observance point", that thus would not need to be randomly chosen.
  Additional complications come from the original randomness possibly being hidden. P. Gacs and A. Kucera proved that every sequence can be algorithmically generated from a random one. But Vladimir V'yugin discovered that randomized algorithms can with positive probability generate uncomputable sequences not algorithmically equivalent to any random ones.</description>

      <title>First-order hyperbolic formulation of the pure tetrad teleparallel gravity theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13659v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a derivation of a first-order reduction and 3+1 decomposition of the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR) in the pure-tetrad formulation (no spin connection). Our analysis demonstrates that in vacuum spacetimes, our 3+1 TEGR equations has the principal part of the differential operator equivalent to the one of tetrad reformulation of general relativity by Estabrook, Robinson, Wahlquist, and Buchman and Bardeen, and therefore the presented 3+1 decomposition of TEGR also admits a symmetric hyperbolic formulation, a desirable property for ensuring well-posedness of the initial value problem. Furthermore, the structure of the 3+1 equations possess a lot of similarities with the equations of relativistic electrodynamics and the recently proposed dGREM tetrad-reformulation of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves on Kerr Black Holes I: Reconstruction of Linearized Metric Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.20311v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational perturbations of a rotating Kerr black hole are notoriously complicated, even at the linear level. In 1973, Teukolsky showed that their physical degrees of freedom are encoded in two gauge-invariant Weyl curvature scalars that obey a separable wave equation. Determining these scalars is sufficient for many purposes, such as the computation of energy fluxes. However, some applications -- such as second-order perturbation theory -- require the reconstruction of metric perturbations. In principle, this problem was solved long ago, but in practice, the solution has never been worked out explicitly. Here, we do so by writing down the metric perturbation (in either ingoing or outgoing radiation gauge) that corresponds to a given mode of either Weyl scalar. Our formulas make no reference to the Hertz potential (an intermediate quantity that plays no fundamental role) and involve only the radial and angular Kerr modes, but not their derivatives, which can be altogether eliminated using the Teukolsky--Starobinsky identities. We expect these analytic results to prove useful in numerical studies and for extending black hole perturbation theory beyond the linear regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum Black Hole as a Harmonic Oscillator from the Perspective of the Minimum Uncertainty Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the eigenvalue equation for the mass of a black hole derived by M\"akel\"a and Repo, we show that, by reparametrizing the radial coordinate and the wave function, it can be rewritten as the eigenvalue equation of a quantum harmonic oscillator. We then study the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole using two quantization approaches. In the standard quantization, the area and mass spectra are discrete, characterized by a quantum number $n$, but the wave function is not square-integrable, limiting its physical interpretation. In contrast, a minimal-uncertainty quantization approach yields an area spectrum that grows as $n^2$, and consequently the mass $M$ also increases. In this framework, the wave function is finite and square-integrable, with convergence requiring that the deformation parameter $\beta$ be regulated by a discrete quantum number $m$. The wave function exhibits quantum tunneling connecting the black hole interior with both its exterior and a white hole region, effects that disappear in the limit $\beta \to 0$. These results demonstrate how minimal-length effects both regularize the wave function and modify the semiclassical structure of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Scalar perturbation and density contrast evolution in $f(Q,C)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The symmetric teleparallel theory offers an alternative gravitational formulation which can elucidate events in the early and late universe without requiring the physical existence of dark matter or dark energy. In this formalism, $f(Q, C)$ gravity has been recently introduced by incorporating the boundary term $C$ with the non-metricity scalar $Q$. In this paper, we develop the theory of cosmological scalar perturbation for $f(Q, C)$ gravity, and retrieve that of $f(\mathring{R})$ and $f(Q)$ gravity from our result. The analysis assumes a model-independent approach within these theories that adheres to the conventional continuity equation at the background level. We derive the density contrast equation by employing some standard cosmological approximations, where the $f(Q,C)$ theory is encoded in the effective Newtonian constant $G_{eff}$. Finally, we derive the evolution equation of density growth $f_g$.</description>

      <title>Reliable quantum master equation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method for estimating the validity range of the quantum Markovian master equation as applied to the Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector within a broader context, particularly without necessitating an exact solution for the detector's evolution. We propose a relaxed van Hove limit (i.e., late-time limit) and offer a perturbative estimate of the error order resulting from the standard derivation procedure of open quantum dynamics. Our primary findings include reliability criteria for the Markov approximation and conditions for the applicability of the rotating wave approximation. Nevertheless, the specific forms of these validity conditions rely on the details of the detector-field system, such as the spacetime background, the trajectory of the detector, and the type of quantum field being analyzed. Finally, we illustrate our results by reexamining the open dynamics of an accelerating UDW detector undergoing the Unruh effect, where the validity conditions narrow the parameter space to ensure the solution's reliability regarding the quantum Markovian master equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores both classical and quantum aspects of an axisymmetric black hole within a non-commutative gauge theory. The rotating solution is derived using a modified Newman-Janis procedure. The analysis begins with the horizon structure, ergospheres, and angular velocity. The thermodynamic properties are examined through surface gravity, focusing on the Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. In addition, the remnant mass is calculated. The Hawking radiation is treated as a tunneling process for bosonic and fermionic particles, along with the corresponding particle creation density. Geodesic motion is explored, emphasizing null geodesics, radial accelerations, the photon sphere, and black hole shadows. Finally, the gravitational lensing in the strong deflection limit is investigated.</description>

      <title>Active and Passive Conformal Transformations in Scalar-Tensor Gravitational Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12826v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Through considering the conformal transformations as coordinate transformations in the configuration space, where the different fields, including the metric $g_{\mu\nu}$ and the Brans-Dicke scalar field $\phi$, are assumed as ``generalized coordinates,'' we introduce the notion of active and passive conformal transformations. We then apply both complementary approaches to the conformal frames issue, arising in the context of scalar-tensor gravity theories, to get a better understanding of the problem. Special focus is on the coupling of matter fields to gravity. The recent result that the Lagrangian density of fundamental matter fields and perfect fluids, in its standard form, is form-invariant under the conformal transformations, is taken into consideration in the discussion. We show that the passive conformal transformations do not provide a suitable framework to search for the physical consequences of conformal symmetry; meanwhile, the active conformal transformations do. We also discuss the physical and phenomenological implications of the scalar-tensor theory in the Jordan frame Brans-Dicke parametrization, which is form-invariant under the conformal transformations complemented with a suitable transformation of the coupling parameter $\omega$. Although the vacuum case was known for a long time, here we generalize this framework to include matter fields. We argue that the conformal frames issue arises as consequence of two factors: 1) omission of the transformation of field-dependent parameters, as the coupling function $\omega=\omega(\phi)$, under the conformal transformation of the fields, in particular of the scalar field $\phi\rightarrow\Omega^{-2}\phi$, and 2) ignorance of the linear dependence of variations of the metric and of the Brans-Dicke scalar field, which is implicit in the invariance under infinitesimal conformal transformations.</description>

      <title>The constraints on the stochastic gravitational wave background from cosmic strings by an electromagnetic resonance system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As one of the primary detection targets for contemporary gravitational wave (GW) observatories, the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) holds significant potential for enhancing our understanding of the early universe's formation and evolution. Studies indicate that the SGWB spectrum from cosmic strings can span an extraordinarily broad frequency range, extending from extremely low frequencies up to the microwave band. This work specifically investigates the detectability of cosmic string SGWB signals in an electromagnetic (EM) resonance system at GHz frequency. We present a systematic analysis encompassing: (1) the response of high frequency gravitational waves (HFGWs) in such EM resonance system. (2) the development and application of fundamental data processing protocols in the EM resonance system. Our results demonstrate that the EM system shows promising sensitivity to detect cosmic string SGWB signals with tension parameters $G\mu\geq 10^{-11}$ (the corresponding dimensionless amplitude $h \geq 10^{-33}$ at 1 GHz), while potentially establishing new constraints for $G\mu\leq 10^{-11}$ in the microwave band. These findings would complement existing multi-band SGWB observations and provide additional constraints on cosmic-string tension parameters in GHz frequency regimes.</description>

      <title>Novel black holes with scalar hair in the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar Theory with positive coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we find a new branch of hairy black hole solutions in the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar (EMS) theory in four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes. Different from spontaneous scalarization induced by tachyonic instabilities in Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) black holes with a negative coupling parameter, these scalar-hairy black hole solutions arise when the coupling parameter is positive, where nonlinear coupling plays the dominant role, meaning that the coupling is positively correlated with the degree of deviation from the trivial state. Our numerical analysis reveals that the scalar field grows monotonically with the radial coordinate and asymptotically approaches a finite constant, exhibiting behavior that is qualitatively similar to that of the Maxwell potential. In these solutions, an increase in the charge $q$ causes the scalar-hairy solutions to deviate further from the RN state, while excessive charging drives the system back towards hairless solutions. Strengthening the coupling parameter compresses the existence domain of the scalar-hairy state, which lies entirely within the parameter region of RN black holes. Moreover, by evaluating the quasinormal modes, we show that the obtained scalar-hairy solutions are stable against linearized scalar perturbations.</description>

      <title>Insights in $f(Q)$ cosmology: the relevance of the connection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03506v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the role of the affine connection in $f(Q)$ gravity, a modified theory where gravity is governed by non-metricity within the symmetric teleparallel framework. Although the connection is constrained to be flat and torsionless, it is not uniquely determined by the metric, allowing for multiple physically distinct formulations. We analyze three such connections compatible with a homogeneous and isotropic universe to show that they yield markedly different cosmological dynamics, even under the same functional form of $f(Q)$. Using both analytical and numerical methods, including a Born-Infeld type model of $f(Q)$, we demonstrate that specific connections can resolve cosmological singularities like the Big Bang and Big Rip, replacing them with smooth de Sitter phases. Others retain singularities but with notable modifications in their behavior. These findings highlight the physical relevance of connection choice in $f(Q)$ gravity and its potential to address fundamental cosmological questions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong self-gravitational fields enable the realization of macroscopic odd-parity quantum objects. Using ray-tracing methods, we systematically analyze the dynamics of photons and the shadow features of rotating black holes with parity-odd scalar hair and contrast them with those of Kerr black holes. Our results demonstrate measurable distinctions between scalar-haired black hole shadows and their Kerr counterparts. Notably, even for tiny scalar charge and negligible scalar hair mass contributions, these differences remain quantitatively resolvable. In particular, one of the hairy black hole reported here lies within the Event Horizon Telescope observational uncertainties, probing the scalar masses of $1.02\times10^{-20}$eV with M87*. These findings may provide related theoretical benchmarks for future observational campaigns targeting scalar-field dark matter candidates through black hole shadow imaging.</description>

      <title>A Conservative Theory of Semiclassical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05237v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that semiclassical gravity is rendered consistent by considering that quantum systems emit a gravitational field only when they interact with members of Stable Determination Chains (SDCs). These are chains of non-gravitational interactions between quantum systems modeled via decoherence and test functions that obey conditions that aim to address the measurement problem and allow for a conservative theory of gravity. It is conservative because it does not need to modify the fundamental equations of quantum theory, unlike spontaneous and gravity-induced collapse approaches to semiclassical gravity, and without invoking relationalism. Furthermore, it does not appeal to nonlocal, retrocausal, or superdeterministic hidden variables. When systems do not interact with SDCs, they do not emit a gravitational field, and the expectation value of their stress-energy tensor does not enter the semiclassical equations describing the gravitational field in a region. In the absence of SDCs in a region, spacetime can be flat. This theory holds a version of the equivalence principle, which establishes that different bodies under the same gravitational field evolve similarly in the absence of non-gravitational interactions. It can be tested by experiments investigating the gravitational field emitted by quasi-isolated systems, and the lack of gravity-mediated entanglement and certain kinds of collapse in the Bose-Marletto-Vedral (BMV) experiment. It provides multiple benefits, such as a semiclassical estimation of the value of the cosmological constant and the prediction of a time-varying dark energy that weakens with time, in agreement with some evidence. More broadly, we propose a new testable framework in which there is a conditional emission of a gravitational field by quantum systems, which may undermine the main motivations for a theory of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Primordial Gravitational Wave Background as a Probe of the Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) from the collapse of density perturbations induced by primordial gravitational waves (PGWs). The PGWs' interpretation of the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) corresponds to PBHs formation in the mass range $[10^{-12}-10^{-3}] M_{\odot}$. Importantly, our analysis shows that PGWs' interpretation of recent PTA data remains viable, as it does not lead to PBH overproduction. We derive the amplitude of PGWs by leveraging existing constraints on the PBH abundance across a wide mass range. Notably, these constrained amplitudes predict SGWB signals that would be detectable by future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with a Non-minimally Coupled Dark Matter Fluid I. Background Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a cosmological model in which dark matter is non-minimally coupled to gravity at the fluid level. While typically subdominant compared to Standard Model forces, such couplings may dominate dark matter dynamics. We show that this interaction modifies the early-time Friedmann equations, driving a phase of accelerated expansion that can resolve the horizon and flatness problems without introducing additional fields. At even earlier times, the coupling to spatial curvature may give rise to a cosmological bounce, replacing the initial singularity of standard cosmology. These results suggest that non-minimally coupled dark matter could offer a unified framework for addressing both the singularity and fine-tuning problems.</description>

      <title>Greybody factors in scalar-tensor gravity and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of the beyond Horndeski action, we consider three subtheories that support scalarised black-hole solutions, and look for modified characteristics compared to GR. We first study the propagation of massless scalar and vector test fields in the fixed background of an analytical spherically symmetric black hole derived in the context of a parity-symmetric beyond Horndeski theory, and show that the profiles of the effective gravitational potentials, greybody factors, absorption cross sections and quasinormal frequencies exhibit distinct modifications as we move away from the GR limit. We then turn our attention to the perturbations of the gravitational field itself and adopt a full-theory analysis that takes into account the backreaction of the scalar field on the metric. Employing as background solutions scalarized black holes arising in the shift-symmetric Horndeski theory and in the quadratic-quartic-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory, we compute the greybody factors and quasinormal modes of the axial sector. In both theories, in direct correspondence to the form of the gravitational potential, which features multiple extremal points, we find modified (suppressed or nonmonotonic) greybody curves and altered quasinormal frequencies (smaller oscillating frequencies and larger damping times), especially as the hair-sourcing parameter increases.</description>

      <title>A universal relation among Euclidean integrals for black holes in higher-derivative gravity theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a universal equality governing Euclidean integrals of gravitational actions in higher-derivative theories. This relation is shown to hold universally for asymptotically flat black holes in pure gravity, and is generalized to asymptotically anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetimes through appropriate regularization. We further examine its validity in systems with matter-gravity coupling, identifying that violations occur only when matter fields exhibit pathological behaviors: divergence at the horizon or non-decaying profiles at infinity. These findings reveal fundamental constraints on gravitational thermodynamics and provide diagnostic tools for identifying ill-behaved matter configurations.</description>

      <title>Imprints of screened dark energy on nonlocal quantum correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how screening mechanisms, reconciling light scalar fields driving cosmic acceleration with local fifth force constraints, can be probed via their impact on non-local quantum correlations between entangled spin pairs, whose evolution on a curved background is affected by General Relativity (GR) and screened modified gravity effects. We consider a gedankenexperiment featuring a pair of massive, spin-1/2 particles orbiting the Earth, evaluating their non-local correlations through spin observables associated to the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) inequality. Using a general formalism developed earlier for curved space-time spin evolution, we compute the effects of screening on the CHSH inequality, finding its degree of violation to be suppressed relative to the flat space-time case. Applying this formalism to the chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton mechanisms, we identify currently unconstrained regions of parameter space where the screening contribution is comparable to that of GR. While detecting these effects will be challenging, our work provides a proof-of-principle for testing screened dark energy through quantum non-locality.</description>

      <title>Agegraphic dark energy from entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the agegraphic dark energy from the entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole using the age of the universe as the IR cutoff. We constrain its parameter with the Pantheon+ Type Ia supernova sample and observational Hubble parameter data, finding that the Akaike Information Criterion cannot effectively distinguish this model from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. The present value of Hubble constant $H_{0}$ and the model parameter $b^{2}$ are constrained to $H_{0}=67.7 \pm 1.8$ and $b^{2}=0.303^{+0.019}_{-0.024}$. This model realizes the whole evolution of the universe, including the late-time accelerated expansion. Although it asymptotically approaches the standard $\Lambda$CDM model in the future, statefinder analysis shows that late-time deviations allow the two models to be distinguished.</description>

      <title>Hawking tunneling radiation with thermodynamic pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hawking radiation elucidates black holes as quantum thermodynamic systems, thereby establishing a conceptual bridge between general relativity and quantum mechanics through particle emission phenomena. While conventional theoretical frameworks predominantly focus on classical spacetime configurations, recent advancements in Extended Phase Space thermodynamics have redefined cosmological parameters (such as the $\Lambda$-term) as dynamic variables. Notably, the thermodynamics of Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes has been successfully extended to incorporate thermodynamic pressure $P$. Within this extended phase space framework, although numerous intriguing physical phenomena have been identified, the tunneling mechanism of particles incorporating pressure and volume remains unexplored. This study investigates Hawking radiation through particle tunneling in Schwarzschild Anti-de Sitter black holes within the extended phase space, where the thermodynamic pressure $P$ is introduced via a dynamic cosmological constant $\Lambda$. By employing semi-classical tunneling calculations with self-gravitation corrections, we demonstrate that emission probabilities exhibit a direct correlation with variations in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Significantly, the radiation spectrum deviates from pure thermality, aligning with unitary quantum evolution while maintaining consistency with standard phase space results. Moreover, through thermodynamic analysis, we have verified that the emission rate of particles is related to the difference in Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of the emitted particles before and after they tunnel through the potential barrier. These findings establish particle tunneling as a unified probe of quantum gravitational effects in black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>A relativistic treatment of accretion disk torques on extreme mass ratio inspirals around spinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model the motion of a small compact object on a nearly circular orbit around a spinning supermassive black hole, which is also interacting with a thin equatorial accretion-disk surrounding the latter, through tools from self-force and Hamiltonian perturbation theory. We provide an analytical and relativistically-accurate formalism to calculate the rate of energy and angular momentum exchanged at Lindblad resonances. We show that strong relativistic effects can potentially cause a reversal in the direction of the torque on the small compact object if the surface density gradient is not too large. We analytically explore the dependence of the torque reversal location on the spin of the supermassive black hole and demonstrate that the ratio of the reversal location to the innermost stable circular orbit is approximately insensitive to the spin of the supermassive black hole. Our results show that relativistic torques can be 1--2 order of magnitude larger than the Newtonian torque routinely used in the literature to model disk/small-compact-object interactions close to the supermassive black hole. Our results highlight the importance of including relativistic effects when modeling environmental effects in extreme mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the low-energy regime of BFSS quantum mechanics using its holographic dual. We identify three distinct thermodynamic phases (black holes) and analyze their thermodynamic properties extensively, including phase transitions amongst the several phases. While the properties of the canonical ensemble aligns with existing conjectures on BFSS thermodynamics, we uncover intriguing and unexpected behavior in the microcanonical ensemble. Specifically, for sufficiently low energies, we observe the dominance of the localized phase. Surprisingly, we also identify an energy range where the non-uniform phase becomes dominant. The transition between these phases is mediated by a Kol-type topology-changing phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Detecting electromagnetic counterparts to LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA gravitational wave events with DECam: Neutron Star Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13673v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With GW170817 being the only multimessenger gravitational wave (GW) event with an associated kilonova detected so far, there exists a pressing need for realistic estimation of the GW localization uncertainties and rates, as well as optimization of available telescope time to enable the detection of new kilonovae. We simulate GW events assuming a data-driven distribution of binary parameters for the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) fourth and fifth observing runs (O4 and O5). We map the binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star-black hole (NSBH) properties to the kilonova optical light curves. We use the simulated population of kilonovae to generate follow-up observing plans, with the primary goal of optimizing detection with the Gravitational Wave Multi-Messenger Astronomy DECam Survey (GW-MMADS). We explore the dependence of kilonova detectability on the mass, distance, inclination, and spin of the binaries. Assuming that no BNS was detected during O4 until the end of 2024, we present updated GW BNS (NSBH) merger detection rates. We expect to detect BNS (NSBH) kilonovae with DECam at a per-year rate of: $0$-$2.0$ ($0$) in O4, and $2.0$-$19$ ($0$-$1.0$) in O5. We expect the majority of BNS detections and also those accompanied by a detectable kilonova to produce a hypermassive NS remnant, with a significant fraction of the remaining BNSs promptly collapsing to a BH. We release GW simulations and depths required to detect kilonovae based on our predictions to support the astronomical community in their multimessenger follow-up campaigns and analyses.</description>

      <title>Astrometry meets Pulsar Timing Arrays: Synergies for Gravitational Wave Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-precision astrometry offers a promising approach to detect low-frequency gravitational waves, complementing pulsar timing array (PTA) observations. We explore the response of astrometric measurements to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in synergy with PTA data. Analytical, covariant expressions for this response are derived, accounting for the presence of a possible dipolar anisotropy in the SGWB. We identify the optimal estimator for extracting SGWB information from astrometric observations and examine how sensitivity to SGWB properties varies with the sky positions of stars and pulsars. Using representative examples of current PTA capabilities and near-future astrometric sensitivity, we demonstrate that cross-correlating astrometric and PTA data can improve constraints on SGWB properties, compared to PTA data alone. The improvement is quantified through Fisher forecasts for the SGWB amplitude, spectral tilt, and dipolar anisotropy amplitude. In the future, such joint constraints could play a crucial role in identifying the origin of SGWB signals detected by PTAs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct the thermal bounce solution in holographic models that describes first-order phase transitions between the deconfined and confined phases in strongly-coupled gauge theories. This new, periodic Euclidean solution represents transitions that occur via thermally-assisted tunneling and interpolates between the $O(4)$-symmetric vacuum bubble at zero temperature and the high temperature $O(3)$-symmetric critical bubble associated with classical thermal fluctuations. The exact thermal bounce solution can be used to obtain the bounce action at low temperatures which allows for a more accurate determination of vacuum decay rates, significantly improving previous estimates in holographic models. In particular, provided the phase transition is sufficiently supercooled, new predictions are obtained for the gravitational wave signal strength for critical temperatures ranging from the TeV scale up to $10^{12}$ GeV, some of which are within reach of future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>The Phase Space of Low-Mass Binary Compact Objects from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Catalog: Hints on the Chances of Different Formation Scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations have significantly advanced our understanding of binary compact object (BCO) formation, yet directly linking these observations to specific formation scenarios remains challenging. The BCO phase space provides a robust and data-driven approach to discover the likely formation scenarios of these binaries. In this study, we expand the previously introduced binary black hole phase space technique to encompass low-mass compact objects (LMCOs), establishing a novel framework to investigate their diverse formation mechanisms. Applying this approach to selected low-mass events $(\lesssim 5 M_\odot)$ from the GWTC-3 catalog and the recently observed GW230529 event, we show for the first time the phase space demonstration of the LMCOs and find the associated probabilities for different formation scenarios including neutron star, astrophysical black hole, or primordial black hole. Our analysis includes the astrophysical modelling uncertainties in and how it causes degeneracy between different formation scenarios. In future, with improvements in GW detector sensitivity and with detection of more GW events, the LMCO phase space framework will significantly strengthen our capacity to associate more likely formation scenarios over the other, thereby refining our understanding of compact object formation for both astrophysical and primordial scenarios, and its evolution across the cosmic redshift.</description>

      <title>An Accurate Modeling of Nano-hertz Gravitational Wave Signal from Eccentric Supermassive Binary Black Holes: An Essential Step Toward a Robust Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz (nHz) regime, detectable by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), provides a promising probe of the cosmic population of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). These binaries are expected to retain significant eccentricity throughout their evolution. We present a new technique to model the nHz SGWB by incorporating eccentricity into a multi-scale adaptive simulation framework. Using the time-domain eccentric waveform model ESIGMAHM, we generate realistic GW signals from astrophysical populations of SMBHBs. Unlike circular binaries, eccentric systems emit across multiple frequencies, introducing spectral correlations between frequency bins. These correlations provide a novel observational signature of the eccentricity distribution of the SMBHB population. In this work, we adopt simplified power-law models for the eccentricity distribution. While this does not capture the full complexity of galactic environments, it effectively highlights the key features of GW emission from eccentric binaries and their imprint on the SGWB. Our approach advances nHz GW signal modeling by incorporating eccentricity at small scales, enabling more realistic predictions and offering a new avenue for probing SMBHB astrophysics with future PTA observations.</description>

      <title>ModMax Electrodynamics and Holographic Magnetotransport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study magnetotransport in a holographic model where ModMax nonlinear electrodynamics is coupled to Einstein anti--de Sitter gravity. To incorporate momentum relaxation, we introduce spatially linear free scalar fields that break translational symmetry, resulting in an anisotropic medium. Using linear response theory, we compute the DC conductivity matrix in the presence of an external magnetic field, expressing the conductivities in terms of horizon data. Our results demonstrate how the nonlinear ModMax parameter modifies charge transport, particularly influencing the Hall angle and Nernst signal. The nonlinear corrections introduce distinct deviations in both longitudinal and Hall conductivities while preserving the characteristic temperature scaling of strange metals, offering new insights into strongly coupled systems with nonlinear electromagnetic interactions. Notably, the Nernst signal reproduces that of high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors showing a superconducting dome and a normal phase, with the ModMax deformation parameter tuning critical and onset temperatures. In the strongly nonlinear regime, we find evidence of an exotic state dominated by quasiparticle excitations in the dual material.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-attractor inflation modified by GUP in light of ACT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, the $\alpha$-attractor inflation is investigated within a framework incorporating a minimal measurable length, as implemented by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP). The GUP modifications to the Friedmann equations and cosmological perturbation parameters are employed to assess the model observational viability against the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) data. Our results indicate that in the $r-n_s$ plane, the predictions of the standard $\alpha$-attractor model ($\beta=0$) lies near the $2\sigma$ boundary of joint observations. More interestingly enough is that in the presence of GUP effect, the predictions of the model for the GUP parameter $\beta \gtrsim O(10^{13})$ shifts into the $68\%$ CL interval. This value for $\beta$ is in well agreement with upper bounds on the GUP parameter deduced from cosmological analysis as well as quantum and gravitational experiments.</description>

      <title>Sagittarius A* near-infrared flares polarization as a probe of space-time I: Non-rotating exotic compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The center of our galaxy hosts Sagittarius~A*, a supermassive compact object of $\sim 4.3\times 10^6$ solar masses, usually associated with a black hole. Nevertheless, black holes possess a central singularity, considered unphysical, and an event horizon, which leads to loss of unitarity in a quantum description of the system. To address these theoretical inconsistencies, alternative models, collectively known as exotic compact objects, have been proposed. In this paper, we investigate the potential detectability of signatures associated with non-rotating exotic compact objects within the Sgr~A* polarized flares dataset, as observed through GRAVITY and future instruments. We examine a total of eight distinct metrics, originating from four different categories of static and spherically symmetric compact objects: Black Holes, Boson stars, Fluid spheres, and Gravastars. Our approach involves utilizing a toy model that orbits the compact object in the equatorial plane, at the Schwarzschild-Keplerian velocity. Using simulated astrometric and polarimetric data with present GRAVITY and future GRAVITY+ uncertainties, we fit the datasets across all metrics examined. We evaluated the detectability of the metric for each dataset based on the resulting $\chi^2_\mathrm{red}$ and BIC-based Bayes factors. Plunge-through images of ECOs affect polarization and astrometry. With GRAVITY's present uncertainties, only a compact boson-star model is discernible. GRAVITY+'s improved sensitivity allows detection of most exotic compact object models. However, enhancing the astrophysical complexity of the hot spot model diminishes these outcomes. Presently, GRAVITY's uncertainties limit us to detecting just one exotic compact object metric. With GRAVITY+'s enhanced sensitivity, we can expect to uncover additional exotic compact object models and use Sgr~A* as a laboratory for fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Black Holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend our earlier work on the linearised perturbations of static black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theories to the case where the black holes are solutions in an enlarged theory including also an axion. We study the perturbations in a 3-parameter family of such EMDA theories. The systems of equations describing the linearised perturbations can always be separated, but they can only be decoupled when the three parameters are restricted to a 1-parameter family of EMDA theories, characterised by a parameter $b$ that determines the coupling of the axion to the $\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\, F_{\mu\nu}\, F_{\rho\sigma}$ term. In the specific case when $b=1$, the theory is related to an ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity. In this one case we find that the perturbations in the axial and the polar sectors are related by a remarkable transformation, which generalises one found by Chandrasekhar for the perturbations of Reissner-Nordstr\"om in Einstein-Maxwell theory. This transformation is of a form found in supersymmetric quantum mechanical models. The existence of such mappings between the axial and polar perturbations appears to correlate with those cases where there is an underlying supergravity supporting the solution, even though the black hole backgrounds are non-extremal and therefore not supersymmetric. We prove the mode stability of the static black hole solutions in the supersymmetric EMDA theory. For other values of the parameter $b$ in the EMDA theories that allow decoupling of the modes, we find that one of the radial potentials can be negative outside the horizon if $b$ is sufficiently large, raising the possibility of there being perturbative mode instabilities in such a case.</description>

      <title>Schwinger--DeWitt expansion for the heat kernel of nonminimal operators in causal theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest a systematic calculational scheme for heat kernels of covariant nonminimal operators in causal theories whose characteristic surfaces are null with respect to a generic metric. The calculational formalism is based on a pseudodifferential operator calculus which allows one to build a linear operator map from the heat kernel of the minimal operator to the nonminimal one. This map is realized as a local expansion in powers of spacetime curvature, dimensional background fields, and their covariant derivatives with the coefficients -- the functions of the Synge world function and its derivatives. Finiteness of these functions, determined by multiple proper time integrals, is achieved by a special subtraction procedure which is an important part of the calculational scheme. We illustrate this technique on the examples of the vector Proca model and the vector field operator with a nondegenerate principal symbol. We also discuss smoothness properties of heat kernels of nonminimal operators in connection with the nondegenerate nature of their operator symbols.</description>

      <title>Harvesting Contextuality from the Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum contextuality is the notion that certain measurement scenarios do not admit a global description of their statistics and has been implicated as the source of quantum advantage in a number of quantum information protocols. It has been shown that contextuality generalizes the concepts of non-local entanglement and magic, and is an equivalent notion of non-classicality to Wigner negativity. In this paper, the protocol of contextuality harvesting is introduced and it is shown that Unruh-DeWitt models are capable of harvesting quantum contextuality from the vacuum of a massless scalar quantum field. In particular, it is shown that gapless systems can be made to harvest contextuality given a suitable choice of measurements. The harvested contextuality is also seen to behave similarly to harvested magic and can be larger in magnitude for specific parameter regimes. An Unruh-DeWitt qubit-qutrit system is also investigated, where it is shown that certain tradeoffs exist between the harvested contextuality of the qutrit and the harvested entanglement between the systems, and that there are harvesting regimes where the two resources can both be present. Some of the tools of contextuality, namely the contextual fraction, are also imported and used as general harvesting measures for any form of contextuality, including non-local entanglement and magic. Additionally, new criteria for genuine harvesting are put forward that also apply to individual systems, revealing new permissible harvesting parameter regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel family of exact black hole solutions constructed in the context of five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet gravity. These solutions add a non-linear charge to the Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli-like configurations known to exist with arbitrary Thurston horizon geometry. We establish constraints on the parameter space defining physically viable black holes, aligning with the standard energy conditions. An explicit proof of the first law of thermodynamics within our scenario is provided. We also employ holographic techniques to characterize the DC conductivities for the distinct horizon geometries, identifying a critical temperature indicative of phase transitions and exploring pertinent limits.</description>

      <title>Improving cosmological reach of a gravitational wave observatory using Deep Loop Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improved low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave observatories would unlock study of intermediate-mass black hole mergers, binary black hole eccentricity, and provide early warnings for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star mergers. Today's mirror stabilization control injects harmful noise, constituting a major obstacle to sensitivity improvements. We eliminated this noise through Deep Loop Shaping, a reinforcement learning method using frequency domain rewards. We proved our methodology on the LIGO Livingston Observatory (LLO). Our controller reduced control noise in the 10--30Hz band by over 30x, and up to 100x in sub-bands surpassing the design goal motivated by the quantum limit. These results highlight the potential of Deep Loop Shaping to improve current and future GW observatories, and more broadly instrumentation and control systems.</description>

      <title>Limits of Symmetry in Schwarzschild: CKVs and BRST Triviality in the Kerr-Schild Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25801v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We complete our investigation into the residual symmetries of the Kerr-Schild double copy for the Schwarzschild solution. In the first paper in this series, we showed that the infinite-dimensional residual gauge algebra collapses to the finite-dimensional global isometries when restricted to Killing vectors. Here, we extend the analysis to proper conformal Killing vectors (CKVs), solving the field equations via the method of characteristics to obtain explicit conformal solutions. While asymptotic flatness and horizon regularity remove divergent contributions, the surviving components form a non-trivial infinite-dimensional algebra, revealing a structural mismatch with the canonical Schwarzschild solution. We resolve this by constructing a unified, Weyl-compensated BRST complex, showing that the infinite-dimensional modes are BRST-exact and do not correspond to physical degrees of freedom. This demonstrates the quantum consistency of the Kerr-Schild double copy, confirming that the physical spectrum is restricted to global isometries.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Lie Algebroids: Taming Singular Carrollian Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developments in Carrollian gravity and holography necessitate the use of singular Carroll vector fields, a feature that cannot be accommodated within standard Carrollian geometry. We introduce Carrollian Lie algebroids as a framework to study such singular Carrollian geometries. In this approach, we define the Carroll distribution as the image of the kernel of the degenerate metric under the anchor map. The Carroll distribution is, in general, a singular Stefan--Sussmann distribution that will fluctuate between rank-1 and rank-0, and so captures the notion of a singular Carroll vector field. As an example, we show that an invariant Carrollian structure on a principal bundle leads to a Carrollian structure on the associated Atiyah algebroid that will, in general, have a singular Carroll distribution. Mixed null-spacelike hypersurfaces, under some simplifying assumptions, also lead to examples of Carrollian Lie algebroids. Furthermore, we establish the existence of compatible connections on Carrollian Lie algebroids, and as a direct consequence, we conclude that Carrollian manifolds can always be equipped with compatible affine connections.</description>

      <title>Matching JWST UV Luminosity Functions with Refined $\Lambda$CDM Halo Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has unveiled a population of unexpectedly massive and luminous galaxies at redshifts $z \gtrsim 7$, posing a significant challenge to the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological paradigm. In this work, we address the tension between early JWST observations of luminous high-redshift galaxies and predictions of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model by revisiting the physics of dark matter halo formation. Employing refined halo mass functions derived by Del Popolo \textit{et al.} (DP1 and DP2) that incorporate angular momentum, dynamical friction, and redshift-dependent collapse barriers, we demonstrate a significant enhancement in the abundance of massive halos at $z \gtrsim 7$ compared to the conventional Sheth-Tormen (ST) formalism. Using a semi-empirical framework linking halo mass to UV luminosity, we show that the DP2 model reproduces the observed UV luminosity functions from $z = 7$ to $14$ with moderate star formation efficiencies, whereas the ST model requires implausibly high efficiencies. Our results suggest that the JWST overabundance problem stems not from new physics beyond $\Lambda$CDM, but from oversimplified treatments of gravitational collapse, highlighting the critical role of small-scale dissipative dynamics in early structure formation.</description>

      <title>Radiative-Corrected Higgs Inflation in Light of the Latest ACT Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), particularly when combined with DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data, have reported a scalar spectral index $n_s$ slightly higher than that inferred by {\it Planck}~2018, suggesting a mild tension with the predictions of standard inflationary attractor models. In this work, we revisit the quantum-corrected Higgs inflation scenario within the framework of a non-minimally coupled scalar field theory. Starting from the one-loop effective action, we incorporate radiative corrections through the anomalous scaling parameter ${\bf A_I}$ and derive analytic expressions for the inflationary observables $n_s$ and $r$ in the Einstein frame. Our analysis demonstrates that quantum corrections naturally shift $n_s$ toward higher values while keeping the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ suppressed. For ${\cal N} = 60$, the model predicts $n_s \simeq 0.9743$ and $r \simeq 5.4\times10^{-3}$, in excellent agreement with the latest ACT+DESI (P-ACT-LB) data and fully consistent with the \textit{Planck}~2018 limit $r &lt; 0.036$. The derived constraint $4.36\times10^{-10} &lt; \lambda/\xi^{2} &lt; 10.77\times10^{-10}$ confirms the robustness of the quantum-corrected Higgs framework and indicates that near-future CMB polarization experiments such as CORE, AliCPT, LiteBIRD, and CMB-S4 will be able to probe the predicted parameter space with high precision.</description>
