      <title>History-Aware Trajectory k-Anonymization Using an FPGA-Based Hardware Accelerator for Real-Time Location Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our previous work established the feasibility of FPGA-based real-time trajectory anonymization, a critical task for protecting user privacy in modern location-based services (LBS). However, that pioneering approach relied exclusively on shortest-path computations, which can fail to capture re- alistic travel behavior and thus reduce the utility of the anonymized data. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a novel, history-aware trajectory k-anonymization methodology and presents an advanced FPGA-based hardware architecture to implement it. Our proposed architecture uniquely integrates par- allel history-based trajectory searches with conventional shortest- path finding, using a custom fixed-point counting module to ac- curately weigh contributions from historical data. This approach enables the system to prioritize behaviorally common routes over geometrically shorter but less-traveled paths. The FPGA implementation demonstrates that our new architecture achieves a real-time throughput of over 6,000 records/s, improves data retention by up to 1.2% compared to our previous shortest-path- only design, and preserves major arterial roads more effectively. These results signify a key advancement, enabling high-fidelity, history-aware anonymization that preserves both privacy and behavioral accuracy under the strict latency constraints of LBS.</description>

      <title>AssertMiner: Module-Level Spec Generation and Assertion Mining using Static Analysis Guided LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assertion-based verification (ABV) is a key approach to checking whether a logic design complies with its architectural specifications. Existing assertion generation methods based on design specifications typically produce only top-level assertions, overlooking verification needs on the implementation details in the modules at the micro-architectural level, where design errors occur more frequently. To address this limitation, we present AssertMiner, a module-level assertion generation framework that leverages static information generated from abstract syntax tree (AST) to assist LLMs in mining assertions. Specifically, it performs AST-based structural extraction to derive the module call graph, I/O table, and dataflow graph, guiding the LLM to generate module-level specifications and mine module-level assertions. Our evaluation demonstrates that AssertMiner outperforms existing methods such as AssertLLM and Spec2Assertion in generating high-quality assertions for modules. When integrated with these methods, AssertMiner can enhance the structural coverage and significantly improve the error detection capability, enabling a more comprehensive and efficient verification process.</description>

      <title>The Role of Advanced Computer Architectures in Accelerating Artificial Intelligence Workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The remarkable progress in Artificial Intelligence (AI) is foundation-ally linked to a concurrent revolution in computer architecture. As AI models, particularly Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), have grown in complexity, their massive computational demands have pushed traditional architectures to their limits. This paper provides a structured review of this co-evolution, analyzing the architectural landscape designed to accelerate modern AI workloads. We explore the dominant architectural paradigms Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Appli-cation-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), and Field-Programmable Gate Ar-rays (FPGAs) by breaking down their design philosophies, key features, and per-formance trade-offs. The core principles essential for performance and energy efficiency, including dataflow optimization, advanced memory hierarchies, spar-sity, and quantization, are analyzed. Furthermore, this paper looks ahead to emerging technologies such as Processing-in-Memory (PIM) and neuromorphic computing, which may redefine future computation. By synthesizing architec-tural principles with quantitative performance data from industry-standard benchmarks, this survey presents a comprehensive picture of the AI accelerator landscape. We conclude that AI and computer architecture are in a symbiotic relationship, where hardware-software co-design is no longer an optimization but a necessity for future progress in computing.</description>

      <title>Combined power management and congestion control in High-Speed Ethernet-based Networks for Supercomputers and Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for computer in our daily lives has led to the proliferation of Datacenters that power indispensable many services. On the other hand, computing has become essential for some research for various scientific fields, that require Supercomputers with vast computing capabilities to produce results in reasonable time. The scale and complexity of these systems, compared to our day-to-day devices, are like comparing a cell to a living organism. To make them work properly, we need state-of-the-art technology and engineering, not just raw resources. Interconnecting the different computer nodes that make up a whole is a delicate task, as it can become the bottleneck for the whole infrastructure. In this work, we explore two aspects of the network: how to prevent degradation under heavy use with congestion control, and how to save energy when idle with power management; and how the two may interact.</description>

      <title>Beamspace Equalization for mmWave Massive MIMO: Algorithms and VLSI Implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication are key physical layer technologies in future wireless systems. Their deployment, however, is expected to incur excessive baseband processing hardware cost and power consumption. Beamspace processing leverages the channel sparsity at mmWave frequencies to reduce baseband processing complexity. In this paper, we review existing beamspace data detection algorithms and propose new algorithms as well as corresponding VLSI architectures that reduce data detection power. We present VLSI implementation results for the proposed architectures in a 22nm FDSOI process. Our results demonstrate that a fully-parallelized implementation of the proposed complex sparsity-adaptive equalizer (CSPADE) achieves up to 54% power savings compared to antenna-domain equalization. Furthermore, our fully-parallelized designs achieve the highest reported throughput among existing massive MIMO data detectors, while achieving better energy and area efficiency. We also present a sequential multiply-accumulate (MAC)-based architecture for CSPADE, which enables even higher power savings, i.e., up to 66%, compared to a MAC-based antenna-domain equalizer.</description>

      <title>Lit Silicon: A Case Where Thermal Imbalance Couples Concurrent Execution in Multiple GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GPU systems are increasingly powering modern datacenters at scale. Despite being highly performant, GPU systems suffer from performance variation at the node and cluster levels. Such performance variation significantly impacts both high-performance computing and artificial intelligence workloads, such as cutting-edge large language models (LLMs). We analyze the performance of a single-node multi-GPU system running LLM training, and observe that the kernel-level performance variation is highly correlated with concurrent computation communication (C3), a technique to overlap computation and communication across GPUs for performance gains. We then take a further step to reason that thermally induced straggling coupling with C3 impacts performance variation, coined as the Lit Silicon effect. Lit Silicon describes that in a multi-GPU node, thermal imbalance across GPUs introduces node-level straggler GPUs, which in turn slow down the leader GPUs. Lit Silicon leads to node-level performance variation and inefficiency, impacting the entire datacenter from the bottom up. We propose analytical performance and power models for Lit Silicon, to understand the potential system-level gains. We further design simple detection and mitigation techniques to effectively address the Lit Silicon problem, and evaluate three different power management solutions, including power optimization under GPU thermal design power, performance optimization under node-level GPU power capping, and performance optimization under node-level CPU power sloshing. We conduct experiments on two workloads on two AMD InstinctTM MI300X GPU systems under two LLM training frameworks, and observe up to 6% performance and 4% power improvements, potentially saving hundreds of millions of dollars in datacenters. Our solution is almost free lunch and can be effortlessly adopted in datacenters as a new node-level power management layer.</description>

      <title>Chameleon: Adaptive Caching and Scheduling for Many-Adapter LLM Inference Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of LLMs has driven an exponential rise in their deployment, imposing substantial demands on inference clusters. These clusters must handle numerous concurrent queries for different LLM downstream tasks. To handle multi-task settings with vast LLM parameter counts, methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable task-specific fine-tuning while sharing most of the base LLM model across tasks. Hence, they allow concurrent task serving with minimal memory requirements. However, existing LLM serving systems face inefficiencies: they overlook workload heterogeneity, impose high link bandwidth from frequent adapter loading, and suffer from head-of-line blocking in their schedulers. To address these challenges, we present Chameleon, a novel LLM serving system optimized for many adapter environments, that relies on two core ideas: adapter caching and adapter-aware scheduling. First, Chameleon caches popular adapters in GPU memory, minimizing the adapter loading times. Importantly, it uses the otherwise idle GPU memory, avoiding extra memory costs. Second, Chameleon uses a non-preemptive multi-queue scheduling to efficiently account for workload heterogeneity. In this way, Chameleon simultaneously prevents head of line blocking and starvation. We implement Chameleon on top of a state-of-the-art LLM serving platform and evaluate it with real-world production traces and open-source LLMs. Under high loads, Chameleon reduces P99 and P50 TTFT latency by 80.7% and 48.1%, respectively, while improving throughput by 1.5x compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</description>
