      <title>Mean-Field Price Formation on Trees with a Network of Relative Performance Concerns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial firms and institutional investors are routinely evaluated based on their performance relative to their peers. These relative performance concerns significantly influence risk-taking behavior and market dynamics. While the literature studying Nash equilibrium under such relative performance competitions is extensive, its effect on asset price formation remains largely unexplored. This paper investigates mean-field equilibrium price formation of a single risky stock in a discrete-time market where agents exhibit exponential utility and relative performance concerns. Unlike existing literature that typically treats asset prices as exogenous, we impose a market-clearing condition to determine the price dynamics endogenously within a relative performance equilibrium. Using a binomial tree framework, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the market-clearing mean-field equilibrium in both single- and multi-population settings. Finally, we provide illustrative numerical examples demonstrating the equilibrium price distributions and agents' optimal position sizes.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Investment with Random Risk Aversion: (Non-)uniqueness, Optimality, and Comparative Statics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates infinite-dimensional portfolio selection problem under a general distribution of the risk aversion parameter. We provide a complete characterization of all deterministic equilibrium investment strategies. Our results reveal that the solution structure depends critically on the distribution of risk aversion: the equilibrium is unique whenever it exists in the case of finite expected risk aversion, whereas an infinite expectation can lead to infinitely many equilibria or to a unique trivial one (pi equals 0). To address this multiplicity, we introduce three optimality criteria-optimal, uniformly optimal, and uniformly strictly optimal-and explicitly characterize the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding equilibria. Under the same necessary and sufficient condition, the optimal and uniformly optimal equilibria exist uniquely and coincide. Furthermore, by additionally assuming that the market price of risk is non-zero near the terminal time, we show that the optimal (and hence uniformly optimal) equilibrium is also uniformly strictly optimal. Finally, we perform comparative statics to demonstrate that a risk aversion distribution dominating another in the reverse hazard rate order leads to a less aggressive equilibrium strategy.</description>

      <title>Robust SGLD algorithm for solving non-convex distributionally robust optimisation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09532v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) algorithm tailored for solving a certain class of non-convex distributionally robust optimisation (DRO) problems. By deriving non-asymptotic convergence bounds, we build an algorithm which for any prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon&gt;0$ outputs an estimator whose expected excess risk is at most $\varepsilon$. As a concrete application, we consider the problem of identifying the best non-linear estimator of a given regression model involving a neural network using adversarially corrupted samples. We formulate this problem as a DRO problem and demonstrate both theoretically and numerically the applicability of the proposed robust SGLD algorithm. Moreover, numerical experiments show that the robust SGLD estimator outperforms the estimator obtained using vanilla SGLD in terms of test accuracy, which highlights the advantage of incorporating model uncertainty when optimising with perturbed samples.</description>
