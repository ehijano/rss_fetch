      <title>Effect Size-Driven Pathway Meta-Analysis for Gene Expression Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of omics datasets in public repositories has created unprecedented opportunities for biomedical research but has also posed significant challenges for their integration, particularly due to missing genes and platform-specific discrepancies. Traditional gene expression metaanalysis often focuses on individual genes, leading to data loss and limited biological insights when there are missing genes across different studies. To address these limitations, we propose GSEMA (Gene Set Enrichment Meta-Analysis), a novel methodology that leverages singlesample enrichment scoring to aggregate gene expression data into pathway-level matrices. By applying meta-analysis techniques to enrichment scores, GSEMA preserves the magnitude and directionality of effects, enabling the definition of pathway activity across datasets. Using simulated data and case studies on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Parkinson's Disease (PD), we demonstrate that GSEMA outperforms other methods in controlling false positive rates while providing meaningful biological interpretations. GSEMA methodology is implemented as an R package available on CRAN repository</description>

      <title>SequenceLab: A Comprehensive Benchmark of Computational Methods for Comparing Genomic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16908</link>

Abstract: Computational complexity is a key limitation of genomic analyses. Thus, over the last 30 years, researchers have proposed numerous fast heuristic methods that provide computational relief. Comparing genomic sequences is one of the most fundamental computational steps in most genomic analyses. Due to its high computational complexity, optimized exact and heuristic algorithms are still being developed. We find that these methods are highly sensitive to the underlying data, its quality, and various hyperparameters. Despite their wide use, no in-depth analysis has been performed, potentially falsely discarding genetic sequences from further analysis and unnecessarily inflating computational costs. We provide the first analysis and benchmark of this heterogeneity. We deliver an actionable overview of the 11 most widely used state-of-the-art methods for comparing genomic sequences. We also inform readers about their advantages and downsides using thorough experimental evaluation and different real datasets from all major manufacturers (i.e., Illumina, ONT, and PacBio).

      <title>MetaTrinity: Enabling Fast Metagenomic Classification via Seed Counting and Edit Distance Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02029v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metagenomics, the study of genome sequences of diverse organisms cohabiting in a shared environment, has experienced significant advancements across various medical and biological fields. Metagenomic analysis is crucial, for instance, in clinical applications such as infectious disease screening and the diagnosis and early detection of diseases such as cancer. A key task in metagenomics is to determine the species present in a sample and their relative abundances. Currently, the field is dominated by either alignment-based tools, which offer high accuracy but are computationally expensive, or alignment-free tools, which are fast but lack the needed accuracy for many applications. In response to this dichotomy, we introduce MetaTrinity, a tool based on heuristics, to achieve a fundamental improvement in accuracy-runtime tradeoff over existing methods. We benchmark MetaTrinity against two leading metagenomic classifiers, each representing different ends of the performance-accuracy spectrum. On one end, Kraken2, a tool optimized for performance, shows modest accuracy yet a rapid runtime. The other end of the spectrum is governed by Metalign, a tool optimized for accuracy. Our evaluations show that MetaTrinity achieves an accuracy comparable to Metalign while gaining a 4x speedup without any loss in accuracy. This directly equates to a fourfold improvement in runtime-accuracy tradeoff. Compared to Kraken2, MetaTrinity requires a 5x longer runtime yet delivers a 17x improvement in accuracy. This demonstrates a 3.4x enhancement in the accuracy-runtime tradeoff for MetaTrinity. This dual comparison positions MetaTrinity as a broadly applicable solution for metagenomic classification, combining advantages of both ends of the spectrum: speed and accuracy. MetaTrinity is publicly available at https://github.com/CMU-SAFARI/MetaTrinity.</description>
