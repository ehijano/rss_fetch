      <title>Total Solar Eclipse White Light Images as a Benchmark for PFSS Coronal Magnetic Field Models: An In-Depth Analysis over a Solar Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) models are widely used to simulate coronal magnetic fields. PFSS models use the observed photospheric magnetic field as the inner boundary condition and assume a perfectly radial field beyond a ``Source Surface" ($R_{ss}$). At present, total solar eclipse (TSE) white light images are the only data that delineate the coronal magnetic field from the photosphere out to several solar radii ($R_\odot$). We utilize a complete solar cycle span of these images between 2008 and 2020 as a benchmark to assess the reliability of PFSS models. For a quantitative assessment, we apply a rolling Hough transform (RHT) to the eclipse data and corresponding PFFS models to measure the difference, $\Delta\theta$, between the data and model magnetic field lines throughout the corona. We find that the average $\Delta\theta$, $\langle\Delta\theta\rangle$, can be minimized for a given choice of $R_{ss}$ depending on the phase within a solar cycle. In particular, $R_{ss}\approx1.3 \ R_\odot$ is found to be optimal for solar maximum, while $R_{ss}\approx3 \ R_\odot$ yields a better match at solar minimum. However, large ($\langle\Delta\theta\rangle&gt;10^\circ$) discrepancies between TSE data and PFSS-generated coronal field lines remain regardless of the choice of source surface. Yet, implementation of solar cycle dependent $R_{ss}$ optimal values do yield more reliable PFSS-generated coronal field lines for use in models and for tracing in-situ measurements back to their sources at the Sun.</description>

      <title>Tidal Spin-up of Subdwarf B Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars are stripped helium-burning stars that are often found in close binaries, where they experience strong tidal interactions. The dissipation of tidally excited gravity waves alter their rotational evolution throughout the sdB lifetime. While many sdB binaries have well-measured rotational and orbital frequencies, there have been few theoretical efforts to accurately calculate the tidal torque produced by gravity waves. In this work, we directly calculate the tidal excitation of internal gravity waves in realistic sdB stellar models, and integrate the coupled spin-orbit evolution of sdB binaries. We find that for canonical sdB ($M_\mathrm{sdB}=0.47\,M_\odot$) binaries, the transitional orbital period below which they could reach tidal synchronization in the sdB lifetime is $\sim \! 0.2\;\mathrm{days}$, with weak dependence on the companion masses. For low-mass sdBs ($M_\mathrm{sdB}=0.37\,M_\odot$) formed from more massive progenitor stars, the transitional orbital period becomes $\sim \! 0.15\;\mathrm{days}$. These values are very similar to the tidal synchronization boundary ($\sim \! 0.2\;\mathrm{days}$) evident from observations. We discuss the dependence of tidal torques on stellar radii, and we make predictions for the rapidly rotating white dwarfs formed from synchronized sdB binaries.</description>

      <title>Assessing the capability of a model-based stellar XUV estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar XUV (X-ray and extreme ultraviolet) emission drives the heating and chemical reactions in planetary atmospheres and protoplanetary disks, and therefore, a proper estimation of a stellar XUV spectrum is required for their studies. One proposed solution is to estimate stellar atmospheric heating using numerical models, although the validation was restricted to the Sun over a limited parameter range. In this study, we extend the validation of the model by testing it with the Sun and three young, nearby solar-type stars with available XUV observational data. We first test the model with the solar observations, examining its accuracy in activity minimum and maximum phases, its dependence on loop length, the effect of loop length superposition, and its sensitivity to elemental abundance. We confirm that the model spectrum is mostly accurate both in activity minimum and maximum, although the high-energy X-rays (&lt; 1 nm) are underestimated in the activity maximum. Applying the model to young solar-type stars, we find that it can reproduce the observed XUV spectra within a factor of 3 in the range of 1-30 nm for stars with magnetic flux up to 100 times that of the Sun. For a star with 300 times the solar magnetic flux, although the raw numerical data show a systematically lower spectrum than observed, the spectra are in good agreement once corrected for the effect of insufficient resolution in the transition region. For all young solar-type stars, high-energy X-rays (&lt; 1 nm) are significantly underestimated, with the deviation increasing with stellar magnetic activity. Our findings indicate that the stellar XUV spectrum can be reasonably estimated through a numerical model, given that the essential input parameters (surface magnetic flux and elemental abundance) are known.</description>

      <title>The AMBRE Project: Lead abundance in Galactic stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemical evolution of neutron capture elements in the Milky Way is still a matter of debate. Although more and more studies investigate their chemical behaviour, there is still a lack of a significant large sample of abundances of a key heavy element: lead. Lead is the final product of the s-process nucleosynthesis channel and is one of the most stable heavy elements. We analysed high-resolution spectra from the ESO UVES and FEROS archives. Atmospheric parameters were taken from the AMBRE parametrisation. We used the automated abundance method GAUGUIN to derive lead abundances in 653 slow-rotating FGK-type stars from the 368.34nm Pb I line. We present the largest catalogue of homogeneous LTE and non-LTE lead abundances ever published with metallicities ranging from -2.9 to 0.6dex and [Pb/Fe] from -0.7 to 3.3dex. Within this sample, no lead-enhanced Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars were found, but nine lead-enhanced metal-poor stars ([Pb/Fe] &gt; 1.5) were detected. Most of them were already identified as carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars with enrichments in other s-process species. The lead abundance of 13 Gaia Benchmark Stars are also provided. We then investigated the Pb content of the Milky Way disc by computing vertical and radial gradients and found a slightly decreasing [Pb/Fe] radial trend with metallicity. This trend together with other related ratios ([Pb/Eu], [Pb/Ba], and [Pb/alpha]) are interpreted thanks to chemical evolution models. The two-infall model closely reproduces the observed trends with respect to the metallicity. It is also found that the AGB contribution to the Pb Galactic enrichment has to be strongly reduced. Moreover, the contribution of massive stars with rather high rotational velocities should be favoured in the low-metallicity regime.</description>

      <title>Discs are born eccentric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations have begun probing the early phases of disc formation, but little data yet exists on disc structure and morphology of Class 0 objects. Using simulations, we are able to lay out predictions of disc morphologies expected in future surveys of young discs. Based on detailed simulations of ab initio star formation by core collapse, we predict that early discs must be eccentric. In this letter, we study the morphology and, in particular, the eccentricity of discs formed in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) collapse simulations. We attempt to show that discs formed by cloud collapse are likely to be eccentric. We ran non-ideal MHD collapse simulations in the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES with radiative transfer. We used state-of-the-art analysis methods to measure the disc eccentricity. We find that despite no asymmetry in the initial conditions, the discs formed are eccentric, with eccentricities on the order of 0.1. These results may have important implications for protoplanetary disc dynamics and planet formation. The presence of eccentricity in young discs that is not seen at later stages of disc evolution is in tension with current viscous eccentricity damping models. This implies that there may be an as-yet undiscovered circularisation mechanism in circumstellar discs.</description>

      <title>The curious case of 2MASS J15594729+4403595, an ultra-fast M2 dwarf with possible Rieger cycles</title>

Abstract: RACE-OC (Rotation and ACtivity Evolution in Open Clusters) is a project aimed at characterising the rotational and magnetic activity properties of the late-type members of open clusters, stellar associations, and moving groups of different ages. As part of this project, in the present paper we present the results of an investigation of a likely member of the AB Doradus association, the M-type star 2MASS J15594729+4403595.} {In the present study, we aim to reveal the real nature of our target, which turned out to be a hierarchical triple system, to derive the stellar rotation period and surface differential rotation, and to characterise its photospheric magnetic activity.} {We have collected radial velocity and photometric time series, complemented with archive data, to determine the orbital parameters and the rotation period and we have used the spot modelling technique to explore what causes its photometric variability. \rm } {We found 2MASS J15594729 +4403595 to be a hierarchical triple system consisting of a dwarf, SB1 M2, and a companion, M8. The M2 star has a rotation period of P = 0.37\,d, making it the fastest among M-type members of AB Dor. The most relevant result is the detection of a periodic variation in the spotted area on opposite stellar hemispheres, which resembles a sort of Rossby wave or Rieger-like cycles on an extremely short timescale. Another interesting result is the occurrence of a highly significant photometric periodicity, P = 0.443\,d, which may be related to the stellar rotation in terms of either a Rossby wave or surface differential rotation.} {2MASS J15594729+4403595 may be the prototype of a new class of extremely fast rotating stars exibiting short Rieger-like cycles. We shall further explore what may drive these short-duration cycles and we shall also search for similar stars to allow for a statistical analysis.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Mass Loss in Binary Stars. V. Effects of Metallicity and Nonconservative Mass Transfer -- Application in High Mass X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary stars are responsible for many unusual astrophysical phenomena, including some important explosive cosmic events. The stability criteria for rapid mass transfer and common-envelope evolution are fundamental to binary star evolution. They determine the mass, mass ratio, and orbital distribution of systems such as X-ray binaries and merging gravitational-wave sources. We use our adiabatic mass-loss model to systematically survey metal-poor and solar-metallicity donor thresholds for dynamical timescale mass transfer. The critical mass ratios qad are systematically explored, and the impact of metallicity and nonconservative mass transfer are studied. For metal-poor radiative-envelope donors, qad are smaller than those for solar-metallicity stars at the same evolutionary stage. However, qad do the opposite for convective-envelope donors. Nonconservative mass transfer significantly decreases qad for massive donors. This is because it matters how conservative mass transfer is during the thermal timescale phase immediately preceding a delayed dynamical mass transfer. We apply our theoretical predictions to observed high-mass X-ray binaries that have overfilled their Roche lobes and find a good agreement with their mass ratios. Our results can be applied to study individual binary objects or large samples of binary objects with binary population synthesis codes.</description>

      <title>Irradiation-driven mass transfer for massive companion stars in supersoft X-rays sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) have been proposed as one of the progenitors for Type Ia supernovae. However, the exact origin of the quasi-periodic variability in the optical light curve remains a mystery.In this work, our goal is to investigate the effect of the feedback of an evolved main-sequence companion star on X-ray irradiation and find whether periodic X-ray irradiation of the companion star could reproduce periodic mass transfer.Using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) code, we modeled the evolutionary track of the companion star under the influence of supersoft X-ray irradiation, and we calculated the resulting mass transfer rate. We find that the supersoft X-ray heating of the companion star can result in the expansion of the companion, causing it to greatly overflow its Roche lobe and thereby increasing the mass transfer rate. The periodic X-ray irradiation on the companion stars leads to periodic changes in the mass transfer rate. For a given companion star, higher irradiation efficiencies result in a higher mass transfer rate. Additionally, the mass transfer rate increases as the mass of the companion star decreases for a given irradiation efficiency. The companion star undergoing thermal timescale mass transfer is periodically irradiated by the X-rays from the WD, which can lead to periodic enhancement of the mass transfer rate. The mechanism could be the origin of the quasi-periodic optical light curve in supersoft X-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Realising efficient computation of individual frequencies for red-giant models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to improve the asteroseismic modelling efforts for red-giant stars, the numerical computation of theoretical individual oscillation modes for evolved red-giant models has to be made feasible. We aim to derive a method for circumventing the computational cost of computing oscillation spectra for models of red-giant stars with an average large frequency separation $\Delta\nu&lt;15$ $\mu$Hz, thereby allowing for asteroseismic investigations of giants utilising individual frequencies. The proposed Truncated Scanning Method serves as a novel method detailing how the observable individual $l=0,1,2$ frequencies of red giants may be computed on realistic timescales through so-called model truncation. By carefully removing the innermost region of the stellar models, the g-mode influence on the oscillation spectra may be avoided, allowing estimation of the observable regions from the resulting pure p-mode oscillations. The appropriate observable frequency regions are subsequently scanned for the complete and un-truncated stellar model. The observable regions are determined by considering the limitations on observability from the internal mode coupling and damping, yielding consistent frequency spectra obtained at a much reduced computational cost. The Truncated Scanning Method proves the feasibility of obtaining the individual frequencies of red-giant models for a wide range of applications and research, demonstrating an improved computational efficiency by a factor of 10 or better. This means that the inclusion of $l=1,2$ individual frequencies is now a possibility in future asteroseismic modelling efforts of red-giant stars. Further potential avenues for improvements to this method are outlined for future pursuits.</description>

      <title>Magnetic activity under tidal influences in the 2+2~hierarchical quadruple system V815 Herculis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal forces in close binaries and multiple systems that contain magnetically active component are supposed to influence the operation of magnetic dynamo. Through synchronization the tidal effect of a close companion helps maintain fast rotation, thus supporting an efficient dynamo. At the same time, it can also suppress the differential rotation of the convection zone, or even force the formation of active longitudes at certain phases fixed to the orbit. V815 Her is a four-star system consisting of two close binaries orbiting each other, one of which contains an active G-type main-sequence star. Therefore, the system offers an excellent opportunity to investigate the influence of gravitational effects on solar-type magnetic activity using different methods.</description>

      <title>SPH modelling of AGB wind morphology in hierarchical triple systems \&amp; comparison to observation of R Aql</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymmetric 3D structures are observed in the outflows of evolved low- and intermediate-mass stars, and are believed to be shaped through the interaction of companions that are hidden within the dense wind. We investigate how triple systems can shape the outflow of AGB stars. We focus on coplanar systems in a hierarchical, stable orbit, consisting of an AGB star with one relatively close companion, and one at large orbital separation. We model a grid of hierarchical triple systems including a wind-launching AGB star, with the smoothed-particle-hydrodynamic Phantom code. We vary the outer companion mass, the AGB wind velocity and the orbital eccentricities to study the impact of these parameters on the wind morphology. Further, we investigate if the outflow of the AGB star R Aql could be shaped by a triple system, by post-processing one of our triple models with a radiative transfer routine, and comparing this to data of the ALMA ATOMIUM programme. The characteristic wind structures resulting from a hierarchical triple system are the following. A large two-edged spiral wake results behind the outer companion star. This structure lies on top of the spiral structure formed by the close binary, which is affected by the orbital motion around the system centre-of-mass. This dense inner spiral pattern interacts with, and strongly impacts, the spiral wake of the outer companion, resulting in a waved-pattern on the outer edge of this spiral wake. From the comparison of our models to the observations of R Aql, we conclude that this circumstellar environment might be shaped by a similar system as the ones modelled in this work, but an elaborate study of the observational data is needed to determine better the orbital parameters and characteristics of the central system.</description>

      <title>A machine learning approach for computing solar flare locations in X-rays on-board Solar Orbiter/STIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on-board the ESA Solar Orbiter mission retrieves the coordinates of solar flare locations by means of a specific sub-collimator, named the Coarse Flare Locator (CFL). When a solar flare occurs on the Sun, the emitted X-ray radiation casts the shadow of a peculiar "H-shaped" tungsten grid over the CFL X-ray detector. From measurements of the areas of the detector that are illuminated by the X-ray radiation, it is possible to retrieve the $(x,y)$ coordinates of the flare location on the solar disk.
  In this paper, we train a neural network on a dataset of real CFL observations to estimate the coordinates of solar flare locations. Further, we apply a post-training quantization technique specifically tailored to the adopted model architecture. This technique allows all computations to be in integer arithmetic at inference time, making the model compatible with the STIX computational requirements. We show that our model outperforms the currently adopted algorithm for estimating the flare locations from CFL data regarding prediction accuracy while requiring fewer parameters. We finally discuss possible future applications of the proposed model on-board STIX.</description>

      <title>Orbital Dynamics of the Solar Basin</title>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of the solar basin -- the accumulated population of weakly-interacting particles on bound orbits in the Solar System. We focus on particles starting off on Sun-crossing orbits, corresponding to initial conditions of production inside the Sun, and investigate their evolution over the age of the Solar System. A combination of analytic methods, secular perturbation theory, and direct numerical integration of orbits sheds light on the long- and short-term evolution of a population of test particles orbiting the Sun and perturbed by the planets. Our main results are that the effective lifetime of a solar basin at Earth's location is $\tau_{\rm eff} = 1.20\pm 0.09 \,\mathrm{Gyr}$, and that there is annual (semi-annual) modulation of the basin density with known phase and amplitude at the fractional level of 6.5% (2.2%). These results have important implications for direct detection searches of solar basin particles, and the strong temporal modulation signature yields a robust discovery channel. Our simulations can also be interpreted in the context of gravitational capture of dark matter in the Solar System, with consequences for any dark-matter phenomenon that may occur below the local escape velocity.</description>

      <title>Investigating cannibalistic millisecond pulsar binaries using MESA: new constraints from pulsar spin and mass evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compact binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs), with orbital periods $\lesssim1$d, are key to understanding binary evolution involving massive neutron stars (NSs). Due to ablation of the companion by the rapidly spinning pulsar, these systems are also known as spiders, categorized into two main branches: redbacks (RBs; companion mass in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 M$_{\odot}$) and black widows (BWs; companion mass $\lesssim$ 0.1 M$_{\odot}$). We present models of low- and intermediate-mass X-ray binaries (XRBs) and compare them with observations of Galactic spiders (including the presence/absence of hydrogen lines in their optical spectra). We constrain and quantify the interaction between pulsar and companion. Using MESA, we create the allowed initial parameter space, modeling the irradiation of the companion by the pulsar wind. For the first time in MESA, we include the detailed evolution of the pulsar spin. Efficient mass accretion onto the NS ($70\%$ of mass transferred) with an X-ray irradiated disc, followed by strong irradiation of the companion can explain most properties of the observed spiders. Our RBs continue to the BW regime, connecting the two branches of spiders. Our models explain the lack of hydrogen in some observed BWs with ultra-light companions. The mass required to spin-up a NS to sub-milliseconds is high enough to collapse it into a black hole. Finally, we discuss the formation of RB-like spiders with giant companions and orbital periods of several days (huntsmen) showing that they are unlikely to produce super-massive NSs (maximum accreted mass $\lesssim$0.5 M$_{\odot}$). Cannibalistic MSP binary formation depends heavily on the interplay between accretion onto the pulsar and pulsar wind irradiation. Our work supports earlier claims that RBs evolve into BWs. We also show that the fastest-spinning pulsars may collapse before reaching sub-millisecond spin periods.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Outcomes of Stellar Evolution in the Disks of Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The disks of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are expected to be populated by numerous stars, either formed in the outer regions of the disk via gravitational instability, or captured from the nearby nuclear star cluster. Regardless of their formation mechanism, these stars experience altered evolutionary paths, mostly shaped by the accretion of dense disk material. In this study, through the comparison of different timescales, we chart the evolutionary outcomes of these AGN stars as a function of disk radius and across a range of supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, spanning from $10^6$ to $10^9 \rm M_\odot$, for two popular AGN disk models. We find that, in the outer regions of the disk, stars evolve similarly to those in the interstellar medium, but in the inner and denser regions accretion quickly turns low-mass stars into massive stars, and their fate depends on just how quickly they accrete. If accretion occurs at a faster rate than nuclear burning, they can reach a quasi-steady `immortal' state. If stars accrete faster than they can thermally adjust, runaway accretion occurs, potentially preventing a quasi-steady state and altering the disk structure. During the AGN lifetime, in the regions of the disk that produce massive stars, supernovae (SNe) and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) may occur within the disk over a wide range of optical depths and ambient densities. Subsequently, in the final phase of the AGN, as the disk becomes depleted, formerly immortal stars will be unable to replenish their fuel, leading to additional SNe and GRBs.</description>

      <title>Cataclysmic Variables and AM CVn Binaries in SRG/eROSITA + Gaia: Volume Limited Samples, X-ray Luminosity Functions, and Space Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present volume-limited samples of cataclysmic variables (CVs) and AM CVn binaries jointly selected from SRG/eROSITA eRASS1 and \textit{Gaia} DR3 using an X-ray + optical color-color diagram (the ``X-ray Main Sequence"). This tool identifies all CV subtypes, including magnetic and low-accretion rate systems, in contrast to most previous surveys. We find 23 CVs, 3 of which are AM CVns, out to 150 pc in the Western Galactic Hemisphere. Our 150 pc sample is spectroscopically verified and complete down to $L_X = 1.3\times 10^{29} \;\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$ in the 0.2--2.3 keV band, and we also present CV candidates out to 300 pc and 1000 pc. We discovered two previously unknown systems in our 150 pc sample: the third nearest AM CVn and a magnetic period bouncer. We find the mean $L_X$ of CVs to be $\langle L_X \rangle \approx 4.6\times 10^{30} \;\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$, in contrast to previous surveys which yielded $\langle L_X \rangle \sim 10^{31}-10^{32} \;\textrm{erg s}^{-1}$. We construct X-ray luminosity functions that, for the first time, flatten out at $L_X\sim 10^{30} \; \textrm{erg s}^{-1}$. We find average number, mass, and luminosity densities of $\rho_\textrm{N, CV} = (3.7 \pm 0.7) \times 10^{-6} \textrm{pc}^{-3}$, $\rho_M = (5.0 \pm 1.0) \times 10^{-5} M_\odot^{-1}$, and $\rho_{L_X} = (2.3 \pm 0.4) \times 10^{26} \textrm{erg s}^{-1}M_\odot^{-1}$, respectively, in the solar neighborhood. Our uniform selection method also allows us to place meaningful estimates on the space density of AM CVns, $\rho_\textrm{N, AM CVn} = (5.5 \pm 3.7) \times 10^{-7} \textrm{pc}^{-3}$. Magnetic CVs and period bouncers make up $35\%$ and $25\%$ of our sample, respectively. This work, through a novel discovery technique, shows that the observed number densities of CVs and AM CVns, as well as the fraction of period bouncers, are still in tension with population synthesis estimates.</description>

      <title>HR-GO I: Comprehensive NLTE abundance analysis of the Cetus stream</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxy streams encode vast amounts of information essential to understanding early galaxy formation and nucleosynthesis channels. Due to the variation in the timescales of star formation history in their progenitors, stellar streams serve as `snapshots' that record different stages of galactic chemical evolution. This study focusses on the Cetus stream, stripped from a low-mass dwarf galaxy. We carried out a comprehensive analysis of the chemical composition of 22 member stars based on their high-resolution spectra. We derived abundances for up to 28 chemical species from C to Dy and, for 20 of them, we account for the departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium. We confirm that the Cetus stream has a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] = $-2.11$ $\pm$ 0.21. All observed Cetus stars are $\alpha$ enhanced with [$\alpha$/Fe] $\simeq$ 0.3. The absence of the $\alpha$-`knee' implies that star formation stopped before iron production in type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) became substantial. Neutron capture element abundances suggest that both the rapid (r-) and the main slow (s-) processes contributed to their origin. The decrease in [Eu/Ba] from a typical r-process value of [Eu/Ba] = 0.7 to 0.3 with increasing [Ba/H] indicates a distinct contribution of the r- and s-processes to the chemical composition of different Cetus stars. For barium, the r-process contribution varies from 100 % to 20 % in different sample stars, with an average value of 50 %. Our abundance analysis indicates that the star formation in the Cetus progenitor ceased after the onset of the main s-process in low- to intermediate-mass asymptotic giant branch stars but before SNe Ia played an important role. A distinct evolution scenario is revealed by comparing the abundances in the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, showing the diversity in the chemical evolution of low-mass dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>The Application of Machine Learning in Tidal Evolution Simulation of Star-Planet Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the release of a large amount of astronomical data, an increasing number of close-in hot Jupiters have been discovered. Calculating their evolutionary curves using star-planet interaction models presents a challenge. To expedite the generation of evolutionary curves for these close-in hot Jupiter systems, we utilized tidal interaction models established on MESA to create 15,745 samples of star-planet systems and 7,500 samples of stars. Additionally, we employed a neural network (Multi-Layer Perceptron - MLP) to predict the evolutionary curves of the systems, including stellar effective temperature, radius, stellar rotation period, and planetary orbital period. The median relative errors of the predicted evolutionary curves were found to be 0.15%, 0.43%, 2.61%, and 0.57%, respectively. Furthermore, the speed at which we generate evolutionary curves exceeds that of model-generated curves by more than four orders of magnitude. We also extracted features of planetary migration states and utilized lightGBM to classify the samples into 6 categories for prediction. We found that by combining three types that undergo long-term double synchronization into one label, the classifier effectively recognized these features. Apart from systems experiencing long-term double synchronization, the median relative errors of the predicted evolutionary curves were all below 4%. Our work provides an efficient method to save significant computational resources and time with minimal loss in accuracy. This research also lays the foundation for analyzing the evolutionary characteristics of systems under different migration states, aiding in the understanding of the underlying physical mechanisms of such systems. Finally, to a large extent, our approach could replace the calculations of theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Dust mineralogy and variability of the inner PDS 70 disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inner disk of the young star PDS 70 may be a site of rocky planet formation, with two giant planets detected further out. Solids in the inner disk may inform us about the origin of this inner disk water and nature of the dust in the rocky planet-forming regions. We aim to constrain the chemical composition, lattice structure, and grain sizes of small silicate grains in the inner disk of PDS 70, observed both in JWST/MIRI MRS and Spitzer IRS. We use a dust fitting model, called DuCK, based on a two-layer disk model. We use Gaussian Random Field and Distribution of Hollow Spheres models to obtain two sets of dust opacities. The third set of opacities is obtained from aerosol spectroscopy. We use stoichiometric amorphous silicates, forsterite, and enstatite in our analysis. We also used iron-rich and magnesium-rich amorphous silicate and fayalite dust species to study the iron content. The Gaussian Random Field opacity agrees well with the observed spectrum. In both MIRI and Spitzer spectra, amorphous silicates are the dominant dust species. Crystalline silicates are dominated by iron-poor olivine. We do not find strong evidence for enstatite. Moreover, the MIRI spectrum indicates larger grain sizes than the Spitzer spectrum, indicating a time-variable small grain reservoir. The inner PDS 70 disk is dominated by a variable reservoir of optically thin warm amorphous silicates. We suggest that the small grains detected in the inner PDS 70 disk are likely transported inward from the outer disk as a result of filtration and fragmentation at the ice line. In addition, the variation between MIRI and Spitzer data can be explained by the grain growth over 15 years and a dynamical inner disk where opacity changes occur resulting from the highly variable hot innermost dust reservoir.</description>

      <title>Can gap-edge illumination excite spirals in protoplanetary disks? Three-temperature radiation hydrodynamics and NIR image modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of high-resolution, near-infrared instruments such as VLT/SPHERE and Gemini/GPI has helped uncover a wealth of substructure in planet-forming disks, including large, prominent spiral arms in MWC 758, SAO 206462, and V1247 Ori among others. In the classical theory of disk-planet interaction, these arms are consistent with Lindblad-resonance driving by multi-Jupiter-mass companions. Despite improving detection limits, evidence for such massive bodies in connection with spiral substructure has been inconclusive. In search of an alternative explanation, we use the PLUTO code to run 3D hydrodynamical simulations with two comparatively low planet masses (Saturn-mass, Jupiter-mass) and two thermodynamic prescriptions (three-temperature radiation hydrodynamics, and the more traditional $\beta$-cooling) in a low-mass disk. In the radiative cases, an $m = 2$ mode, potentially attributable to the interaction of stellar radiation with gap-edge asymmetries, creates an azimuthal pressure gradient, which in turn gives rise to prominent spiral arms in the upper layers of the disk. Monte Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) post-processing with RADMC3D reveals that in near-infrared scattered light, these gap-edge spirals are significantly more prominent than the traditional Lindblad spirals for planets in the mass range tested. Our results demonstrate that even intermediate-mass protoplanets -- less detectable, but more ubiquitous, than super-Jupiters -- are capable of indirectly inducing large-scale spiral disk features, and underscore the importance of including radiation physics in efforts to reproduce observations.</description>

      <title>How can an extra dimension affect compact star observables in the Klauza-Klein model?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theoretical framework for calculating the mass-radius curve of compact stars in the Kaluza-Klein space-time is introduced, with one additional compact spatial dimension. Static, spherically symmetric solutions are considered, with the equation of state provided by a zero temperature, interacting multidimensional Fermi gas. To model the strong force between baryons, a repulsive potential is introduced, which is linear in the particle number density. The maximal mass of compact stars is calculated for different model parameters, and with a physical parameter choice, it satisfies observational data, meaning that it is possible to model simple, realistic objects within this framework. Based on this comparison, a limiting size for the observational regime of extra dimensions in compact stars is provided, with $r_c \gtrsim 0.2$~fm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present simultaneous X-ray polarimetric and spectral observations of the bright atoll source Ser~X-1 carried out with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE), NICER, and NuSTAR. We obtain an upper limit of 2% (99% confidence level) on the polarization degree in the 2--8 keV energy band. We detect four type-I X-ray bursts, two of which during the IXPE observation. This is the first time that has IXPE observed type-I X-ray bursts, and it allows us to place an upper limit on their polarization degree; however, due to the limited total number of counts in each burst, we obtain a relatively high upper limit (80%). We confirm the presence of reflection features in the X-ray spectrum, notably a broad iron line. Fitting the data with a relativistic reflection model, we derive a disk inclination of 25 deg. The spectral and polarization properties are comparable with other atolls observed by IXPE, suggesting a similar accretion geometry, and the relatively low polarization is consistent with the low inclination.</description>

Abstract: Asteroseismology of dwarf stars cooler than the Sun is very challenging due to the low amplitudes and rapid timescales of oscillations. Here, we present the asteroseismic detection of solar-like oscillations at 4-minute timescales ($\nu_{\mathrm{max}}\sim4300\mu$Hz) in the nearby K-dwarf $\sigma$ Draconis using extreme precision Doppler velocity observations from the Keck Planet Finder and 20-second cadence photometry from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The star is the coolest dwarf star to date with both velocity and luminosity observations of solar-like oscillations, having amplitudes of $5.9\pm0.8\,$cm$\,\text{s}^{-1}$ and $0.8\pm0.2$ ppm, respectively. These measured values are in excellent agreement with established luminosity-velocity amplitude relations for oscillations and provide further evidence that mode amplitudes for stars with $T_{\mathrm{eff}}&lt;\,5500\,$K diminish in scale following a $(L/M)^{1.5}$ relation. By modeling the star's oscillation frequencies from photometric data, we measure an asteroseismic age of $4.5\pm0.9\,\rm{(ran)} \pm 1.2\,\rm{(sys)}$ Gyr. The observations demonstrate the capability of next-generation spectrographs and precise space-based photometry to extend observational asteroseismology to nearby cool dwarfs, which are benchmarks for stellar astrophysics and prime targets for directly imaging planets using future space-based telescopes.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates orbital parallax in gravitational microlensing events, focusing on OGLE-2017-BLG-0103 and OGLE-2017-BLG-0192. For events with timescales $\leq$ 60 days, a Jerk Parallax degeneracy arises due to high Jerk velocity ($\tilde{v_{j}}$), causing a four-fold continuous parallax degeneracy. OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, after incorporating orbital parallax, reveals four discrete degenerate parallax solutions, while OGLE-2017-BLG-0192 exhibits four discrete solutions without degeneracy. {The asymmetric light curve of OGLE-2017-BLG-0103 suggests a more probable model where xallarap is added to the parallax model, introducing tension. The galactic model analysis predicts a very low mass stellar lens for OGLE-2017-BLG-0192. For OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, degenerate solutions suggest a low-mass star or a darker lens in the disc, while the Xallarap+Parallax model also predicts a stellar lens in the bulge, with the source being a solar-type star orbited by a dwarf star.} This study presents five degenerate solutions for OGLE-2017-BLG-0103, emphasizing the potential for confirmation through high-resolution Adaptive Optics (AO) observations with Extremely Large Telescopes in the future. The complexities of degenerate scenarios in these microlensing events underscore the need to analyze special single-lens events in the Roman Telescope Era.</description>
