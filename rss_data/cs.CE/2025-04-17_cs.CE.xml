      <title>A viscoplasticity model with an invariant-based non-Newtonian flow rule for unidirectional thermoplastic composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A three-dimensional mesoscopic viscoplasticity model for simulating rate-dependent plasticity and creep in unidirectional thermoplastic composites is presented. The constitutive model is a transversely isotropic extension of an isotropic finite strain viscoplasticity model for neat polymers. Rate-dependent plasticity and creep are described by a non-Newtonian flow rule where the viscosity of the material depends on an equivalent stress measure through an Eyring-type relation. In the present formulation, transverse isotropy is incorporated by defining the equivalent stress measure and flow rule as functions of transversely isotropic stress invariants. In addition, the Eyring-type viscosity function is extended with anisotropic pressure dependence. As a result of the formulation, plastic flow in fiber direction is effectively excluded and pressure dependence of the polymer matrix is accounted for. The re-orientation of the transversely isotropic plane during plastic deformations is incorporated in the constitutive equations, allowing for an accurate large deformation response. The formulation is fully implicit and a consistent linearization of the algorithmic constitutive equations is performed to derive the consistent tangent modulus. The performance of the mesoscopic constitutive model is assessed through a comparison with a micromechanical model for carbon/PEEK, with the original isotropic viscoplastic version for the polymer matrix and with hyperelastic fibers. The micromodel is first used to determine the material parameters of the mesoscale model with a few stress-strain curves. It is demonstrated that the mesoscale model gives a similar response to the micromodel under various loading conditions. Finally, the mesoscale model is validated against off-axis experiments on unidirectional thermoplastic composite plies.</description>

      <title>Deep Material Network: Overview, applications and current directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Material Network (DMN) has emerged as a powerful framework for multiscale material modeling, enabling efficient and accurate predictions of material behavior across different length scales. Unlike traditional machine learning approaches, the trainable parameters in DMN have direct physical interpretations, capturing the geometric characteristics of the microstructure rather than serving as purely statistical fitting parameters. Its hierarchical tree structure effectively encodes microstructural interactions and deformation mechanisms, allowing DMN to achieve a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This physics-informed architecture significantly reduces computational costs compared to direct numerical simulations while preserving essential microstructural physics. Furthermore, DMN can be trained solely on a linear elastic dataset while effectively extrapolating nonlinear responses during online prediction, making it a highly efficient and scalable approach for multiscale material modeling. This article provides a comprehensive review of DMN, detailing its motivation, underlying methodology, and recent advancements. We discuss key modeling aspects, including its hierarchical structure, training process, and the role of physics-based constraints in enhancing predictive accuracy. Furthermore, we highlight its applications in component-scale multiscale analysis and inverse parameter identification, demonstrating its capability to bridge microscale material behavior with macroscale engineering predictions. Finally, we discuss challenges and future directions in improving DMN's generalization capabilities and its potential extensions for broader applications in multiscale modeling.</description>

      <title>Topological Analysis of Mixer Activities in the Bitcoin Network</title>

Abstract: Cryptocurrency users increasingly rely on obfuscation techniques such as mixers, swappers, and decentralised or no-KYC exchanges to protect their anonymity. However, at the same time, these services are exploited by criminals to conceal and launder illicit funds. Among obfuscation services, mixers remain one of the most challenging entities to tackle. This is because their owners are often unwilling to cooperate with Law Enforcement Agencies, and technically, they operate as 'black boxes'. To better understand their functionalities, this paper proposes an approach to analyse the operations of mixers by examining their address-transaction graphs and identifying topological similarities to uncover common patterns that can define the mixer's modus operandi. The approach utilises community detection algorithms to extract dense topological structures and clustering algorithms to group similar communities. The analysis is further enriched by incorporating data from external sources related to known Exchanges, in order to understand their role in mixer operations. The approach is applied to dissect the Blender.io mixer activities within the Bitcoin blockchain, revealing: i) consistent structural patterns across address-transaction graphs; ii) that Exchanges play a key role, following a well-established pattern, which raises several concerns about their AML/KYC policies. This paper represents an initial step toward dissecting and understanding the complex nature of mixer operations in cryptocurrency networks and extracting their modus operandi.</description>

      <title>SAGEPhos: Sage Bio-Coupled and Augmented Fusion for Phosphorylation Site Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phosphorylation site prediction based on kinase-substrate interaction plays a vital role in understanding cellular signaling pathways and disease mechanisms. Computational methods for this task can be categorized into kinase-family-focused and individual kinase-targeted approaches. Individual kinase-targeted methods have gained prominence for their ability to explore a broader protein space and provide more precise target information for kinase inhibitors. However, most existing individual kinase-based approaches focus solely on sequence inputs, neglecting crucial structural information. To address this limitation, we introduce SAGEPhos (Structure-aware kinAse-substrate bio-coupled and bio-auGmented nEtwork for Phosphorylation site prediction), a novel framework that modifies the semantic space of main protein inputs using auxiliary inputs at two distinct modality levels. At the inter-modality level, SAGEPhos introduces a Bio-Coupled Modal Fusion method, distilling essential kinase sequence information to refine task-oriented local substrate feature space, creating a shared semantic space that captures crucial kinase-substrate interaction patterns. Within the substrate's intra-modality domain, it focuses on Bio-Augmented Fusion, emphasizing 2D local sequence information while selectively incorporating 3D spatial information from predicted structures to complement the sequence space. Moreover, to address the lack of structural information in current datasets, we contribute a new, refined phosphorylation site prediction dataset, which incorporates crucial structural elements and will serve as a new benchmark for the field. Experimental results demonstrate that SAGEPhos significantly outperforms baseline methods. We release the SAGEPhos models and code at https://github.com/ZhangJJ26/SAGEPhos.</description>

      <title>QPET: A Versatile and Portable Quantity-of-Interest-Preservation Framework for Error-Bounded Lossy Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Error-bounded lossy compression has been widely adopted in many scientific domains because it can address the challenges in storing, transferring, and analyzing unprecedented amounts of scientific data. Although error-bounded lossy compression offers general data distortion control by enforcing strict error bounds on raw data, it may fail to meet the quality requirements on the results of downstream analysis, a.k.a. Quantities of Interest (QoIs), derived from raw data. This may lead to uncertainties and even misinterpretations in scientific discoveries, significantly limiting the use of lossy compression in practice. In this paper, we propose QPET, a novel, versatile, and portable framework for QoI-preserving error-bounded lossy compression, which overcomes the challenges of modeling diverse QoIs by leveraging numerical strategies. QPET features (1) high portability to multiple existing lossy compressors, (2) versatile preservation to most differentiable univariate and multivariate QoIs, and (3) significant compression improvements in QoI-preservation tasks. Experiments with six real-world datasets demonstrate that integrating QPET into state-of-the-art error-bounded lossy compressors can gain 2x to 10x compression speedups of existing QoI-preserving error-bounded lossy compression solutions, up to 1000% compression ratio improvements to general-purpose compressors, and up to 133% compression ratio improvements to existing QoI-integrated scientific compressors.</description>
