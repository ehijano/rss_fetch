      <title>Pre-Sorted Tsetlin Machine (The Genetic K-Medoid Method)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a machine learning pre-sort stage to traditional supervised learning using Tsetlin Machines. Initially, N data-points are identified from the dataset using an expedited genetic algorithm to solve the maximum dispersion problem. These are then used as the initial placement to run the K-Medoid clustering algorithm. Finally, an expedited genetic algorithm is used to align N independent Tsetlin Machines by maximising hamming distance. For MNIST level classification problems, results demonstrate up to 10% improvement in accuracy, approx. 383X reduction in training time and approx. 86X reduction in inference time.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multiplayer Battle Game Optimizer for Adversarial Robust Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel metaheuristic algorithm, known as the efficient multiplayer battle game optimizer (EMBGO), specifically designed for addressing complex numerical optimization tasks. The motivation behind this research stems from the need to rectify identified shortcomings in the original MBGO, particularly in search operators during the movement phase, as revealed through ablation experiments. EMBGO mitigates these limitations by integrating the movement and battle phases to simplify the original optimization framework and improve search efficiency. Besides, two efficient search operators: differential mutation and L\'evy flight are introduced to increase the diversity of the population. To evaluate the performance of EMBGO comprehensively and fairly, numerical experiments are conducted on benchmark functions such as CEC2017, CEC2020, and CEC2022, as well as engineering problems. Twelve well-established MA approaches serve as competitor algorithms for comparison. Furthermore, we apply the proposed EMBGO to the complex adversarial robust neural architecture search (ARNAS) tasks and explore its robustness and scalability. The experimental results and statistical analyses confirm the efficiency and effectiveness of EMBGO across various optimization tasks. As a potential optimization technique, EMBGO holds promise for diverse applications in real-world problems and deep learning scenarios. The source code of EMBGO is made available in \url{https://github.com/RuiZhong961230/EMBGO}.</description>

      <title>Emotional Intelligence Through Artificial Intelligence : NLP and Deep Learning in the Analysis of Healthcare Texts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript presents a methodical examination of the utilization of Artificial Intelligence in the assessment of emotions in texts related to healthcare, with a particular focus on the incorporation of Natural Language Processing and deep learning technologies. We scrutinize numerous research studies that employ AI to augment sentiment analysis, categorize emotions, and forecast patient outcomes based on textual information derived from clinical narratives, patient feedback on medications, and online health discussions. The review demonstrates noteworthy progress in the precision of algorithms used for sentiment classification, the prognostic capabilities of AI models for neurodegenerative diseases, and the creation of AI-powered systems that offer support in clinical decision-making. Remarkably, the utilization of AI applications has exhibited an enhancement in personalized therapy plans by integrating patient sentiment and contributing to the early identification of mental health disorders. There persist challenges, which encompass ensuring the ethical application of AI, safeguarding patient confidentiality, and addressing potential biases in algorithmic procedures. Nevertheless, the potential of AI to revolutionize healthcare practices is unmistakable, offering a future where healthcare is not only more knowledgeable and efficient but also more empathetic and centered around the needs of patients. This investigation underscores the transformative influence of AI on healthcare, delivering a comprehensive comprehension of its role in examining emotional content in healthcare texts and highlighting the trajectory towards a more compassionate approach to patient care. The findings advocate for a harmonious synergy between AI's analytical capabilities and the human aspects of healthcare.</description>

      <title>A Conceptual Framework For White Box Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces semantic features as a general conceptual framework for fully explainable neural network layers. A well-motivated proof of concept model for relevant subproblem of MNIST consists of 4 such layers with the total of 4.8K learnable parameters. The model is easily interpretable, achieves human-level adversarial test accuracy with no form of adversarial training, requires little hyperparameter tuning and can be quickly trained on a single CPU. The general nature of the technique bears promise for a paradigm shift towards radically democratised and truly generalizable white box neural networks. The code is available at https://github.com/314-Foundation/white-box-nn</description>

      <title>Single- and Multi-Agent Private Active Sensing: A Deep Neuroevolution Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on one centralized and one decentralized problem of active hypothesis testing in the presence of an eavesdropper. For the centralized problem including a single legitimate agent, we present a new framework based on NeuroEvolution (NE), whereas, for the decentralized problem, we develop a novel NE-based method for solving collaborative multi-agent tasks, which interestingly maintains all computational benefits of single-agent NE. The superiority of the proposed EAHT approaches over conventional active hypothesis testing policies, as well as learning-based methods, is validated through numerical investigations in an example use case of anomaly detection over wireless sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Expected Hitting Time of Evolutionary Computation-based Neural Architecture Search Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.05397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary computation-based neural architecture search (ENAS) is a popular technique for automating architecture design of deep neural networks. Despite its groundbreaking applications, there is no theoretical study for ENAS. The expected hitting time (EHT) is one of the most important theoretical issues, since it implies the average computational time complexity. This paper proposes a general method by integrating theory and experiment for estimating the EHT of ENAS algorithms, which includes common configuration, search space partition, transition probability estimation, population distribution fitting, and hitting time analysis. By exploiting the proposed method, we consider the ($\lambda$+$\lambda$)-ENAS algorithms with different mutation operators and estimate the lower bounds of the EHT. Furthermore, we study the EHT on the NAS-Bench-101 problem, and the results demonstrate the validity of the proposed method. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to establish a theoretical foundation for ENAS algorithms.</description>

      <title>Expressivity of Spiking Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The synergy between spiking neural networks and neuromorphic hardware holds promise for the development of energy-efficient AI applications. Inspired by this potential, we revisit the foundational aspects to study the capabilities of spiking neural networks where information is encoded in the firing time of neurons. Under the Spike Response Model as a mathematical model of a spiking neuron with a linear response function, we compare the expressive power of artificial and spiking neural networks, where we initially show that they realize piecewise linear mappings. In contrast to ReLU networks, we prove that spiking neural networks can realize both continuous and discontinuous functions. Moreover, we provide complexity bounds on the size of spiking neural networks to emulate multi-layer (ReLU) neural networks. Restricting to the continuous setting, we also establish complexity bounds in the reverse direction for one-layer spiking neural networks.</description>

      <title>Traveling Waves Encode the Recent Past and Enhance Sequence Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traveling waves of neural activity have been observed throughout the brain at a diversity of regions and scales; however, their precise computational role is still debated. One physically inspired hypothesis suggests that the cortical sheet may act like a wave-propagating system capable of invertibly storing a short-term memory of sequential stimuli through induced waves traveling across the cortical surface, and indeed many experimental results from neuroscience correlate wave activity with memory tasks. To date, however, the computational implications of this idea have remained hypothetical due to the lack of a simple recurrent neural network architecture capable of exhibiting such waves. In this work, we introduce a model to fill this gap, which we denote the Wave-RNN (wRNN), and demonstrate how such an architecture indeed efficiently encodes the recent past through a suite of synthetic memory tasks where wRNNs learn faster and reach significantly lower error than wave-free counterparts. We further explore the implications of this memory storage system on more complex sequence modeling tasks such as sequential image classification and find that wave-based models not only again outperform comparable wave-free RNNs while using significantly fewer parameters, but additionally perform comparably to more complex gated architectures such as LSTMs and GRUs.</description>
