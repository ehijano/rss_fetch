      <title>Lorentz Herz-type Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a family of function spaces of Besov and Triebel-Lizorkin type. We present the $\varphi $-transform characterization of these spaces in the sense of Frazier and Jawerth and we prove their Sobolev and Franke-Jewarth embeddings. Also, we establish the smooth atomic, molecular and wavelet decomposition of these function spaces. Characterizations by ball means of differences are given. Finally, we investigate a series of examples which play an important role in the study of function spaces of Besov-Triebel-Lizorkin type.</description>

      <title>$DW$-compact operators on Banach lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of $DW$-compact operators, that is, those operators which map disjointly weakly compact sets in a Banach lattice onto relatively compact sets. We show that $DW$-compact operators are precisely the operators which are both Dunford-Pettis and $AM$-compact. As an application, Banach lattices with the property that every disjointly weakly compact set is a limited (resp. Dunford-Pettis) set, are characterized by using $DW$-compact operators.</description>

      <title>Functional calculus on weighted Sobolev spaces for the Laplacian on the half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Laplace operator on the half-space with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. We prove that this operator admits a bounded $H^\infty$-calculus on Sobolev spaces with power weights measuring the distance to the boundary. These weights do not necessarily belong to the class of Muckenhoupt $A_p$ weights. We additionally study the corresponding Dirichlet and Neumann heat semigroup. It is shown that these semigroups, in contrast to the $L^p$-case, have polynomial growth. Moreover, maximal regularity results for the heat equation are derived on inhomogeneous and homogeneous weighted Sobolev spaces.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathrm{RBMO}(\mu) = \mathrm{RBMO}(\mathbb{R}^m, \mu)$ denote the regular BMO space introduced by X. Tolsa for an $n$-dimensional finite positive measure on $\mathbb{R}^m$, $0&lt;n \le m$.

Abstract: We obtain new sampling discretization results in Orlicz norms on finite dimensional spaces. As applications, we study sampling recovery problems, where the error of the recovery process is calculated with respect to different Orlicz norms. In particular, we are interested in the recovery by linear methods in the norms close to $L^2$.</description>

      <title>Existence and nonexistence of minimizers for classical capillarity problems in presence of nonlocal repulsion and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate, under a volume constraint and among sets contained in a Euclidean half-space, the minimization problem of an energy functional given by the sum of a capillarity perimeter, a nonlocal repulsive term and a gravitational potential energy. The capillarity perimeter assigns a constant weight to the portion of the boundary touching the boundary of the half-space. The nonlocal term is represented by a double integral of a positive kernel $g$, while the gravitational term is represented by the integral of a positive potential $G$.
  We first establish existence of volume-constrained minimizers in the small mass regime, together with several qualitative properties of minimizers. The existence result holds even for rather general choices of kernels in the nonlocal term, including attractive-repulsive ones. When the nonlocal kernel $g(x)=1/|x|^\beta$ with $\beta \in (0,2]$, we also obtain nonexistence of volume constrained minimizers in the large mass regime. Finally, we prove a generalized existence result of minimizers holding for all masses, meaning that the infimum of the problem is realized by a finite disjoint union of sets thought located at "infinite distance" one from the other.
  These results stem from an application of quantitative isoperimetric inequalities for the capillarity problem in a half-space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the self-improvement property of the Hardy--Littlewood maximal operator on quasi-Banach lattices with the Fatou property in the setting of spaces of homogeneous type. Our result is a generalization of the boundedness criterion obtained in 2010 by Lerner and Ombrosi for maximal operators on quasi-Banach function spaces over Euclidean spaces. The specialty of the proof for spaces of homogeneous type lies in using adjacent grids of Hyt\"onen--Kairema dyadic cubes and studying the maximal operator alongside its dyadic version. Then we apply the obtained result to variable Lebesgue spaces over spaces of homogeneous type.</description>

      <title>Noisy Data Visualization using Functional Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data visualization via dimensionality reduction is an important tool in exploratory data analysis. However, when the data are noisy, many existing methods fail to capture the underlying structure of the data. The method called Empirical Intrinsic Geometry (EIG) was previously proposed for performing dimensionality reduction on high dimensional dynamical processes while theoretically eliminating all noise. However, implementing EIG in practice requires the construction of high-dimensional histograms, which suffer from the curse of dimensionality. Here we propose a new data visualization method called Functional Information Geometry (FIG) for dynamical processes that adapts the EIG framework while using approaches from functional data analysis to mitigate the curse of dimensionality. We experimentally demonstrate that the resulting method outperforms a variant of EIG designed for visualization in terms of capturing the true structure, hyperparameter robustness, and computational speed. We then use our method to visualize EEG brain measurements of sleep activity.</description>

      <title>The strong data processing inequality under the heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\nu$ and $\mu$ be probability distributions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, and $\nu_s,\mu_s$ be their evolution under the heat flow, that is, the probability distributions resulting from convolving their density with the density of an isotropic Gaussian random vector with variance $s$ in each entry. This paper studies the rate of decay of $s\mapsto D(\nu_s\|\mu_s)$ for various divergences, including the $\chi^2$ and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences. We prove upper and lower bounds on the strong data-processing inequality (SDPI) coefficients corresponding to the source $\mu$ and the Gaussian channel. We also prove generalizations of de Brujin's identity, and Costa's result on the concavity in $s$ of the differential entropy of $\nu_s$. As a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain new lower bounds on the mutual information between $X$ and $Y=X+\sqrt{s} Z$, where $Z$ is a standard Gaussian vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$, independent of $X$, and on the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) in estimating $X$ from $Y$, in terms of the Poincar\'e constant of $X$.</description>

      <title>Beyond trace class -- Tensor products of Hilbert spaces and operator ideals in quantum physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04627v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Starting from the meaning of the conjugate of a complex Hilbert space, including a related application of the theorem of Fr\'{e}chet-Riesz (by which an analysis of semilinear operators can be reduced to - linear - operator theory) to a revisit of applications of nuclear and absolutely $p$-summing operators in algebraic quantum field theory in the sense of Araki, Haag and Kastler ($p=2$) and more recently in the framework of general probabilistic spaces ($p=1$), we will outline that Banach operator ideals in the sense of Pietsch, or equivalently tensor products of Banach spaces in the sense of Grothendieck are even lurking in the foundations and philosophy of quantum physics and quantum information theory. In particular, we concentrate on their importance in algebraic quantum field theory. In doing so, we establish a canonical isometric isomorphism between the Hilbert spaces $H\otimes_2 (K \otimes_2 L)$ and $(H \otimes_2 K) \otimes_2 L$ (Theorem 3.8) and revisit the role of trace class operators.
  A few applications are specified, including the appropriateness of the class of Hilbert-Schmidt operators and an implied Banach operator ideal representation of the tensor product of two complex Hilbert spaces $H \otimes_2 K$ (Proposition 3.4) and a purely linear algebraic description of the quantum teleportation process (Example 3.10).</description>

      <title>Banach lattices of homogeneous polynomials not containing $c_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11717v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: First we develop a technique to construct Banach lattices of homogeneous polynomials. We obtain, in particular, conditions for the linear spans of all positive compact and weakly compact $n$-homogeneous polynomials between the Banach lattices $E$ and $F$, denoted by ${\cal P}_{\cal K}^r(^n E; F)$ and $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{W}}^r(^n E; F)$, to be Banach lattices with the polynomial regular norm. Next we study when the following are equivalent for ${\cal I} = {\cal K}$ or ${\cal I} = {\cal W}$: (1) The space $\mathcal{P}^r(^n E; F)$ of regular polynomials contains no copy of $c_0$. (2) ${\cal P}_{\mathcal{I}}^r(^n E; F)$ contains no copy of $c_0$. (3) ${\cal P}_{\mathcal{I}}^r(^n E; F)$ is a projection band in $\mathcal{P}^r(^n E; F)$. (4) Every positive polynomial in $\mathcal{P}^r(^n E; F)$ belongs to ${\cal P}_{\cal I}^r(^nE;F)$. The result we obtain in the compact case can be regarded as a lattice polynomial Kalton theorem. Most of our results and examples are new even in the linear case $n = 1$.</description>

Abstract: We provide a multifractal analysis of lacunary wavelet series on Cantor sets. Byintroducing a desynchronization between the scales of the wavelets and the scales of the steps of the construction of the Cantor set, we obtain random processes that donot satisfy multifractal formalisms based on the Legendre transform and on the large deviation of wavelet leaders. Subsequently, we show how the computation of the leader large deviation spectra of "lacunarized" versions of such wavelet series can detect the failure in the multifractal formalism using only numerical quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, we emulate the Bergman projection on Reinhardt domains by using a Banach-space basis of $L^p$-Bergman space. The construction gives an integral kernel generalizing the ($L^2$) Bergman kernel. The operator defined by the kernel is shown to be absolutely bounded projection on the $L^p$-Bergman space on a class of domains where the $L^p$-boundedness of the Bergman projection fails for certain $p \neq 2$. As an application, we identify the duals of these $L^p$-Bergman spaces with weighted Bergman spaces.</description>

      <title>The alternating simultaneous Halpern-Lions-Wittmann-Bauschke algorithm for finding the best approximation pair for two disjoint intersections of convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09600v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two nonempty and disjoint intersections of closed and convex subsets, we look for a best approximation pair relative to them, i.e., a pair of points, one in each intersection, attaining the minimum distance between the disjoint intersections. We propose an iterative process based on projections onto the subsets which generate the intersections. The process is inspired by the Halpern-Lions-Wittmann-Bauschke algorithm and the classical alternating process of Cheney and Goldstein, and its advantage is that there is no need to project onto the intersections themselves, a task which can be rather demanding. We prove that under certain conditions the two interlaced subsequences converge to a best approximation pair. These conditions hold, in particular, when the space is Euclidean and the subsets which generate the intersections are compact and strictly convex. Our result extends the one of Aharoni, Censor and Jiang ["Finding a best approximation pair of points for two polyhedra'', Computational Optimization and Applications 71 (2018), 509--523] who considered the case of finite-dimensional polyhedra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the algebraic approach to duality, more precisely to intertwinings, within the context of particle systems in general spaces, focusing on the $\mathfrak{su}(1,1)$ current algebra. We introduce raising, lowering, and neutral operators indexed by test functions and we use them to construct unitary operators, which act as self-intertwiners for some Markov processes having the Pascal process's law as a reversible measure. We show that such unitaries relate to generalized Meixner polynomials. Our primary results are continuum counterparts of results in the discrete setting obtained by Carinci, Franceschini, Giardin\`a, Groenevelt, and Redig (2019).</description>

Abstract: In this survey paper we present classical and recent results relating the auction design and the optimal transportation theory. In particular, we discuss in details the seminal result of Daskalakis, Deckelbaum and Tzamos \cite{DDT} about duality between auction design with $1$ bidder and the weak transportation problem. Later investigations revealed the connection of multi-bidder case to the Beckmann's transportation problem. In this paper we overview a number of works on related subjects (monopolist's problem, regularity issues, weak transportation, measure ordering etc.). In addition, we prove some new results on duality for unreduced mechanisms.</description>
