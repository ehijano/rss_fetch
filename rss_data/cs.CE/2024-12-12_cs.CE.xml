      <title>Energy-Efficient Robust Beamforming for Multi-Functional RIS-Aided Wireless Communication under Imperfect CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The robust beamforming design in multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS) assisted wireless networks is investigated in this work, where the MF-RIS supports signal reflection, refraction, and amplification to address the double-fading attenuation and half-space coverage issues faced by traditional RISs. Specifically, we aim to maximize the system energy efficiency by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming vector and MF-RIS coefficients in the case of imperfect channel state information (CSI). We first leverage the S-procedure and Bernstein-Type Inequality approaches to transform the formulated problem into tractable forms in the bounded and statistical CSI error cases, respectively. Then, we optimize the MF-RIS coefficients and the transmit beamforming vector alternately by adopting an alternating optimization framework, under the quality of service constraint for the bounded CSI error model and the rate outage probability constraint for the statistical CSI error model. Simulation results demonstrate the significant performance improvement of MF-RIS compared to benchmark schemes.In addition, it is revealed that the cumulative CSI error caused by increasing the number of RIS elements is larger than that caused by increasing the number of transmit antennas.</description>

      <title>Using Large Language Models for Parametric Shape Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advanced large language models (LLMs) have showcased their emergent capability of in-context learning, facilitating intelligent decision-making through natural language prompts without retraining. This new machine learning paradigm has shown promise in various fields, including general control and optimization problems. Inspired by these advancements, we explore the potential of LLMs for a specific and essential engineering task: parametric shape optimization (PSO). We develop an optimization framework, LLM-PSO, that leverages an LLM to determine the optimal shape of parameterized engineering designs in the spirit of evolutionary strategies. Utilizing the ``Claude 3.5 Sonnet'' LLM, we evaluate LLM-PSO on two benchmark flow optimization problems, specifically aiming to identify drag-minimizing profiles for 1) a two-dimensional airfoil in laminar flow, and 2) a three-dimensional axisymmetric body in Stokes flow. In both cases, LLM-PSO successfully identifies optimal shapes in agreement with benchmark solutions. Besides, it generally converges faster than other classical optimization algorithms. Our preliminary exploration may inspire further investigations into harnessing LLMs for shape optimization and engineering design more broadly.</description>

      <title>Towards Automated Algebraic Multigrid Preconditioner Design Using Genetic Programming for Large-Scale Laser Beam Welding Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multigrid methods are asymptotically optimal algorithms ideal for large-scale simulations. But, they require making numerous algorithmic choices that significantly influence their efficiency. Unlike recent approaches that learn optimal multigrid components using machine learning techniques, we adopt a complementary strategy here, employing evolutionary algorithms to construct efficient multigrid cycles from available individual components. This technology is applied to finite element simulations of the laser beam welding process. The thermo-elastic behavior is described by a coupled system of time-dependent thermo-elasticity equations, leading to nonlinear and ill-conditioned systems. The nonlinearity is addressed using Newton's method, and iterative solvers are accelerated with an algebraic multigrid (AMG) preconditioner using hypre BoomerAMG interfaced via PETSc. This is applied as a monolithic solver for the coupled equations. To further enhance solver efficiency, flexible AMG cycles are introduced, extending traditional cycle types with level-specific smoothing sequences and non-recursive cycling patterns. These are automatically generated using genetic programming, guided by a context-free grammar containing AMG rules. Numerical experiments demonstrate the potential of these approaches to improve solver performance in large-scale laser beam welding simulations.</description>

      <title>A computational framework to predict weld integrity and microstructural heterogeneity: application to hydrogen transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel computational framework to assess the structural integrity of welds. In the first stage of the simulation framework, local fractions of microstructural constituents within weld regions are predicted based on steel composition and welding parameters. The resulting phase fraction maps are used to define heterogeneous properties that are subsequently employed in structural integrity assessments using an elastoplastic phase field fracture model. The framework is particularised to predicting failure in hydrogen pipelines, demonstrating its potential to assess the feasibility of repurposing existing pipeline infrastructure to transport hydrogen. First, the process model is validated against experimental microhardness maps for vintage and modern pipeline welds. Additionally, the influence of welding conditions on hardness and residual stresses is investigated, demonstrating that variations in heat input, filler material composition, and weld bead order can significantly affect the properties within the weld region. Coupled hydrogen diffusion-fracture simulations are then conducted to determine the critical pressure at which hydrogen transport pipelines will fail. To this end, the model is enriched with a microstructure-sensitive description of hydrogen transport and hydrogen-dependent fracture resistance. The analysis of an X52 pipeline reveals that even 2 mm defects in a hard heat-affected zone can drastically reduce the critical failure pressure.</description>

      <title>Reliable Uncertainty Quantification for Fiber Orientation in Composite Molding Processes using Multilevel Polynomial Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiber orientation is decisive for the mechanical properties and thus for the performance of composite materials. During manufacturing, variations in material and process parameters can significantly influence the exact fiber orientation. We employ multilevel polynomial surrogates to model the propagation of uncertain material properties in the injection molding process. To ensure reliable uncertainty quantification, a key focus is deriving novel error bounds for statistical measures of a quantity of interest, computed via these surrogates. To verify these bounds, we conduct numerical experiments using the Cross-WLF viscosity model alongside the Hagen-Poiseuille flow in a rectangular channel. In particular, the impact of uncertainties in fiber length and matrix temperature on the fractional anisotropy of fiber orientation is investigated. The Folgar-Tucker equation and the improved anisotropic rotary diffusion model are used, incorporating recently established analytical solutions of these models as part of our verification. Our results demonstrate that the investigated method significantly improves upon standard Monte Carlo estimation, while also providing error guarantees. These findings offer the first step toward a reliable and practical tool for optimizing fiber-reinforced polymer manufacturing processes in the future.</description>

      <title>Proactive Model Adaptation Against Concept Drift for Online Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However, they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present \textsc{Proceed}, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time series forecasting. \textsc{Proceed} first operates by estimating the concept drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample. It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework, \textsc{Proceed} is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. We conduct extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast models. The empirical study demonstrates that our proposed \textsc{Proceed} brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept drifts.</description>

      <title>Multi-layer diffusion model of photovoltaic installations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nowadays, harmful effects of climate change are becoming increasingly apparent. A vital issue that must be addressed is the generation of energy from non-renewable and often polluting sources. For this reason, the development of renewable energy sources is of great importance. Unfortunately, too rapid spread of renewables can disrupt stability of the power system and lead to energy blackouts. One should not simply support it, without ensuring sustainability and understanding of the diffusion process. In this research, we propose a new agent-based model of diffusion of photovoltaic panels. It is an extension of the q-voter model that utilizes multi-layer network structure. The novelty is studying both opinion dynamics and diffusion of innovation simultaneously, on a multidimensional structure. The model is analyzed with Monte Carlo simulations and mean-field approximation. The impact of parameters and specifications on the basic properties of the model is discussed. Firstly, we show that for a certain range of parameters, innovation always succeeds, regardless of the initial conditions. Secondly, that the mean-field approximation gives qualitatively the same results as computer simulations, even though it does not utilize knowledge of the network structure.</description>

      <title>Social Recommendation through Heterogeneous Graph Modeling of the Long-term and Short-term Preference Defined by Dynamic Time Spans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social recommendations have been widely adopted in substantial domains. Recently, graph neural networks (GNN) have been employed in recommender systems due to their success in graph representation learning. However, dealing with the dynamic property of social network data is a challenge. This research presents a novel method that provides social recommendations by incorporating the dynamic property of social network data in a heterogeneous graph. The model aims to capture user preference over time without going through the complexities of a dynamic graph by adding period nodes to define users' long-term and short-term preferences and aggregating assigned edge weights. The model is applied to real-world data to argue its superior performance. Promising results demonstrate the effectiveness of this model.</description>
