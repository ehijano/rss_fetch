      <title>A general optimization framework for mapping local transition-state networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how complex systems transition between states requires mapping the energy landscape that governs these changes. Local transition-state networks reveal the barrier architecture that explains observed behaviour and enables mechanism-based prediction across computational chemistry, biology, and physics, yet current practice either prescribes endpoints or randomly samples only a few saddles around an initial guess. We present a general optimization framework that systematically expands local coverage by coupling a multi-objective explorer with a bilayer minimum-mode kernel. The inner layer uses Hessian-vector products to recover the lowest-curvature subspace (smallest k eigenpairs), the outer layer optimizes on a reflected force to reach index-1 saddles, then a two-sided descent certifies connectivity. The GPU-based pipeline is portable across autodiff backends and eigensolvers and, on large atomistic-spin tests, matches explicit-Hessian accuracy while cutting peak memory and wall time by orders of magnitude. Applied to a DFT-parameterized N\'eel-type skyrmionic model, it recovers known routes and reveals previously unreported mechanisms, including meron-antimeron-mediated N\'eel-type skyrmionic duplication, annihilation, and chiral-droplet formation, enabling up to 32 pathways between biskyrmion (Q=2) and biantiskyrmion (Q=-2). The same core transfers to Cartesian atoms, automatically mapping canonical rearrangements of a Ni(111) heptamer, underscoring the framework's generality.</description>

      <title>The uniqueness of inverse scattering problems, reciprocity principles, and nonradiating sources related to low-signature structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is about perfectly electrically conducting structures designed to produce negligible scattered power when exposed to a time-harmonic plane electromagnetic wave. The structures feature cavities capable of concealing objects. Theoretical investigations of the properties of the structures combined with accurate numerical computations lead to three key findings: the first concerns the uniqueness of the solution to an inverse scattering problem, the second establishes a reciprocity relation for the far-field scattering amplitude, and the third reveals the existence of non-radiating sources that generate substantial electromagnetic fields near the source region. The results have applications in low-observable technology.</description>

      <title>TBPLaS 2.0: a Tight-Binding Package for Large-scale Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce version 2.0 of TBPLaS, a package for large-scale simulation based on the tight-binding propagation method (TBPM). This new version brings significant improvements with many new features. Existing Python/Cython modeling tools have been thoroughly optimized, and a compatible C++ implementation of the modeling tools is now available, offering efficiency enhancement of several orders. The solvers have been rewritten in C++ from scratch, with the efficiency enhanced by several times or even by an order. The workflow of utilizing solvers has also been unified into a more comprehensive and consistent manner. New features include spin texture, Berry curvature and Chern number calculation, search of eigenvalues within a specific energy range, analytical Hamiltonian, and GPU computing support. The documentation and tutorials have also been updated to the new version. In this paper, we discuss the revisions with respect to version 1.3 and demonstrate the new features. Benchmarks on modeling tools and solvers are also provided.</description>

      <title>Method for backtracking the layer thermal conductivities of multilayer thin film structure using coupled Newton Raphson approach and 3-omega approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal conductivity of thin films is commonly estimated using the 3-omega experimental method. When calibrating the test setup, it is customary to use a specimen with a known thermal conductivity for validation. However, when determining the thermal conductivity of samples with unknown values, numerical approximations can provide a means to validate experimental results and ensure the integrity of the setup. A simple analytical or finite element analysis (FEA) method can be used to achieve this. For multilayer systems of unknown layer thermal conductivities, the 3-omega experimental setup only provides information about the overall bulk thermal conductivity of the system. To obtain the individual layer thermal conductivities, a combined experimental and numerical approach can be used. This article presents a novel method for backtracking the layer thermal conductivities of a multilayer thin film structure using a coupled 3-omega experimental and Newton-Raphson numerical approach. The method is validated using high-fidelity data obtained from literature.</description>

      <title>A Fourier/Modal-Spectral-Element Method for the Simulation of High-Reynolds Number Incompressible Stratified Flows in Domains with a Single Non-Periodic Direction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the components of a high-order accurate Navier-Stokes solver designed to simulate high-Reynolds-number stratified flows. The proposed numerical model addresses some of the numerical and computational challenges that high-Reynolds-number simulations pose, facilitating the reproduction of stratified turbulent fluid dynamics typically observed in oceanic and atmospheric flows, namely the development of thin regions of high vertical shear, strongly layered turbulence at high Reynolds numbers and internal wave radiation. This Navier-Stokes solver utilizes a Fourier pseudo-spectral method in the horizontal direction and a modal spectral element discretization in the vertical. We adopt an implicit-explicit time discretization scheme that involves solving several one-dimensional Helmholtz problems at each time step. Static condensation and modal boundary-adapted basis functions result in an inexpensive algorithm based on solving many small tridiagonal systems. A series of benchmark studies is presented to demonstrate the robustness of the flow solver. These include two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems, concluding with a turbulent stratified wake generated by a sphere in linear stratification.</description>

      <title>Automated Code Development for PDE Solvers Using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundation models -- large language models (LLMs) in particular -- have become ubiquitous, shaping daily life and driving breakthroughs across science, engineering, and technology. Harnessing their broad cross-domain knowledge, text-processing, and reasoning abilities for software development, e.g., numerical libraries for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), is therefore attracting growing interest. Yet existing studies mainly automate case setup and execution for end users. We introduce LLM-PDEveloper, a zero-shot, multi-agent LLM framework that automates code development for PDE libraries, specifically targeting secondary developers. By translating mathematical and algorithmic descriptions directly into source code, LLM-PDEveloper generates new solvers/modules and adapts existing ones. This end-to-end math-to-code approach enables a self-augmenting pipeline that continuously expands the codebase of a library, extends its capacities, and broadens its scope. We demonstrate LLM-PDEveloper on three tasks: 1) build a solver for a new PDE, 2) implement new BCs for a given PDE, and 3) modify an existing solver to incorporate additional terms, achieving moderate success rates. Failures due to syntactic errors made by LLMs are analyzed and we propose effective fixes. We also identify the mechanisms underlying certain semantic errors, guiding future research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We implement physics-informed-neural-networks (PINNs) to compute holographic entanglement entropy and entanglement wedge cross section. This technique allows us to compute these quantities for arbitrary shapes of the subregions in any asymptotically AdS metric. We test our computations against some known results and further demonstrate the utility of PINNs in examples, where it is not straightforward to perform such computations.</description>

      <title>Spatial correlations in SIS processes on regular random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In network-based SIS models of infectious disease transmission, infection can only occur between directly connected individuals. This constraint naturally gives rise to spatial correlations between the states of neighboring nodes, as the infection status of connected individuals becomes interdependent. Although mean-field approximations are commonly invoked to simplify disease forecasting on networks, they fail to account for these correlations by assuming that infectious individuals are well-mixed within a population, leading to inaccurate predictions of infection numbers over time. As such, the development of mathematical frameworks that account for spatially correlated infections is of great interest, as they offer a compromise between accurate disease forecasting and analytic tractability. Here, we use existing corrections to mean-field theory on the regular lattice to construct a more general framework for equivalent corrections on regular random graph topologies. We derive and simulate a system of ordinary differential equations for the time evolution of the spatial correlation function at various geodesic distances on random networks, and use solutions to this hierarchy of ordinary differential equations to predict the global infection density as a function of time, finding good agreement with corresponding numerical simulations. Our results constitute a substantial development on existing corrections to mean-field theory for infectious individuals in SIS processes and provide an in-depth characterization of how structural randomness in networks affects the dynamical trajectories of infectious diseases on networks.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstration of boson sampling as a hardware accelerator for monte carlo integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental demonstration of boson sampling as a hardware accelerator for Monte Carlo integration. Our approach leverages importance sampling to factorize an integrand into a distribution that can be sampled using quantum hardware and a function that can be evaluated classically, enabling hybrid quantum-classical computation. We argue that for certain classes of integrals, this method offers a quantum advantage by efficiently sampling from probability distributions that are hard to simulate classically. We also identify structural criteria that must be satisfied to preserve computational hardness, notably the sensitivity of the classical post-processing function to high-order quantum correlations. To validate our protocol, we implement a proof-of-principle experiment on a programmable photonic platform to compute the first-order energy correction of a three-boson system in a harmonic trap under an Efimov-inspired three-body perturbation. The experimental results are consistent with theoretical predictions and numerical simulations, with deviations explained by photon distinguishability, discretization, and unitary imperfections. Additionally, we provide an error budget quantifying the impact of these same sources of noise. Our work establishes a concrete use case for near-term photonic quantum devices and highlights a viable path toward practical quantum advantage in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Multi-patch isogeometric neural solver for partial differential equations on computer-aided design domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops a computational framework that combines physics-informed neural networks with multi-patch isogeometric analysis to solve partial differential equations on complex computer-aided design geometries. The method utilizes patch-local neural networks that operate on the reference domain of isogeometric analysis. A custom output layer enables the strong imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions. Solution conformity across interfaces between non-uniform rational B-spline patches is enforced using dedicated interface neural networks. Training is performed using the variational framework by minimizing the energy functional derived after the weak form of the partial differential equation. The effectiveness of the suggested method is demonstrated on two highly non-trivial and practically relevant use-cases, namely, a 2D magnetostatics model of a quadrupole magnet and a 3D nonlinear solid and contact mechanics model of a mechanical holder. The results show excellent agreement to reference solutions obtained with high-fidelity finite element solvers, thus highlighting the potential of the suggested neural solver to tackle complex engineering problems given the corresponding computer-aided design models.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Guided Probabilistic Surrogate Modeling Framework for Digital Twins of Underwater Radiated Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25730v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ship traffic is an increasing source of underwater radiated noise in coastal waters, motivating real-time digital twins of ocean acoustics for operational noise mitigation. We present a physics-guided probabilistic framework to predict three-dimensional transmission loss in realistic ocean environments. As a case study, we consider the Salish Sea along shipping routes from the Pacific Ocean to the Port of Vancouver. A dataset of over 30 million source-receiver pairs was generated with a Gaussian beam solver across seasonal sound speed profiles and one-third-octave frequency bands spanning 12.5 Hz to 8 kHz. We first assess sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) and then incorporate physics-based mean functions combining spherical spreading with frequency-dependent absorption. To capture nonlinear effects, we examine deep sigma-point processes and stochastic variational deep kernel learning. The final framework integrates four components: (i) a learnable physics-informed mean that represents dominant propagation trends, (ii) a convolutional encoder for bathymetry along the source-receiver track, (iii) a neural encoder for source, receiver, and frequency coordinates, and (iv) a residual SVGP layer that provides calibrated predictive uncertainty. This probabilistic digital twin facilitates the construction of sound-exposure bounds and worst-case scenarios for received levels. We further demonstrate the application of the framework to ship speed optimization, where predicted transmission loss combined with near-field source models provides sound exposure level estimates for minimizing acoustic impacts on marine mammals. The proposed framework advances uncertainty-aware digital twins for ocean acoustics and illustrates how physics-guided machine learning can support sustainable maritime operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is high demand on fire simulations, in both scale and quantity. We present a multi-pronged approach to improving the time and energy required to meet these demands. We show the ability of a custom machine learning surrogate model to predict the dynamics of heat propagation orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art CFD software for this application. We also demonstrate how a guided optimisation procedure can decrease the number of simulations required to meet an objective; using lightweight models to decide which simulations to run, we see a tenfold reduction when locating the most dangerous location for a fire to occur within a building based on the impact of smoke on visibility. Finally we present a framework and product, Simvue, through which we access these tools along with a host of automatic organisational and tracking features which enables future reuse of data and more savings through better management of simulations and combating redundancy.</description>

      <title>Axial resolution post-processing engineering in Fresnel incoherent correlation holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fresnel incoherent correlation holography (FINCH) is a self-interference-based incoherent digital holography method. In FINCH, light from an object point is split into two beams, modulated differently using two lenses with different focal distances, and creates a self-interference hologram. At least three phase-shifted holograms are recorded and synthesized into a complex hologram, which reconstructs the object image without twin image and bias noises. Compared with conventional imaging, FINCH exhibits a longer depth of focus (DOF) and higher lateral resolution. In this study, we propose and demonstrate a new method termed post-engineering of axial resolution in FINCH (PEAR-FINCH), which enables post-recording DOF engineering for the first time. In PEAR-FINCH, a library of FINCH holograms catalogued with unique axial characteristics, DOF, and focus location is recorded by changing the focal distance of one of the diffractive lenses. Selected holograms from this library are combined to engineer new axial characteristics not achievable in FINCH. A two-step reconstruction, involving numerical back-propagation and deconvolution with a point spread hologram, is implemented. Experiments with multiplane objects having large axial separations confirm that PEAR-FINCH achieves a substantially extended DOF compared with direct imaging and FINCH. PEAR-FINCH will be promising for applications in biomedical imaging, holography, and fluorescence microscopy.</description>

      <title>Are neural scaling laws leading quantum chemistry astray?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural scaling laws are driving the machine learning community toward training ever-larger foundation models across domains, assuring high accuracy and transferable representations for extrapolative tasks. We test this promise in quantum chemistry by scaling model capacity and training data from quantum chemical calculations. As a generalization task, we evaluate the resulting models' predictions of the bond dissociation energy of neutral H$_2$, the simplest possible molecule. We find that, regardless of dataset size or model capacity, models trained only on stable structures fail dramatically to even qualitatively reproduce the H$_2$ energy curve. Only when compressed and stretched geometries are explicitly included in training do the predictions roughly resemble the correct shape. Nonetheless, the largest foundation models trained on the largest and most diverse datasets containing dissociating diatomics exhibit serious failures on simple diatomic molecules. Most strikingly, they cannot reproduce the trivial repulsive energy curve of two bare protons, revealing their failure to learn the basic Coulomb's law involved in electronic structure theory. These results suggest that scaling alone is insufficient for building reliable quantum chemical models.</description>

Abstract: Frictional sliding contact in hydrodynamic environments can be found in a range of engineering applications. Accurate modeling requires an integrated numerical framework capable of resolving large relative motions, multiphase interactions, and nonlinear contact responses. Building on our previously developed fully Eulerian fluid structure formulation, we introduce a phase field based formulation for dynamic frictional contact in 3D. Contact detection is achieved via the overlap of diffuse interfaces of colliding solids. The normal contact response is defined as a volumetric body force proportional to the overlap parameter, while the tangential response is computed using the Coulomb friction model. The direction of the friction forces are derived by projecting phase-averaged relative velocities onto the local tangent plane of colliding bodies. This proposed unified treatment enables the computation of both normal and frictional forces within a single momentum balance equation, avoiding separate velocity fields for individual solids. We present several test cases with increasing complexity to verify and demonstrate our proposed frictional contact model. Verification against the Hertzian contact problem shows excellent agreement with the analytical solution, with errors below $3\%$ in the traction profile. In the sliding block benchmark, the computed displacement profiles closely follow the analytical solution for point-mass systems across multiple friction coefficients. The ironing problem demonstrates stable force predictions under finite deformation, with normal and tangential forces matching kinetic friction laws. The robustness and scalability of the proposed formulation are further demonstrated through a representative ship ice interaction scenario with free surface and frictional sliding effects.</description>

      <title>FESTIM v2.0: Upgraded framework for multi-species hydrogen transport and enhanced performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: FESTIM is an open-source finite element framework for modelling the transport of hydrogen isotopes in materials. It provides a flexible and extensible tool for simulating diffusion, trapping, surface interactions, and other processes that govern hydrogen behaviour. This paper presents FESTIM v2.0, a major release that broadens both the physical scope and the software infrastructure of the framework. On the physics side, the formulation adopts a modular structure that supports multi-species transport, advanced trapping and reaction schemes, isotope exchange, decay, and advection. Interface and boundary conditions have been generalised, and interoperability with external solvers enables multiphysics workflows, including coupling with fluid dynamics and neutron transport codes. On the software side, FESTIM v2.0 has been migrated to DOLFINx, the next-generation FEniCS platform, providing improved performance, interoperability, and long-term sustainability. Taken together, these advances position FESTIM v2.0 as a versatile platform for investigating hydrogen transport in materials across scientific and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Complexity Analysis of Normalizing Constant Estimation: from Jarzynski Equality to Annealed Importance Sampling and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an unnormalized probability density $\pi\propto\mathrm{e}^{-V}$, estimating its normalizing constant $Z=\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}\mathrm{e}^{-V(x)}\mathrm{d}x$ or free energy $F=-\log Z$ is a crucial problem in Bayesian statistics, statistical mechanics, and machine learning. It is challenging especially in high dimensions or when $\pi$ is multimodal. To mitigate the high variance of conventional importance sampling estimators, annealing-based methods such as Jarzynski equality and annealed importance sampling are commonly adopted, yet their quantitative complexity guarantees remain largely unexplored. We take a first step toward a non-asymptotic analysis of annealed importance sampling. In particular, we derive an oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{d\beta^2{\mathcal{A}}^2}{\varepsilon^4}\right)$ for estimating $Z$ within $\varepsilon$ relative error with high probability, where $\beta$ is the smoothness of $V$ and $\mathcal{A}$ denotes the action of a curve of probability measures interpolating $\pi$ and a tractable reference distribution. Our analysis, leveraging Girsanov theorem and optimal transport, does not explicitly require isoperimetric assumptions on the target distribution. Finally, to tackle the large action of the widely used geometric interpolation, we propose a new algorithm based on reverse diffusion samplers, establish a framework for analyzing its complexity, and empirically demonstrate its efficiency in tackling multimodality.</description>

      <title>A quantitative analysis of semantic information in deep representations of text and images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks are known to develop similar representations for semantically related data, even when they belong to different domains, such as an image and its description, or the same text in different languages. We present a method for quantitatively investigating this phenomenon by measuring the relative information content of the representations of semantically related data and probing how it is encoded into multiple tokens of large language models (LLMs) and vision transformers. Looking first at how LLMs process pairs of translated sentences, we identify inner ``semantic'' layers containing the most language-transferable information. We find moreover that, on these layers, a larger LLM (DeepSeek-V3) extracts significantly more general information than a smaller one (Llama3.1-8B). Semantic information of English text is spread across many tokens and it is characterized by long-distance correlations between tokens and by a causal left-to-right (i.e., past-future) asymmetry. We also identify layers encoding semantic information within visual transformers. We show that caption representations in the semantic layers of LLMs predict visual representations of the corresponding images. We observe significant and model-dependent information asymmetries between image and text representations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Simulations of Catalytic Metal Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of metal surfaces are critical for catalytic innovation. Yet existing methods face a cost-accuracy dilemma: density functional theory is efficient but system-dependent in accuracy, while wavefunction-based theories are accurate but prohibitively costly. Here we introduce FEMION (Fragment Embedding for Metals and Insulators with Onsite and Nonlocal correlation), a systematically improvable quantum embedding framework that resolves this challenge by capturing partially filled electronic states in metals. FEMION combines auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo for local catalytic sites with a global random phase approximation treatment of nonlocal screening, yielding a scalable approach across diverse catalytic systems. Employing FEMION, we address two longstanding challenges: determining the preferred CO adsorption site and quantifying the H2 desorption barrier on Cu(111). Furthermore, our calculations demonstrate that the recently discovered 10-electron-count rule can also be extended to the single-atom catalysis processes on 3d metal surfaces, resolving the controversies arising from density functional theory calculations. We thus open a predictive, first-principles route to modeling complex catalytic systems.</description>

      <title>Interpolation-supplemented lattice Boltzmann simulation of thermal convection on non-uniform meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic evaluation of an interpolation-supplemented lattice Boltzmann method (ISLBM) for simulating buoyancy-driven thermal convection on non-uniform meshes. The ISLBM extends the standard lattice Boltzmann framework by incorporating quadratic interpolation during the streaming step, enabling flexible mesh refinement near solid boundaries while maintaining algorithmic simplicity and parallel scalability. The method is implemented for a two-dimensional side-heated cavity at high Rayleigh numbers $10^6\leq Ra \leq 10^8$, and for a three-dimensional side-heated cavity at $10^5\leq Ra \leq 10^7$, with the Prandtl number fixed at $Pr=0.71$. Benchmark results show that the ISLBM accurately captures thermal and velocity boundary layers, yielding Nusselt and Reynolds numbers in close agreement with high-fidelity reference data. Grid-convergence studies demonstrate nearly third-order accuracy for global quantities and about second-order for local fields. We further assess the computational performance of the in-house LBM solver against two open-source solvers: Nek5000 based on the spectral element method, and OpenFOAM based on the finite volume method. Performance metrics, including million lattice updates per second (MLUPS) and wall-clock time per dimensionless time unit (WCTpDT), indicate that the ISLBM offers one to three orders of magnitude higher efficiency in large-scale simulations. On GPU architectures, the ISLBM retains high computational performance: throughput on non-uniform meshes reaches 60-70% of that on uniform meshes in terms of MLUPS, while the cost in WCTpDT is about three times higher. These results highlight the potential of interpolation-based LBM approaches for high-fidelity simulations of thermal convection on non-uniform meshes, providing a robust foundation for future extensions to turbulent flows.</description>
