      <title>Classification and degenerations of small minimal border rank tensors via modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a self-contained classification of $1_*$-generic minimal border rank tensors in $C^m \otimes C^m \otimes C^m$ for $m \leq 5$. Together with previous results, this gives a classification of all minimal border rank tensors in $C^m \otimes C^m \otimes C^m$ for $m \leq 5$: there are $37$ isomorphism classes. We fully describe possible degenerations among the tensors. We prove that there are no $1$-degenerate minimal border rank tensors in $C^m \otimes C^m \otimes C^m $ for $m \leq 4$.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic degree and its application to Zariski dense orbit conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for a dominant rational self-map $f$ on a quasi-projective variety defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, there is a point whose $f$-orbit is well-defined and its arithmetic degree is arbitrary close to the first dynamical degree of $f$. As an application, we prove that Zariski dense orbit conjecture holds for a birational map defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ such that the first dynamical degree is strictly larger than the third dynamical degree. In particular, the conjecture holds for birational maps on threefolds with first dynamical degree larger than $1$.</description>

      <title>Gromov--Witten Invariants of Non-Convex Complete Intersections in Weighted Projective Stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we compute genus 0 orbifold Gromov--Witten invariants of Calabi--Yau threefold complete intersections in weighted projective stacks, regardless of convexity conditions. The traditional quantumn Lefschetz principle may fail even for invariants with ambient insertions. Using quasimap wall-crossing, we are able to compute invariants with insertions from a specific subring of the Chen--Ruan cohomology, which contains all the ambient cohomology classes.
  Quasimap wall-crossing gives a mirror theorem expressing the I-function in terms of the J-function via a mirror map. The key of this paper is to find a suitable GIT presentation of the target space, so that the mirror map is invertible. An explicit formula for the I-function is given for all those target spaces and many examples with explicit computations of invariants are provided.</description>

      <title>S-dual of Hamiltonian $\mathbf G$ spaces and relative Langlands duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The S-dual $(\mathbf G^\vee\curvearrowright\mathbf M^\vee)$ of the pair $(\mathbf G\curvearrowright\mathbf M)$ of a smooth affine algebraic symplectic manifold $\mathbf M$ with hamiltonian action of a complex reductive group $\mathbf G$ was introduced implicitly in [arXiv:1706.02112] and explicitly in [arXiv:1807.09038] under the cotangent type assumption. The definition was a modification of the definition of Coulomb branches of gauge theories in [arXiv:1601.03586]. It was motivated by the S-duality of boundary conditions of 4-dimensional $\mathcal N=4$ super Yang-Mills theory, studied by Gaiotto and Witten [arXiv:0807.3720]. It is also relevant to the relative Langlands duality proposed by Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis and Venkatesh. In this article, we review the definition and properties of S-dual.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notions of tight closure of ideals on Witt rings and quasi-tightly closedness of system of parameters. By using the notions, we obtain a characterization of quasi-$F$-rationality. Furthermore, we study the relationship between the closure operator and integrally closure.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Algebraic Families of Birational Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a description of the algebraic families of birational transformations of an algebraic variety X. As an application, we show that the morphisms to Bir(X) given by algebraic families satisfy a Chevalley type result and a certain fibre-dimension formula. Moreover, we show that the algebraic subgroups of Bir(X) are exactly the closed finite-dimensional subgroups with finitely many components. We also study algebraic families of birational transformations preserving a fibration. This builds on previous work of Blanc-Furter, Hanamura, and Ramanujam.</description>

      <title>The structure of Hurwitz numbers with fixed ramification profile and varying genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1891, Hurwitz introduced the enumeration of genus $g$, degree $d$, branched covers of the Riemann sphere with simple ramification over prescribed points and no branching elsewhere. He showed that for fixed degree $d$, the enumeration possesses a remarkable structure. More precisely, it can be expressed as a linear combination of exponentials $m^{2g-2+2d}$, where $m$ ranges over the integers from $1$ to $\binom{d}{2}$.
  In this paper, we generalise this structural result to Hurwitz numbers that enumerate branched covers which also have a prescribed ramification profile over one point. Our proof fundamentally uses the infinite wedge space, in particular the connected correlators of products of $\mathcal{E}$-operators. The recent study of Hurwitz numbers has often focussed on their structure with fixed genus and varying ramification profile. Our main result is orthogonal to this, allowing for the explicit calculation and the asymptotic analysis of Hurwitz numbers in large genus.
  We pose the broad question of which other enumerative problems exhibit analogous structure. We prove that orbifold Hurwitz numbers can also be expressed as a linear combination of exponentials and conjecture that monotone Hurwitz numbers share a similar structure, but with the inclusion of an additional linear term.</description>

      <title>Les Houches lecture notes on topological recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: You may have seen the words "topological recursion" mentioned in papers on matrix models, Hurwitz theory, Gromov-Witten theory, topological string theory, knot theory, topological field theory, JT gravity, cohomological field theory, free probability theory, gauge theories, to name a few. The goal of these lecture notes is certainly not to explain all these applications of the topological recursion framework. Rather, the intention is to provide a down-to-earth (and hopefully accessible) introduction to topological recursion itself, so that when you see these words mentioned, you can understand what it is all about. These lecture notes accompanied a series of lectures at the Les Houches school "Quantum Geometry (Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics)" in Summer 2024.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1809.07616v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a global residual formula in terms of logarithmic indices for one-dimensional holomorphic foliations, with isolated singularities, and logarithmic along normal crossing divisors. We also give a formula for the total sum of the logarithmic indices if the singular set of the foliation is contained in the invariant divisor. As an application, we provide a formula for the number of singularities in the complement of the invariant divisor on complex projective spaces. Finally, we obtain a Poincar\'e-Hopf type formula for singular normal projective varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.04210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a certain affine algebraic surface over $\mathbb{Q}$ such that it admits a regular map to $\mathbb{A}^2/\mathbb{Q}$. We show that any non-trivial torsion line bundle in the relative Picard group $Pic^0\left(S/\mathbb{A}^2\right)$ can be pulled back to ideal classes of quadratic fields whose order can be made sufficiently large. This gives an affirmative answer to a question raised by Agboola and Pappas, in case of affine algebraic surfaces. For a closed point $P\in \mathbb{A}^2/\mathbb{Q}$, we show that the cardinality of a subgroup of the Picard group of the fiber $S_P$ remains unchanged when $P$ varies over a Zarisky open subset in $\mathbb{A}^2$. We also show by constructing an element of odd order $n\geq 3$ in the class group of certain imaginary quadratic fields that the Picard group of $S_P$ has a subgroup isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

Abstract: We study the Kodaira dimension of moduli spaces of polarized hyperk\"ahler varieties deformation equivalent to the Hilbert scheme of points on a K3 surface or to O'Grady's ten dimensional variety. This question was studied by Gritsenko-Hulek-Sankaran in the cases of $K3^{[2]}$ and OG10 type when the divisibility of the polarization is one. We generalize their results to higher dimension and divisibility. As a main result, for almost all dimensions $2n$ we provide a lower bound on the degree such that for all higher degrees, every component of the moduli space of polarized hyperk\"ahler varieties of $K3^{[n]}$ type is of general type.</description>

Abstract: Let $\frakX$ be a smooth $p$-adic formal scheme over $\calO_C$ with rigid generic fiber $X$. In this paper, we construct a new period sheaf $\calO\widehat \bC_{\pd}^+$ on $X_{\proet}$ and use it to establish an integral $p$-adic Simspon correspondence for small $\OXp$-representations on $X_{\proet}$ and small Higgs bundles on $\frakX_{\et}$ which is compatible with the works on rational level. In particular, for a small $\OXp$-representations $\calL$ with induced Higgs bundle $(\calH,\theta_{\calH})$, we provide a canonical morphism $\HIG(\calH,\theta_{\calH})\to\rR\nu_*\calL$ with a uniformly bounded $p^{\infty}$-torsion cofiber. Finally, we shall use this canonical map to study an analogue of Deligne--Illusie decomposition with coefficients in small $\OXp$-representations.</description>

      <title>Fibrations by plane quartic curves with a canonical moving singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08579v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We classify fibrations by integral plane projective rational quartic curves whose generic fibre is regular but admits a non-smooth point that is a canonical divisor. These fibrations can only exist in characteristic two. The geometric generic fibre, which determines the generic behaviour of the special fibres, is an integral plane projective rational quartic curve over the algebraic closure of the function field of the base. It has the remarkable property that the tangent lines at the non-singular points are either all bitangents or all non-ordinary inflection tangents; moreover it is strange, that is, all the tangent lines meet in a common point. We construct two fibrations that are universal in the sense that any other fibration with the aforementioned properties can be obtained from one of them by a base extension. Furthermore, among these fibrations we choose a pencil of plane quartic curves and study in detail its geometry. We determine the corresponding minimal regular model and we describe it as a purely inseparable double covering of a quasi-elliptic fibration.</description>

      <title>Some applications of microlocalization for local complete intersection subvarieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Saito's microlocalization construction has been used to great effect in understanding hypersurface singularities. In this paper, we introduce what we believe to be a suitable analogue of the microlocalization construction for local complete intersection subvarieties. As evidence, we relate our construction to Saito's in the codimension one case. Moreover, we use this construction to study various natural questions concerning the minimal exponent of LCI subvarieties. We show that the minimal exponent agrees with the smallest Bernstein-Sato root, which was expected to be true. We also show that, in the isolated complete intersection singularities case, the minimal exponent agrees with the smallest non-zero spectral number, as defined by Dimca, Maisonobe and Saito. As applications of these results, we prove constructibility of the minimal exponent along certain Whitney stratifications and we prove that the spectrum (hence, the minimal exponent) is constant in equisingular families of ICIS varieties, in the sense of Gaffney.</description>

      <title>Non-density of the exceptional components of the Noether-Lefschetz locus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study when the Picard group of smooth surfaces of degree $d\geq 5$ in $\mathbb{P}^3$ acquires extra classes. In particular we show that the so called exceptional components of the Noether-Lefschetz locus are not Zariski dense. This answers a 1991 question of C. Voisin. We also obtain similar results for the Noether-Lefschetz locus for suitable $(Y,L)$, where $Y$ is a smooth projective threefold and $L$ a very ample line bundle. Both results are applications of the Zilber-Pink viewpoint recently developed by the authors for arbitrary (polarized, integral) variations of Hodge structures.</description>

      <title>Defect of irreducible plane curves with simple singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we focus on the defect of singular plane curve that was recently introduced by Dimca. Roughly speaking, the defect of a reduced plane curve measures the discrepancy from the property of being a free curve. We find some lower-bound on the defect for certain classes of irreducible plane curves admitting nodes, ordinary cusps and ordinary triple points. The main result of the note tells us that reduced simply singular plane curves with sufficiently high Arnold exponents are never free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01481v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a relative hypercohomology version of Serre's GAGA theorem. We prove that the relative hypercohomology of a complex of sheaves on a complex projective variety is isomorphic to the relative hypercohomology of its analytification, with respect to an open or closed subvariety. This result implies Serre's original GAGA theorem.</description>

      <title>On the direct product of fields with an application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:1911.04217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the (infinite) direct product of fields is investigated. In particular, the finiteness of a given set is characterized in terms of some ring-theoretic observations. Next, a certain localization (whose multiplicative set formed by cofinite sets) of the direct product of fields is studied. Finally, it is shown that every set $X$ can be made into a separated scheme, and this scheme is an affine scheme if and only if $X$ is a finite set.</description>

      <title>Local theory of stable polynomials and bounded rational functions of several variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.07507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide detailed local descriptions of stable polynomials in terms of their homogeneous decompositions, Puiseux expansions, and transfer function realizations. We use this theory to first prove that bounded rational functions on the polydisk possess non-tangential limits at every boundary point. We relate higher non-tangential regularity and distinguished boundary behavior of bounded rational functions to geometric properties of the zero sets of stable polynomials via our local descriptions. For a fixed stable polynomial $p$, we analyze the ideal of numerators $q$ such that $q/p$ is bounded on the bi-upper half plane. We completely characterize this ideal in several geometrically interesting situations including smooth points, double points, and ordinary multiple points of $p$. Finally, we analyze integrability properties of bounded rational functions and their derivatives on the bidisk.</description>

      <title>Geometric Eisenstein Series, Intertwining Operators, and Shin's Averaging Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08175v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the geometric Langlands program over function fields, Braverman-Gaitsgory and Laumon constructed geometric Eisenstein functors which geometrize the classical construction of Eisenstein series. Fargues and Scholze very recently constructed a general candidate for the local Langlands correspondence, via a geometric Langlands correspondence occurring over the Fargues-Fontaine curve. We carry some of the theory of geometric Eisenstein series over to the Fargues-Fontaine setting. Namely, given a quasi-split connected reductive group $G/\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ with simply connected derived group and maximal torus $T$, we construct an Eisenstein functor $\mathrm{nEis}(-)$, which takes sheaves on $Bun_{T}$ to sheaves on $Bun_{G}$. We show that, given a sufficiently nice $L$-parameter $\phi_{T}: W_{\mathbb{Q}_{p}} \rightarrow \phantom{}^{L}T$, there is a Hecke eigensheaf on $Bun_{G}$ with eigenvalue $\phi$, given by applying $\mathrm{nEis}(-)$ to the Hecke eigensheaf $\mathcal{S}_{\phi_{T}}$ on $Bun_{T}$ attached to $\phi_{T}$ by Fargues and Zou. We show that $\mathrm{nEis}(\mathcal{S}_{\phi_{T}})$ interacts well with Verdier duality, and, assuming compatibility of the Fargues-Scholze correspondence with a suitably nice form of the local Langlands correspondence, provide an explicit formula for the stalks of the eigensheaf in terms of parabolic inductions of the character $\chi$ attached to $\phi_{T}$. This has several surprising consequences. First, it recovers special cases of an averaging formula of Shin for the cohomology of local Shimura varieties with rational coefficients, and generalizes it to the non-minuscule case. Second, it refines the averaging formula in the cases where the parameter $\phi$ is sufficiently nice, giving an explicit formula for the degrees of cohomology that certain parabolic inductions sit in, and this refined formula holds even with torsion coefficients.</description>

      <title>On {\L}ojasiewicz Inequalities and the Effective Putinar's Positivstellensatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.09551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The representation of positive polynomials on a semi-algebraic set in terms of sums of squares is a central question in real algebraic geometry, which the Positivstellensatz answers. In this paper, we study the effective Putinar's Positivestellensatz on a compact basic semi-algebraic set $S$ and provide a new proof and new improved bounds on the degree of the representation of positive polynomials. These new bounds involve a parameter $\epsilon$ measuring the non-vanishing of the positive function, the constant $\mathfrak{c}$ and exponent $L$ of a {\L}ojasiewicz inequality for the semi-algebraic distance function associated to the inequalities $\mathbf{g} = (g_1, \dots , g_r)$ defining $S$. They are polynomial in $\mathfrak{c}$ and $\epsilon^{-1}$ with an exponent depending only on $L$. We analyse in details the {\L}ojasiewicz inequality when the defining inequalities $\mathbf g$ satisfy the Constraint Qualification Condition. We show that, in this case, the {\L}ojasiewicz exponent $L$ is $1$ and we relate the {\L}ojasiewicz constant $\mathfrak{c}$ with the distance of $\mathbf g$ to the set of singular systems.</description>

      <title>Some cases of Oort's conjecture about Newton polygons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11080v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper contains a method to prove the existence of smooth curves in positive characteristic whose Jacobians have unusual Newton polygon. Using this method, I give a new proof that there exist supersingular curves of genus $4$ for every prime $p$. More generally, for every prime $p$ and every $g \geq 4$, I prove that every Newton polygon whose $p$-rank is at least $g-4$ occurs for a smooth curve of genus $g$. In addition, I resolve some cases of Oort's conjecture about Newton polygons.</description>

      <title>Geometry of $K$-trivial Moishezon manifolds : decomposition theorem and holomorphic geometric structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact complex manifold such that its canonical bundle $K_X$ is numerically trivial. Assume additionally that $X$ is Moishezon or $X$ is Fujiki with dimension at most four. Using the MMP and classical results in foliation theory, we prove a Beauville-Bogomolov type decomposition theorem for $X$. We deduce that holomorphic geometric structures of affine type on $X$ are in fact locally homogeneous away from an analytic subset of complex codimension at least two, and that they cannot be rigid unless $X$ is an \'etale quotient of a compact complex torus. Moreover, we establish a characterization of torus quotients using the vanishing of the first two Chern classes which is valid for any compact complex $n$-folds of algebraic dimension at least $n-1$. Finally, we show that a compact complex manifold with trivial canonical bundle bearing a rigid geometric structure must have infinite fundamental group if either $X$ is Fujiki, $X$ is a threefold, or $X$ is of algebraic dimension at most one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we first prove a key result which asserts that every nonzero idempotent element of a $G$-graded commutative ring with $G$ a torsion-free Abelian group is homogeneous of degree zero. This important special case leads us to derive a general result which asserts that every idempotent element of a $G$-graded commutative ring $R=\bigoplus\limits_{n\in G}R_{n}$ with $G$ an Abelian group is contained in the subring $\bigoplus\limits_{h\in H}R_{h}$ where $H$ is the torsion subgroup of $G$. This theorem gives an affirmative answer to the generalized version of Kaplansky's idempotent conjecture in the commutative case. Our result also ...</description>

      <title>Heavenly metrics, hyper-Lagrangians and Joyce structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14352v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In \cite{B3}, Bridgeland defined a geometric structure, named a Joyce structure, conjectured to exist on the space $M$ of stability conditions of a $CY_3$ triangulated category. Given a non-degeneracy assumption, a feature of this structure is a complex hyper-K\"ahler metric with homothetic symmetry on the total space $X = TM$ of the holomorphic tangent bundle. \par Generalising the isomonodromy calculation which leads to the $A_2$ Joyce structure in \cite{BM}, we obtain an explicit expression for a hyper-K\"ahler metric with homothetic symmetry via construction of the isomonodromic flows of a Schr\"odinger equation with deformed polynomial oscillator potential of odd degree $2n+1$. The metric is defined on a total space $X$ of complex dimension $4n$ and fibres over a $2n$--dimensional manifold $M$ which can be identified with the unfolding of the $A_{2n}$-singularity. The hyper-K\"ahler structure is shown to be compatible with the natural symplectic structure on $M$ in the sense of admitting an \textit{affine symplectic fibration} as defined in \cite{BS}. \par Separately, using the additional conditions imposed by a Joyce structure, we consider reductions of Pleba\'nski's heavenly equations that govern the hyper-K\"ahler condition. We introduce the notion of a \textit{projectable hyper-Lagrangian} foliation and show that in dimension four such a foliation of $X$ leads to a linearisation of the heavenly equation. The hyper-K\"ahler metrics constructed here are shown to admit such a foliation.</description>
