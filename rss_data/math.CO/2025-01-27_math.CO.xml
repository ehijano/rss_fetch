      <title>The minimum size of a $k$-connected locally nonforesty graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A local subgraph of a graph is the subgraph induced by the neighborhood of a vertex. Thus a graph of order $n$ has $n$ local subgraphs. A graph $G$ is called locally nonforesty if every local subgraph of $G$ contains a cycle. Clearly, a graph is locally nonforesty if and only if every vertex of the graph is the hub of a wheel. We determine the minimum size of a $k$-connected locally nonforesty graph of order $n.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, its spectral radius $\rho(G)$ is the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a finite family of graphs with $\min_{F\in \mathcal{F}}\chi(F)=r+1\geq3$, where $\chi(F)$ is the chromatic number of $F$. Set $t=\max_{F\in\mathcal{F}}|F|$. Let $T(rt,r)$ be the Tur\'{a}n graph of order $rt$ with $r$ parts. Assume that some $F_{0}\subseteq\mathcal{F}$ is a subgraph of the graph obtained from $T(rt,r)$ by embedding a path or a matching in one part. Let ${\rm EX}(n,\mathcal{F})$ be the set of graphs with the maximum number of edges among all the graphs of order $n$ not containing any $F\in\mathcal{F}$. Simonovits \cite{S1,S2} gave general results on the graphs in ${\rm EX}(n,\mathcal{F})$. Let ${\rm SPEX}(n,\mathcal{F})$ be the set of graphs with the maximum spectral radius among all the graphs of order $n$ not containing any $F\in\mathcal{F}$. Motivated by the work of Simonovits, we characterize the specified structure of the graphs in ${\rm SPEX}(n,\mathcal{F})$ in this paper. Moreover, some applications are also included.</description>

      <title>Embedding edge-colored graphs in expanders with roll-back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a method to embed edge-colored graphs into families of expander graphs, which generalizes a framework developed by Dragani\'c, Krivelevich, and Nenadov (2022). As an application, we show that each family of sufficiently pseudo-random graphs on $n$ vertices contains every edge-colored subdivision of $K_\Delta$, provided that the distance between branch vertices in the subdivision is large enough, the average degree of each graph in the family is at least $(1+o(1))\Delta$, and the number of vertices in the subdivision is at most $(1-o(1))n$.
  This work is motivated in part by the problem of finding structures in distance graphs defined over finite vector spaces. For $d\ge 2$ and an odd prime power $q$, consider the vector space $\mathbb{F}_q^d$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, where the distance between two points $(x_1,\ldots,x_d)$ and $(y_1,\ldots,y_d)$ is defined to be $\sum_{i=1}^d (x_i-y_i)^2$. A distance graph is a graph associated with a non-zero distance to each of its edges. We show that large subsets of vector spaces over finite fields contain every distance graph that is a nearly spanning subdivision of a complete graph, provided that the distance between branching vertices in the subdivision is large enough.</description>

      <title>On the Set of Balanced Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometric structure of the set of cooperative transferable utility games having a nonempty core, characterized by Bondareva and Shapley as balanced games. We show that this set is a nonpointed polyhedral cone, and we find the set of its extremal rays and facets. This study is also done for the set of balanced games whose value for the grand coalition is fixed, which yields an affine nonpointed polyhedral cone. Finally, the case of nonnegative balanced games with fixed value for the grand coalition is tackled. This set is a convex polytope, with remarkable properties. We characterize its vertices and facets, study the adjacency structure of vertices, develop an algorithm for generating vertices in a random uniform way, and show that this polytope is combinatorial and its adjacency graph is Hamiltonian. Last, we give a characterization of the set of games having a core reduced to a singleton. Funding: This work was supported by the Spanish Government [Grant PID2021-124933NB-I00].</description>

      <title>Open Problems in Continuous Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by notorious combinatorial optimization problems on graphs, in this paper we propose a series of related problems defined using a metric space and topology determined by a graph. Particularly, we present Independent Set, Vertex Cover, Chromatic Number and Treewidth problems on, so-called, continuous graphs where every edge is represented by a unit-length continuous interval rather than by a pair of vertices. If any point of any unit-interval edge is considered as a possible member of a hitting set or a cover, the classical combinatorial problems become trickier and many open questions arise. Notably, in many real-life applications, such continuous view on a graph is more natural than the classic combinatorial definition of a graph.</description>

      <title>Impartial Chess on Integer Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Berlekamp proposed a class of impartial combinatorial games based on the moves of chess pieces on rectangular boards. We generalize impartial chess games by playing them on Young diagrams and obtain results about winning and losing positions and Sprague-Grundy values for all chess pieces. We classify these games, and their restrictions to sets of partitions known as rectangles, staircases, and general staircases, according to the approach of Conway, later extended by Gurvich and Ho. The games $\rm {R\small OOK}$ and $\rm{Q\small UEEN}$ restricted to rectangles are known to have the same game tree as $2$-pile $\rm N{\small IM}$ and $\rm W{\small YTHOFF}$, respectively, so our work generalizes these well-known games.</description>

      <title>Tree independence number V. Walls and claws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a family $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, we say that a graph $G$ is $\mathcal{H}$-free if no induced subgraph of $G$ is isomorphic to a member of $\mathcal{H}$. Let $S_{t,t,t}$ be the graph obtained from $K_{1,3}$ by subdividing each edge $t-1$ times, and let $W_{t\times t}$ be the $t$-by-$t$ hexagonal grid. Let $\mathcal{L}_t$ be the family of all graphs $G$ such that $G$ is the line graph of some subdivision of $W_{t \times t}$. We prove that for every positive integer $t$ there exists $c(t)$ such that every $\mathcal{L}_t \cup \{S_{t,t,t}, K_{t,t}\}$-free $n$-vertex graph admits a tree decomposition in which the maximum size of an independent set in each bag is at most $c(t)\log^4n$. This is a variant of a conjecture of Dallard, Krnc, Kwon, Milani\v{c}, Munaro, \v{S}torgel, and Wiederrecht from 2024. This implies that the Maximum Weight Independent Set problem, as well as many other natural algorithmic problems, that are known to be NP-hard in general, can be solved in quasi-polynomial time if the input graph is $\mathcal{L}_t \cup \{S_{t,t,t},K_{t,t}\}$-free. As part of our proof, we show that for every positive integer $t$ there exists an integer $d$ such that every $\mathcal{L}_t \cup \{S_{t,t,t}\}$-free graph admits a balanced separator that is contained in the neighborhood of at most $d$ vertices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that products of double Grothendieck polynomials have the same back- and forward-stability numbers as products of Schubert polynomials, characterize which simple reflections appear in such products, and also give a new proof of a finiteness conjecture of Lam-Lee-Shimozono on products of back-stable Grothendieck polynomials which was first proved by Anderson. To do this, we use the main theorems from our recent work, as well as expansion formulas of Lenart, Fomin-Kirillov, and Lam-Lee-Shimozono.</description>

      <title>Low rank matrix completion and realization of graphs: results and problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Netflix problem (from machine learning) asks the following. Given a ratings matrix in which each entry $(i,j)$ represents the rating of movie $j$ by customer $i$, if customer $i$ has watched movie $j$, and is otherwise missing, we would like to predict the remaining entries in order to make good recommendations to customers on what to watch next. The remaining entries are predicted so as to minimize the {\it rank} of the completed matrix.
  In this survey we study a more general problem, in which instead of knowing specific matrix elements, we know linear relations on such elements. We describe applications of these results to embeddings of graphs in surfaces (more precisely, embeddings with rotation systems, and embeddings modulo 2).</description>

      <title>Which coprime graphs are divisor graphs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$, the coprime graph $\Gamma(G)$ of $G$ is a graph with vertex set $G$, in which two distinct vertices $a$ and $b$ are adjacent if the order of $a$ and the order of $b$ are coprime. In this paper, we first give a characterization for which generalized lexicographic products are divisor graphs. As applications, we show that every of power graph, reduced power graph and order graph is a divisor graph, which also implies the main result in [N. Takshak, A. Sehgal, A. Malik, Power graph of a finite group is always divisor graph, Asian-Eur. J. Math. 16 (2023), ID: 2250236]. Then, we prove that the coprime graph of a group is a generalized lexicographic product, and give two characterizations for which coprime graphs are divisor graphs. We also describe the groups $G$ with $|\pi(G)|\le 4$, whose coprime graph is a divisor graph. Finally, we classify the finite groups $G$ so that $\Gamma(G)$ is a divisor graph if $G$ is a nilpotent group, a dihedral group, a generalized quaternion group, a symmetric group, an alternating group, a direct product of two non-trivial groups, and a sporadic simple group.</description>

      <title>Trace of Multi-variable Matrix Functions and its Application to Function of Graph Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix extension of a scalar function of a single variable is well-studied in literature. Of particular interest is the trace of such functions. It is known that for diagonalizable matrices, $M$, the function $g(M) = \text{Tr}(f(M)) = \sum_{j=1}^n f(\mu_j)$ (where $\{\mu_j\}_{j=1,2,\cdots,n}$ are the eigenvalues of $M$) inherits the monotonocity and convexity properties of $f$ ($f$ need not be operator convex for $g$ to be convex -- convexity is sufficient). In this paper we first develop the idea of matrix extension of function of multiple variables, study the monotonicity and convexity properties of the trace, and thus show that a function of form $g(M) = \sum_{j_1=1}^n \sum_{j_2=1}^n \cdots \sum_{j_m=1}^n f(\mu_{j_1}, \mu_{j_2},\cdots, \mu_{j_m})$ also inherits the monotonocity and convexity properties of the multi-variable function, $f$. We apply the results to functions of the spectrum of the weighted Laplacian matrix of an undirected, simple graph.</description>

Abstract: In the space of square matrices, we characterize row-generated subspaces, on which the determinant is an irreducible polynomial. As a corollary, we characterize square systems of polynomial equations with indeterminate coefficients, whose discriminant is an irreducible hypersurface. This resolves a conjecture of Esterov, and, in a sequel paper, leads to a complete description of components and codimensions for discriminants of square systems of equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetric edge polytopes of graphs are important object in Ehrhart theory,and have an application to Kuramoto models.In the present paper, we study the upper and lower bounds for the number of facets of symmetric edge polytopes of connected graphs conjectured by Braun and Bruegge. In particular, we show that their conjecture is true for any graph that is the join of two graphs (equivalently, for any connected graph whose complement graph is not connected). It is known that any symmetric edge polytope is a centrally symmetric reflexive polytope. Hence our results give a partial answer to Nill's conjecture: the number of facets of a $d$-dimensional reflexive polytope is at most $6^{d/2}$.</description>

      <title>When do Schubert polynomial products stabilize?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The "back-stabilization number" for products of Schubert polynomials is the distance the corresponding permutations must be shifted before the structure constants stabilize. We give an explicit formula for this number and thereby prove a conjecture of N. Li in a strengthened form. This leads to an additional result: a formula for the smallest $n$ such that a given Schubert product expands completely over $S_n$.
  Our method is to explore back-stable fundamental slide polynomials and their products combinatorially, in the context of their associated words. We use three main tools: (i) an algebra consisting of "colored words", with a modified shuffle product, and which contains the rings of back (quasi)symmetric functions as subquotients; (ii) the combinatorics of increasing suffixes of reduced words; and (iii) the lift of differential operators to the space of colored words.</description>

      <title>Matroid intersection and packing/covering conjectures are true in the class of finitary matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given two finite matroids on the same ground set, a celebrated result of Edmonds says that the ground set can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets in a manner that there is a common independent set in both matroids whose intersection with the first subset spans that subset in the first matroid, and whose intersection with the second subset spans that subset in the second matroid.
  There is a longstanding conjecture regarding the situation of two matroids defined on the same infinite ground set. Infinite matroids were only recently axiomatized in the early 2010s in the work of Bruhn et al., while the conjecture had been proposed during the 1990s for the class of structures that are now called finitary matroids, which are matroids all of whose circuits are finite sets.
  The packing/covering conjecture, due to Bowler and Carmesin, is a related conjecture in the sense that it is true in the class of all matroids if and only if the matroid intersection conjecture is true in the class of all matroids. Given any family of matroids on the same ground set, the conjecture asks if it is possible to partition the ground set into two disjoint subsets in a way such that the corresponding family of matroids restricted to the first subset admits a packing while the family of matroids contracted to the second subset admits a covering.
  We prove both of these conjectures in the class of finitary matroids. Our main tool is nonstandard analysis, specifically the technique of iterated nonstandard extensions. Roughly, we first embed any infinite matroid inside a hyperfinite matroid defined on a subset of the nonstandard extension of the original ground set, and we iteratively nonstandardly extend the hyperfinite structure again in order to prove results in the internal universe that can be directly transferred to obtain results about the matroid(s) we started with.</description>

      <title>Metric graphs of negative type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The negative type inequalities of a metric space are closely tied to embeddability. A result by Gupta, Newman, and Rabinovich implies that if a metric graph $G$ does not contain a theta submetric as an embedding, then $G$ has negative type. We show the converse: if a metric graph $G$ contains a theta, then it does not have negative type.</description>

      <title>A classification of $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graphs with girth $6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ denote a $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graph with diameter $D$ and valency $k \ge 3$. In [Homotopy in $Q$-polynomial distance-regular graphs, Discrete Math., {\bf 223} (2000), 189-206], H. Lewis showed that the girth of $\Gamma$ is at most $6$. In this paper we classify graphs that attain this upper bound. We show that $\Gamma$ has girth $6$ if and only if it is either isomorphic to the Odd graph on a set of cardinality $2D +1$, or to a generalized hexagon of order $(1, k -1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph code is a linear code obtained from linear codes $C$ and a certain bipartite graph G. In this paper, I propose an expansion of the definition of graph code to general $l$-partite, and give its lower bound of minimum distance. I also give an example of generalized graph code and calculate its parameters $[n, k, d]$.</description>

      <title>An Alternative Approach for Nonparametric Analysis of Random Utility Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14249v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We readdress the problem of nonparametric statistical testing of random utility models proposed in Kitamura and Stoye (2018). Although their test is elegant, it is subject to computational constraints which leaves execution of the test infeasible in many applications. We note that much of the computational burden in Kitamura and Stoye's test is due to their test defining a polyhedral cone through its vertices rather than its faces. We propose an alternative but equivalent hypothesis test for random utility models. This test relies on a series of equality and inequality constraints which defines the faces of the corresponding polyhedral cone. Building on our testing procedure, we develop a novel axiomatization of the random utility model.</description>

      <title>Regular polygons, line operators, and elliptic modular surfaces as realization spaces of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an integer $n\geq 7$, we investigate the matroid realization space of a specific deformation of the regular $n$-gon along with its lines of symmetry. It turns out that this particular realization space is birational to the elliptic modular surface $\Xi_{1}(n)$ over the modular curve $X_{1}(n)$.
  In this way, we obtain a model of $\Xi_{1}(n)$ defined over the rational numbers. Furthermore, a natural geometric operator acts on these matroid realizations. On the elliptic modular surface, this operator corresponds to the multiplication by $-2$ on the elliptic curves. This provides a new geometric approach to computing multiplication by $-2$ on elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles II: the dynamics of an aperiodic computer chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a new family $(\mathcal{T}_n)_{n\geq1}$ of aperiodic sets of Wang tiles and we describe the dynamical properties of the set $\Omega_n$ of valid configurations $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. The tiles can be defined as the different instances of a square-shaped computer chip whose inputs and outputs are 3-dimensional integer vectors. The family include the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles and gathers the hallmarks of other small aperiodic sets of Wang tiles. Notably, the tiles satisfy additive versions of equations verified by the Kari--Culik aperiodic sets of 14 and 13 Wang tiles. Also configurations in $\Omega_n$ are the codings of a $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action on a 2-dimensional torus like the Jeandel--Rao aperiodic set of 11 Wang tiles. The family broadens the relation between quadratic integers and aperiodic tilings beyond the omnipresent golden ratio as the dynamics of $\Omega_n$ involves the positive root $\beta$ of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$, also known as the $n$-th metallic mean. We show the existence of an almost one-to-one factor map $\Omega_n\to\mathbb{T}^2$ which commutes with the shift action on $\Omega_n$ with horizontal and vertical translations by $\beta$ on $\mathbb{T}^2$. The factor map can be explicitly defined by the average of the top labels from the same row of tiles as in Kari and Culik examples. The proofs are based on the minimality of $\Omega_n$ (proved in a previous article) and a polygonal partition of $\mathbb{T}^2$ which we show is a Markov partition for the toral $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action. The partition and the sets of Wang tiles are symmetric which makes them, like Penrose tilings, worthy of investigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the limits of canonical series along families of curves degenerating to a nodal curve which is general for its topology, in the weak sense that the branches over nodes on each of its components are in general position. We define a fan structure on the space of edge lengths on the dual graph of the limit curve, and construct a projective variety parametrizing the limits, organized in strata associated to the cones of this fan. This extends to all topologies the works by Eisenbud-Harris (Invent. Math. 87: 496-515, 1987) on curves of compact type and Esteves-Medeiros (Invent. Math. 149: 267-338, 2002) on two-component curves.</description>

      <title>On stabilizers in finite permutation groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a permutation group on the finite set $\Omega$. We prove various results about partitions of $\Omega$ whose stabilizers have good properties. In particular, we obtain the following three theorems: In every solvable permutation group, there is a subset whose stabilizer has all orbits of length at most $6$, which is best possible and answers two questions of Babai. Every solvable maximal subgroup of any almost simple group has derived length at most $10$, which is best possible. In every primitive group with solvable stabilizer, there are two points whose pointwise stabilizer has derived length bounded by an absolute constant.</description>

      <title>Random-Key Algorithms for Optimizing Integrated Operating Room Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient surgery room scheduling is essential for hospital efficiency, patient satisfaction, and resource utilization. This study addresses this challenge by introducing a novel concept of Random-Key Optimizer (RKO), rigorously tested on literature and new, real-world inspired instances. Our combinatorial optimization problem incorporates multi-room scheduling, equipment scheduling, and complex availability constraints for rooms, patients, and surgeons, facilitating rescheduling and enhancing operational flexibility. The RKO approach represents solutions as points in a continuous space, which are then mapped in the problem solution space via a deterministic function known as a decoder. The core idea is to operate metaheuristics and heuristics in the random-key space, unaware of the original solution space. We design the Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm with $Q$-Learning, Simulated Annealing, and Iterated Local Search for use within an RKO framework, employing a single decoder function. The proposed metaheuristics are complemented by lower-bound formulations, providing optimal gaps for evaluating the effectiveness of the heuristic results. Our results demonstrate significant lower and upper bounds improvements for the literature instances, notably proving one optimal result. Furthermore, the best-proposed metaheuristic efficiently generates schedules for the newly introduced instances, even in highly constrained scenarios. This research offers valuable insights and practical solutions for improving surgery scheduling processes, offering tangible benefits to hospitals by optimising resource allocation, reducing patient wait times, and enhancing overall operational efficiency.</description>
