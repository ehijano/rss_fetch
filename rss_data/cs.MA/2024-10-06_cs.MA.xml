      <title>Distributed Networked Multi-task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a distributed multi-task learning scheme that accounts for multiple linear model estimation tasks with heterogeneous and/or correlated data streams. We assume that nodes can be partitioned into groups corresponding to different learning tasks and communicate according to a directed network topology. Each node estimates a linear model asynchronously and is subject to local (within-group) regularization and global (across groups) regularization terms targeting noise reduction and generalization performance improvement respectively. We provide a finite-time characterization of convergence of the estimators and task relation and illustrate the scheme's general applicability in two examples: random field temperature estimation and modeling student performance from different academic districts.</description>

      <title>AutoML-Agent: A Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Full-Pipeline AutoML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) accelerates AI development by automating tasks in the development pipeline, such as optimal model search and hyperparameter tuning. Existing AutoML systems often require technical expertise to set up complex tools, which is in general time-consuming and requires a large amount of human effort. Therefore, recent works have started exploiting large language models (LLM) to lessen such burden and increase the usability of AutoML frameworks via a natural language interface, allowing non-expert users to build their data-driven solutions. These methods, however, are usually designed only for a particular process in the AI development pipeline and do not efficiently use the inherent capacity of the LLMs. This paper proposes AutoML-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework tailored for full-pipeline AutoML, i.e., from data retrieval to model deployment. AutoML-Agent takes user's task descriptions, facilitates collaboration between specialized LLM agents, and delivers deployment-ready models. Unlike existing work, instead of devising a single plan, we introduce a retrieval-augmented planning strategy to enhance exploration to search for more optimal plans. We also decompose each plan into sub-tasks (e.g., data preprocessing and neural network design) each of which is solved by a specialized agent we build via prompting executing in parallel, making the search process more efficient. Moreover, we propose a multi-stage verification to verify executed results and guide the code generation LLM in implementing successful solutions. Extensive experiments on seven downstream tasks using fourteen datasets show that AutoML-Agent achieves a higher success rate in automating the full AutoML process, yielding systems with good performance throughout the diverse domains.</description>

      <title>Multi-Robot Motion Planning with Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently been successfully applied to a wide range of robotics applications for learning complex multi-modal behaviors from data. However, prior works have mostly been confined to single-robot and small-scale environments due to the high sample complexity of learning multi-robot diffusion models. In this paper, we propose a method for generating collision-free multi-robot trajectories that conform to underlying data distributions while using only single-robot data. Our algorithm, Multi-robot Multi-model planning Diffusion (MMD), does so by combining learned diffusion models with classical search-based techniques -- generating data-driven motions under collision constraints. Scaling further, we show how to compose multiple diffusion models to plan in large environments where a single diffusion model fails to generalize well. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in planning for dozens of robots in a variety of simulated scenarios motivated by logistics environments.

      <title>Offline congestion games: How feedback type affects data coverage requirement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates when one can efficiently recover an approximate Nash Equilibrium (NE) in offline congestion games. The existing dataset coverage assumption in offline general-sum games inevitably incurs a dependency on the number of actions, which can be exponentially large in congestion games. We consider three different types of feedback with decreasing revealed information. Starting from the facility-level (a.k.a., semi-bandit) feedback, we propose a novel one-unit deviation coverage condition and give a pessimism-type algorithm that can recover an approximate NE. For the agent-level (a.k.a., bandit) feedback setting, interestingly, we show the one-unit deviation coverage condition is not sufficient. On the other hand, we convert the game to multi-agent linear bandits and show that with a generalized data coverage assumption in offline linear bandits, we can efficiently recover the approximate NE. Lastly, we consider a novel type of feedback, the game-level feedback where only the total reward from all agents is revealed. Again, we show the coverage assumption for the agent-level feedback setting is insufficient in the game-level feedback setting, and with a stronger version of the data coverage assumption for linear bandits, we can recover an approximate NE. Together, our results constitute the first study of offline congestion games and imply formal separations between different types of feedback.</description>

      <title>TrustAgent: Towards Safe and Trustworthy LLM-based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01586v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rise of LLM-based agents shows great potential to revolutionize task planning, capturing significant attention. Given that these agents will be integrated into high-stake domains, ensuring their reliability and safety is crucial. This paper presents an Agent-Constitution-based agent framework, TrustAgent, with a particular focus on improving the LLM-based agent safety. The proposed framework ensures strict adherence to the Agent Constitution through three strategic components: pre-planning strategy which injects safety knowledge to the model before plan generation, in-planning strategy which enhances safety during plan generation, and post-planning strategy which ensures safety by post-planning inspection. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can effectively enhance an LLM agent's safety across multiple domains by identifying and mitigating potential dangers during the planning. Further analysis reveals that the framework not only improves safety but also enhances the helpfulness of the agent. Additionally, we highlight the importance of the LLM reasoning ability in adhering to the Constitution. This paper sheds light on how to ensure the safe integration of LLM-based agents into human-centric environments.

      <title>Understanding the Impact of Coalitions between EV Charging Stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) is driving the expansion of charging infrastructure globally. As charging stations become ubiquitous, their substantial electricity consumption can influence grid operation and electricity pricing. Naturally, \textit{some} groups of charging stations, which could be jointly operated by a company, may coordinate to decide their charging profile. While coordination among all charging stations is ideal, it is unclear if coordination of some charging stations is better than no coordination. In this paper, we analyze this intermediate regime between no and full coordination of charging stations. We model EV charging as a non-cooperative aggregative game, where each station's cost is determined by both monetary payments tied to reactive electricity prices on the grid and its sensitivity to deviations from a desired charging profile. We consider a solution concept that we call $\mathcal{C}$-Nash equilibrium, which is tied to a coalition $\mathcal{C}$ of charging stations coordinating to reduce their costs. We provide sufficient conditions, in terms of the demand and sensitivity of charging stations, to determine when independent (aka uncoordinated) operation of charging stations could result in lower overall costs to charging stations, coalition and charging stations outside the coalition. Somewhat counter to common intuition, we show numerical instances where allowing charging stations to operate independently is better than coordinating a subset of stations as a coalition. Jointly, these results provide operators of charging stations insights into how to coordinate their charging behavior, and open several research directions.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Algorithms for Finding Local Nash Equilibria in Zero-Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-sum games arise in a wide variety of problems, including robust optimization and adversarial learning. However, algorithms deployed for finding a local Nash equilibrium in these games often converge to non-Nash stationary points. This highlights a key challenge: for any algorithm, the stability properties of its underlying dynamical system can cause non-Nash points to be potential attractors. To overcome this challenge, algorithms must account for subtleties involving the curvatures of players' costs. To this end, we leverage dynamical system theory and develop a second-order algorithm for finding a local Nash equilibrium in the smooth, possibly nonconvex-nonconcave, zero-sum game setting. First, we prove that this novel method guarantees convergence to only local Nash equilibria with a local linear convergence rate. We then interpret a version of this method as a modified Gauss-Newton algorithm with local superlinear convergence to the neighborhood of a point that satisfies first-order local Nash equilibrium conditions. In comparison, current related state-of-the-art methods do not offer convergence rate guarantees. Furthermore, we show that this approach naturally generalizes to settings with convex and potentially coupled constraints while retaining earlier guarantees of convergence to only local (generalized) Nash equilibria.</description>
