      <title>Critical dynamics and superconducting state preparation in the quenched Kitaev chain with pairing imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical balance of the pairing term plays a crucial role in the emergence of topological superconductivity in the p-wave spinless Kitaev chain, particularly in the non-Hermitian regime. In this work, we systematically investigate the effects of non-Hermitian pairing terms on both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phenomena in the Kitaev chain. Our analysis focuses on two representative forms of pairing imbalance: uniform and staggered. We demonstrate that a uniform imbalance induces only minor perturbations to the spectrum and dynamical properties, without significantly affecting its equilibrium phase or nonequilibrium steady behavior. In contrast, even a slight staggered imbalance leads to drastic changes. At the symmetry point, it enables the resonant generation of two distinct superconducting states through critical dynamics, with the realized state determined by the direction of the bias. Both states exhibit exact off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) in the thermodynamic limit. Our results emphasize the fragility of coherent dynamics in non-Hermitian topological systems and elucidate the interplay among non-Hermiticity, topology, and dynamical criticality in quench processes.</description>

      <title>Extending the optical absorption in a lumped element meander structure to far-infrared wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21951v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting radiation detectors typically exhibit detection and single photon sensitivity limited to the mid infrared wavelength range. Extending their detection capabilities into the far infrared range (&gt;10 um) requires careful selection of substrate materials and detector geometries. The overall detection efficiency is linked to absorption and coupling efficiencies. In this study, the resonator geometry and absorption efficiency were estimated using electromagnetic simulations in CST Microwave Studio for a lumped-element meander structure. Simulations were performed for the 12 to 50 um wavelength range, corresponding to the Infrared Free Electron Laser (IR FEL) at RRCAT, Indore. Absorption in the meander inductor was influenced by the substrate material, thickness, and impedance matching between the detector and incident photon medium. The results indicate that SiO2 and diamond substrates are suitable for developing lumped-element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKID) in this range. Optimized meander geometries on diamond substrates demonstrated absorption efficiencies of up to 95% for narrow bandwidths and over 50% for wide bandwidths. A 30-pixel LEKID structure was fabricated using electron beam lithography on a 500 um SiO2 coated Si substrate, with a 20 nm thick Ti40V60 alloy resonator. Experimental absorption efficiency was determined through transmission and reflection measurements. Results show that in the 14 to 26 um IR-FEL range, the LEKID achieved up to 75% absorption efficiency. These studies demonstrate that the LEKID structure is ideal for detecting far infrared wavelengths above 10 um, with high absorption efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the superconductivity of high-entropy Hf-Nb-Ta-Ti-Zr alloy films affected by structural order. While films deposited from the same target on a substrate with a room temperature are amorphous, and if superconducting, only at temperatures below 1.9 K, films deposited on a substrate with a temperature of 740 $^o$C and 630 $^o$C are superconducting with a critical temperature of 6.61 K and 6.63 K, respectively. The observed effect of structural order on superconductivity can be explained by the theory of superconductivity in strongly bound amorphous materials recently published by Baggioli et al.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in cubic La3Al with interstitial anionic electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of superconductivity in cubic La3Al single crystal. It shows a metallic behavior at a normal state without observable structural transition and enters the superconducting state below Tc ~ 6.32 K. Detailed characterizations and analysis indicate that cubic La3Al is a bulk type-II BCS superconductor. Moreover, theoretical calculations show that it can host interstitial anionic electrons, which are located at the body center of cubic unit cell, and confirm the electron-phonon coupling as the superconducting mechamism. Thus, cubic La3Al can be regarded as an novel electride superconductor.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Parasitic Two-Level Systems in Merged-Element Transmon Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional transmon qubits, decoherence is dominated by a large number of parasitic two-level systems (TLS) residing at the edges of its large area coplanar shunt capacitor and junction leads. Avoiding these defects by improvements in design, fabrication and materials proved to be a significant challenge that so far led to limited progress. The merged-element transmon qubit (''mergemon''), a recently proposed paradigm shift in transmon design, attempts to address these issues by engineering the Josephson junction to act as its own shunt capacitor. With its energy mostly confined within the junctions, efforts required to improve qubit coherence can be concentrated on the junction barrier, a potentially easier to control interface compared to exposed circuit areas. Incorporating an additional aluminium deposition and oxidation into the in-situ bandaged Niemeyer-Dolan technique, we were able to fabricate flux-tunable mergemon qubits achieving mean $T_{1}$ relaxation times of up to $130\mu s$ ($Q \approx 3.3 \times 10^{6}$). TLS spectroscopy under applied strain and electric fields, together with systematic design variations, revealed that even for mergemon qubits - despite their significantly reduced footprint and increased junction barrier volume - careful design considerations are still essential to avoid coherence limitations due to surface loss.</description>

      <title>Limitations of detecting structural changes and time-reversal symmetry breaking in scanning tunneling microscopy experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$=K, Cs, Rb) is an exciting playground for investigating various density waves, unusual superconductivity and a surprising time-reversal symmetry breaking despite the absence of spin magnetism. The origin of time-reversal symmetry breaking has been of particular interest, and conflicting results have been intensely debated. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) provided crucial evidence by the observation that apparent chirality associated with the 2 $\times$ 2 charge density wave (CDW) may be modified by the direction of magnetic field, a phenomenon observed in select sample areas in some experiments, but not others. Related to this, Xing et al. investigated the effects of magnetic and electric fields on the 2 $\times$ 2 CDW state and the lattice structure of kagome superconductor RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. They report a $\sim$ 1% change in the in-plane lattice constants, concomitant with the CDW intensities modification, controlled by the field direction. This was interpreted as a rare case of piezomagnetism. Here we show how the apparent magnetic field induced lattice and CDW intensity change is a consequence of two independent experimental artifacts: reconfiguration of atoms at the STM tip apex that alter the amplitudes of CDW modulations, and piezo creep, hysteresis, and thermal drift that artificially distort STM topographs. We find no evidence supporting that magnetic field leads to intrinsic changes in the sample, which challenges reported piezomagnetism.</description>

      <title>Pathways from a chiral superconductor to a composite Fermi liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments have reported chiral time-reversal broken superconductivity in $n$-layer rhombohedral graphene for $n = 4,5, 6$. Introducing a moir\'e potential by alignement with a hexagonal boron nitride substrate suppresses the superconductivity but leads instead to various fractional quantum anomalous Hall phenomena. Motivated by these observations, we consider the fate of the phase transition between (a chiral) Landau Fermi liquid (LFL) metal and a Composite Fermi Liquid (CFL) metal in the presence of attractive interactions. These are parent states, respectively, for the superconductor and the fractional quantum Hall states. For weak attractive interactions, the LFL is usually unstable to superconductivity while the CFL is stable. This raises the possibility of a direct continuous phase transition between the chiral superconductor and the CFL. However, we show that generically the LFL close to the transition to the CFL is stable against superconductivity. Thus the evolution between the CFL and chiral superconductor goes through an intermediate stable LFL phase for weak attractive interactions. With stronger interactions, the evolution can instead go through a non-Abelian paired quantum Hall state.</description>

      <title>Competing $s$-wave pairing in overdoped $t$-$J$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $d$-wave pairing symmetry has long been considered a defining feature of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. In this work, we reveal that $s$-wave pairing states exhibit variational energies comparable to the $d$-wave state in a square $t$-$J$ model, particularly at high doping levels ($\delta\gtrsim 15\%$) by using the state-of-the-art tensor network simulation. This surprising result suggests that $s$-wave pairing may play an important role in the cuprate phase diagram, especially for the overdoped region. Our findings provide a potential resolution to discrepancies in recent Josephson tunneling experiments on twisted bilayer cuprates and offer new insights into the evolution of pairing symmetry with doping.</description>

      <title>Optical control of the crystal structure in the bilayer nickelate superconductor La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ via nonlinear phononics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ occurs when the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle becomes straight under pressure, suggesting a strong relationship between the crystal structure and the emergence of superconductivity. In this study, we theoretically propose a way to control the crystal structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ toward the tetragonal symmetry via light irradiation instead of pressure using the idea of nonlinear phononics. Here, resonant optical excitation of an infrared-active (IR) lattice vibration induces a nonlinear Raman-mode displacement through the anharmonic phonon-phonon coupling. We calculate the light-induced phonon dynamics on the anharmonic lattice potential determined by first-principles calculation. We find that the interlayer Ni-O-Ni bond angle gets slightly closer to straight when an appropriate IR mode is selectively excited. Our study suggests that light irradiation can be a promising way for structural control of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Identifying Majorana edge and end modes in a Josephson junction of a $p$-wave superconductor with a magnetic barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical model describing a Josephson junction featuring a magnetically textured barrier within two-dimensional (2D) $p$-wave superconductor, considering both $p_x + p_y$ and $p_x + ip_y$ type pairing symmetries. Our study reveals the influence of the magnetic barrier strength and its spatial periodicity on the system's topological properties, in terms of local density of states and Josephson current calculations. Notably, we demonstrate that these parameters regulate the number of Majorana zero modes at the junction in the topological regime. Our setup further allows for the identification of three distinct topological phases, the differentiation between one-dimensional (1D) Majorana edge (either flat/dispersive and arising from intrinsic 2D $p$-wave pairing) and localized Majorana end modes, and an analysis of their hybridization through the Josephson current. In particular, the Josephson current exhibits a discontinuous jump due to the edge modes and pronounced hump in the $p_x + ip_y$ pairing case, directly linked to the hybridized Majorana modes. Moreover, our study opens a possible interesting avenue to distinguish between 1D Majorana edge modes and zero-dimensional end modes via Josephson current signatures.</description>

      <title>Developing a Complete AI-Accelerated Workflow for Superconductor Discovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quest to identify new superconducting materials with enhanced properties is hindered by the prohibitive cost of computing electron-phonon spectral functions, severely limiting the materials space that can be explored. Here, we introduce a Bootstrapped Ensemble of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (BEE-NET), a machine-learning model trained to predict the Eliashberg spectral function and superconducting critical temperature with a mean-absolute-error of 0.87 K relative to DFT-based Allen-Dynes calculations. Intriguingly, BEE-NET achieves a true-negative-rate of 99.4\%, enabling highly efficient screening for the rare property of superconductivity. Integrated into a multi-stage, AI-accelerated discovery pipeline that incorporates elemental-substitution strategies and machine-learned interatomic potentials, our workflow reduced over 1.3 million candidate structures to 741 dynamically and thermodynamically stable compounds with DFT-confirmed $T_{\mathrm{c}} &gt; 5$ K. We report the successful synthesis and experimental confirmation of superconductivity in two of these previously unreported compounds. This study establishes a data-driven framework that integrates machine learning, quantum calculations, and experiments to systematically accelerate superconductor discovery.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous phase stiffness in two-dimensional $s$-wave disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of white-noise disorder on the local phase stiffness and thermodynamic properties of a two-dimensional $s$-wave superconductor. Starting from a local attractive model and using path-integral formalism, we derive an effective action by decoupling the superconducting order parameter into amplitude and phase components in a gauge-invariant manner. Perturbative techniques are applied to the phase fluctuation sector to derive an effective phase-only XY model for disordered superconducting systems. Solving the saddle-point Green's function using Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory, we calculate the distributions of nearest-neighbor couplings for various disorder strengths. A single-peak distribution is observed for low disorder strength, which becomes bimodal with one peak at negative couplings as the disorder strength increases. The local phase stiffness remains randomly distributed throughout the lattice and shows no correlation with pairing amplitudes. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness ($J_s$) is studied using Monte Carlo simulations. At strong disorder and low temperatures, $J_s$ increases with increasing temperature, exhibiting anomalous behavior that may indicate the onset of a glassy transition. Additionally, calculations of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter in this disorder regime suggest the emergence of a $phase$-$glass$ state at very low temperatures.</description>

      <title>An rf-SQUID-based traveling-wave parametric amplifier with -84 dBm input saturation power across more than one octave bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) have become an essential tool for the readout of quantum circuits and the search for dark matter. We report on the implementation of an rf-SQUID-based Josephson TWPA with an average saturation power of -84 dBm, while providing an average power gain of 20 dB from 3.5 to 8.5 GHz. This wide bandwidth is enabled by reducing the curvature of the dispersion in the signal band while suppressing detrimental mixing processes. With 2393 rf-SQUIDs our device has a comparable number of nonlinear elements, but achieves ten times higher saturation power than previous works, showing that using rf-SQUIDs results in a more favorable trade-off between device length and saturation power. Harnessing wideband characterization techniques we determine the TWPA's excess noise above the quantum limit to be 0.8 to 1.5 photons. In addition, we validate signal-to-noise ratio improvement as a practical measure for tuning the TWPA to minimize the total system noise, and demonstrate that its optimum does not coincide with the highest gain.</description>

Abstract: We study the interplay between quantum geometry, interactions, and external fields in complex band systems. When Wannier obstructions preclude a description based solely on atomic-like orbitals, this complicates the prediction of electromagnetic responses particularly in the presence of disorder and interactions. In this work, we introduce a generalized Peierls substitution framework based on Lagrange multipliers to enforce the constraints of the Wannier obstruction in the band of interest. Thus we obtain effective descriptions of interactions and disorder in the presence of non-trivial quantum geometry of that band. We apply our approach to examples including the diamagnetic response in flat-band superconductors and delocalization effects in flat-band metals caused by interactions and disorder.</description>
