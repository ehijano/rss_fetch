      <title>An Analytic Computation of Three-Loop Five-Point Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the three-loop five-point pentagon-box-box massless integral family in the dimensional regularization scheme, via canonical differential equation. We use tools from computational algebraic geometry to enable the necessary integral reductions. The boundary values of the differential equation are determined analytically in the Euclidean region. To express the final result, we introduce a new representation of weight six functions in terms of one-fold integrals over the product of weight-three functions with weight-two kernels that are derived from the differential equation. Our work paves the way to the analytic computation of three-loop multi-leg Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>Generating the Dark Matter mass from the QCD vacuum: A new approach to the Dark Matter-Baryon coincidence problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The comparable abundances of dark matter and baryons imply a deep connection between the dark sector and the QCD sector. In models of asymmetric dark matter, the number densities of both sectors are ensured to be similar. However, a complete solution should also include a mechanism for comparable masses. In this letter, we present a solution in which the dark matter mass is generated through the QCD vacuum, ensuring the mass is at the GeV scale. The model features $\mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV dark baryons as dark matter, together with dark pions (axion-like particles) and dark photons.</description>

      <title>A string loop origin for dark radiation and superheavy dark matter in type IIB compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study the significance of string loop corrections, in a perturbative moduli stabilization scenario, on unraveling the origin of dark radiation in the late cosmological times and its correlation to dark matter. More specifically, a scrutinized analysis is provided where the mass hierarchy of the normalized fields in the K{\"a}hler moduli sector is determined by the integer fluxes and the scale of the quantum correction's parameter $\eta$. Furthermore, the previously underestimated contributions to the decay rates of moduli to axions, which behave as dark radiation, are computed highlighting their connection to the aforementioned higher order corrections. Two contrasting reheating scenarios (low scale and high scale) are provided, depending on the decay rate of the longest lived particle to Standard model degrees of freedom through a Giudice-Masiero mechanism, while the effective number of neutrino species $\Delta N_{eff}$ lays below the respected bounds. Finally, a non-thermal dark matter scenario is proposed based on the decays of the heavy scalar fields, where the main production mechanisms are investigated, leading to dark matter candidate's mass laying from a few $GeV$ up to $10^{11}\; GeV$.</description>

      <title>Relaxing Constraints on Dark Matter Annihilation Near the Supermassive Black Hole in M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supermassive black hole at the center of the M87 galaxy could redistribute dark matter particles within its sphere of influence, creating a high-density region known as a density spike. This spike can significantly enhance dark matter annihilation signals, making M87 a critical target for deriving stringent constraints on annihilation cross sections. In this work, we demonstrate that these constraints are highly sensitive to the choice of the halo density profile for M87. Motivated by recent kinematic studies of M87, we adopt a cored halo model and find that the constraints on dark matter annihilation are significantly relaxed. Specifically, in the cored halo scenario, the smooth part of the halo overwhelmingly dominates the annihilation signals, whereas the commonly-assumed cuspy halo model attributes a major contribution to the spike. We demonstrate this effect using a dark matter model with a light mediator.</description>

      <title>New renormalization scheme in extended Higgs sectors for Higgs precision measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a new renormalization scheme for mixing angles in extended Higgs sectors for the coming era of the Higgs precise measurements at future lepton colliders. We focus on the two Higgs doublet models (2HDMs) with a softly-broken $Z_2$ symmetry as a simple and important example, in which two mixing angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$ appear in the Higgs sector. In this new scheme, the counterterms for two mixing angles $\delta\alpha$ and $\delta\beta$ are determined by requiring that deviations in the decay rates of $h\to ZZ^* \to Z\ell^+\ell^-$ and $h \to \tau\tau$ from the corresponding predictions in the standard model at NLO are given by the square of the scaling factor at tree level. We show how this scheme works in the 2HDMs, and demonstrate how the other decay rates (e.g., $h \to WW^*$, $h \to b\bar{b}$, etc.) are predicted at NLO.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing of chirality imbalance in SU(2) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18869v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a variational quantum algorithm to investigate the chiral condensate in a 1+1 dimensional SU(2) non-Abelian gauge theory. The algorithm is evaluated using a proposed Monte Carlo sampling method, which allows the extension to large qubit systems. The obtained results through quantum simulations on classical and actual quantum hardware are in good agreement with exact diagonalization of the lattice Hamiltonian, revealing the phenomena of chiral symmetry breaking and restoration as functions of both temperature and chemical potential. Our findings underscore the potential of near-term quantum computing for exploring QCD systems at finite temperature and density in non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Heavy quarkonium dissociation in the presence of magnetic field and anisotropy using dissociation energy criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we have studied the dissociation temperature of 1S and 2S states of heavy quarkonium in the presence of anisotropy and a strong magnetic field background using the dissociation energy criterion. We utilized the medium-modified form of the Cornell potential, which depends on temperature as well as the anisotropic parameter {\xi} and the magnetic field. The binding energy (B.E.) and dissociation energy (D.E.) of heavy quarkonium have been examined for different values of the magnetic field and anisotropy. It is noted that B.E. starts decreasing from higher values as we increase the anisotropy, while D.E. exhibits the opposite behavior. The dissociation temperature appears to increase with anisotropy, while it decreases with the magnetic field, as shown in Table 1 and 2 respectively. These results align well with recent research findings.</description>

      <title>Simulating toponium formation signals at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to simulate toponium formation events at the LHC using the Green's function of non-relativistic QCD in the Coulomb gauge, which governs the momentum distribution of top quarks in the presence of the QCD potential. This Green's function can be employed to re-weight any matrix elements relevant for $t\bar{t}$ production and decay processes where a colour-singlet top-antitop pair is produced in the $S$-wave at threshold. As an example, we study the formation of $\eta_t$ toponium states in the gluon fusion channel at the LHC, combining the re-weighted matrix elements with parton showering.</description>

      <title>Testable Flavored TeV-scale Resonant Leptogenesis with MeV-GeV Dark Matter in a Neutrinophilic 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore flavored resonant leptogenesis embedded in a neutrinophilic 2HDM. Successful leptogenesis is achieved by the very mildly degenerate two heavier right-handed neutrinos~(RHNs) $N_2$ and $N_3$ with a level of only $\Delta M_{32}/M_2 \sim \mathcal{O}(0.1\%-1\%)$. The lightest RHN, with a MeV-GeV mass, lies below the sphaleron freeze-out temperature and is stable, serving as a dark matter candidate. The model enables TeV-scale leptogenesis while avoiding the extreme mass degeneracy typically plagued conventional resonant leptogenesis. Baryon asymmetry, neutrino masses, and potentially dark matter relic density can be addressed within a unified, experimentally testable framework.</description>

      <title>Sterile-active resonance: A global qualitative picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the $\nu$SM extended by adding an eV-scale sterile state, the $(3+1)$ model, the sterile-active level crossing entails the MSW resonance, here referred as the sterile-active (SA) resonance. In this paper, we construct an effective theory of SA resonance which involves only the sterile-active mixing angles and $\Delta m^2_{41}$, thanks to the given environment of high matter potential which freezes the $\nu$SM oscillations. We give our first attempt at an analytic treatment of the effective theory to illuminate the global picture of the SA resonance at a glance. We formulate a perturbative framework in which the structure of ``texture zeros'' of the $S$ matrix in the flavor space and the suppression by the small parameters $\sin \theta_{j 4}$ ($j=1,2,3$) allows us to reveal the flavor$-$event-type hierarchy of the resonance-effect strength in the probabilities. We have shown that the cascade events dominantly comes from the three paths through $P(\nu_{e} \rightarrow \nu_{e})$, $P(\bar{\nu}_{e} \rightarrow \bar{\nu}_{e})$, and $P(\bar{\nu}_{\mu} \rightarrow \bar{\nu}_{\tau})$, and a three-component fit is suggested to disentangle the SA resonance generation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Analysis of $b \to c \ell \nu $ baryonic decay modes in SMEFT approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The flavor-changing neutral current decays of heavy bottom quark, alongside the flavor-changing charged current processes mediated by $b \to (c, u)$ in semileptonic $B$ decays are emerged as powerful tools for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we focus on the feasibility of interpreting the processes mediated by $b \to c \tau \nu$ transitions, in particular, the semileptonic $b$-baryonic decay modes $\Sigma_b \to \Sigma_c^{(*)} \tau^-\bar{\nu}_\tau$ and $\Xi_b \to \Xi_c \tau^-\bar{\nu}_\tau$ in the context of SMEFT approach. We perform a detailed analysis of the sensitivity of new physics operators on various observables such as branching ratio, forward-backward asymmetry parameter, lepton non-universal observable and the longitudinal polarization fraction of the $b$-baryonic decay channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an extension of the Standard Model with one or more scalar multiplets beyond the Higgs doublet $\Phi$. The additional scalar multiplets are supposed to carry arbitrary hypercharges. We prove that, in such a model, if the field configuration where only $\Phi$ has a nonzero vacuum expectation value (VEV) is a local minimum of the potential, then it has a lower value of the potential than any field configuration where both $\Phi$ and other scalar multiplets have nonzero VEVs. We also consider the field configurations where only one multiplet $\Xi$ (different from $\Phi$) with isospin $J \le 7/2$ has nonzero VEV; we compute the values of the potential at those possible vacua.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study neutrino oscillations in background matter within the quantum field theory formalism where neutrino mass eigenstates are virtual particles. In this case, neutrino mass eigenstates are mixed owing to the interaction with matter. Assuming that neutrinos are Majorana particles, we find the exact propagators for massive neutrinos accounting for the interaction with matter by solving the analog of the Dyson equation. These propagators are used to calculate the transition probability which coincides with the prediction of the Mikheyev--Smirnov--Wolfenstein effect. Finally, we analyze the approximations made in our analysis.</description>

Abstract: We study the decay of a heavy CP-even neutral Higgs into an on-shell Standard Model-like Higgs boson and two photons, $H\to h\gamma\gamma$, in the two-Higgs doublet model. We argue that the decay channel $H\to h\gamma\gamma$, followed by the decay of the Standard Model Higgs $h\rightarrow b\bar b$, could be observed at the 5$\sigma$ level at the High-Luminosity LHC for masses of the heavy Higgs up to 900 GeV for the type-II, 500 GeV for the Lepton Specific and the Flipped 2HDMs, and at 3 sigmas for the type-I, for masses up to 600 GeV. We also discuss the possible role of the decay $H\to h\gamma\gamma$ in discriminating among 2HDMs.</description>

      <title>Looking into the quantum entanglement in $H\to ZZ^\star$ at LHC within SMEFT framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $H\to ZZ^\star$ production process in final four lepton states at $13$ TeV LHC within SMEFT framework. The anomalous $HZZ$ couplings are parameterized with dimension-6 $SU(2)_L\times U(1)_Y$ gauge invariant operators. We compute the eight polarizations of each $Z$ boson and $64$ spin-correlations as asymmetries in angular functions of final decayed leptons in the rest frame of the $Z$ boson. We perform the sensitivity analysis of these asymmetries to anomalous couplings and one parameter limits on these couplings at $95\%$ confidence level are obtained. These asymmetries are further used to construct the joint density matrix (DM) for $ZZ^\star$ system. However, such DM suffers from negative probability and eigenvalues. To alleviate the negativity issues, we reconstruct the DM using asymmetries of symmetrized angular functions owing to the indistinguishability of two $Z$ bosons. The symmetrized DM is further employed to compute lower bound for concurrence as a witness of entanglement measurable at the collider experiments. The $ZZ^\star$ system is found to be in an entangled state for all values of the anomalous couplings. Notably, while the lower bound exhibits poorer sensitivity to anomalous couplings compared to asymmetries, it demonstrates distinct behavior for CP-even and odd couplings.</description>

      <title>Ensuring that toponium is glued, not nailed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hints of toponium might be incipient in LHC data, as given the vast numbers of $t$ quarks produced, some survive on the exponential-decay tail long enough to fasten $t\bar{t}$ together. I here discuss a few differences between the standard Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) binding (the ``glue'') and exotic short-range binding (the ``nail''). If the energy below threshold reaches the 3-4 GeV range (the range of a leading order calculation with $\alpha_s$ at the ultrasoft scale) the peak of the $\eta_t$ is distinct enough that a cross-section dip should be apparent in the line shape, should there only be one isolated resonance, but is filled by the excited QCD states adding over a pbarn to the cross section of $t\bar{t}$ production. Their effect for smaller binding energies is a tenuous increase in the cross section. A new-physics short-range interaction, on the other hand, yields a larger cross-section for equal binding energy (or hardly a visible bound state for similar cross section). This is due to its larger $t\bar{t}$ relative wavefunction at small distances. Finally, assuming that standard QCD plays out, I comment on what size of constraints on new-physics coefficients one can expect at given precision.</description>

      <title>Dark axion portal at $Z$ boson factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark axion portal connects an axion-like-particle (ALP), which can be the QCD axion, with the SM by the coupling to a photon and a dark photon, leading to a rich and distinct phenomenology related to dark matter, astrophysics, and cosmology. We note that due to the gauge invariance, the $Z$ boson-dark photon-ALP coupling should also be generated with sizable strength, and we study its phenomenological consequences at $Z$ boson factories: LEP, FCC-ee, and forward physics detectors at the LHC and FPF@FCC - FASER and MATHUSLA. Due to the large number of $Z$ bosons produced, DAP particles can be efficiently produced and detected by semi-visible displaced decays of the heavier DS species to $\gamma$+inv. or $f^+ f^-$+inv., and via missing energy signature with zero or one photon. Because of the complementarity of the two approaches, we find great prospects in exploring both short and long-lived lifetime regimes of DAP, especially when the heavier dark species has mass above $0.1\,$GeV.</description>

      <title>Light quark fragmentation into S-wave fully charmed tetraquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the fragmentation function of a light quark into S-wave fully-charmed tetraquarks ($T_{4c}$) within the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) framework, at leading order in $\alpha_{s}$ and $v$. We present results for light quark fragmentation into $T_{4c}$ and predict its contribution to $T_{4c}$ production at high transverse momentum ($p_{T}$) at the LHC and EIC. We also compare light quark fragmentation with charm quark and gluon fragmentation channels. Our analysis shows that the production cross section for $T_{4c}$ from light quark fragmentation is smaller than that from gluon fragmentation but larger than that from charm quark fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lindblad master equation for neutrino evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new theoretical framework, based on the quantum field theory of open systems applied to neutrinos, has been developed. This framework aims to describe the neutrino evolution in external environment, taking into account the effect of neutrino quantum decoherence. We have applied this approach to investigate a novel mechanism for neutrino quantum decoherence, which arises due to the neutrino decay into a lighter neutrino state and a massless particle, as well as the inverse process of absorption of a massless particle by a neutrino. We derived the new generalized Lindblad master equation for the neutrino evolution that accounts for neutrino transitions between states with different momenta. We also demonstrate that studying of neutrino quantum decoherence through this master equation provides a unique possibility to determine or limit the neutrino decay width. On this basis we obtained the constraint on neutrino lifetime $\frac{\tau_2}{m_2} &gt; 1.83 \times 10^{-10} \frac{s}{eV}$ (for the case of the Dirac neutrino scalar decay and neutrino degenerate hierarchy).</description>

      <title>Axion-induced pair production: a new strategy for axion detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit and update the axion-induced pair production process in a nuclear electric field mediated by the axion-electron coupling, $a+{{}^{A}_{Z}X} \rightarrow {{}^{A}_{Z}X} + e^{+} + e^{-}$. This process emerges as one of the most efficient channels for detecting axions with energies above a few MeV in large underground detectors. It is particularly relevant for detecting axions produced in nuclear reactions, such as the $p+d~\rightarrow~{ }^3 \mathrm{He}~+~a(5.5\,\mathrm{MeV})$ reaction in the solar pp-chain, and for axions originating in supernovae. Despite recent interest in detecting high-energy axions, the pair production process has received limited attention, even in scenarios where it is the dominant detection channel. This study fills this gap by demonstrating that pair production is a highly effective detection mechanism for high-energy axions. We apply our results to axions from supernovae and the solar 5.5 MeV line, recasting the current bounds of Borexino and comparing the detection capabilities of the JUNO and Hyper-Kamiokande detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the phenomenological ${^{3}\!}P_{0}$ model for the decay of quarkonium $\left( Q\bar{Q}\right) $ into two open flavor mesons ($\bar{\mathfrak{M}}\mathfrak{M}% $). We take the heavy-quark limit and derive a transition rate between $Q\bar{Q}$ and $\bar{\mathfrak{M}}\mathfrak{M}$ to be compared with the one calculated in studies of string breaking using lattice QCD. This comparison allows to fit the creation amplitude of a light quark-antiquark pair in the ${^{3}\!}P_{0}$ model to the string-breaking transition rate in QCD.</description>

      <title>Model-Agnostic Tagging of Quenched Jets in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of jet substructure in ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions indicate that interactions with the quark-gluon plasma quench the jet showering process. Modern data-driven methods have shown promise in probing these modifications in the jet's hard substructure. In this Letter, we present a machine learning framework to identify quenched jets while accounting for pileup, uncorrelated soft particle background, and detector effects; a more experimentally realistic and challenging scenario than previously addressed. Our approach leverages an interpretable sequential attention-based mechanism that integrates representations of individual jet constituents alongside global jet observables as features. The framework sets a new benchmark for tagging quenched jets with reduced model dependence.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization for massive fermion in a shear flow: complete results at $O(\partial)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the key role of shear induced polarization in understanding the local spin polarization puzzle of $\Lambda$ hyperons in heavy ion collisions, we perform a complete analysis of spin polarization of massive fermion in a quantum electrodynamic plasma with shear flow. Apart from the well-known spin-shear coupling in free theory, we include two more collision dependent contributions: one is a non-dynamical contribution fixed by shifted spin-averaged distribution in steady state; the other is a dynamical contribution following from spin evolution. Despite of the dependencies on collision, we find the dependencies on coupling drop out in the final results. These contributions can lead to significant enhancement of the spin-shear coupling in phenomenologically interesting regime.</description>

      <title>Heavy-light mesons from a flavour-dependent interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new symmetry-preserving framework for the physics of heavy-light mesons, whose key element is the effective incorporation of flavour-dependent contributions into the corresponding bound-state and quark gap equations. These terms originate from the fully-dressed quark-gluon vertices appearing in the kernels of these equations, and provide a natural distinction between ``light" and ``heavy" quarks. In this approach, only the classical form factor of the quark-gluon vertex is retained, and is evaluated in the so-called ``symmetric" configuration. The standard Slavnov-Taylor identity links this form factor to the quark wave-function, allowing for the continuous transition from light to heavy quarks through the mere variation of the current quark mass in the gap equation. The method is used to compute the masses and decay constants of specific pseudoscalars and vector heavy-light systems, showing good overall agreement with both experimental data and lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics in heavy and light-ion collisions -- I) Kinetic Theory vs. Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions exhibit collective flow, which emerges as a dynamical response of the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) to the initial state geometry of the collision. Collective flow in heavy-ion collisions is usually described within multi-stage evolution models, which employ a viscous relativistic hydrodynamic description of the space-time evolution of the QGP. By comparing event-by-event simulations in kinetic theory and viscous hydrodynamics in OO, AuAu and PbPb collisions at RHIC and LHC energies, we quantify to what extent a macroscopic hydrodynamic description can accurately describe the development of collective flow and to what extent collective flow in small systems, such as OO, is sensitive to the non-equilibrium evolution of the QGP beyond hydrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting the first measurements of the same ion species in OO collisons at RHIC and LHC, we propose an observable to distinguish whether collective behavior builds up through a hydrodynamic expansion of a strongly interacting QGP or few final state re-scatterings. Our procedure allows to disentangle the effects of the initial state geometry and the dynamical response mechanism on anisotropic flow. We validate its ability to discriminate between systems with different interaction rates using results from event-by-event simulations in kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Searching for MeV-mass neutrinophilic Dark Matter with Large Scale Dark Matter Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The indirect detection of dark matter (DM) through its annihilation products is one of the primary strategies for DM detection. One of the least constrained classes of models is neutrinophilic DM, because the annihilation products, weakly interacting neutrinos, are challenging to observe. Here, we consider a scenario where MeV-mass DM exclusively annihilates to the third neutrino mass eigenstate, which is predominantly of tau and muon flavor. In such a scenario, the potential detection rate of the neutrinos originating from the DM annihilation in our galaxy in the conventional detectors would be suppressed by up to approximately two orders of magnitude. This is because the best sensitivity of such detectors for neutrinos with energies below approximately 100~MeV is for electron neutrino flavor. In this work, we highlight the potential of large-scale DM detectors in uncovering such signals in the tens of MeV range of DM masses. In addition, we discuss how coincident signals in direct detection DM experiments and upcoming neutrino detectors such as DUNE, Hyper-Kamiokande, and JUNO could provide new perspectives on the DM problem.</description>

      <title>Universality of the baryon axial vector current operator in large-$N_c$ chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The baryon axial vector current is computed in a combined formalism in $1/N_c$ and chiral corrections. Flavor $SU(3)$ symmetry breaking is accounted for in two ways: Implicitly through the integrals occurring in the one-loop graphs and explicitly through perturbative symmetry breaking. Loop integrals can be expanded in a power series in the ratio of the decuplet-octet baryon mass difference to the pseudoscalar meson mass and the first three terms in the series are retained and evaluated. The universal baryon axial vector current so constructed is neither diagonal nor off-diagonal in the sense that it can connect baryon states of either different or equal spins to obtain appropriate axial vector couplings. Processes of interest are found in octet-baryon and decuplet-baryon semileptonic decays and strong decays of decuplet baryons. A fit to the available experimental information is performed to determine the free parameters in the formalism, which allows one to estimate, for instance, the leading axial vector coupling in the semileptonic decay $\Omega^- \to{\Xi^*}^0\ell^-\overline{\nu}_\ell$.</description>

      <title>New physics effects on $B\to D^{(*)}\tau\nu$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate new physics effects on $B\to D^{(*)}\tau\nu$ decays in a general and model-independent way. The $\chi^2$ fits for fractions of the branching ratios $R(D^{(*)})$ and other polarization parameters are implemented. We parameterize the relevant Wilson coefficients with a new physics scale and its power together with combined fermionic couplings. Constraints from $B_c\to\tau\nu$ are imposed such that its branching ratio is less than 30%. For a moderate range of our parameters we find that the new physics scale goes up to $\lesssim 27$ TeV for ordinary new particle contributions. It turns out that the polarization asymmetry of $\tau$ for $B\to D$ transition can be negative only for a few combinations of the new physics operators. We also discuss related processes $B_c\to J/\Psi\tau\nu$ and $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_c\tau\nu$ decays.</description>

      <title>RI-(S)MOM to $\overline{\rm MS}$ conversion for $B_K$ at two-loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kaon bag parameter $ {\hat{B}}_K $ plays a critical role in constraining the parameters of the CKM matrix and in probing physics beyond the Standard Model. In this work, we improve the precision of $ \hat{B}_K $ to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) and provide world averages for both $3$- and $4$-flavour theories. In the course of this, as our main technical development, we carry out the two-loop matching between the RI-(S)MOM and $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ schemes. Our world averages combine all available lattice data, including conversion between the 3- and 4-flavour theories as appropriate. We obtain the result $\hat B_{K}^{(f=3)} = 0.7627(60)$, which comprises the complete set of $3$- and $4$-flavour lattice results and can be used directly in phenomenological applications. The error is dominated by lattice uncertainties and missing higher-order corrections (residual scale dependence). Our averages include a PDG rescaling factor of 1.28 reflecting a mild tension among the lattice inputs after inclusion of NNLO corrections in the scheme conversion and matching across flavour thresholds. Our averages imply an updated value $|\epsilon_K|=2.171(65)_\text{pert.}(71)_\text{non-pert.}(153)_\text{param.} \times 10^{-3}$. We briefly discuss applications of our results to $D$-meson mixing.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek scaling of the superfluid-supersolid transition in an elongated dipolar gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate interaction quenches crossing from a superfluid to a supersolid state in a dipolar quantum gas of ${}^{164}\mathrm{Dy}$ atoms, trapped in an elongated tube with periodic boundary conditions, via the extended Gross-Pitaevskii equation. A freeze-out time is observed through a delay in supersolid formation, in comparison to the adiabatic case. We compute the density-density correlations at the freeze-out time and extract the frozen correlation length for the solid order. An analysis of the freeze-out time and correlation length versus the interaction quench rate allows us to extract universal exponents corresponding to the relaxation time and correlation length based on predictions of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Over several orders of magnitude, clear power-law scaling is observed for both, the freeze-out time and the correlation length, and the corresponding exponents are compatible with predictions based on the excitation spectrum calculated via Bogoliubov theory. Defects due to independent local breaking of translational symmetry, contributing to globally incommensurate supersolid order, are identified, and their number at the freeze-out time is found to also scale as a power law. Our results support the hypothesis of a continuous transition whose universality class remains to be determined but appears to differ from that of the (1+1)D XY model.</description>

      <title>Seeking the nearest neutron stars using a new local electron density map</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars provide a compelling testing ground for gravity, nuclear dynamics, and physics beyond the Standard Model, and so it will be useful to locate the neutron stars nearest to Earth. To that end, we revisit pulsar distance estimates extracted from the dispersion measure of pulsar radio waves scattering on electrons. In particular, we create a new electron density map for the local kiloparsec by fitting to parallax measurements of the nearest pulsars, which complements existing maps that are fit on the Galactic scale. This ``near-Earth'' electron density map implies that pulsars previously estimated to be 100-200 pc away may be as close as tens of parsecs away, which motivates a parallax-based measurement campaign to follow-up on these very-near candidate pulsars. Such nearby neutron stars would be valuable laboratories for testing fundamental physics phenomena, including several late-stage neutron star heating mechanisms, using current and forthcoming telescopes. We illustrate this by estimating the sensitivities of the upcoming Extremely Large Telescope and Thirty Meter Telescope to neutron stars heated by dark matter capture.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the dark matter-baryon interaction cross section from galaxy cluster thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) models with a non-zero DM-baryon interaction cross section imply energy transfer between DM and baryons. We present a new method of constraining the DM-baryon interaction cross section and DM particle mass for velocity-independent interactions using the thermodynamics of galaxy clusters. If the baryonic gas in these clusters is in thermodynamic equilibrium and DM cools baryons, this cooling rate is limited by the net heating rate of other mechanisms in the cluster. We use the REFLEX clusters from the Meta-Catalogue of X-ray detected Clusters of Galaxies (MCXC) with mass estimates from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) catalog of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) selected galaxy clusters. This yields 95% upper bounds on the DM-proton interaction cross section for velocity-independent interactions of $\sigma_0\leq9.3\times10^{-28} \mathrm{~cm^2}$ for DM masses, $m_\chi = 10^{-4} - 10^{-1}$ GeV. These constraints are within an order of magnitude of the best constraints derived in this mass range, and serve as a complementary, independent constraint. We also apply this model to the fractional interacting DM scenario, where only 10% and 1% of the DM is interacting. Unlike other methods, this constraint scales linearly with this fraction. This yields 95% upper bounds of $\sigma_0\leq1.1\times10^{-26} \mathrm{~cm^2}$ and $\sigma_0\leq8.2\times10^{-26} \mathrm{~cm^2}$, which are the strongest existing constraints for this scenario. This paper serves as a proof of concept. Upcoming SZ measurements will provide temperature profiles for galaxy clusters. Combining these measurements with more complex thermodynamic models could lead to more robust constraints.</description>

      <title>New Limits on Coherent Neutrino Nucleus Elastic Scattering Cross Section at the Kuo-Sheng Reactor Neutrino Laboratory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutrino nucleus elastic scattering ({\nu}Ael) with reactor neutrinos is an interaction under full quantum-mechanical coherence. It has not yet been experimentally observed. We present new results on the studies of {\nu}Ael cross section with an electro-cooled p-type point-contact germanium detector at the Kuo-Sheng Reactor Neutrino laboratory. A total of (242)357 kg-days of Reactor ON(OFF) data at a detector threshold of 200 eVee in electron equivalent unit are analyzed. The Lindhard model parametrized by a single variable k which characterizes the quenching function was used. Limits at 90% confidence level are derived on the ratio {\rho} relative to standard model (SM) cross section of {\rho}&lt;4.7 at the predicted value of k=0.162, while k&lt;0.285 at the SM-value of {\rho}=1. Prospects on future positive measurements are discussed.</description>

      <title>New constraints on the primordial curvature perturbations on small scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ has been measured with high precision on large scales $10^{-4}\lesssim k\lesssim 3~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, basing on the observations of cosmic microwave background, Lyman-$\alpha$ forest and large scale structure. On small scales $3\lesssim k \lesssim 10^{23}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, the constrains are mainly from the studies on the primordial black holes (PBHs). Specifically, on small scales $10^{17}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{23}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$, the limits arise from studies on the lightest supersymmetric particles produced by PBHs radiation and the stable Planck-mass relics after its evaporation. It has been demonstrated that the big bang nucleosynthesis can be used to constrain the initial fraction of PBHs with masses $10^{9}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{13}~{\rm g}$, corresponding to the scales $10^{16}\lesssim k\lesssim 10^{18}~{\rm Mpc^{-1}}$. Recently, on one hand, it is found that the evaporation of light PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{9}\rm g$) can modify the expansion rate of the Universe and the baryon-to-photon ratio, resulting in the influences on the primordial abundance of light nuclei. On the other hand, it has been proposed that the `memory burden' effect can slow down the mass loss rate of black hole (BH), leading to the existence of light PBHs by now. Based on the recent theoretical research process of BH and the limits on the (initial) mass fraction of light PBHs with masses $10^{4}\lesssim M_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{10}~\rm g$, we derive new constraints on $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}$ on small scales $1.5\times 10^{18}\lesssim k\lesssim 2.5\times 10^{21}~\rm Mpc^{-1}$, which are rarely studied in previous literature.</description>

      <title>Enhanced nuclear Schiff and electric dipole moments in nuclei with an octupole deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformed nuclei exhibit enhanced moments that violate time-reversal invariance ($T$) and parity ($P$). This paper focuses on the enhanced nuclear electric dipole moment (EDM) and Schiff moment present in nuclei with octupole deformation (pear-shaped nuclei). These moments, which are proportional to the octupole deformation, have a collective nature and are large in the intrinsic frame that rotates with the nucleus. However, in a state with definite angular momentum and parity, $T$ and $P$ conservation forbid their expectation values in the laboratory frame, as nuclear rotation causes them to vanish. In nuclei with octupole deformation, close opposite-parity rotational states with identical spin are mixed by $T$,$P$-violating nuclear forces. This mixing polarises the nuclear axis along the nuclear spin, allowing moments from the intrinsic frame to manifest in the laboratory frame, provided the nuclear spin $I$ is sufficiently large. This mechanism may be extended to nuclei with a soft octupole vibration mode. Using half-life data for $E1$ transitions from the NuDat database, we calculate the intrinsic nuclear EDM $d_{\text{int}}$ for a range of nuclei theorised to exhibit octupole deformation or soft octupole vibration. From these values, we independently estimate the intrinsic nuclear Schiff moment $S_{\text{int}}$ and the octupole deformation parameter $\beta_{3}$. Finally, we compare the magnitude of these collective moments in the laboratory frame with the contributions from valence nucleons, providing an estimate of the nuclear EDM and Schiff moment components unrelated to octupole deformation.</description>

      <title>The spectra of a radiative reprocessing outflow model for fast blue optical transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radiation reprocessing model, in which an optically-thick outflow absorbs the high-energy emission from a central source and re-emits in longer wavelengths, has been frequently invoked to explain some optically bright transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) whose progenitor and explosion mechanism are still unknown. Previous studies on this model did not take into account the frequency dependence of the opacity. We study the radiative reprocessing and calculate the UV-optical-NIR band spectra from a spherical outflow composed of pure hydrogen gas, for a time-dependent outflowing mass rate. Electron scattering and frequency-dependent bound-free, free-free opacities are considered. The spectrum deviates from the blackbody at NIR and UV frequencies; in particular, it has $\nu L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{1.5}$ at NIR frequencies, because at these frequencies the absorption optical depth from the outflow's outer edge to the so-called photon trapping radius is large and is frequency dependent. We apply our model to the proto-type FBOT AT2018cow by {the spectra} to the observed SED. The best-fit mass loss rate suggests that the total outflow mass in AT2018cow is $M_{\rm out} \approx 5.7^{+0.4}_{-0.4} \, M_{\odot}$. If that equals the total mass lost during an explosion, and if the progenitor is a blue supergiant (with a pre-explosion mass of $\sim 20 \, M_{\odot}$), then it will suggest that the central compact remnant mass is at least $\approx \, \rm{14 \, M_{\odot}}$. This would imply that the central remnant is a black hole.</description>

      <title>On the photon self-energy to three loops in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the photon self-energy to three loops in Quantum Electrodynamics. The method of differential equations for Feynman integrals and a complete $\epsilon$-factorization of the former allow us to obtain fully analytical results in terms of iterated integrals involving integration kernels related to a K3 geometry. We argue that our basis has the right properties to be a natural generalization of a canonical basis beyond the polylogarithmic case and we show that many of the kernels appearing in the differential equations, cancel out in the final result to finite order in $\epsilon$. We further provide generalized series expansions that cover the whole kinematic space so that our results for the self-energy may be easily evaluated numerically for all values of the momentum squared. From the local solution at $p^2=0$, we extract the photon wave function renormalization constant in the on-shell scheme to three loops and confirm its agreement with previously obtained results.</description>

      <title>An updated determination of light-cone distribution amplitudes of octet baryons in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present updated results on the wave function normalization constants and the first moments of the light cone distribution amplitudes for the lowest-lying baryon octet. The analysis is carried out on a large number of $n_f=2+1$ lattice gauge ensembles, including ensembles at physical pion (and kaon) masses. These are spread across five different lattice spacings, enabling a controlled continuum limit. The main differences with respect to our earlier work are the use of two-loop conversion factors to an $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$-like scheme and of an updated set of low-energy constants in the parametrization of the quark mass dependence. As a byproduct, for the first time, the anomalous dimensions for local three-quark operators with one derivative are obtained.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the feasibility of realizing the Dark Dimension Scenario through T-fold compactifications on $T^5 \times S^1$, where the base of the internal space $S^1$ naturally acts as the requisite mesoscopic extra dimension. Utilizing Scherk--Schwarz reduction from 5D to 4D, and applying duality twists from both elliptic and parabolic conjugacy classes of subgroups of the T-duality group associated with $T^5$, we stabilize the volume of $T^5$ and several other moduli. This approach generates a potential characterized by two runaway directions, one aligned with the Scherk--Schwarz radion. Further stabilization efforts yield a decreasing potential trajectory demanded by the Dark Dimension Scenario.</description>

      <title>Impact of memory-burdened black holes on primordial gravitational waves in light of Pulsar Timing Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blue-tilted Gravitational Waves (BGWs) have been proposed as a potential candidate for the cosmic gravitational waves detected by Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTA). In the standard cosmological framework, BGWs are constrained in their frequency range by the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) limit on GW amplitude, which precludes their detection at interferometer scales. However, introducing a phase of early matter domination dilutes BGWs at higher frequencies, ensuring compatibility with both the BBN and LIGO constraints on stochastic GWs. This mechanism allows BGWs to align with PTA data while producing a distinct and testable GW signal across a broad frequency spectrum. Ultralight Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) could provide the required early matter-dominated phase to support this process. Interpreted through the lens of BGWs, the PTA results offer a way to constrain the parameter space of a new scenario involving modified Hawking radiation, known as the ``memory burden" effect, associated with ultralight PBHs. This interpretation can be further probed by high-frequency GW detectors. Specifically, we demonstrate that PBHs as light as $10^{2-3}~{\rm g}$ can leave detectable imprints on BGWs at higher frequencies while remaining consistent with PTA observations.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Topological Defects from Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates cosmic topological defects in gauge theories, focusing on models with an $SU(N)$ gauge group coupled with a single flavor, explored through a holographic framework. At low energies, the effective theory is described by an axion-like particle resulting from the spontaneous breaking of the axial $U(1)_A$ flavor symmetry. As the Universe cools below a critical temperature, the chiral symmetry is broken, and non-trivial vacuum configurations form, resulting in the creation of cosmic strings and domain walls. We provide a UV description of these defects in a particular holographic theory, the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model, as probe D6-branes. We show the presence of a first-order phase transition separating string loop from domain wall solutions. String loops charged under the baryon symmetry and with angular momentum - vortons - can be understood as excitations of a topological phase of matter given by a Chern-Simons theory living on the D6-brane world volume. Finally, we provide an effective description of string loops and vortons in terms of degrees of freedom living on the flavor brane, i.e. mesonic modes.</description>

      <title>Indirect detection of the QCD axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion, originally proposed to solve the strong CP problem in QCD, is a prominent candidate for dark matter (DM). In the presence of strong magnetic fields, such as those around neutron stars, axions can theoretically convert into photons, producing detectable electromagnetic signals. This axion-photon coupling provides a unique experimental pathway to probe axions within a specific mass range. We investigate a novel observational approach using the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to search for radio transients that could arise from interactions between neutron stars and dense DM clumps known as axion miniclusters. By observing the core of Andromeda with the VErsatile GBT Astronomical Spectrometer (VEGAS) and the X-band receiver (8 to 10 GHz), we achieve sensitivity to axions with masses in the range of (33 - 42)$\,\mu$eV, with a mass resolution of $3.8 \times 10^{-4}\,\mu$eV. We detail our observational and analytical strategies developed to capture transient signals from axion-photon conversion, achieving an instrumental sensitivity of $2\,$mJy per spectral channel. Despite our sensitivity threshold, no candidate signals exceeding the 5$\sigma$ level were identified. Future implementations will extend this search across additional spectral bands and refine the modeling used for the processes involved, strengthening the constraints on axion DM models.</description>

      <title>Centre vortex evidence for a second finite-temperature QCD transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence for the existence of a second finite-temperature transition in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) is obtained through the study of centre vortex geometry and its evolution with temperature. The dynamical anisotropic ensembles of the FASTSUM collaboration are utilised to conduct a comprehensive analysis at eight temperatures beyond the established chiral transition. Visualisations of the centre vortex structure in temporal and spatial slices of the lattice reveal that vortex percolation persists through the chiral transition and ceases at a temperature that is approximately twice the chiral transition temperature $T_c$. This implies that confinement is retained through temperatures up to $T \approx 2\,T_c$, pointing towards a second transition corresponding to deconfinement. The loss of percolation is quantified by the vortex cluster extent, providing a clear signal for the deconfinement transition. Additional vortex statistics, including temporal correlations, vortex and branching point densities, the number of secondary clusters and vortex chain lengths between branching points, are scrutinised as a function of temperature. All ten measures investigated herein show the characteristics of two transitions in QCD, encompassing the chiral transition at $T_c$ and the deconfinement transition at $T \approx 2\,T_c$. Performing an inflection point analysis on the vortex and branching point densities produces an estimate of $T_c$ that agrees with the known FASTSUM value. By the same procedure, a precise estimate of the deconfinement point is extracted as $T_d = 321(6)\,$MeV.</description>

Abstract: We present our recent studies on thermal field theories using quantum algorithms. We first delve into the representation of quantum fields via qubits on general digital quantum computers alongside the quantum algorithms employed to evaluate thermal properties of generic quantum field theories. Then, we show our numerical results of thermal field theories in 1+1 dimensions using quantum simulators. Both fermion and scalar fields will be discussed. These studies aim to understand thermal fixed points for our forthcoming work on studying thermalisation in quantum field theories in real time quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative three-nucleon simulation using chiral lattice EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the three-nucleon system at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order ($\mathrm{N^3LO}$) in the framework of chiral effective field theory (EFT) on the lattice. Our calculations do not rely on a perturbative treatment of subleading contributions to the nuclear forces. For the two-nucleon potential, we apply the previously developed $\mathrm{N^3LO}$ lattice interaction. For the leading contribution to the three-nucleon force, we determine the two low-energy constants (LECs) in the contact interactions by adjusting the ground state energy and half-life of triton, where the latter employs the nuclear axial current at $\mathrm{N^2LO}$ in chiral EFT. Additionally, the ground state energy of helion and the charge radii of the two considered nuclei are computed. No effect of the smearing regularization in the three-nucleon contact interaction is observed here. We compare our results with recent lattice-EFT calculations that are based on a potential tuned to light and medium-mass nuclei using the wave-function-matching technique to circumvent the Monte-Carlo sign problem.</description>

      <title>The classification and formation rate of $\mathbf{Swift/BAT}$ gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are usually classified into long/short categories according to their durations, but controversy still exists in this aspect. Here we re-examine the long/short classification of GRBs and further compare the cosmological distribution and evolution of each potential subclass. A large number of $Swift/BAT$ GRBs are analyzed in this study. The Gaussian mixture model is used to fit the duration distribution as well as the joint distribution of duration and hardness ratio, and the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria are adopted to assess the goodness of fit. It is found that three Gaussian components can better fit both the univariate and bivariate distributions, indicating that there are three subclasses in the $Swift/BAT$ GRBs, namely short, intermediate, and long subclasses. The non-parametric Efron-Petrosian and Lynden-Bell's $c^{-}$ methods are used to derive the luminosity function and formation rate from the truncated data of bursts with known redshift in each subclass. It is found that the luminosity distributions and birth rates of the three subclasses are different, further supporting the existence of the intermediate subclass in the $Swift/BAT$ GRBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, electromagnetic (EM) radiation has been used as a sensitive probe of Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) properties, owing to the smaller EM coupling relative to QCD coupling. To better understand the constraining power of EM emissions on transport properties of the QGP, a deeper understanding of both the theory and phenomenology of EM signals is required. A selection of recent developments in those two areas of QGP EM probes is discussed, with an outlook on how Bayesian model-to-data comparisons can help further quantify our understanding of QGP transport coefficients.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Gauge Friction in Natural Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an extension of the natural inflation model comprising a non-Abelian gauge sector coupled to the axion-inflaton kinetic term. We show how such non-minimal coupling serves as a source of friction for the rolling inflaton granting sixty or more $e$-folds of accelerated expansion for sub-Planckian values of the axion decay constant. The analysis of perturbations reveals a negative sound speed, thus signaling an instability. Implementing a Chern-Simons-type coupling between the inflaton and gauge sectors cures the instability by delivering a positive speed. We perform a numerical study of scalar and tensor perturbations for a fiducial set of parameters finding that the corresponding observables are compatible with current CMB bounds.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational form factors of the deuteron are calculated in the framework of non-relativistic chiral effective field theory. Non-relativistic reduction of the matrix element of the energy-momentum tensor operator for spin-one systems is worked out, and the gravitational form factors of the deuteron are extracted from the three-point function of the energy-momentum tensor using the LSZ reduction formula. The obtained form factors are compared to results of model calculations available in the literature.</description>

      <title>The hot circumgalactic medium in the eROSITA All-Sky Survey III. Star-forming and quiescent galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The circumgalactic medium (CGM), as the gas repository for star formation, might contain the answer to the mysterious galaxy quenching and bimodal galaxy population origin. We measured the X-ray emission of the hot CGM around star-forming and quiescent galaxies. We detect extended X-ray emission from the hot CGM around star-forming galaxies with $\log(M_*/M_\odot)&gt;11.0$ and quiescent galaxies with $\log(M_*/M_\odot)&gt;10.5$, extending out to $R_{\rm 500c}$. $L_{\rm X, CGM}$ of star-forming galaxies with median stellar masses $\log(M_{\rm *,med}/M_\odot) = 10.7, 11.1, 11.3$ are approximately $0.8\,, 2.3\,, 4.0 \times 10^{40}\,\rm erg/s$, while for quiescent galaxies with $\log(M_{\rm *,med}/M_\odot) = 10.8, 11.1, 11.4$, they are $1.1\,, 6.2\,, 30 \times 10^{40}\,\rm erg/s$. Notably, quiescent galaxies with $\log(M_{\rm *,med}/M_\odot) &gt; 11.0$ exhibit brighter hot CGM than their star-forming counterparts. In halo mass bins, we detect similar X-ray emission around star-forming and quiescent galaxies with $\log(M_{\rm 200m}/M_\odot) &gt; 12.5$, suggesting that galaxies in the same mass dark matter halos host equally bright hot CGM. We emphasize the observed $L_{\rm X, CGM} - M_{\rm 500c}$ relations of star-forming and quiescent galaxies are sensitive to the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR). A comparison with cosmological hydrodynamical simulations (EAGLE, TNG100, and SIMBA) reveals varying degrees of agreement, contingent on the simulation and the specific stellar or halo mass ranges considered. Either selected in stellar mass or halo mass, the star-forming galaxies do not host brighter stacked X-ray emission from the hot CGM than their quiescent counterparts at the same mass range. The result provides useful constraints on the extent of feedback's impacts as a mechanism for quenching star formation as implemented in current cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>The strong coupling constant: State of the art and the decade ahead</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.08271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions for particle production cross sections and decays at colliders rely heavily on perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) calculations, expressed as an expansion in powers of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. The current $\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ uncertainty of the QCD coupling evaluated at the reference Z boson mass, $\alpha_s(m_Z) = 0.1179 \pm 0.0009$, is one of the limiting factors to more precisely describe multiple processes at current and future colliders. A reduction of this uncertainty is thus a prerequisite to perform precision tests of the Standard Model as well as searches for new physics. This report provides a comprehensive summary of the state-of-the-art, challenges, and prospects in the experimental and theoretical study of the strong coupling. The current $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ world average is derived from a combination of seven categories of observables: (i) lattice QCD, (ii) hadronic $\tau$ decays, (iii) deep-inelastic scattering and parton distribution functions fits, (iv) electroweak boson decays, hadronic final-states in (v) $e^+e^-$, (vi) e-p, and (vii) p-p collisions, and (viii) quarkonia decays and masses. We review the current status of each of these seven $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ extraction methods, discuss novel $\alpha_s$ determinations, and examine the averaging method used to obtain the world-average value. Each of the methods discussed provides a ``wish list'' of experimental and theoretical developments required in order to achieve the goal of a per-mille precision on $\alpha_s(m_Z)$ within the next decade.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.01623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two Majorana cp-violating phases can not be determined by experiments on neutrino oscillations. It is difficult even not possible almost to measure two Majorana cp-violating phases since they are only sensitive to lepton-number-violating processes. One must take some assumption on the structure of neutrino mass matrix and their flavor mixing mechanism hidden behind in phenomenological models in order to determine Majorana cp-violating phases. Two models on the symmetry of the neutrino mass matrix are proposed in this paper. The Majorana cp-violating phases and the effective Majorana neutrino mass $\mathcal{m}_{\mathcal{ee}}$ are computed in the two models. Using the limit of the absolute neutrino mass scale which is from cosmological observations, the numerical values of the Majorana cp-violating phases and the effective Majorana neutrino mass $\mathcal{m}_{\mathcal{ee}}$ are obtained.</description>

Abstract: We point out that there is a stable configuration of metal plates where the Casimir force is vanishing in axion electrodynamics. We consider a concrete setup involving Weyl semimetals, which hosts an axion-like effect on the electromagnetism, towards the measurement of the axionic effect on the Casimir force. Our setup realizes zero Casimir force between metals and may be useful for the search for new force mediated by light particles at the micrometer scale.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the Hellings Downs correlation has been observed by different pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations, such as NANOGrav, European PTA, Parkes PTA, and Chinese PTA. These PTA measurements of the most precise pulsars within the Milky Way show the first evidence for the stochastic gravitational wave background of our Universe. We study the ultralight axion interpretation of the new discovery by investigating the gravitational wave from axion transitions between different energy levels of the gravitational atoms, which are composed of cosmic populated Kerr black holes and their surrounding axion clouds formed through the superradiant process. By Bayesian analysis, we demonstrate that this new observation naturally admits an ultralight axion interpretation around $10^{-21}$eV, which is consistent in magnitude with the typical mass of fuzzy dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a texture of neutrino mass matrix characterized by two constraints consisting of one equality and another antiequality between two elements corresponding to two pairs of the matrix entries. Amidst such textures, we limit our study to three patterns which were realizable assuming an $S_4$-symmetry within type II-seesaw scenario. Three such cases were found and studied: I ($M_{\n 22}=-M_{\n 33}$ \&amp; $M_{\n 11}=+M_{\n 23}$), II ($M_{\n 11}=-M_{\n 33}$ \&amp; $M_{\n 22}=+M_{\n 13}$) and III ($M_{\n 11}=-M_{\n 22}$ \&amp; $M_{\n 33}=+M_{\n 12}$). We specify the role of unphysical phases in the definition of the textures under study which were tested against experimental constraints, and were found to accommodate data with both hierarchies allowed. However, switching off the unphysical phases allows only for inverted hierarchy, except for the texture III which allows also, albeit for a very narrow parameter space region, for normal ordering. We stress that the different phenomenologies when including/excluding unphysical phases stem from the different definitions of the texture one has to adopt in order to make it insensitive to unphysical phases, rather than to any `absent' physical effects of unphysical phases. We present a complete phenomenological analysis of these three textures and justify analytically the resulting correlations. We detail the effect of the unphysical phases in diluting/deforming several correlations, which otherwise would have been ``clear". Finally, we give theoretical realizations within seesaw type II scenarios for such textures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19123v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strong CP violation problem has a long history emanating from its discovery 60 years ago in the decay of neutral kaons and subsequent experimental and theoretical studies over several decades. We review herein experimental data that observe indirect CP violation of the order of $\sim10^{-3}$, as well as the discovery of direct CP violation of the order of $\sim10^{-6}$. Despite improved experimental methods over the past half a century, the original CP violation numbers have remained the same. Verification of the CP violation in the decay of charged kaons was also observed. Data reflecting CP violation in the decays of $B$ and $D$ mesons have become very important and are also discussed in this review. The question of CP violation only with the participation of $s\bar{s}$, $c\bar{c}$, and $b\bar{b}$ quarks in the framework of the Standard Model or beyond it and its small magnitude remains open.</description>

      <title>Tomography of flavoured leptogenesis with primordial blue gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a scenario where an early epoch of matter domination is driven by the mass scale $M_N$ of the right-handed neutrinos, which also characterizes the different flavour regimes of leptogenesis. Such a matter-domination epoch gives rise to peculiar spectral imprints on primordial Gravitational Waves (GWs) produced during inflation. We point out that the characteristic spectral features are detectable in multiple frequency bands with current and future GW experiments in case of Blue GWs (BGWs) described by a power-law with a positive spectral index $(n_T &gt;0)$ and an amplitude compatible with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) measurements at the CMB scale. We find that the three-flavour leptogenesis regime with $M_N \lesssim 10^9~{\rm GeV}$ imprints BGWs more prominently than the two-flavour and one-flavour regimes characterized by a higher right-handed neutrino mass scale. In particular, a two-flavour (three-flavour) leptogenesis regime is expected to leave distinct imprints in the mHz-Hz ($\mu$Hz-mHz) band. Moreover, we translate the current Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and LIGO limits on the GW energy density into constraints on the flavour leptogenesis parameter space for different GW spectral indices $n_T$. We provide a rigorous statistical analysis of how the future GW detectors would be conjointly able to distinguish the flavour regimes. Interestingly, the scenario also offers unique GW signals testable in the next LIGO run with a correlated signature in the PTA frequency band with an amplitude comparable to the one expected from supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave spectrum from expanding string loops on domain walls: Implication for nanohertz pulsar timing array signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09599v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically calculate the spectrum of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by expanding string loops on domain walls in the scenario where domain walls decay by nucleation of string loops. By introducing macroscopic parameters characterizing the nucleation of the loops, the stochastic GW spectrum is derived in a way that is independent of the details of particle physics models. In contrast to GWs emitted from bubble collisions of the false vacuum decay, the string loops do radiate GWs even when they are perfectly circular before their collisions, resulting in that more and more contribution to the spectrum comes from the smaller and smaller loops compared to the typical size of the collided loops. Consequently, the spectrum is linearly proportional to the frequency at the high-frequency region, which is peculiar to this GW source. Furthermore, the results are compared with the recent nano-Hertz pulsar timing array signal, as well as the projected sensitivity curves of future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlos for tau lepton -- Standard Model and New Physics signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12570v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of purposes for High Energy accelerator experiments is confrontation of theory and measurements in ever new realms. Any new agreement extends theory applicability domain, any discrepancy hints to unexplained. That calls for better calculations or new, deeper theory. Often one has to search for small contributions over large Standard Model background. Multi-dimensional signatures and complex background subtraction cuts imply that Monte Carlo techniques are indispensable.
  My talk included description of: KKMC Monte Carlo for e+e- to tau+tau- (n gamma) (with tau decays), generation of additional lepton pairs of SM and New Physics, and of anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments effects.</description>

      <title>Supernova electron-neutrino interactions with xenon in the nEXO detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-neutrino charged-current interactions with xenon nuclei were modeled in the nEXO neutrinoless double-$\beta$ decay detector (~5 metric ton, 90% ${}^{136}$Xe, 10% ${}^{134}$Xe) to evaluate its sensitivity to supernova neutrinos. Predictions for event rates and detectable signatures were modeled using the Model of Argon Reaction Low Energy Yields (MARLEY) event generator. We find good agreement between MARLEY's predictions and existing theoretical calculations of the inclusive cross sections at supernova neutrino energies. The interactions modeled by MARLEY were simulated within the nEXO simulation framework and were run through an example reconstruction algorithm to determine the detector's efficiency for reconstructing these events. The simulated data, incorporating the detector response, were used to study the ability of nEXO to reconstruct the incident electron-neutrino spectrum and these results were extended to a larger xenon detector of the same isotope enrichment. We estimate that nEXO will be able to observe electron-neutrino interactions with xenon from supernovae as far as 5-8 kpc from Earth, while the ability to reconstruct incident electron-neutrino spectrum parameters from observed interactions in nEXO is limited to closer supernovae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15286v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise measurements of magnetic and electric dipole moments are important tests of the Standard Model and beyond Standard Model physics, particularly for the electron and the muon. However, the situation presents distinctive challenges when dealing with the tau lepton due to its very short lifetime and relatively high mass. Here, we review the theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of both the anomalous magnetic and electric dipole moments of the tau lepton.

      <title>Effect of quark anomalous magnetic moment on neutral dense quark matter under magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the effect of the quark anomalous magnetic moment (AMM) on the neutral dense quark matter under magnetic fields based on the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model at finite baryon density. To address its correlation with the chiral symmetry, we consider a simplified situation: the model includes the two-quark flavors under constant magnetic fields, and incorporates the effective interaction of the quark AMM linked to the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking. We then examine the equation of state (EoS) in cases with and without magnetization for anatomizing the thermodynamic quantities. Without the magnetization, a small magnetic field stiffens the EoS, but with increasing the magnetic field, the EoS tends to soften. The stiffness of the EoS is found to be influenced by the magnetic effect on the critical chemical potential of the chiral phase transition and the quark number density at this critical point. As a result, the mass and radius of the neutral dense quark matter increase with the small magnetic field but turn to decrease as the magnetic field further increases. By including the quark AMM, the critical chemical potential is decreased and the quark number density takes a smaller value. Thus, for the stronger magnetic fields, the quark AMM suppresses the softening effect of the magnetic field on the EoS, leading to increased mass and radius compared to when the quark AMM is absent. In contrast, for the small magnetic field, the contribution of the quark AMM to the EoS is marginal. When the magnetization is taken into account, the magnetic effect on the stiffness of the EoS is overshadowed by the contribution of the magnetization, and the significance of the quark AMM also becomes invisible in the mass-radius relation.</description>

      <title>Improved $\pi^0,\eta,\eta^{\prime}$ transition form factors in resonance chiral theory and their $a_\mu^{\rm{HLbL}}$ contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Working with Resonance Chiral Theory, within the two resonance multiplets saturation scheme, we satisfy leading (and some subleading) chiral and asymptotic QCD constraints and accurately fit simultaneously the $\pi^{0},\eta,\eta^{\prime}$ transition form factors, for single and double virtuality. In the latter case, we supplement the few available measurements with lattice data to ensure a faithful description. Mainly due to the new results for the doubly virtual case, we improve over existing descriptions for the $\eta$ and $\eta^\prime$. Our evaluation of the corresponding pole contributions to the hadronic light-by-light piece of the muon $g-2$ read: $a_\mu^{\pi^{0}\text{-}\rm{pole}}=\left(61.9\pm0.6^{+2.4}_{-1.5}\right)\times10^{-11}$, $a_\mu^{\eta\text{-}\rm{pole}}=\left(15.2\pm0.5^{+1.1}_{-0.8}\right)\times10^{-11}$ and $a_\mu^{\eta^\prime\text{-}\rm{pole}}=\left(14.2\pm0.7^{+1.4}_{-0.9}\right)\times10^{-11}$, for a total of $a_\mu^{\pi^0+\eta+\eta^{\prime}\text{-}\rm{pole}}=\left(91.3\pm1.0^{+3.0}_{-1.9}\right)\times10^{-11}$, where the first and second errors are the statistical and systematic uncertainties, respectively.</description>

      <title>Fully charmed tetraquark production at the LHC experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the formalism for production of a fully heavy tetraquark and apply it to the calculation of $pp\to T_{4c}+X$ cross-sections. We demonstrate that the production cross-section of a fully heavy tetraquark, even if it is a diquark-antidiquark cluster, can be obtained in the meson-like basis, for which the spin-color projection technique is well established. Prompted by the recent LHCb, ATLAS and CMS data, we perform a pQCD calculation of ${\cal O}(\alpha_s^5)$ short-distance factors in the dominant channel of gluon fusion, and match these to the four-body $T_{4c}$ wave functions in order to obtain the unpolarized $T_{4c}(0^{++},1^{+-},2^{++})$ cross-sections. The novelty in comparison with the recently published article~\cite{Feng:2023agq} lies in the fact that we predict the absolute values as well as the $d\sigma/dp_T$ spectra in the kinematic ranges accessible at the ongoing LHC experiments. From the comparison with the signal yield at LHCb we derive the constraints on the $\Phi\cdot\text{Br}(J/\psi\,J/\psi)$ (reduced wave function times branching) product for the $T_{4c}$ candidates for $X(6900)$ and observe that $X(6900)$ is compatible with a $2^{++}(2S)$ state.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Properties of Double-Strangeness Molecular Tetraquarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by recent advances in the study of the $K^{(*)} \bar K^{(*)}$ molecular tetraquarks and the $H$-dibaryon, we focus on the spectroscopic properties of the $\bar K^{(*)} \bar K^{(*)}$ systems, which exhibit exotic flavor quantum number of $ss\bar q \bar q$. A dynamical analysis is performed using the one-boson-exchange model to describe the effective interactions for these systems, accounting for both $S$-$D$ wave mixing and coupled-channel effects. By solving the coupled-channel Schr$\ddot{\rm o}$dinger equation, we identify the $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ $\bar K \bar K^*$ and $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ $\bar K^* \bar K^*$ states as the most likely candidates for double-strangeness molecular tetraquarks. Furthermore, we estimate their strong decay behaviors based on the effective Lagrangian approach, with several channels exhibiting considerable decay widths. Meanwhile, we investigate their magnetic moments and M1 radiative decay widths, shedding light on their inner structures, within the constituent quark model. Finally, we encourage experimentalists to focus on these predicted double-strangeness molecular tetraquark candidates, particularly in $B$ meson decays. Such efforts could pave the way for establishing the molecular tetraquark states in the light-quark sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present analytical and numerical calculations for the photon polarization tensor at finite temperature and density in a constant magnetic field. We first discuss the tensor decomposition in the presence of the magnetic field which breaks rotational symmetry. Then, we analytically perform all the momentum integrations and numerically take the Landau level sum. We present the real and imaginary parts of the photon polarization tensor as functions of the momenta, the chemical potential, and the finite temperature. As an application, we consider the real photon limit and estimate the photon decay rate in the hot and dense medium. We specifically quantify the difference between the X-mode and the O-mode with the polarization orthogonal and parallel to the magnetic field. As long as the magnetic field is weak, the decay rate of the X-mode photon is larger than that of the O-mode photon, while the O-mode becomes dominant due to the Landau level suppression of the X-mode at strong magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Using non-DESI data to confirm and strengthen the DESI 2024 spatially-flat $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00502v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data and non-CMB data that include Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNIa), Hubble parameter [$H(z)$], growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, and a collection of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, but not recent DESI 2024 BAO measurements, to confirm the DESI 2024 (DESI+CMB+PantheonPlus) data compilation support for dynamical dark energy with an evolving equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$. From our joint compilation of CMB and non-CMB data, in a spatially-flat cosmological model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.850 \pm 0.059$ and $w_a = -0.59^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$ and find that this dynamical dark energy is favored over a cosmological constant by $\sim 2\sigma$. Our data constraints on the flat $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization are slightly more restrictive than the DESI 2024 constraints, with the DESI 2024 and our values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ differing by $-0.27\sigma$ and $0.44\sigma$, respectively. Our data compilation slightly more strongly favors the flat $w_0w_a$CDM model over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model than does the DESI 2024 data compilation. We note that our CMB and non-CMB data $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization cosmological constraints are discrepant at 2.7$\sigma$, a little larger than the 1.9$\sigma$ discrepancy between DESI DR1 BAO and CMB data flat $\Lambda$CDM model cosmological constraints. We also show that if we remove the Pantheon+ SNIa contribution from the non-CMB data, for the $w_0w_a$CDM parameterization we still find tension between P18 and non-CMB data (2.5$\sigma$) and P18+lensing and non-CMB data (2.4$\sigma$). Even after the exclusion of Pantheon+ SNIa data the $\Lambda$CDM model is still disfavoured at $\sim 2\sigma$ c.l.</description>

      <title>Relic gravitons and non-stationary processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stationary processes do not accurately describe the diffuse backgrounds of relic gravitons whose correlations are homogeneous in space (i.e. only dependent upon the distance between the two spatial locations) but not in time. The symmetries of the autocorrelations ultimately reflect the quantum mechanical origin of the diffuse backgrounds and lead to non-stationary observables at late time. In particular, large oscillations are believed to arise in the spectral energy density that is customarily (but approximately) related to the tensor power spectrum. When the full expression of the spectral energy density is employed the amplitudes of oscillation are instead suppressed in the large-scale limit and the non-stationary features of the late-time signal practically disappear. For similar reasons the relations between the spectral energy density and the spectral amplitude are ambiguous in the presence of non-stationary features. While it is debatable if the non-stationary features are (or will be) directly detectable, we argue that the spectral amplitude following from the Wiener-Khintchine theorem is generally inappropriate for a consistent description of the relic signal. Nevertheless the strong oscillatory behaviour of the late-time observables is naturally smeared out provided the spectral energy density is selected as pivotal variable.</description>

Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) collaboration has recently released measurements of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) from the first year of observations. A joint analysis of DESI BAO, CMB, and SN Ia probes indicates a preference for time-evolving dark energy. We evaluate the robustness of this preference by replacing the DESI distance measurements at $z&lt;0.8$ with the SDSS BAO measurements in a similar redshift range. Assuming the $w_0w_a$CDM model, we find an evolution of the dark energy equation of state parameters consistent with $\Lambda$CDM. Our analysis of $\chi^2$ statistics across various BAO datasets shows that DESI's preference for evolving dark energy is primarily driven by the two LRG samples at $z_{\rm eff}=0.51$ and $z_{\rm eff}=0.71$, with the latter having the most significant impact.
  Taking this preference seriously, we study a general Horndeski scalar-tensor theory, which provides a physical mechanism to safely cross the phantom divide, $w=-1$. Utilizing the Effective Field Theory of dark energy and adopting the $w_0w_a$CDM background cosmological model, we derive constraints on the parameters $w_0=-0.856\pm0.062$ and $w_a=-0.53_{-0.26}^{+0.28}$ at $68\%$ CL from Planck CMB, Planck and ACT CMB lensing, DESI BAO, and Pantheon+ datasets, showing good consistency with the standard $w_0w_a$CDM model. The modified gravity model gives results discrepant with $\Lambda$CDM at the $2.4\sigma$ level, while for $w_0w_a$CDM it is at $2.5\sigma$, based on the best-fit $\chi^2$ values. We conclude that modified gravity offers a viable physical explanation for DESI's preference for evolving dark energy.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic flow fluctuation as a possible signature of clustered nuclear geometry in O-O collisions at the Large Hadron Collider</title>

Abstract: Nuclei having $4n$ number of nucleons are theorized to possess clusters of $\alpha$ particles ($^4$He nucleus). The Oxygen nucleus ($^{16}$O) is a doubly magic nucleus, where the presence of an $\alpha$-clustered nuclear structure grants additional nuclear stability. In this study, we exploit the anisotropic flow coefficients to discern the effects of an $\alpha$-clustered nuclear geometry with respect to a Woods-Saxon nuclear distribution in O--O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=7$ TeV using a hybrid of IP-Glasma + MUSIC + iSS + UrQMD models. In addition, we use the multi-particle cumulants method to measure anisotropic flow coefficients, such as elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) and triangular flow ($v_{3}$), as a function of multiplicity class. Anisotropic flow fluctuations, which are expected to be larger in small collision systems, are also studied for the first time in O--O collisions. It is found that an $\alpha$-clustered nuclear distribution gives rise to an enhanced value of $v_{2}$ and $v_3$ for the low-multiplicity events. Consequently, a rise in $v_3/v_2$ is also observed for the 0--10\% multiplicity class. Further, for $\alpha$-clustered O--O collisions, fluctuations of $v_{2}$ are larger for the highest multiplicity events, which decrease as the final-state multiplicity decreases. In contrast, for a Woods-Saxon $^{16}$O nucleus, $v_{2}$ fluctuations show an opposite behavior with decreasing multiplicity. When confronted with experimental data, this study may reveal the importance of the nuclear density profile on the discussed observables and provide physics validation for the hybrid model discussed in this work.</description>

      <title>WZW terms without anomalies: generalised symmetries in chiral Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a 4d non-linear sigma model on the coset $(\mathrm{SU}(N)_L \times \mathrm{SU}(N)_R \times \mathrm{SU}(2))/(\mathrm{SU}(N)_{L+R}\times \mathrm{U}(1))\cong \mathrm{SU}(N) \times S^2$, that features a topological Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) term whose curvature is $\frac{n}{24\pi^2}\mathrm{Tr}(g^{-1}dg)^3 \wedge \mathrm{Vol}_{S^2}$ where $g$ is the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ pion field. This WZW term, unlike its familiar cousin in QCD, does not match any chiral anomaly, so its microscopic origin is not obviously QCD-like. We find that generalised symmetries provide a key to unlocking a UV completion. The $S^2$ winding number bestows the theory with a 1-form symmetry, and the WZW term intertwines this with the $\mathrm{SU}(N)^2$ flavour symmetry into a 2-group global symmetry. Like a 't Hooft anomaly, the 2-group symmetry should match between UV and IR, precluding QCD-like completions that otherwise give the right pion manifold. We instead construct a weakly-coupled UV completion that matches the 2-group symmetry, in which an abelian gauge field connects the QCD baryon number current to the winding number current of a $\mathbb{C}P^1$ model, and explicitly show how the mixed WZW term arises upon flowing to the IR. The coefficient is fixed to be the number of QCD colours and, strikingly, this matching must be 'tree-level exact' to satisfy a quantization condition. We discuss generalisations, and elucidate the more intricate generalised symmetry structure that arises upon gauging an anomaly-free subgroup of $\mathrm{SU}(N)_{L+R}$. This WZW term may even play a phenomenological role as a portal to a dark sector, that determines the relic abundance of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Monopole-Fermion Scattering and the Solution to the Semiton/Unitarity Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Polchinski's "fermion-rotor system" as an accurate description of charged Weyl fermions scattering on a magnetic monopole core in the limit of zero gauge coupling. Traditionally it was thought such scattering could lead to fractional particle numbers ("semitons"). By direct calculations we show those semitonic processes are in fact free propagation, facilitated by composite fermion-rotor operators interpolating the "forbidden" states, effectively "recovering" both ingoing and outgoing states in every lowest partial wave. Non-semitonic Callan-Rubakov processes are unchanged.</description>

      <title>Preheating Axions in String Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Certain inflationary models can feature periods of preheating - an era preceding reheating during which parametric resonance triggers an exponential production of bosons. This non-perturbative process can have significant impact on the history of our universe, with consequences ranging from altered reheating channels to overproduction of dark radiation to overclosure. In this work, we study parametric resonance production of axions in string models of inflation. We find that the kinetic couplings and moduli-dependent axion masses give rise to generalizations of the Mathieu equation. We study these generalizations and determine the strength of parametric resonance created by such couplings. We then apply this technology to fibre inflation models in Type IIB orientifold compactifications. We find that heavy axions can be copiously produced and avoidance of overclosure results in constraints on the typical fibre inflation parameter space.</description>
