      <title>Energy-Dependent Transport of Cosmic Rays in the Multiphase, Dynamic Interstellar Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport of spectrally resolved cosmic ray (CR) protons with kinetic energies between $1-100$ GeV within the dynamic, multiphase interstellar medium (ISM), using a two-moment CR fluid solver applied to a TIGRESS MHD simulation with conditions similar to the solar neighborhood. Our CR transport prescription incorporates space- and momentum-dependent CR scattering coefficients $\sigma=\kappa^{-1}$, computed from the local balance between streaming-driven Alfv\`{e}n wave growth and damping processes. We find that advection combines with momentum-dependent diffusion to produce a CR distribution function $f(p)\propto~p^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma\approx4.6$ that agrees with observations, steepened from an injected power law slope $\gamma_\mathrm{inj}=4.3$. The CR pressure is uniform in the highly diffusive, mostly neutral midplane region, but decreases exponentially in the ionized extraplanar region where scattering is efficient. To interpret these numerical results, we develop a two-zone analytic model that captures and links the two (physically and spatially) distinct regimes of CR transport in the multiphase, dynamic ISM. At low momenta, CR transport is dominated by gas advection, while at high momenta, both advection and diffusion contribute. At high momentum, the analytic prediction for the spectral slope approaches $\gamma=(4/3)\gamma_\mathrm{inj}-1$, and the predicted scaling of grammage with momentum is $X\propto p^{1-\gamma_\mathrm{inj}/3}$, consistent with the simulations. These results support a physical picture in which CRs are confined within the neutral midplane by the surrounding ionized gas, with their escape regulated by both the CR scattering rate in the ionized extraplanar gas and the velocity and Alfv\'{e}n speed of that gas, at effective speed $v_\mathrm{c,eff}\approx(1/2)[\kappa_\parallel~d(v+v_\mathrm{A,i})/dz]^{1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Mid-Infrared Dust Evolution and Late-time Circumstellar Medium Interaction in SN 2017eaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/MIRI and complementary ground-based near-infrared observations of the Type II SN 2017eaw taken 6 years post-explosion. SN 2017eaw is still detected out to 25 $\mu$m and there is minimal evolution in the mid-infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) between the newly acquired JWST/MIRI observations and those taken a year earlier. Modeling of the mid-infrared SED reveals a cool $\sim$160 K dust component of $5.5\times10^{-4}\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ and a hot $\sim$1700 K component of $5.4\times10^{-8}\ \mathrm{M}_\odot$ both composed of silicate dust. Notably there is no evidence of temperature or mass evolution in the cool dust component in the year between JWST observations. We also present new and archival HST and ground-based ultraviolet (UV) and optical observations which reveal reduced but continued circumstellar medium (CSM)-ejecta interaction at $&gt;$2000 days post-explosion. The UV and mid-infrared emission show similar decline rates, suggesting both probe the interface between the ejecta and CSM. Given this, the continued existence of boxy H$\alpha$ emission in the nebular spectra, the low inferred optical depth of the dust, and the lack of temperature and mass evolution, we suggest that the cool dust component in SN 2017eaw may be primarily due to pre-existing dust rather than newly-formed dust in the ejecta or cold dense shell.</description>

      <title>XRISM Observation of the Ophiuchus Galaxy Cluster: Quiescent Velocity Structure in the Dynamically Disturbed Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic observations of the Ophiuchus galaxy cluster core using the XRISM satellite. Despite previous observations revealing multiple cold fronts and dynamical disturbances in the cluster core, our XRISM observations show low gas velocity dispersions of \sigma_v = 115 +/- 7 km s^{-1} in the inner region (~&lt; 25 kpc) and \sigma_v = 186 +/- 9 km s^{-1} in the outer region (~ 25-50 kpc). The gas temperatures are kT = 5.5 +/- 0.2 keV and 8.4 +/- 0.2 keV for the inner and outer regions, respectively, with metal abundances of Z = 0.75 +/- 0.03 Z_sun (inner) and 0.44 +/- 0.02 Z_sun (outer). The measured velocity dispersions correspond to nonthermal pressure fractions of only 1.4 +/- 0.2% (inner) and 2.5 +/- 0.2% (outer), indicating highly subsonic turbulence. Our analysis of the bulk gas motion indicates that the gas in the inner region is nearly at rest relative to the central galaxy (|v_bulk|=8 +/- 7 km s^{-1}), while the outer region exhibits a moderate motion of |v_bulk|=104 +/- 7 km s^{-1}. Assuming the velocity dispersion arises from turbulent motions, the turbulent heating rate is only ~ 40% of the radiative cooling rate, although there is some uncertainty. This suggests that the heating and cooling of the gas are not balanced. The activity of the central active galactic nucleus (AGN) has apparently weakened. The sloshing motion that created the cold fronts may now be approaching a turning point at which the velocity is minimum.</description>

      <title>On the cosmic-ray distribution in the Galactic Center region: New insights from H.E.S.S</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a spectro-morphological analysis of the diffuse emission in the Galactic center region with H.E.S.S. gamma-ray data. We relied on templates to model the diffuse emissions (the Galactic center ridge and the foreground component) and on a 3D likelihood fitting approach. We first assessed the validity of a continuous injection scenario near the Galactic center by investigating possible deviations from a 1/r profile of the cosmic-ray distribution and potential spectral variations within the Galactic center ridge. We found the data can appropriately be described by a scenario in which a steady source near the Galactic center continuously injects cosmic rays which diffuse through the Central Molecular Zone. We then derived the best-fit spectral parameters of the Galactic center ridge emission and we found a spectral transition near 10-20 TeV.</description>

      <title>Modeling Cosmic Ray Electron Spectra and Synchrotron Emission in the Multiphase ISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the transport and spectral evolution of 1-100 GeV cosmic ray (CR) electrons (CREs) in TIGRESS MHD simulations of the magnetized, multiphase interstellar medium. We post-process a kpc-sized galactic disk patch representative of the solar neighborhood using a two-moment method for CR transport that includes advection, streaming, and diffusion. The diffusion coefficient is set by balancing wave growth via the CR streaming instability against wave damping (nonlinear Landau and ion-neutral collisions), depending on local gas and CR properties. Implemented energy loss mechanisms include synchrotron, inverse Compton, ionization, and bremsstrahlung. We evaluate CRE losses by different mechanisms as a function of energy and distance from the midplane, and compare loss timescales to transport and diffusion timescales. This comparison shows that CRE spectral steepening above p = 1 GeV/c is due to a combination of energy-dependent transport and losses. Our evolved CRE spectra are consistent with direct observations in the solar neighborhood, with a spectral index that steepens from an injected value of -2.3 to an energy dependent value between -2.7 and -3.3. We also show that the steepening is independent of the injection spectrum. Finally, we present potential applications of our models, including to the production of synthetic synchrotron emission. Our simulations demonstrate that the CRE spectral slope can be accurately recovered from pairs of radio observations in the range 1.5-45 GHz.</description>

      <title>X-ray polarization of Z-type neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries -- I. Model-independent, time-resolved X-ray polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Z-sources are a particular class of neutron star low-mass X-ray binaries characterized by a wide Z-like track in their hard colorsoft color (or hardness-intensity) diagrams, with three branches: the horizontal (HB), the normal (NB), and the flaring branch (FB). Spectropolarimetric observations with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) show that the polarization in these sources varies along the Z-track, reaching unexpectedly high values in the HB. In this work, we collected all the polarimetric results obtained so far from observations of Z-sources with IXPE, using a model-independent analysis with ixpeobssim. We first performed a detailed characterization of the spectral state of each source along the Z-track using IXPE, along with the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) and the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) data and then estimated the polarization for each branch. Although we confirm that the average polarization in the 2-8 keV band decreases moving from the HB to the NB for all three Z-sources observed in these branches, we also observe a qualitatively increasing trend from the NB to the FB. Whereas this increase is clearly significant for Cyg X-2 and Sco X-1, the polarization remains consistent at the 90% confidence level for GX 5-1 and GX 349+2, while for XTE J1701-462 and GX 340+0 only upper limits are found in the FB. For most sources, the average polarization angle in the 2-8 keV range remains consistent along the CCD; however, we observe a significant rotation for both Sco X1 and GX 349+2 (at the 90% confidence level) as they move from the NB to the FB. In addition, we observe a significant increase in the polarization degree with energy in most of the observed Z-sources, with some also exhibiting a rotation of the polarization angle with energy (approximately by 20-30 deg).</description>

      <title>Radio Continuum Studies of Ultra-Compact and Short Orbital Period X-Ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the radio continuum counterparts to the enigmatic ultra-compact X-ray binaries (UCXBs); a black hole or neutron star accreting from a hydrogen-deficient white dwarf donor star, with short orbital periods ($&lt;$ 80 minutes). For the sample of UCXBs hosted by globular clusters (GCs), we search for whether certain GC properties are more likely to enhance UCXB formation. We determine that GCs which host UCXBs are drawn from a distinct population in terms of cluster concentration, core radius and half-light radius, but are similar to other well-studied GCs in metallicity and cluster mass. In particular, UCXB-hosting GCs tend to be on average more compact, with a higher concentration than other GCs, with significantly higher encounter rates. We investigate whether a correlation exists between radio luminosity and orbital period, using new and archival observations. We determine that there is not a clear connection between the two observable quantities.</description>

      <title>LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA neutron star merger candidate S250206dm: Zwicky Transient Facility observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the searches conducted with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) in response to S250206dm, a bona fide event with a false alarm rate of one in 25 years, detected by the International Gravitational Wave Network (IGWN). Although the event is significant, the nature of the compact objects involved remains unclear, with at least one likely neutron star. ZTF covered 68% of the localization region, though we did not identify any likely optical counterpart. We describe the ZTF strategy, potential candidates, and the observations that helped rule out candidates, including sources circulated by other collaborations. Similar to Ahumada et al. 2024, we perform a frequentist analysis, using simsurvey, as well as Bayesian analysis, using nimbus, to quantify the efficiency of our searches. We find that, given the nominal distance to this event of 373$\pm$104 Mpc, our efficiencies are above 10% for KNe brighter than $-17.5$ absolute magnitude. Assuming the optical counterpart known as kilonova (KN) lies within the ZTF footprint, our limits constrain the brightest end of the KN parameter space. Through dedicated radiative transfer simulations of KNe from binary neutron star (BNS) and black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers, we exclude parts of the BNS KN parameter space. Up to 35% of the models with high wind ejecta mass ($M_{\rm wind} \approx 0.13$ M$_{\odot}$) are ruled out when viewed face-on ($\cos\theta_{\rm obs} = 1.0$). Finally, we present a joint analysis using the combined coverage from ZTF and the Gravitational Wave Multimessenger Dark Energy Camera Survey (GW-MMADS). The joint observations cover 73% of the localization region, and the combined efficiency has a stronger impact on rising and slowly fading models, allowing us to rule out 55% of the high-mass KN models viewed face-on.</description>

      <title>Evidence for enhanced mass transfer in the disc preceding the transition to the soft state in MAXI J1820+070</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the 2018-2019 main outburst and the subsequent mini-outbursts of the black hole low-mass X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 using optical/ultraviolet data from the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO), the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO), and $\textit{Swift}$/UVOT, as well as X-ray data from $\textit{Insight}$-HXMT and $\textit{Swift}$/XRT. Given the high-cadence observations, we identify a broad dip-like feature in both the optical and X-ray light curves preceding the transition to the soft state, with the X-ray dip lagging the optical dip by approximately 10 days. We propose that the dip is caused by a brief decrease followed by an increase in the mass accretion rate as it propagates through the disc, ultimately triggering the transition to the soft state. This might be a potential tool to predict impending hard-to-soft state transitions, although such a dip has not yet been observed in many sources. Additionally, we find that optical colour ($g^{\prime}-i^{\prime}$) becomes bluer and less variable before the transition to the intermediate state, preceding a dramatic change in the hardness ratio. This appears to be an unusual case, differing from the typical scenario where the optical colour changes usually along with the transition to the soft state. Finally, we explore the implications of the complex evolution of optical/X-ray correlation during both main outbursts and mini-outbursts. In particular, we find a loop-like evolutionary track before the transition to the soft state, which is linked to the optical/X-ray dips in the light curves.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive study of time delay between optical/near-infrared and X-ray emissions in black hole X-ray binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted a comprehensive study of daily delays using multi-wavelength data from a sample of well-studied black hole X-ray binaries, specifically focusing on the sources GX 339-4, 4U 1543-47, and XTE J1550-564. The Interpolated-Correlation Function method was employed to investigate the temporal relationship between the X-ray (Compton component) and optical-infrared (OIR) emissions. Our results show that during the rising hard state, the Compton emission consistently lags behind OIR emission for several days. In contrast, during the decaying hard state, the OIR emission lags behind the Compton emission by approximately 6 to 35 days. This measurement can potentially be used in models of accretion physics and disk instability. We explore the underlying mechanisms responsible for these time delays, highlighting the critical role of viscous heating in the accretion disk in generating OIR luminosity for these sources. The observed time delays during both the rising and decaying hard states are well explained by the disk instability model.</description>

      <title>The radiative subpulse modulation and spectral features of PSR B1929$+$10 with the whole pulse phase emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we observe the nearby pulsar, PSR B1929$+$10, using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). We find, for the first time, two new emission components with an extremely weak observed flux density of about $10^{-4}$ of the magnitude of the peak radio emission of PSR B1929$+$10. Our results show that the intrinsic radio emission of PSR B1929$+$10 covers the $360^{\circ}$ of longitude, demonstrating that this pulsar is a whole $360^{\circ}$ of longitude emission pulsar. We find at least 15 components of pulse emission in the average pulse profile. Additionally, we identify 5 modes of subpulse modulation in different emission regions, which differ from the pulse components. Moreover, the narrowband emission feature and the frequent jumps in the observed linear polarization position angle (PPA) are also detected in the single pulse of this pulsar. To understand the magnetosphere of this pulsar, we analyze the observed PPA variations across the whole $360^{\circ}$ of longitude and fit them using the classical rotating vector model (RVM). For the best-fit model, the inclination angle,$\alpha$, and the impact angle, $\beta$, of this pulsar are $55^{\circ}.56$ and $53^{\circ}.47$, respectively. Using the rotating magnetosphere approximation of the magnetic dipole field, we investigate the three-dimensional pulsar magnetosphere and the sparking pattern on the polar cap surface. Our analysis indicates that the extremely narrow zone of the polar cap, which is associated with a high-altitude magnetospheric region, is responsible for the weak emission window. This pulsar has extremely high-altitude magnetospheric radio emissions.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent temporal study of GX 13+1 with AstroSat observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we performed an energy-dependent study of low-frequency oscillations observed in GX 13+1 using \textit{AstroSat} (Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter and Soft X-ray Telescope). The hardness-intensity diagram (HID) of the observation resembles a `$\nu$'-shaped track, while the color-color diagram exhibits a `$&lt;$'-shaped track, similar to the horizontal and normal branches of the Z source. We conducted flux-resolved temporal studies focusing on low-frequency variability and divided the HID into five regions: A, B, C, D, and E. Low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) were detected in Regions A, B, and C. The QPO in Region A has a frequency of $5.06^{+0.54}_{-0.48}$ Hz with a quality factor (Q-factor) of 2.80. In Region B, the QPO was detected at $4.52^{+0.14}_{-0.13}$ Hz with a Q-factor of 5.79, while in Region C, it was observed at $4.70^{+0.62}_{-0.42}$ Hz with a Q-factor of 4.35. The QPO frequencies, Q-factors, and low root-mean-square (rms) values (1.32\%, 1.34\%, and 0.7\%) suggest that these oscillations are Normal Branch Oscillations, similar to those reported in GX 340+0. We modeled the rms and lag of the QPOs using a propagative model, considering variations in blackbody temperature, coronal heating rate, and optical depth. Our findings indicate that the observed QPOs are likely driven by interactions between the corona and variations in the blackbody temperature.</description>

      <title>Attributing the point symmetric structure of core-collapse supernova remnant N132D to the jittering jets explosion mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I identified a point-symmetric morphology in the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) remnant (CCSNR) N132D, composed of two symmetry axes: the short symmetry axis extending from the northwest ear and through the center of the iron-rich emission on the other side, and the second along the long dimension of N132D and coincides with the extension of the central oxygen-rich gas to the northeast. Namely, the point-symmetry of the outer zones of CCSNR N132D correlates with that of the oxygen-rich gas near the center. The surrounding gas cannot shape the inner oxygen-rich material, implying that the point-symmetric morphology is a property of the explosion mechanism, as predicted by the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). The oxygen-rich material is known to be in a torus. According to the JJEM, an energetic pair of opposite jets, more or less perpendicular to the plane of the torus, has shaped the torus; this pair is along the short symmetry axis. Another energetic pair, perpendicular to the first one, shaped the elongated, large-scale structure of CCSNR N132D. I discuss how the JJEM accounts for two perpendicular pairs of jets and the unequal jets in each pair. CCSNR N132D is the fifteenth CCSNR with an identified point-symmetric morphology attributed to the JJEM. Because the neutrino-driven mechanism cannot explain such morphologies, this study further strengthens the claim that the JJEM is the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quark Stars with Quark-Quark Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of phase transitions between different quark matter phases occurring within quark stars, giving rise to the hybrid quark stars (HybQSs). Utilizing a well-established general parameterization of interacting quark matter, we construct quark star models featuring sharp first-order quark-quark phase transitions of various types, in contrast to the hadron-quark transition in conventional hybrid stars. We systematically investigate how recent observations, such as the pulsar mass measurements $M_{\rm TOV}\gtrsim2M_{\odot}$ and the GW170817's tidal deformability bound $\Lambda_{1.4M_{\odot}}&lt;800$, constrain the viable parameter space. We also identified twin stars in some of the HybQS parameter space. This work unveils new possibilities of phase transitions and the resulting new types of compact stars in realistic astrophysical scenarios.</description>

      <title>Timing and spectral studies of SRGA J144459.2$-$604207 with NICER, Einstein Probe, IXPE, NuSTAR, Insight-HXMT and INTEGRAL during its 2024 outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SRGA J144459.2$-$604207 is a newly confirmed accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar and type I X-ray burster. We present the broadband X-ray timing and spectral behaviors of SRGA J144459.2$-$604207 during its 2024 outburst. The data were collected from NICER, Einstein Probe, IXPE, Insight-HXMT, NuSTAR and INTEGRAL observations. X-ray pulsations have been detected for the 1.5$-$90 keV energy range throughout the `ON' phase of the outburst from MJD $\sim 60355-60385$.
  We refined the orbital and spin ephemerides assuming a circular orbit, and found that the pulsar was in a spin-up state during MJD $\sim$ 60361--60377 showing a significant spin-up rate $\dot{\nu}$ of $(3.15\pm 0.36)\times10^{-13}~{\rm Hz~s^{-1}}$. Around MJD $\sim 60377$ a swing was detected in the spin evolution accompanied by significantly enhanced pulsed emission.
  We studied the pulse profile morphology during the X-ray bursts as observed by Insight-HXMT, IXPE and NuSTAR. During the bursts, pulsations were detected across the 2$-$60 keV with shapes broadly consistent with those observed for the persistent emission. We found, however, that the `burst' pulse profiles exhibit significant phase offsets relative to the pre- and post-burst profiles. These offsets systematically decrease with increasing energy, $\Delta \phi\approx0.15$, 0.11 and 0.02 for IXPE, Insight-HXMT ME and HE in 2$-$8, 5$-$30 and 20$-$60 keV, respectively, and $\Delta \phi\approx0.21$, 0.10 and 0.07 for NuSTAR in 3$-$10, 20$-$35 and 35$-$60 keV, respectively, compared to the pre- and post-burst profiles.
  We performed a joint spectral analysis of quasi-simultaneous NICER, NuSTAR, and Insight-HXMT data for two epochs. The resulting spectra from both observations were consistent and well-described by an absorbed thermal Comptonization model, nthcomp, plus relativistic reflection, relxillCp.</description>

      <title>A period-increasing oscillation signal in a long gamma-ray burst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), the brightest electromagnetic bursts in the universe, are believed to originate from ultra-relativistic jets launched by the rapidly rotating central engine, either a disk-surrounded newly formed black hole (BH) or a magnetar. Such a central engine potentially possesses rapidly evolving physical characteristics, as it is just born. The caught of time-increasing frequency in the gravitational wave signals is the evidence of upon opinion. Here we report a possible oscillatory signal identified in GRB 131122B with periods increasing from 1.27 seconds to 4.02 seconds in a time interval of 16.75 seconds. Such a peculiar oscillation signal has not been identified in GRBs before and its periodic evolution could also be the quickest one found in the electromagnetic radiation window of astrophysics. The precession of a misaligned accretion disk caused by the tidal disruption of a star by an intermediate-mass BH may be responsible for this signal. This finding could open a new window to reveal the nature of the hiding central engine of GRBs.</description>

      <title>A binary origin of ultra-long period radio pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a possible binary evolution model for the formation of ultra-long period pulsars (ULPPs). The model involves two key stages: first, a neutron star (NS) in wide binaries undergoes an effective spin-down phase through wind-fed accretion from its massive stellar companion; second, the supernova explosion of the companion leads to the disruption of the binary system, and produces two isolated compact stars. One of the them is the first-born, slowly rotating NSs, and our binary and spin evolution calculations show that the spin periods range from $\lesssim 0.1$ s to $\gtrsim 10^8$ s. This offers a possible formation channel for some of the long-period radio transients. We estimate that the formation rate of such systems in the Milky Way is approximately about $10^{-6}$ $\rm yr^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Black-hole - neutron-star mergers: new numerical-relativity simulations and multipolar effective-one-body model with spin precession and eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present 52 new numerical-relativity (NR) simulations of black-hole-neutron-star merger (BHNS) mergers and employ the data to inform TEOBResumS-Dal\'i: a multipolar effective-one-body model also including precession and eccentricity. Our simulations target quasicircular mergers and the parameter space region characterized by significant tidal disruption of the star. Convergent gravitational waveforms are produced with a detailed error budget after extensive numerical tests. We study in detail the multipolar amplitude hierarchy and identify a characteristic tidal signature in the $(\ell,m)=(2,0)$, and $(3,0)$ modes. We also develop new NR-informed models for the remnant black hole and for the recoil velocity. The numerical data is then used to inform next-to-quasicircular corrections and the ringdown of TEOBResumS-Dal\'i for BHNS. We show an overall order of magnitude improvement in the waveform's amplitude at merger and more consistent multipoles over our older TEOBResumS-GIOTTO for BHNS. TEOBResumS-Dal\'i is further validated with a new 12 orbit precessing simulation, showing phase and relative amplitude differences below $\sim 0.5$ (rad) throughout the inspiral. The computed mismatches including all the modes lie at the one percent level for low inclinations. Finally, we demonstrate for the first time that TEOBResumS-Dal\'i can produce robust waveforms with both eccentricity and precession, and use the model to identify the most urgent BHNS to simulate for waveform development. Our new numerical data are publicly released as part of the CoRe database.</description>

      <title>Modeling Gravitational Wave Modes from Binaries with Arbitrary Eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eccentric binaries are key targets for current and future gravitational wave (GW) detectors, offering unique insights into the formation and environments of compact binaries. However, accurately and efficiently modeling eccentric waveforms remains challenging, in part due to their complex harmonic structure. In this work, we develop a post-Newtonian (PN) framework to compute the Fourier amplitudes of GWs from eccentric binaries, deriving simple expressions at 1PN order for all relevant $(l, m)$ multipoles, valid for arbitrary eccentricities. We then characterize the GW emission by analyzing the contribution of each $(l, m)$ mode to the strain, its mean frequency, frequency spread, and asymptotic behavior at high frequencies. Additionally, we introduce a method to determine the minimal set of Fourier modes needed to reconstruct the waveform to a given accuracy. Finally, we also discuss how our framework can be extended to higher PN orders, obtaining closed-form expressions for the leading-order tail and spin contributions and outlining the steps required to include higher-order corrections. Our results provide both a deeper theoretical understanding of eccentric GW emission and practical tools for developing more accurate and efficient waveform models.</description>

      <title>Black Holes Immersed in Galactic Dark Matter Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac test fields in the background of a black hole immersed in a galactic dark matter halo. The analytic black hole solution considered here is sourced by a physically motivated halo density profile that leads to a flat galactic rotation curve. Using the sixth-order WKB method with Pad\'e approximants, we compute the QNM spectra for various field spins and parameter values, and provide numerical data in tabulated form. In addition to the numerical analysis, we derive analytic expressions for the quasinormal frequencies in the eikonal limit and beyond, by means of an expansion in inverse powers of the multipole number. We also calculate the Unruh temperature perceived by a static observer in the halo-modified spacetime. Our results demonstrate that the presence of the dark matter halo leads to observable modifications in the QNM spectra only if the density or compactness of the galactic halo is extraordinary high, so that quasinormal ringing a reliable observable for testing the black hole geometry, even in the presence of galactic environments.</description>

      <title>The Instrumental Background of EP/FXT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The in-flight instrumental background of the Follow-up X-ray Telescope (FXT) onboard Einstein Probe (EP) mission is analysed in this work by utilizing observations collected during Performance Verification phase and subsequent dedicated filter wheel closed observations. The instrumental backgrounds of the two FXT modules are consistent with each other, with an average rate of $\sim 4\times10^{-2}$\,counts/s/keV at 0.5--10\,keV for each module. The background is nearly uniformly distributed across the detector pixels, with a minor increase ($&lt;8\%$) observed along rows. The spatial distribution shows significant modulation by the geomagnetic field. The spectral shapes remain unchanged in 0.5--10\,keV at different rates. The long-term temporal variation indicates a periodic change associated with the orbital precession ($\sim 57$ days). The innovative design of FXT full-frame readout mode enables simultaneous recording of events in both the imaging area (IMG) and the frame store area (FSA) of the pnCCD. FSA event rates show a strong linear correlation with the IMG, based on which the IMG instrumental background modelling is established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TRIDENT experiment is a planned neutrino observatory at West Pacific Ocean to search for astrophysical neutrinos. The final full-scale detector array is expected to have about 1000 strings, each of which consists of 20 hybrid digital optical modules. Each module will contain a number of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) and silicon photomultipliers to detect Cherenkov lights. In this paper, we present a custom designed digitization mainboard for the TRIDENT experiment. It includes PMT waveform digitization at a sampling rate of 125 MS/s using commercial analog-to-digital converters, and time digitization using time-to-digital converters implemented in a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). We present its design and the first performances.</description>

      <title>Detection probability of light compact binary mergers in future observing runs of the current ground-based gravitational wave detector network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With no binary neutron star (BNS) merger detected yet during the fourth observing run (O4) of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational wave (GW) detector network, despite the time-volume (VT) surveyed with respect to the end of O3 increased by more than a factor of three, a pressing question is how likely the detection of at least one BNS merger is in the remainder of the run. I present here a simple and general method to address such a question, which constitutes the basis for the predictions that have been presented in the LVK Public Alerts User Guide during the hiatus between the O4a and O4b parts of the run. The method, which can be applied to neutron star - black hole (NSBH) mergers as well, is based on simple Poisson statistics and on an estimate of the ratio of the VT span by the future run to that span by previous runs. An attractive advantage of this method is that its predictions are independent from the mass distribution of the merging compact binaries, which is very uncertain at the present moment. The results, not surprisingly, show that the most likely outcome of the final part of O4 is the absence of any BNS merger detection. Still, the probability of a non-zero number of detections is 34-46\%. For NSBH mergers, the probability of at least one additional detection is 64-71\%. The prospects for the next observing run O5 are more promising, with predicted numbers $N_\mathrm{BNS,O5}=28_{-21}^{+44}$, and the NSBH detections to be $N_\mathrm{NSBH,O5}=65_{-38}^{+61}$ (median and 90\% symmetric credible range), based on the current LVK detector target sensitivities for the run. The calculations presented here also lead to an update of the LVK local BNS merger rate density estimate that accounts for the absence of BNS merger detections in O4 so far, that reads $2.8\,\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}\leq R_0\leq 480\,\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Muffled Murmurs: Environmental effects in the LISA stochastic signal from stellar-mass black hole binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The population of unresolved stellar-mass black hole binaries (sBBHs) is expected to produce a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) potentially detectable by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). In this work, we compute the imprint of astrophysical environmental effect--such as gas dynamical friction and accretion--on this background. Using the sBBHs population constraints obtained by the LIGO--Virgo--Kagra collaboration, we compute the expected SGWB and develop a phenomenological parametric model that can accurately capture the effect of dynamical friction and accretion. Using our model, we perform Bayesian inference on simulated signals to assess the detectability of these environmental effects. We find that even for large injected values of the Eddington ratio, the effect of accretion in the SGWB is undetectable by LISA. However, LISA will be able to constrain the effect of dynamical friction with an upper bound on the gas density of $\rho \lesssim 7.6 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{g \, cm^{-3}}$, thus probing the sBBH environment forming in typical thin accretion disks around Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). For injected densities of $\rho \sim 10^{-10}-10^{-9} \mathrm{g} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, dynamical friction effects can be well measured and clearly distinguished from vacuum, with Bayes factors reaching up to $\sim$ 60, even when the Galactic foreground is included.</description>

Abstract: The existence of billion-solar-mass quasars at redshifts $z \gtrsim 7$ poses a formidable challenge to theories of black hole formation, requiring pathways for the rapid growth of massive seeds. Population III.1 stars, forming in pristine, dense dark matter (DM) minihalos, are compelling progenitors. This study presents a suite of stellar evolution models for accreting Pop III.1 protostars, calculated with the \textsc{GENEC} code. We systematically explore a wide parameter space, spanning ambient WIMP densities of $\rho_\chi \sim 10^{12}\mbox{-}10^{16}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$ and gas accretion rates of $10^{-3}\mbox{-}10^{-1}\,M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$, to quantify the effects of DM annihilation. A central finding is that for a protostar to grow to supermassive scales ($\gtrsim 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$), the ambient DM density in the immediate vicinity of the star must exceed a critical threshold of $\rho_{\chi} \gtrsim 5 \times 10^{14} \, \text{GeV cm}^{-3}$. The energy injected by WIMP annihilation inflates the protostar, lowering its surface temperature, which suppresses the ionizing feedback that would otherwise halt accretion and significantly delays the onset of hydrogen fusion. This heating also governs the star's final fate: in dense halos ($\rho_\chi \gtrsim 10^{15}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$), stars remain stable against general relativistic instability beyond $10^6 \, M_{\odot}$, whereas at lower densities ($\rho_\chi \lesssim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$), they collapse at masses of $\sim 5 \times 10^5 \, M_{\odot}$. Once the DM fuel is exhausted and core burning commences, the protostar contracts and its ionising photon output can reach very high levels $\sim 10^{53} s^{-1}$. These distinct evolutionary phases offer clear observational signatures for the JWST, providing a robust, physically-grounded pathway for forming heavy black hole seeds in the early universe.</description>

      <title>New Constraints on Neutrino-Dark Matter Interactions: A Comprehensive Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the interactions of neutrinos with the dark sector within the simplified model framework. We first derive the exact analytic formulas for the differential scattering cross sections of neutrinos with scalar, fermion, and vector dark matter (DM) for light dark sector models with mediators of different types. We then implement the full catalog of constraints on the parameter space of the neutrino-DM and neutrino-mediator couplings and masses, including cosmological and astrophysical bounds coming from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, Cosmic Microwave Background, DM and neutrino self-interactions, DM collisional damping, and astrophysical neutrino sources, as well as laboratory constraints from 3-body meson decays and invisible $Z$ decays. We find that most of the benchmarks in the DM mass-coupling plane adopted in previous studies to get an observable neutrino-DM interaction effect are actually ruled out by a combination of the above-mentioned constraints, especially the laboratory ones which are robust against astrophysical uncertainties and independent of the cosmological history. To illustrate the consequences of our new results, we take the galactic supernova neutrinos in the MeV energy range as a concrete example and highlight the difficulties in finding any observable effect of neutrino-DM interactions. Finally, we identify new benchmark points potentially promising for future observational prospects of the attenuation of the galactic supernova neutrino flux and comment on their implications for the detection prospects in future large-volume neutrino experiments such as JUNO, Hyper-K, and DUNE. We also comment on the ultraviolet-embedding of the effective neutrino-DM couplings.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger signatures of delayed choked jets in tidal disruption events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent radio observations and coincident neutrino detections suggest that some tidal disruption events (TDEs) exhibit late-time activities, relative to the optical emission peak, and these may be due to delayed outflows launched from the central supermassive black hole. We investigate the possibility that jets launched with a time delay of days to months, interact with a debris that may expand outwards. We discuss the effects of the time delay and expansion velocity on the outcomes of jet breakout and collimation. We find that a jet with an isotropic-equivalent luminosity of $\lesssim 5 \times 10^{45}\,{\rm erg/s}$ is likely to be choked for a delay time of $\sim 3$ months. We also study the observational signatures of such delayed choked jets. The jet-debris interaction preceding the breakout would lead to particle acceleration and the resulting synchrotron emission can be detected by current and near-future radio, optical and X-ray telescopes, and the expanding jet-driven debris could explain late-time radio emission. We discuss high-energy neutrino production in delayed choked jets, and the time delay can significantly alleviate the difficulty of the hidden jet scenario in explaining neutrino coincidences.</description>

      <title>Ultrahigh-energy neutrino searches using next-generation gravitational wave detectors at radio neutrino detectors: GRAND, IceCube-Gen2 Radio, and RNO-G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary neutron star (BNS) mergers can be sources of ultrahigh-energy (UHE) cosmic rays and potential emitters of UHE neutrinos. The upcoming and current radio neutrino detectors like the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND), IceCube-Gen2 Radio, and the Radio Neutrino Observatory in Greenland (RNO-G) are projected to reach the required sensitivities to search for these neutrinos. In particular, in conjunction with the next-generation of gravitational wave (GW) detectors like Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), GW-triggered stacking searches can be performed with the UHE neutrino detectors. In this work, we explore the prospects of such searches by implementing in our analysis an upper distance limit based on the sky-localization capabilities of the GW detectors from which meaningful triggers can be collected. We find that if each GW burst is associated with a total isotropic-equivalent energy of $\sim 10^{50} - 10^{51}$ erg emitted in UHE neutrinos, along with a corresponding beaming fraction of $1$%, GRAND and IceCube-Gen2 Radio have a large probability ($\sim 99$%) to detect a coincident neutrino event using the joint combination of CE+ET in a timescale of less than 15 years of operation for our fiducial choice of parameters. In case of nondetections, the parameter spaces can be constrained at $3\sigma$ level in similar timescales of operation. We also highlight and discuss the prospects of such joint radio neutrino detector network, their importance, and their role in facilitating synergic GW and neutrino observations in the next era of multimessenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>SECRET: Stochasticity Emulator for Cosmic Ray Electrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectrum of cosmic-ray electrons depends sensitively on the history and spatial distribution of nearby sources. Given our limited observational handle on cosmic-ray sources, any model remains necessarily probabilistic. Previously, predictions were performed in a Monte Carlo fashion, summing the contributions from individual, simulated sources to generate samples from the statistical ensemble of possible electron spectra. Such simulations need to be re-run if the cosmic-ray transport parameters (e.g. diffusion coefficient, maximum energy) are changed, rendering any parameter study computationally expensive. In addition, a proper statistical analysis of observations and comparison with such probabilistic models requires the joint probability distribution of the full spectrum instead of only samples. Note that parametrising this joint distribution is rendered difficult by the non-Gaussian statistics of the cosmic-ray fluxes. Here, we employ machine learning to compute the joint probability distribution of cosmic-ray electron fluxes. Specifically, we employ masked autoregressive density estimation (MADE) for a representation of the high-dimensional joint probability distribution. In a first step, we train the network on a Monte Carlo simulation for a fixed set of transport parameters, thus significantly accelerating the generation of samples. In a second step, we extend this setup to SECRET (Stochasticity Emulator for Cosmic Ray Electrons), allowing to reliably interpolate over the space of transport parameters. We make the MADE and SECRET codes available at https://git.rwth-aachen.de/pmertsch/secret .</description>

      <title>Rapid Spectral Evolution of SGR 1935+2154 During its 2022 Outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the 2022 outburst of SGR 1935+2154, a Fast-Radio-Burst-like event (FRB 20221014A) and X-ray activities occurred between two spin-up glitches, suggesting these glitches may connect to multiwavelength phenomenology. However, the mechanisms altering the magnetar's magnetosphere to enable radio emission remain unclear. This study presents high-cadence NICER and NuSTAR observations revealing spectral changes in burst and persistent emission. Hardness ratio and spectral analysis reveal significant changes during an "intermediate flare" 2.5 hours before FRB 20221014A. This 80-second flare, releasing $&gt;(6.3\pm0.2)\times10^{40}$ erg, coincides with a rapid spectral softening in both burst and persistent emission and a notable decrease in burst occurrence rate. The intermediate flare is bright enough to be detected if placed at a few Mpc, and would appear as a fast X-ray transient. This implies that the connection between magnetar X-ray activity and FRBs can be observed in the local Universe. Post-flare burst spectra peak near 5 keV, resembling the characteristics of the FRB-associated X-ray burst of 2020. Such change persisted for a few hours, implying magnetospheric evolution on similar timescales. However, no radio emission was detected from post-flare bursts, suggesting that FRB emission requires conditions beyond peculiar short bursts. The burst waiting times exhibit a broken power-law distribution, likely resulting from contamination by enhanced persistent emission. Although the bursts appear randomly distributed in the spin phase, the hardness ratio profile as a function of spin phase follows that of the persistent emission, indicating that X-ray bursts originate at low altitudes.</description>

      <title>Detectability of dark matter density distribution via gravitational waves from binary black holes in the Galactic center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental nature of dark matter (DM) remains unknown, with significant uncertainties in its density profile. DM environments surrounding massive binary black holes (BBHs) modify their orbital dynamics, thereby altering gravitational wave (GW) emissions. For BBH systems at the Galactic Center, dynamical friction induced by DM spikes could produce detectable deviations in GW spectra, potentially observable by future space-based detectors. To address the uncertainties in the Galactic Center's DM profile, we systematically examine two scenarios: the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White (gNFW) profile and its post-spike modification. We investigate the evolutionary effects of DM dynamical friction and accretion on the eccentricity and semi-latus rectum of secondary black holes (BHs) in elliptical orbits. By constructing orbital models with varying initial eccentricities across the mass-semi-latus rectum parameter space and utilizing 30 years of simulated pulsar timing array data from the Square Kilometer Array (SKA), we identify detectable parameter regimes of DM effects and employ these GW observational signatures to constrain different DM density profiles. Our analysis reveals that among gNFW profiles ($\gamma=2,1.5,1,0.5$), only $\gamma=2$ produces significant detectable signatures. The formation of DM spikes further enhances these observable waveform deviations for all gNFW slopes.</description>

      <title>Probing the detectability of electromagnetic signatures from Galactic isolated black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: A large number of isolated black holes (IBHs) are expected to populate the Galaxy. However, only one has been confirmed by the analysis of a microlensing event, and no confirmed emission detection from an IBH has been reported so far.
  Aims: We analysed the detectability of electromagnetic signatures from IBHs moving in the Galaxy. Methods: We considered accretion from the interstellar medium onto an IBH and assumed the formation of an outflow. We modelled the accretion process and the interaction of the outflow with the surrounding medium on large scales, including mechanical feedback on the accretion process. Furthermore, we also calculated the emission from three different regions: the accretion region, the radiation from the outflow medium interaction structure, and the emission of relativistic particles that diffuse in the surrounding medium.
  Results: Multiwavelength emission associated with Galactic IBHs can be detected in systems moving through a very dense medium. Thermal emission from accretion could be observed in the mid infrared and in hard X rays with current and forthcoming observatories. Thermal and non thermal emission from the outflow medium shock could also be detected in the radio and millimetre ranges. Moreover, detection of the emission from particles diffusing in a dense medium could be feasible in gamma rays. Applying our model to the IBH associated with the gravitational microlensing event MOA2011BLG191 OGLE2011BLG0462, we inferred that radio and infrared detection of the IBH is plausible. Also, we derived that IBHs could be modest Galactic cosmic ray contributors, potentially reaching a 1% contribution at 1 PeV. Finally, by extending our model to primordial black holes, we conclude that efficient leptonic acceleration in their outflow medium interactions would rule them out as a major dark matter component.</description>

      <title>On probing turbulence in core-collapse supernovae in upcoming neutrino detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino propagation through a turbulent medium can be highly non-adiabatic leading to distinct signatures in the survival probabilities. A core-collapse supernova can be host to a number of hydrodynamic instabilities which occur behind the shockfront. Such instabilities between the forward shock and a possible reverse shock can lead to cascades introducing turbulence in the associated matter profile, which can imprint itself in the neutrino signal. In this work, we consider realistic matter profiles and seed in the turbulence using a randomization scheme to study its effects on neutrino propagation in an effective two-flavor framework. We focus on the potential of upcoming neutrino detectors - DUNE and Hyper-Kamiokande to constrain the parameters characterizing turbulence in a supernova. We find that these experiments can effectively constrain the parameter space for the amplitude of the spectra, they will only have mild sensitivity to the spectral index, and cannot inform on deviations from the usual Kolmogorov $5/3$ inverse power law. Furthermore, we also confirm that the double-dip feature, originally predicted in the neutrino spectra associated with forward and reverse shocks, can be completely washed away in the presence of turbulence, leading to total flavor depolarization.</description>

      <title>Limits on Early Matter Domination from the Isotropic Gamma-Ray Background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18893v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In cosmologies with hidden sector dark matter, the lightest hidden sector species can come to dominate the energy budget of the universe and cause an early matter-dominated era (EMDE). EMDEs amplify the matter power spectrum on small scales, leading to dense, early-forming microhalos which massively boost the dark matter annihilation signal. We use the Fermi-LAT measurement of the isotropic gamma-ray background to place limits on the parameter space of hidden sector models with EMDEs. We calculate the amplified annihilation signal by sampling the properties of prompt cusps, which reside at the centers of these microhalos and dominate the signal on account of their steep $\rho\propto r^{-3/2}$ density profiles. We also include the portions of the parameter space affected by the gravitational heating that arises from the formation and subsequent destruction of nonlinear structure during the EMDE. We are able to rule out significant portions of the parameter space, particularly at high reheat temperatures. Long EMDEs remain poorly constrained despite large structure-induced boosts to the annihilation signal.</description>

      <title>The Mass of the Vela Pulsar Progenitor and the Age of the Vela-Puppis Complex</title>

Abstract: The association of the Vela Pulsar with the Vela Supernova Remnant has long supported the hypothesis that core-collapse supernovae yield neutron stars, but its surrounding stellar population now offers new insights into progenitor evolution. By age-dating stars within 150 pc of the Vela Pulsar, we infer properties of its progenitor. These stars belong to the Vela-Puppis complex, revealing the region's star formation history. While stellar population models with standard assumptions suggest a likely progenitor age and mass, these predictions are internally inconsistent with the observed population, indicating that something is missing in the standard modeling approach. With those assumptions, there is very weak support for a $\lesssim$10 Myr old population, moderate support for a 40 Myr old population, and strong support for an intermediate age population around 65-100 Myrs old. The $\lesssim$10 Myr signal hinges on two peculiar O stars, which are unlike any others in the Vela-Puppis complex and imply nearly three times more main sequence stars than are observed. The 40 Myr-old population is supported by 6 red supergiants (RSGs) and several Be stars; but this population is again marginally inconsistent with the observed distribution of main sequence stars. The red giant (RG) and MS distributions are consistent with a 65-100 Myr old population. We discuss several possible resolutions, emphasizing how binary evolution and/or very rapid rotation could resolve these discrepancies. Gaia parallaxes and {\it Stellar Ages} enable these results; {\it Stellar Ages} is a novel stellar population modeling algorithm that combines individual and population-level age inferences.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-Ray Cooling in Active Galactic Nuclei as a New Probe of Inelastic Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel way to probe inelastic dark matter using cosmic-ray (CR) cooling in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Dark matter (DM) in the vicinity of supermassive black holes may scatter off CRs, resulting in the rapid cooling of CRs for sufficiently large cross sections. This in turn can alter the high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray fluxes detected from these sources. We show that AGN cooling bounds obtained through the multimessenger data of NGC 1068 and TXS 0506+056 allow to reach unprecedently large mass splittings for inelastic DM ($\gtrsim$ TeV), orders of magnitude larger than those probed by direct detection experiments and DM capture in neutron stars. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cooling bounds from AGNs can probe thermal light DM with small mass splittings. This provides novel and complementary constraints in parts of a parameter space accessible solely by colliders and beam dump experiments.</description>

      <title>Sleeping Giants Arise: Monitoring the Return of Three Changing-Look Quasars to Their High States</title>

Abstract: Changing-look quasars challenge many models of the quasar central engine. Their extreme variability in both the continuum and broad emission-line fluxes on timescales on the order of years is difficult to explain. To investigate the cause of the observed transitions, we present new contemporaneous optical and X-ray observations of three faded changing-look quasars as they return to a state of high optical luminosity. Two of these three remained in a quiescent state for more than ten years before returning to a new high state. We find that before, during, and after transition, the spectral energy distributions of all three follow predictions for quasars based on X-ray binary outbursts, suggesting that the underlying mechanism is likely a changing accretion rate causing changes in the accretion flow structure. In two of the three cases, the transition between the initial high and low state and the transition between the low and new high state took nearly identical amounts of time, on the order of hundreds of days. This transition timescale is a useful constraint on models of the accretion state changes. The behavior of the broad line profiles suggests that the BLR structure is changing during the transition.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark-Matter Spikes and the Final-Parsec Problem: Bayesian constraints from the NANOGrav 15-Year Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A self-interacting dark-matter (SIDM) density spike around merging supermassive black holes (SMBHs) may be able to supply the dynamical friction needed to shrink binaries from $\sim 1\, \mathrm{pc}$ to $\sim 10^{-2} \,\mathrm{pc}$, thereby resolving the long-standing "final-parsec problem". Embedding the binary-halo system in a cosmological population model, we evolve the inspiral under the combined influence of gravitational-wave (GW) emission and SIDM drag, compute the resulting nanohertz GW background, and confront it with the NANOGrav 15 year pulsar-timing data. A six-parameter Bayesian analysis, performed with a Gaussian-process-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo, yields posterior constraints on the cross-section per unit mass and maximum circular velocity values that were consistent with independent galaxy-rotation and cluster-lensing limits. Within this parameter space, the SIDM spike remains intact, supplies sufficient friction to overcome the stellar depletion barrier, and produces a characteristic-strain spectrum that matches the NANOGrav signal as well as phenomenological astrophysical models.</description>
