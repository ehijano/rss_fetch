      <title>The Riemann Hypothesis in Oaxaca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An equivalence of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) enables a direct bridge to the Young lattice. In specific, the classical threshold $\lim_{n\to\infty} \sigma(n)/(n \log\log n) = e^{\gamma} \approx 1.78107$, derived from the asymptotic behavior of the sum-of-divisors function, can be realized combinatorially via limiting proportions associated to specific families of integer partitions.</description>

      <title>On Monogeneity of reciprocal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{Z}_K$ denote the ring of integers of the number field $K = \mathbb{Q}(\theta)$, where $\theta$ is a root of the monic irreducible polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$. We say that $f(x)$ is monogenic if $\mathbb{Z}_K = \mathbb{Z}[\theta]$. A polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}[x]$ is called reciprocal if $f(x) = x^{\operatorname{deg}(f)} f(1/x)$. In this article, we derive sufficient conditions for the monogeneity of even degree reciprocal polynomials. By employing properties of the discriminant of reciprocal polynomials, we partially prove a conjecture proposed by Jones in $2021$. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound on the number of certain sextic monogenic reciprocal polynomials.</description>

      <title>On the average number of representations of an integer as a sum of polynomials computed at prime values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the average number of representations of an integer $n$ as $n = \phi(n_{1}) + \dots + \phi(n_{j})$, for polynomials $\phi \in \mathbb{Z}[n]$ with $\partial\phi = k\ge 1$, $\operatorname{lead}(\phi) = 1$, $j \ge k$, where $n_{i}$ is a prime power for each $i \in \{1, \dots, j\}$. We extend the results of Languasco and Zaccagnini (2019), for $k=3$ and $j=4$, and of Cantarini, Gambini and Zaccagnini (2020), where they focused on monomials $\phi(n) = n^k$, $k\ge 2$ and $j=k, k + 1$.</description>

      <title>On the finiteness of prime trees and their relation to modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the prime trees associated with a finite subset $P$ of the set of all prime numbers, and provide conditions under which the tree is of finite type. Moreover, we compute the density of finite-type subsets $P$. As an application, we show that for weight $k \ge 2$ and levels $N = N'\prod_{p \in P} p^{a_p}$, where $N'$ is squarefree and $a_{p} \geq 2$, every cusp form $f \in \mathcal{S}_k(\Gamma_0(N))$ can be expressed as a linear combination of products of two specific Eisenstein series whenever $P$ is of finite type.</description>

      <title>Some series representing the zeta function for $\Re s&gt;1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present series converging to the Riemann zeta function in its half-plane of convergence, and possessing remainders whose sizes decrease geometrically. They are easy to implement numerically, using only polynomial and power functions, and are efficient for obtaining dozens or hundreds of digits (when the imaginary part is not too large). They may prove less suited to very high precision (tens of thousands of digits), due to a linear cost for each new term. One can express the coefficients as linear combinations of Bernoulli numbers, but this is not advantageous numerically. The method is a development of tools introduced by the author for the evaluation of harmonic series with restricted digits in a given radix.</description>

      <title>Geometric configuration of integrally closed Noetherian domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we completely describe the family of integrally closed Noetherian domains between $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ and $\mathbb{Q}[X]$. We accomplish this result by classifying the Krull domains between these two polynomial rings. To this end, we first describe the DVRs of $\mathbb{Q}(X)$ lying over $\mathbb{Z}_{(p)}$ for some prime $p \in \mathbb{Z}$, by distinguishing them according to whether the extension of the residue fields is algebraic or transcendental. We unify the known descriptions of such valuations by considering ultrametric balls in $\mathbb{C}_p$, the completion of the algebraic closure of the field $\mathbb{Q}_p$ of $p$-adic numbers. We then study when the intersection $R$ of such DVRs with $\mathbb{Q}[X]$ is of finite character, so that $R$ is a Krull domain, and we finally compute the divisor class group of $R$. It turns out that such a ring is formed by those polynomials which simultaneously map a finite union of ultrametric balls of $\mathbb{C}_p$ to its valuation domain $\mathbb{O}_p$, as $p\in\mathbb{Z}$ ranges through the set of primes. By a result of Heinzer, the Krull domains of this class are precisely the integrally closed Noetherian domains between $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ and $\mathbb{Q}[X]$. This novel approach provides a geometric understanding of this class of integrally closed domains. Furthermore, we also describe the UFDs between $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ and $\mathbb{Q}[X]$.</description>

      <title>Semi-Autonomous Mathematics Discovery with Gemini: A Case Study on the Erd\H{o}s Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22401v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a case study in semi-autonomous mathematics discovery, using Gemini to systematically evaluate 700 conjectures labeled 'Open' in Bloom's Erd\H{o}s Problems database. We employ a hybrid methodology: AI-driven natural language verification to narrow the search space, followed by human expert evaluation to gauge correctness and novelty. We address 13 problems that were marked 'Open' in the database: 5 through seemingly novel autonomous solutions, and 8 through identification of previous solutions in the existing literature. Our findings suggest that the 'Open' status of the problems was through obscurity rather than difficulty. We also identify and discuss issues arising in applying AI to math conjectures at scale, highlighting the difficulty of literature identification and the risk of ''subconscious plagiarism'' by AI. We reflect on the takeaways from AI-assisted efforts on the Erd\H{o}s Problems.</description>

      <title>Kernels of Arithmetic Jet Spaces and Frobenius Morphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any $\pi$-formal group scheme $G$, the Frobenius morphism between arithmetic jet spaces restricts to generalized kernels of the projection map. Using the functorial properties of such kernels of arithmetic jet spaces, we show that this morphism is indeed induced by a natural ring map between shifted $\pi$-typical Witt vectors.
  In the special case when $G = \hat{\mathbb{G}}_a$, the arithmetic jet space, as well as the generalized kernels are affine $\pi$-formal planes with Witt vector addition as the group law. In that case the above morphism is the multiplication by $\pi$ map on Witt vector schemes. In fact, the system of arithmetic jet spaces and generalized kernels of any $\pi$-formal group scheme $G$ along with their maps and identitites satisfied among them are a generalization of the case of the Witt vector scheme with the system of maps such as the Frobenius, Verschiebung and multiplication by $\pi$.</description>

      <title>Eigenweights for arithmetic Hirzebruch Proportionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23245v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior work of Feng--Yun--Zhang established a (Higher) Arithmetic Hirzebruch Proportionality Principle, expressing the arithmetic volumes of moduli stacks of shtukas in terms of differential operators applied to $L$-functions. This formula involves certain "eigenweights" which were calculated in simple cases by Feng--Yun--Zhang, but not in general. We document work of a (custom) AI Agent built upon Gemini Deep Think, which employs tools from algebraic combinatorics to connect these eigenweights to the representation theory of symmetric groups, and then determines them for all classical groups.</description>

      <title>The Partition-Frequency Enumeration Matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.04191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a calculus that gives an elementary approach to enumerate partition-like objects using an infinite upper-triangular number-theoretic matrix. We call this matrix the Partition-Frequency Enumeration (PFE) matrix. This matrix unifies a large number of results connecting number-theoretic functions to partition-type functions. The calculus is extended to arbitrary generating functions, and functions with Weierstrass products. As a by-product, we recover (and extend) some well-known recurrence relations for many number-theoretic functions, including the sum of divisors function, Ramanujan's $\tau$ function, sums of squares and triangular numbers, and for $\zeta(2n)$, where $n$ is a positive integer. These include classical results due to Euler, Ewell, Ramanujan, Lehmer and others. As one application, we embed Ramanujan's famous congruences $p(5n+4)\equiv 0$ (mod $5)$ and $\tau(5n+5)\equiv 0$ (mod $5)$ into an infinite family of such congruences.</description>

      <title>Amending the Lonely Runner Spectrum Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.10417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $||x||$ be the absolute distance from $x$ to the nearest integer. For a set of distinct positive integral speeds $v_1, \ldots, v_n$, we define its maximum loneliness, also known as the gap $\delta$, to be
  $$ML(v_1,\ldots,v_n) = \max_{t \in \mathbb{R}}\min_{1 \leq i \leq n} || tv_i||.$$
  The Loneliness Spectrum Conjecture, recently proposed by Kravitz (2021), asserts that
  $$\exists s \in \mathbb{N}, \text{ML}(v_1,\ldots,v_n) = \frac{s} {sn + 1} \text{ or } \text{ML}(v_1,\ldots,v_n) \geq \frac{1}{n}.
  $$
  We disprove the Loneliness Spectrum Conjecture for $n = 4$ with an infinite family of counterexamples and propose an alternative conjecture. We confirm the amended conjecture for $n = 4$ whenever there exists a pair of speeds with a common factor of at least $3$ and also prove some related results.</description>

      <title>Twisted periods of modular forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S_k$ denote the space of cusp forms of weight $k$ and level one. For $0\leq t\leq k-2$ and primitive Dirichlet character $\chi$ mod $D$, we introduce twisted periods $r_{t,\chi}$ on $S_k$. We show that for a fixed natural number $n$, if $k$ is sufficiently large relative to $n$ and $D$, then any $n$ periods with the same twist but different indices are linearly independent. We also prove that if $k$ is sufficiently large relative to $D$ then any $n$ periods with the same index but different twists mod $D$ are linearly independent. These results are achieved by studying the trace of the products and Rankin-Cohen brackets of Eisenstein series of level $D$ with nebentypus. Moreover, we give two applications of our method. First, we prove certain identities that evaluate convolution sums of twisted divisor functions. Second, we show that Maeda's conjecture implies a non-vanishing result on twisted central $L$-values of normalized Hecke eigenforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.10725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are several recent works where authors have shown that number fields $K$ with `sufficiently many' units and cyclic class group contain a Euclidean ideal class provided the Hilbert class field $H(K)$ is absolutely abelian. In this article, we explore the latter hypothesis: how often a number field $K$ has absolutely abelian Hilbert class field? For a number field $K$ to have absolutely abelian Hilbert class field, we obtain several criteria in terms of class number of $K$, P\'olya group of $K$, and genus number of $K$. We also show that for such number fields the $\ell-$torsion conjecture is true. Along with these, the article also reports some results on a theme to study class groups, developed by the authors, where primes of higher degree are used to study class groups.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution of polynomial sequences in function fields: resolution of a conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb F_q$ be the finite field of $q$ elements having characteristic $p$, and denote by $\mathbb K_\infty=\mathbb F_q((1/t))$ the field of formal Laurent series in $1/t$. We consider the equidistribution in $\mathbb T=\mathbb K_\infty/\mathbb F_q[t]$ of the values of polynomials $f(u)\in \mathbb K_\infty [u]$ as $u$ varies over $\mathbb F_q[t]$. Let $\mathcal K$ be a finite set of positive integers, and suppose that $\alpha_r\in \mathbb K_\infty$ for $r\in \mathcal K\cup \{0\}$. We show that the polynomial $\sum_{r\in \mathcal K\cup\{0\}}\alpha_ru^r$ is equidistributed in $\mathbb T$ whenever $\alpha_k$ is irrational for some $k\in \mathcal K$ satisfying $p\nmid k$, and also $p^vk\not\in \mathcal K$ for any positive integer $v$. This conclusion resolves in full a conjecture made jointly by the third, fourth and fifth authors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extending the works of Alladi and Sweeting and Woo, we state and prove the general higher order duality between prime ideals in number rings. We then use the second order duality to obtain the a new formula for the Chebotarev Density involving sums of the generalized M\"obius function and the prime ideal counting function. We also provide two estimates of such sums as an application of the duality identity. A discussion of the duality in a slightly more general setting is done at the end.</description>

      <title>On the Identification of Elliptic Curves That Admit Infinitely Many Twists Satisfying the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work of Burungale-Skinner-Tian-Wan established the first infinite families of quadratic twists of non-CM elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ for which the strong Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD) conjecture holds. Building on their results, we encode the required hypotheses into an explicit algorithm and apply it to the database of elliptic curves in the $L$-functions and Modular Forms Database (LMFDB), identifying all elliptic curves $E$ of conductor at most $500{,}000$ that admit infinitely many quadratic twists satisfying the strong BSD conjecture. Our computations provide certain numerical evidence for a conjecture of Radziwi{\l}{\l} and Soundararajan predicting Gaussian behavior in the analytic order of the Shafarevich-Tate group, while also observing a systematic positive bias within the BSD-satisfying subfamily.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of the d'Arcais Numbers at Small $k$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18599v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The d'Arcais numbers are the triangular array $\{A(2,n,k)\, :\, n=0,1,\dots,\, k=0,\dots,n\}$, such that $\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \sum_{k=0}^{n} A(2,n,k) x^k z^n/n! = ((z;z)_{\infty})^{-x}$. The infinite $q$-Pochhammer symbol is $(q;q)_{\infty} = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1-q^n)$. Holding $k$ fixed and considering large $n$, we note that the ratio $k! A(2,n,k)/n!$ is asymptotic to $C(k) \sigma_{2k-1}(n)/n^k$ where the divisor sum function is $\sigma_p(n) = \sum_{d|n} d^p$ and $C(k) = (\zeta(2))^k/(\Gamma(k) \zeta(2k))$. This is a slightly generalized version of one of Ramanujan's formulas from his paper, ``On Certain Arithmetical Functions," and it is an immediate consequence of the more recent article of Oliver, Shreshta and Thorne. Heim and Neuhauser made a conjecture, that $A(2,n,k)/A(2,n,k-1)$ is greater than or equal to $A(2,n,k+1)/A(2,n,k)$, for $k=2,3,\dots$ and all $n$. The conjecture is false for $k=2$, and it is true for $k=3,4,\dots$ when $n$ is sufficiently large. We consider the Hardy-Ramanujan circle method as a heuristic step.</description>

      <title>Explicit Construction of Maass Wave Forms and Their Petersson Inner Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explicitly construct Maass wave cusp forms associated to Hecke characters on arbitrary real quadratic fields. This result is a generalization of Maass (1949), who constructed Maass wave cusp forms under the assumption that narrow class number is one. We also compute its Petersson inner product explicitly and give a few examples involving dihedral Artin representation.</description>

      <title>Ramification theory from homotopical point of view, I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the compatibility of pushforward along a proper morphism of an \'{e}tale constructible sheaf and the pushforward of its characteristic cycle up to $p$-torsion. This was conjectured by Takeshi Saito. For this, we revisit the construction of the characteristic cycle, due to Saito and Beilinson, from more homotopical point of view. In particular, the language of $\infty$-categories is indispensable to carry this out.</description>

      <title>Cyclotomic Factors and LRS-Degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08751v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present three new, practical algorithms for polynomials in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$: one to test if a polynomial is cyclotomic, one to determine which cyclotomic polynomials are factors, and one to determine whether the given polynomial is LRS-degenerate. A polynomial is "LRS-degenerate" iff it has two distinct roots $\alpha, \beta$ such that $\beta = \zeta \alpha$ for some root of unity $\zeta$. All three algorithms are based on "intelligent brute force". The first two produce the indexes of the cyclotomic polynomials; the third produces a list of degeneracy orders. The algorithms are implemented in CoCoALib.</description>

      <title>A Note on the Sum-Product Problem and the Convex Sumset Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a new exponent for the Sum-Product conjecture on $\mathbb{R} $. Namely for $A \subset \mathbb{R}$ finite, \[
  \max \left\{ \left\lvert A+A \right\rvert , \left\lvert AA \right\rvert \right\} \gg_{\epsilon} \left\lvert A \right\rvert ^{\frac{4}{3} + \frac{10}{4407} - \epsilon} .\] We also provide new exponents for $A \subset \mathbb{R} $ finite and convex, namely \[
  \left\lvert A+A \right\rvert \gg_{\epsilon} \left\lvert A \right\rvert ^{\frac{46}{29} - \epsilon}, \] and \[
  \left\lvert A-A \right\rvert \gg_{\epsilon} \left\lvert A \right\rvert ^{\frac{8}{5} + \frac{1}{3440} -\epsilon} .\]</description>

      <title>The sum-product problem for small sets II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish that every set of $k=10$ natural numbers determines at least $30$ distinct pairwise sums or at least $30$ distinct pairwise products, as well as the analogous result for $k=11$ and at least $34$ sums/products, with sharpness exhibited by $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18\}$ and $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24\}$, respectively. This extends previous work of the fifth author with Clevenger, Havard, Heard, Lott, and Wilson, which established the corresponding thresholds for $k\leq 9$. Included is a classification result for sets of $10$ real numbers (resp. positive real numbers) determining at most $29$ pairwise sums (resp. pairwise products) that do not contain $8$ elements of any single arithmetic progression (resp. geometric progression), as well as some observations controlling additive quadruples in small subsets of two-dimensional generalized geometric progressions.</description>
