      <title>Non-closed scalar charge in 4-dimensional Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet black hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a covariant differential-form framework to define scalar charges for stationary, asymptotically flat black holes in $4$--dimensional Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a general scalar coupling function. Contracting the scalar field equation of motion with the horizon generator $k$ yields a non-closed-form scalar charge, revealing a bulk contribution encoded in a $3$--form, which measures the obstruction to its closedness. In the presence of shift-symmetry, this obstruction vanishes and the $2$--form scalar charge satisfies a Gauss law, depending solely on boundary data. Geometrically, this reproduces known topological results in the shift-symmetric limit. This framework allows us to analyze the role of the non-closed scalar charges in black hole thermodynamics through the Smarr formula for more general couplings and provide a covariant, charge-based interpretation of the spontaneous scalarization mechanism, showing how the behavior of the scalar charge and the bulk term capture the instability of scalar-free black holes and the emergence of scalar hair. Our results offer a unified geometric understanding of the role of scalar charges and the mechanism of spontaneous scalarization in Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity.</description>

      <title>Broken Weyl Gravity: Dynamical Torsion and Generalized Proca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a symmetry-based construction of gravity from a phase in which Weyl invariance is spontaneously broken. Using the coset formalism, the dilaton acts as a Stuckelberg field for the gauged scale symmetry, giving the Weyl gauge field a mass of order $\mathcal{O}(M_{\rm Pl})$. The resulting gauge-gravity interactions fall within the ghost-free generalized Proca framework. We further show that the Weyl field can be exchanged for a propagating vector component of torsion, providing a natural realization of dynamical vector torsion. Our construction organizes all operators systematically, clarifies the absence of Wess-Zumino terms in $d=4$, and recovers General Relativity in the infrared with controlled higher-derivative corrections.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Particle on Light-Front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Wigner's classification of massive one particle state in a general moving frame in the front form of Lorentz group, characterized and labeled by a special null vector -- reference vector. The little group transformation turns out to be equivalent to a change of reference vector, which also gives a concrete formula to compute the Wigner D-matrices with a general momentum. The little group transformation and Wigner D-matrices have both continuous zero momentum limit and infinite boost (massless) limit, a property that can be called massive-massless continuation. We then apply those results to massive spin-1 particle and compute the corresponding Wigner D-matrices. The resulting polarization vectors are equivalent to those in spinor-helicity formalism. In the massless limit, it is shown that longitudinal polarization decouples from the spectrum. The $\epsilon^\mu_\pm \rightarrow \epsilon^\mu_\pm +\xi k^\mu$ shift turns out to be remnant of this decoupling, with $\xi$ computable from the Wigner D-matrix. Thus in our construction, massless spin-1 particle can be defined as the infinite boost limit of massive spin-1 particle. Our results also give us a deeper understanding of gauge symmetry: it can be understood as the equivalence between obtaining the massless limit for polarization vectors through different reference vectors.</description>

      <title>Massive Gauge Theories from Consistency Conditions of Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the general principles of Lorentz symmetry and unitary, we introduce two consistency conditions -- on-shell gauge symmetry and strong massive-massless continuation -- in constructing amplitudes of massive gauge theory with elementary particles. In particular we argue on-shell gauge symmtry can be understood as a consequence of Lorentz symmetry, through mixture of a spin-1 block ands a spin-0 block with degnerate mass spectrum. Based on the two conditions, combined with the little group transformation and consistent factorization, we construct 3-point and 4-point vector boson/scalar amplitudes, then analyze the underlying physical models. Given the particle masses, almost all possible vertices, including those involving Goldstone modes, are uniquely fixed. The only exceptions are triple and quartic scalar self-couplings. In addition, all particle masses must have the same physical origin. If the number of vector bosons smaller than 3, the underlying theories for the amplitudes are either massive gauge theories with spontaneous symmetry breaking (S.S.B) or Stueckelberg theory. The necessary condition for the latter is that the scalars have equal masses. We also discuss different models depending on the number of scalars involved. If the number of vector bosons larger than 3, the underlying theory must be Yang-Mills theory with S.S.B. In both abelian and non-abelian cases, the specific shape of Higgs potential cannot be determined, which explains the fact that scalar self-couuplings are undetermined, and the relations between the masses are generally not linear.</description>

      <title>Quantization of charged fields in the presence of intense electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis applies techniques from quantum field theory in curved spacetimes to study particle creation in external fields, focusing on the Schwinger effect (i.e., the production of particle-antiparticle pairs by intense electric fields). Although experimental verification remains out of reach, theoretical analysis advances our understanding of this phenomenon and its broader implications.
  The work develops the theoretical framework for quantizing charged fields in nontrivial backgrounds, addressing the ambiguities in defining the quantum vacuum and extending the concept of states of low energy from cosmology to the Schwinger setting. It examines how different quantizations allow for unitary time evolution, and generalizes the quantum Vlasov equation to encompass a wider range of schemes. An operational perspective reveals that quantum ambiguities have genuine physical meaning, being linked to different modes of interaction and measurement. The study also analyzes dynamical transitions between static regimes and their impact on observables, with applications to analog cosmological expansion in Bose-Einstein condensates and the Schwinger effect itself. In the context of black holes, the thesis shows that the Schwinger effect prevents the formation of black holes from light under current conditions and investigates fermionic charge superradiance, demonstrating how quantum effects lead to black-hole discharge (a process without classical analogue).
  Overall, the thesis underscores the fundamental role of external electromagnetic and gravitational fields in defining particles and vacua, revealing the limits of flat-spacetime intuition and identifying purely quantum phenomena with implications for black-hole physics. It contributes to bridging the conceptual gap between general relativity and quantum field theory and offers new tools toward a consistent quantum description of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Localizing the Ising CFT from the ground state of the Ising model on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We locate the phase-transition line for the Ising model on the fuzzy sphere from a finite-size scaling analysis of its ground-state energy. This is similar to what was used to locate the complex CFT of the 5-state Potts model in dimension $d=2$ [PRL 133 (2024) 077101]. There it was shown that a CFT is characterized by a stationarity condition for the measured effective central charge. Our strategy is to write the ground-state energy as $E_{\rm GS}(N)/N_m = E_{0} + E_1 /N_m + E_{3/2}/N_m^{3/2}+ ...$, and to search for a minimum of $ E_{3/2}/E_0$ as a function of the couplings. This procedure finds the critical curve of [PRX 13 (2023) 021009] with good precision, and their sweet spot as well. We find similar results when normalizing by the gap to the stress tensor tensor $T$ or first parity-odd operator $\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Unveiling dynamical quantum error correcting codes via non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical stabilizer codes (DSCs) have recently emerged as a powerful generalization of static stabilizer codes for quantum error correction, replacing a fixed stabilizer group with a sequence of non-commuting measurements. This dynamical structure unlocks new possibilities for fault tolerance but also introduces new challenges, as errors must now be tracked across both space and time. In this work, we provide a physical and topological understanding of DSCs by establishing a correspondence between qudit Pauli measurements and non-invertible symmetries in 4+1-dimensional 2-form gauge theories. Sequences of measurements in a DSC are mapped to a fusion of the operators implementing these non-invertible symmetries. We show that the error detectors of a DSC correspond to endable surface operators in the gauge theory, whose endpoints define line operators, and that detectable errors are precisely those surface operators that braid non-trivially with these lines. Finally, we demonstrate how this framework naturally recovers the spacetime stabilizer code associated with a DSC.</description>

      <title>Yukawa interactions in Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first complete next-to-leading-order analysis of a Yukawa system within the framework of asymptotically safe quantum gravity. Our results are obtained through a systematic resummation of higher-order operators, revealing two distinct resummation mechanisms -- one of which has not been explored previously. In addition, we introduce a novel approach to estimate systematic uncertainties by simulating the impact of neglected higher-order contributions.
  We demonstrate that quantum gravity fluctuations anti-screen Yukawa interactions, thereby resolving previously inconclusive leading-order results. This anti-screening mechanism enables the generation of finite interactions from an asymptotically free Yukawa fixed point. Consequently, our findings provide strong evidence that non-vanishing Yukawa couplings are compatible with asymptotically safe quantum gravity, which is a necessary requirement for the Standard Model to emerge from an asymptotically safe ultraviolet completion.</description>

      <title>Bardeen black hole chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01104</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.01104v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper we try to connect the Bardeen black hole with the concept of the recently proposed black hole chemistry. We study thermodynamic properties of the regular black hole with an anti-deSitter background. The negative cosmological constant $\Lambda$ plays the role of the positive thermodynamic pressure of the system. After studying the thermodynamic variables, we derive the corresponding equation of state and we show that a neutral Bardeen-anti-deSitter black hole has similar phenomenology to the chemical Van der Waals fluid. This is equivalent to saying that the system exhibits criticality and a first order small/large black hole phase transition reminiscent of the liquid/gas coexistence.</description>

      <title>Gauge Dependence of Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves from Isocurvature Perturbations: Analytical Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analytically study the gauge dependence of scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) sourced by primordial isocurvature perturbations during radiation domination (RD), working across nine gauges. Through analytical integrations of the kernels supported by graphical comparison we identify a clear dichotomy. We find that in some gauges viz. the uniform-density (UD), total-matter (TM), uniform-curvature (UC), comoving-orthogonal (CO) and transverse-traceless (TT) gauges the energy density grows polynomially in conformal time $\eta^n$, where $n$ varies from $2$ to $8$. While in rest of the gauges viz. the longitudinal (Long.), uniform-expansion (UE), Newtonian-motion (Nm), and N-body (Nb) gauges the late-time energy spectrum converges, and SIGWs behave as radiation. For subhorizon modes ($ k\eta \gg 1 $), the divergence becomes severe, showing that SIGWs are gauge-dependent observables in this regime. We resolve it through a kernel projection that isolates the luminal, freely propagating gravitational wave components (oscillating as $\sin(k\eta)$ and $\cos(k\eta)$), eliminating spurious contributions. The resulting kernel decays as $ (k\eta)^{-1} $ and yields a finite, gauge-independent late-time spectrum, confirming that only luminal modes represent physical SIGWs.</description>

      <title>Emission of Nambu-Goldstone bosons from the semilocal string network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semilocal cosmic string is a line-like non-topological soliton associated with the breakdown of the $SU(2)_{\rm global} \times U(1)_{\rm gauge}$ symmetry to the $U(1)_{\rm global}$ symmetry. The broken phase has two massless Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes as dynamical fields, and they can be emitted by semilocal strings. In this paper, we numerically show that such NG bosons are copiously produced with the evolution of the semilocal string network in the early universe. Our numerical analysis shows that the spectrum of produced particles has a peak at low momenta corresponding to the horizon scale. If the emitted NG bosons acquire mass due to soft-breaking terms, they can take the role of dark matter. This scenario typically predicts very light pseudo NG boson dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractional quantum dynamics provides a natural framework to capture nonlocal temporal behavior and memory effects in quantum systems. In this work, we analyze the physical consequences of fractional-order quantum evolution using a Green's function formulation based on the Caputo fractional derivative. Explicit iterative expressions for the evolved state are derived and applied to an extended two-level Rabi model, a paradigmatic setting for coherent quantum control. We find that even in the absence of external driving, the static Hamiltonian term induces non-trivial spin dynamics with damping features directly linked to the fractional temporal nonlocality. When a periodically varying driving field is introduced, the competition between energy injection and memory effects gives rise to a richer dynamical behavior, manifest in the evolution of spin polarization, autocorrelation function, and fidelity. Unlike the standard Rabi oscillations characterized by a fixed frequency, the fractional regime introduces controllable damping and dephasing governed by the degree of fractionality. These distinctive signatures could be observable through the Loschmidt echo and autocorrelation function, and would offer potential routes to probe fractional quantum dynamics experimentally. Our findings open pathways toward exploring memory-induced dynamical phenomena in other systems effectively described by a two-level approximation, such as graphene-like materials and topological SSH chains, where non-integer order evolution may reveal novel topological or relaxation effects.</description>

      <title>The charge-singlet measurement toolbox</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to physical laws across different scales$\unicode{x2014}$from spacetime structure in general relativity to particle interactions in quantum field theory. Local symmetries, described by gauge theories, are central to phenomena such as superconductivity, topological phases, and the Standard Model of particle physics. Emerging simulation techniques using tensor network states or quantum computers offer exciting new possibilities of exploring the physics of these gauge theories, but require careful implementation of gauge symmetry and charge-neutrality constraints. This is especially challenging for non-Abelian gauge theories such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which governs the strong interaction between quarks and gluons. In a recent article (arXiv:2501.00579), we introduced "charge-singlet measurements" for quantum simulations, consisting of a projection based technique from group representation theory that allowed us to probe for the first time the phase diagram of (1+1)-dimensional QCD on a quantum computer. In this article, we show more broadly how to apply charge-singlet measurements as a flexible tool for both classical and quantum simulations of discrete and continuous gauge theories. Our approach extends the use of charge-singlet measurements beyond state preparation in the charge neutral (charge-singlet) sector to include noise mitigation in symmetry-preserving time-evolution circuits. We further demonstrate how this method enables the computation of thermodynamic observables$\unicode{x2014}$such as entropy$\unicode{x2014}$within the charge-singlet subspace, providing a new tool for exploring the connection between quantum thermodynamics and gauge symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbative partial-wave amplitudes diverge in cases with a massless exchanged particle in the $t$-channel. We argue that the divergence is an artifact of perturbation theory and give a prescription for the all-orders correction factor that renders the partial waves finite. As an example, we apply this to longitudinal $W^+W^-$ elastic scattering, for which there is a photon exchange $t$-channel contribution, and derive improved quasi-perturbative unitarity bounds on the mass of the Higgs. The method is also useful for $t$-channel exchange of very light particles.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Simulations of Sphaleron Dynamics at Colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sphaleron dynamics in the Standard Model at high-energy particle collisions remains experimentally unobserved, with theoretical predictions hindered by its nonperturbative real-time nature. In this work, we investigate a quantum simulation approach to this challenge. Taking the $1+1$D $O(3)$ model as a protocol towards studying dynamics of sphaleron in the electroweak theory, we identify the sphaleron configuration and establish lattice parameters that reproduce continuum sphaleron energies with controlled precision. We then develop quantum algorithms to simulate sphaleron evolutions where quantum effects can be included. This work lays the ground to establish quantum simulations for studying the interaction between classical topological objects and particles in the quantum field theory that are usually inaccessible to classical methods and computations.</description>

      <title>Hubble Constant and Mass Determination of Centaurus A and M83 from TGRB Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An independent determination of the Hubble constant is crucial in light of the persistent tension between early- and late-Universe measurements. In this study, we analyze the dynamics of the Centaurus A (CenA) and M83 galaxies, along with their associated dwarf companions identified via Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) distance measurements, to constrain both the group mass and the local value of $H_0$. By examining the motions of these galaxies relative to the system's barycenter, we apply both the minor and major infall models, which provide bounds on the true radial velocity dispersion. Averaging these approaches, we obtain a virial mass estimate of $(11 \pm 2) \times 10^{12}\, M_{\odot}$ and a Hubble flow-based mass of $(2.6 \pm 1.1) \times 10^{12}\, M_{\odot}$. Modeling the cold Hubble flow around the group center of mass, we derive a corresponding value of the Hubble constant as $68 \pm 5~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. These results offer an independent, dynamically motivated constraint on the local value of $H_0$, explicitly accounting for the impact of peculiar velocities in the nearby Universe. We also discuss the mild tension between the virial and Hubble flow-based mass estimates, which likely arises from the fact that M83 is close to the velocity surface and breaks the Hubble flow model assumptions. While the Hubble flow fit emphasizes galaxies that follow smooth expansion on the lower branch of the velocity-distance relation, the virial estimate includes the broader spread of bound galaxies near the group core, which seems to fit better for the CenA/M83 total mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the only smooth, Ricci flat, ALE instanton with a toric Hermitian non-K\"ahler structure is the Eguchi-Hanson instanton. The proof is analogous to the classification of toric Hermitian ALF instantons by Biquard and Gauduchon, although we avoid the use of toric K\"ahler geometry and instead perform a direct global analysis of the Tod form of the metric in Weyl-Papapetrou coordinates. This supports a conjecture by Gibbons and Bando-Kasue-Nakajima which states that any Ricci flat ALE instanton is self-dual.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dark matter (DM) production from evaporation of regular primordial black holes (RPBHs). While there are many available metrics that describe singularity-free RPBHs, we focus on the Hayward metric and the Simpson-Visser metric for illustrative purpose. The framework can be applied straightforwardly to other metrics. RPBHs generally have different Hawking temperature and therefore different lifetime from the standard singular black holes. The resulting modified cosmological constraints for this DM production mechanism and the allowed parameter space to obtain the correct DM abundance are calculated.</description>

      <title>The two-mass contributions to the three-loop massive operator matrix elements $\tilde{A}_{Qg}^{(3)}$ and $\Delta \tilde{A}_{Qg}^{(3)}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the two-mass three-loop contributions to the unpolarized and polarized massive operator matrix elements $\tilde{A}_{Qg}^{(3)}$ and $\Delta \tilde{A}_{Qg}^{(3)}$ in $x$-space for a general mass ratio by using a semi-analytic approach. We also compute Mellin moments up to $N = 2000 (3000)$ by an independent method, to which we compare the results in $x$-space. In the polarized case, we work in the Larin scheme. We present numerical results. The two-mass contributions amount to about $50 \%$ of the full \textcolor{blue}{$O(T_F^2)$} and \textcolor{blue}{$O(T_F^3)$} terms contributing to the operator matrix elements. The present result completes the calculation of all unpolarized and polarized massive three-loop operator matrix elements.</description>

      <title>Particle creation in a cosmological background in analogy to the Schwinger effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a gravitational analogue of the Schwinger effect in a cosmological context. While the Schwinger effect is usually attributed to a static electric background, its derivation is actually based on a switching on/off of the electric field in the infinite past/future. Motivated by this, and our previous work on particle production in a gravitational background, we consider a long pulse of the gravitational field in an FLRW-spacetime, thus simulating a static background. We rigorously derive particle production by a novel application of the Heun equation. In fact, the recently obtained connecting formulas between its local solutions can be used to determine the Bogolyubov coefficients, and subsequently the particle production probabilities, in the limit of an infinitely long pulse.
  The particle production in the FLRW-model is found to have a lower threshold on the outgoing frequencies, which can be related to the duration of the time interval of the switching on/off the background field. For large frequencies and in the spatially flat case, we find black-body radiation whose temperature is inversely proportional to the radius of the apparent horizon that appears in the FLRW-model during the phase of scale change.
  We compare our findings to Schwinger's result on particle production for a long pulse of an electromagnetic background field, for which we also include a detailed derivation.</description>

      <title>Theoretical filters for shift-symmetric Horndeski gravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of nontrivial maximally symmetric vacua and compact-object solutions in shift-symmetric scalar-tensor theories. Focusing on Horndeski gravity, we derive consistency conditions directly from the field equations to identify the subclasses that admit Minkowski and de Sitter vacua with a nontrivial scalar field. In doing so, we obtain a filtering mechanism that operates independently of observational data. In this context, we introduce the notion of stealth vacua, where the scalar field remains active without altering the vacuum. Following this, we examine the theoretical framework of Horndeski theories that admit homogeneous geometries and we extract the implicit form of the solution pertaining to the entire family of theories. Building upon these frameworks, we construct exact solutions in beyond-Horndeski gravity by applying a linear disformal transformation to the regularized Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet black hole. This procedure yields solitonic spacetimes with scalar hair as well as black holes carrying primary scalar hair, demonstrating how disformal maps can qualitatively modify solution properties. We delineate the parameter space in which the transformation is well-defined and analyze the solutions. Our results provide both a principled criterion for selecting viable Horndeski models and a framework for exploring rich solution spaces in beyond-Horndeski gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1911.11605v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the metric-affine formulation of bumblebee gravity, derive the field equations, and show that the connection can be written as Levi-Civita of a disformally related metric in which the bumblebee field determines the disformal part. As a consequence, the bumblebee field gets coupled to all the other matter fields present in the theory, potentially leading to nontrivial phenomenological effects. To explore this issue we compute the weak-field, post-Minkowskian limit and study the resulting effective theory. In this scenario, we couple scalar and spinorial matter to the effective metric, and then we explore the physical properties of the VEV of the bumblebee field, focusing mainly on the dispersion relations and the stability of the resulting effective theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.02445v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The involutory subalgebra K(E$_9$) of the affine Kac-Moody algebra E$_9$ was recently shown to admit an infinite sequence of unfaithful representations of ever increasing dimensions arXiv:2102.00870. We revisit these representations and describe their associated ideals in more detail, with particular emphasis on two chiral versions that can be constructed for each such representation. For every such unfaithful representation we show that the action of K(E$_9$) decomposes into a direct sum of two mutually commuting (`chiral' and `anti-chiral') parabolic algebras with Levi subalgebra $\mathfrak{so}(16)_+\,\oplus\,\mathfrak{so}(16)_-$. We also spell out the consistency conditions for uplifting such representations to unfaithful representations of K(E$_{10}$). From these results it is evident that the holonomy groups so far discussed in the literature are mere shadows (in a Platonic sense) of a much larger structure.</description>

      <title>Cutkosky rules and 1-loop $\kappa$-deformed amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the Cutkosky cutting rules are still valid term by term in the expansion in powers of $\kappa$ of the $\kappa$-deformed 1-loop correction to the propagator. We first present a general argument which relates each term in the expansion to a non-deformed amplitude containing additional propagators with mass $M&gt;\kappa$. We then show the same thing more pragmatically, by reducing the singularity structure of the coefficients in the expansion of the $\kappa$-deformed amplitude, to the singularity structure of non-deformed loop amplitudes, by using algebraic and analytic identities. We will explicitly show this up to second order in $1/\kappa$, but the technique can be generalized to higher orders in $1/\kappa$. Both the abstract and the more direct approach easily generalize to different deformed theories. We will then compute the full imaginary part of the $\kappa$-deformed 1-loop correction to the propagator in a specific model, up to second order in the expansion in $1/\kappa$, highlighting the usefulness of the approach for the phenomenology of deformed models. This explicitly confirms previous qualitative arguments concerning the behaviour of the decay width of unstable particles in the considered model.</description>

      <title>Holography of dislocations and ring defects in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet AdS gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study torsional topological defects in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in ($4+1$)-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime. In the holographic interpretation, these correspond to crystalline dislocation defects associated with the discrete lattice translational symmetry. The Gauss-Bonnet coupling is fixed at the Chern-Simons point. By solving the equations of motion through an asymptotic expansion near the boundary, we show that the dual ($3+1$)-dimensional theory admits axially symmetric solutions. These solutions describe holographic materials with dislocation defects at finite temperature, encoded by a black hole in the bulk. At the same time, they feature ring-shaped defects arising from the background Riemann-Cartan geometry, characterized by nontrivial Burgers vectors. We also discuss the possible appearance of an odd-parity Abelian holographic anomaly, proportional to the Nieh-Yan invariant. Our results motivate further studies of holographic defects using bulk gravitational theories and support the view that torsion provides a holographic counterpart of crystalline dislocation defects.</description>

      <title>A Family of Vertex Algebras from Argyres-Douglas Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that multiple vertex algebras can arise from a single 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theory (SCFT). The connection is given by the BPS monodromy operator $M$, which is a wall-crossing invariant quantity that captures the BPS spectrum on the Coulomb branch. For a class of low-rank Argyres-Douglas theories, we find that the trace of the multiple powers of the monodromy operator $\mathrm{Tr} M^N$ yield modular functions that can be identified with the vacuum characters of certain vertex algebra for each $N$. In particular, we realize unitary VOAs of the Deligne-Cvitanovi\'c exceptional series type $(A_2)_1$, $(G_2)_1$, $(D_4)_1$, $(F_4)_1$, $(E_6)_1$ from Argyres-Douglas theories. We also find the modular invariant characters of the `intermediate vertex algebras' $(E_{7\frac{1}{2}})_1$ and $(X_1)_1$. Our analysis allows us to construct 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories that flow to $\mathcal{N}=4$ SCFTs in the IR, whose specialized half-index can be identified with these modular invariant characters.</description>

      <title>What is a photon in de Sitter spacetime?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00761v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The states of a single photon in four-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime form a Unitary Irreducible Representation (UIR) of SO(1,4), which we call the photon UIR. While in flat spacetime photons are intimately tied to gauge symmetry, we demonstrate that in de Sitter, photon states emerge generically in any quantum field theory, even without an underlying U(1) gauge field. We derive a K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation for antisymmetric tensor two-point functions and show that numerous composite operators constructed from massive free fields can create states in the photon UIR. Remarkably, we find that some of these operators exhibit two-point functions with slower late-time and large-distance decay than the electromagnetic field strength itself, challenging the conventional notion that photons dominate the infrared regime. Using our spectral representation, we establish non-perturbative bounds on the late-time behavior of electric and magnetic fields in de Sitter, with potential implications for primordial magnetogenesis. Through one-loop calculations, we demonstrate that both the creation of photon states and the enhanced late-time large-distance behavior persist in weakly interacting theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of a scalar field in de Sitter spacetime can be regarded as a non-perturbative diffusion process, to which exact distribution and correlation functions are constructed by utilising the correspondence between diffusion and Schr\"{o}dinger equations. The Krein--Adler transformation of the quantum harmonic oscillator deletes several pairs of the energy levels to define anharmonic oscillators that we dub quantum deficient oscillators, based on which this article constructs a new class of exact solutions in stochastic inflation. In addition to the simplest single-well model, an exactly solvable double-well model is also presented. The results are further extended to exactly solvable models with multiple wells, allowing analytical studies on various cosmological phenomenologies.</description>

      <title>1-loop renormalisability of integrable sigma-models from 4d Chern-Simons theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large families of integrable 2d sigma-models have been constructed at the classical level, partly motivated by the utility of integrability on the string worldsheet. It is natural to ask whether these theories are renormalisable at the quantum level, and whether they define quantum integrable field theories. By considering examples, a folk theorem has emerged: the classically integrable sigma-models always turn out to be renormalisable, at least at 1-loop order. We prove this theorem for a large class of models engineered on surface defects in the 4d Chern-Simons theory by Costello and Yamazaki. We derive the flow of the 'twist 1-form' (a 4d coupling constant that distinguishes different 2d models), proving earlier conjectures and extending previous results. Our approach is general, using the 'universal' form of 2d integrable models' UV divergences in terms of their Lax connection and reinterpreting the result in the language of 4d Chern-Simons. These results apply equally to rational, trigonometric and elliptic models.</description>

      <title>The Yang-Baxter integrability of the critical Ising chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the one dimensional, critical transverse field Ising model is Yang-Baxter integrable. This is done by constructing commuting transfer matrices built out of a $R$-matrix satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation with additive spectral parameters. The $R$-matrix is non-local, as it is expressed in terms of Majorana fermions. It is also non-regular. Nevertheless, we show that the quantum inverse scattering method can still be suitably adapted. We then recursively obtain the conserved quantities [in the infinite volume] by the boost operator method. Remarkably, among the conserved charges we also find the Kramers-Wannier duality and other non-invertible symmetries for the periodic transverse field Ising model.</description>

Abstract: We consider the four-dimensional action of spinors minimally coupled to a $U(1)$-gauge field in an Riemann-Cartan background. In this theory, we integrate over the spinors and study the resulting one-loop gauge-gravity effective action, paying special attention to the contributions that depend on both the gauge field and the torsion. We explicitly calculate the gauge-torsion term, which turns out to be finite, and comment on possible terms depending simultaneously on torsion, curvature, and gauge field.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear realisation approach to extended supergravity theories in three dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We elaborate on the nonlinear realisation approach to spontaneously broken supergravity in three dimensions presented in arXiv:2304.09506. Using this approach we provide a novel derivation of $\mathcal{N}$-extended supergravity, with and without a cosmological term. It corresponds to a St\"uckelberg-type extension of the following theories: (i) the $(p,q)$ anti-de Sitter (AdS) supergravity theories with $p+q=\mathcal{N}$, $p\geq q\geq 0$ proposed by Ach\'ucarro and Townsend; and (ii) the $\mathcal{N}$-extended Poincar\'e supergravity of Marcus and Schwarz. We also apply the approach to obtain a St\"uckelberg reformulation of the supersymmetric Lorentz Chern-Simons action for arbitrary $\mathcal{N}$. In our construction, the pure supergravity actions (Poincar\'e and AdS) share the invariance under two different local $\mathcal{N}$-extended supersymmetries. One of them acts on the Goldstini, while the other supersymmetry leaves the Goldstini inert. The $\mathcal{N}$-extended supersymmetric Lorentz Chern-Simons action proposed in our setting shares the former supersymmetry, but differs in the one that leaves the Goldstini inert. The supersymmetry that acts on the Goldstini can be used to gauge them away, and then the resulting actions coincide with that given in the literature.</description>

      <title>Massive Spinning Fields During Inflation: Feynman rules and correlator comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the dynamics of massive spinning fields during inflation and the resulting signatures in the cosmological correlators of inflaton perturbations computed in the Poincar\'e patch of de Sitter space. There are (at least) two ways to describe the fluctuations of such new spinning degrees of freedom and these are distinguished by the symmetries of the de Sitter group that they linearly realise. The primary question we ask is: do these two set-ups yield distinct signatures in cosmological observables? After systematically deriving the Feynman rules for exchange diagrams consisting of massive spinning fields, where we discover the necessity of effective propagators that augment the naive Schwinger-Keldysh ones by delta functions corresponding to instantaneous propagation, we show that the two set-ups are indistinguishable at the level of the inflaton bispectrum but distinguishable at the level of the trispectrum and other higher-point correlation functions. The bispectrum is special since in the corresponding tree-level Feynman diagrams, only the helicity-zero modes of the spinning fields can propagate. The bispectrum correspondence holds up to the addition of contact diagrams arising from the self-interactions of the inflaton, and is consistent with the symmetries of the effective field theory of inflation. Our results suggest that the cosmological collider signals in the bispectrum are universal and do not depend on the detailed description of the massive spinning field.</description>

      <title>Degenerate kinks and kink-instantons in two-dimensional scalar field models with $\mathcal{N}=1$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models with classically degenerate vacua often support quasiclassical configurations of nontrivial topology. In (0+1)-dimensional quantum mechanics with a double-well potential, for example, instantons induce mixing between the two perturbative ground states in the purely bosonic case, while in the supersymmetric version, the tunneling amplitude is suppressed.
  In this work, we investigate (1+1)-dimensional models featuring classically Bogomol'nyi-Prasad-Sommerfield saturated kinks with degenerate masses and identical topology. Recent studies suggest that such kinks may undergo mixing mediated by scalar-field instantons. We analyze this phenomenon in a supersymmetric framework and demonstrate that, whereas mixing indeed occurs in the bosonic theory, the presence of fermionic zero modes in the supersymmetric case leads to the vanishing of the transition amplitude. To illustrate these results, we examine two examples featuring Wess-Zumino models with two and four supercharges. The latter example is motivated by the Affleck-Dine-Seiberg superpotential. We also present a number of developments of instanton calculus in the case of instantons in kink backgrounds.</description>

Abstract: We discuss applications of the proper-time method in a Lorentz-violating extension of QED characterized by the modification of the mass sector through the addition of the term proportional to the antisymmetric tensor $H_{\mu\nu}$. Unlike other LV extensions of QED, in our case the one-loop Euler-Heisenberg-like action turns out to include only odd degrees of the stress tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$. Our result is shown to be UV finite, and it is confirmed using the Feynman diagrams framework.</description>

      <title>Disorder operators in two-dimensional Fermi and non-Fermi liquids through multidimensional bosonization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disorder operators are a type of non-local observables for quantum many-body systems, measuring the fluctuations of symmetry charges inside a region. It has been shown that disorder operators can reveal global aspects of many-body states that are otherwise difficult to access through local measurements. We study the disorder operator for U(1) (charge or spin) symmetry in two-dimensional Fermi and non-Fermi liquid states, using the multidimensional bosonization formalism. For a region $A$, the logarithm of the charge disorder parameter in a Fermi liquid with isotropic interactions scales asymptotically as $l_A\ln l_A$, with $l_A$ being the linear size of the region $A$. We calculate the proportionality coefficient in terms of Landau parameters of the Fermi liquid theory. We then study models of the Fermi surface coupled to gapless bosonic fields realizing non-Fermi liquid states. In a simple spinless model, where the fermion density is coupled to a critical scalar, we find that at the quantum critical point the scaling behavior of the charge disorder operators is drastically modified to $l_A \ln^2 l_A$. We also consider the composite Fermi liquid state and argue that the charge disorder operator scales as $l_A$.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Euclidean vacuum for linearized gravity on the global de Sitter space, obtained from the Euclidean Green's function on the 4-sphere. We use the notion of Calder\'on projectors to recover a quantum state for the Lorentzian theory on de Sitter space. We show that while the state is gauge invariant and Hadamard, it is not positive on the whole of the phase space. We show however that a suitable modification at low energies yields a well-defined Hadamard state on global de Sitter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the impact of non-spherical effects on the Primordial Black Hole mass function, based on the ellipticity-dependent threshold calculated by performing $3+1$ relativistic numerical simulations. We consider an equation of state of radiation $w:=P/\rho=1/3$ and a softer one $w=1/10$ with $P$ and $\rho$ being the pressure and energy density, respectively. We suppose that the curvature perturbations obey Gaussian statistics with a monochromatic power spectrum and examine the most probable ellipsoidal configurations utilizing peak theory. We also suppose the critical scaling law of the PBH mass near the threshold following the known results. The simulations arXiv:2410.03452 show that the non-sphericity can easily prevent the system from black hole formation when the initial fluctuation amplitude is near the threshold (critical scaling regime). Nevertheless, we show that the non-spherical effects make the mass function just a few times smaller and are insignificant on the mass function distribution, including the power-law scaling in the small mass region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03452v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform $3+1$ relativistic numerical simulations to study primordial black hole (PBH) formation from the collapse of adiabatic super-horizon non-spherical perturbations generated from curvature fluctuations obeying random Gaussian statistics with a monochromatic power spectrum. The matter field is assumed to be a perfect fluid of an equation of state $w:=P/\rho={\rm const.}$ with $P$ and $\rho$ being the pressure and the energy density, respectively. The initial spatial profile of the curvature perturbation is modeled with the amplitude $\mu$ and non-spherical parameters $e$ (ellipticity) and $p$ (prolateness) according to peak theory. We focus on the dynamics and the threshold for PBH formation in terms of the non-spherical parameters $e$ and $p$. We find that the critical values ($e_c, p_c$) with a fixed value of $\mu$ closely follow a superellipse curve. With $p=0$, for the range of amplitudes considered, we find that the critical ellipticity for non-spherical collapse follows a decaying power law as a function of $(\mu-\mu_{\rm c,sp})$ with $\mu_{\rm c,sp}$ being the threshold for the spherical case. Our results also indicate that, for both cases of $w = 1/3$ and $w = 1/10$, small deviations from sphericity can avoid collapsing to a black hole when the amplitude is near its critical threshold. Finally we discuss the significance of the ellipticity on the rate of the PBH production.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21397v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurements in many-body quantum systems can generate non-trivial phenomena, such as preparation of long-range entangled states, dynamical phase transitions, or measurement-altered criticality. Here, we introduce a new measurement scheme that produces an ensemble of mixed states in a subsystem, obtained by measuring a local Hermitian observable on part of its complement. We refer to this as the observable-projected ensemble. Unlike standard projected ensembles-where pure states are generated by projective measurements on the complement-our approach involves projective partial measurements of specific observables. This setup has two main advantages: theoretically, it is amenable to analytical computations, especially within conformal field theories. Experimentally, it requires only a linear number of measurements, rather than an exponential one, to probe the properties of the ensemble. As a first step in exploring the observable-projected ensemble, we investigate its entanglement properties in conformal field theory and perform a detailed analysis of the free compact boson.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17474v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of a nonlinear magnetic-charged black hole in the presence of a phantom global monopole. By incorporating nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) and exotic scalar fields, we derive an exact black hole solution and analyze its geometric structure, causal properties, and thermodynamic behavior. We examine how the presence of a phantom global monopole modifies the black hole's Hawking temperature, entropy, and stability conditions, revealing significant changes in its phase structure. Additionally, we investigate the geodesic motion of test particles. The quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum is computed using the WKB approximation and P\"oschl-Teller potential method, providing insights into the perturbative stability of the system. Furthermore, we analyze the grey-body factors that characterize radiation emission, highlighting their dependence on black hole parameters. Our findings indicate that the interplay between phantom energy, NLE, and global monopoles introduces observable deviations in strong-field astrophysical phenomena. These results offer potential signatures for testing modified gravity theories and contribute to a deeper understanding of black hole physics in exotic field environments.</description>

      <title>Model-independent cosmological inference after the DESI DR2 data with improved inverse distance ladder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) measurements from the DESI survey have suggested hints of dynamical dark energy, challenging the standard $\Lambda $CDM model. In this work, we adopt an improved inverse distance ladder approach based on the latest cosmological data to provide a model-independent perspective, employing a global parametrization based on cosmic age (PAge). Our analysis incorporates DESI DR2 BAO measurements, cosmic chronometer (CC) data, and type Ia supernovae (SNe) observations from either the DESY5 or PantheonPlus datasets. For the DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets, we obtain $H_0 = 67.91 \pm 2.33~\mathrm{km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}}$. This value is consistent with the Planck 2018 result, while shows $2.0 \sigma$ tension with the SH0ES measurement. Furthermore, by mapping specific cosmological models into PAge approximation parameter space $(p_{\mathrm{age}}, \eta)$, our model-independent analysis reveals a notable deviation from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model, as indicated by the DESY5 and DESI DR2 datasets. Finally, DESY5+DESI DR2+CC datasets provide nearly decisive evidence favoring the PAge model over the standard $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model. These findings highlight the need for further investigation into the expansion history to better understand the deviations from the $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$ model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological ordered phases in 2+1 dimensions characterized by generalized modulated symmetries. Such phases have explicit realizations in terms of fixed-point Hamiltonians involving commuting projectors with support $h=3,5,7,\ldots$ in the horizontal direction, which dictates the modulation of the generalized symmetries. These symmetries are sensitive to the lattice sizes. For certain sizes, they are spontaneously broken and the ground state is degenerated, while for the remaining ones, the symmetries are explicitly broken and the ground state is unique. The ground state dependence on the lattice sizes is a manifestation of the ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing. The structure of the modulated symmetries implies that the anyons can move only in rigid steps of size $h$, leading to the notion of position-dependent anyons. The phases exhibit rich boundary physics with a variety of gapped phases, including trivial, partial and total symmetry-breaking, and SPT phases. Effective field theory descriptions are discussed, making transparent the relation between the generalized modulated symmetries and the restrictions on anyon mobility, incorporating the boundary physics in a natural way, and showing how the short-distance details can be incorporated into the continuum by means of twisted boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Cosmological perturbations for smooth sign-switching dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a comprehensive perturbative analysis of four cosmological models featuring a sign-switching cosmological constant. Among these, we include the well-known $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, characterised by an abrupt transition from a negative to a positive cosmological constant. We also consider the L$\Lambda$CDM model, which exhibits a generalised ladder-step evolution, as well as the SSCDM and ECDM models, both of which undergo a smooth sign change at comparable redshifts. We solve the linear cosmological perturbation equations from the radiation-dominated era, imposing initial adiabatic conditions for matter and radiation, for modes well outside the Hubble radius in the early Universe. We analyse the behaviour of the matter density contrast, the gravitational potential, the linear growth rate, the matter power spectrum, and the $f\sigma_8$ evolution . These results are contrasted with predictions from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and are confronted with observational data.</description>

      <title>An operator algebraic approach to fusion category symmetry on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for fusion category symmetry on the (1+1)D lattice in the thermodynamic limit by giving a formal interpretation of SymTFT decompositions. Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the fixed point operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries on a tensor product quasi-local algebra if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an ``on-site" action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove two anomaly enforced gaplessness theorems, one for internal categorical symmetries and one for anomalous duality channels. Using the first, we show that for any fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exist gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain.</description>

      <title>From geometry to cosmology: a pedagogical review of inflation in curvature, torsion, and extended gravity theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simplified review of inflationary cosmology across various modified gravity theories. These include models based on curvature, torsion, and non-metricity. We explore how scalar fields interact with different geometric quantities and how these interactions affect inflationary dynamics. Key cosmological features such as background evolution, reheating, and observable parameters are discussed. We also examine exotic scenarios inspired by string theory, extra dimensions, and non-local models. This work aims to connect theoretical models with observational data and future missions, offering guidance for exploring inflation beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Information Loss and Cost in Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an algebraic and information-theoretic framework to characterize symmetry breaking of generalized, non-invertible symmetries in two spatial dimensions. The reduction of symmetry is modeled within subfactor theory, where condensable Frobenius algebras play the role of subgroups in the categorical setting. This perspective naturally connects to the description of anyon condensation in topological phases of matter. Central to our approach are coarse-graining maps, or conditional expectations, which act as quantum channels projecting observables from a phase with higher symmetry onto one where the symmetry is partially or completely broken by condensation. By employing relative entropy as an entropic order parameter, we quantify the information loss induced by condensation and establish a universal bound governed by the Jones index, which is equal to the quantum dimension of the condensate. We illustrate the framework through explicit examples, including the toric code, abelian groups $\mathbb{Z}_N$, and the representation category Rep($S_3$), and show how dualities give rise to equivalence classes of condensation patterns. Our results forge new connections between operator algebras, tensor category theory, and quantum information in the study of generalized symmetries.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling superconductivity near Gross-Neveu quantum criticality in Dirac systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions at neutrality, coupled to bosonic modes through a Yukawa interaction. We then examine the intriguing possibility that such a system, devoid of carriers at zero temperature, might nevertheless exhibit superconductivity. Remarkably, we find that superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of Gross-Neveu quantum criticality, provided the fermions cease to behave as well-defined quasiparticles, that is, once their anomalous dimension in the normal state becomes sufficiently large. In other words, well-defined fermions do not superconduct, whereas ill-defined ones do. We analyze four symmetry-distinct bosonic modes, each capable of driving normal-state criticality and, in three of the four cases, giving rise to a distinct superconducting phase. While phase fluctuations are strong in this regime, we argue that they do not destroy the superconducting state. We further characterize the resulting pairing states for a concrete Dirac model of spin-orbit coupled systems with orbitals of different parity. Our results are obtained using the SYK-inspired framework for Dirac systems introduced by Kim et al.[1], which provides a controlled approach to the strongly coupled regime of Dirac fluids near Gross-Neveu criticality.</description>

      <title>Wormhole-Induced correlation: A Link Between Two Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the profound connection between quantum mechanics and spacetime geometry, particularly the conjectured correspondence between wormholes and quantum entanglement as proposed in the ER=EPR framework, this study aims to investigate the influence of wormhole geometries on quantum information extraction. We examine the correlation-specifically mutual information (MI) and entanglement-extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors from the quantum vacuum field in the presence of a BTZ wormhole featuring a null-like throat, also known as an Einstein-Rosen bridge. First, we analyze how the detector's position relative to the wormhole throat and the throat's size affect the extracted MI. Our results indicate that the wormhole enhances MI extraction, with maximal MI achieved when the detectors are located at specific image-symmetric points connected by the wormhole. By analyzing the behavior of the nonlocal contribution term and the classical noise term, it is found that the correlations extracted contain genuine non-classical components. This work highlights the feasibility of extracting quantum correlations through null-like wormhole geometries and provides a novel perspective for probing the potential relationship between spacetime topology and the nonlocal characteristics of quantum mechanics.</description>
