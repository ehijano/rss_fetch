      <title>Liouville Theorem with Boundary Conditions from Chern--Gauss--Bonnet Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\sigma_k(A_g)$ curvature and the boundary $\mathcal{B}^k_g$ curvature arise naturally from the Chern--Gauss--Bonnet formula for manifolds with boundary. In this paper, we prove a Liouville theorem for the equation $\sigma_k(A_g)=1$ in $\overline{\mathbb{R}^n_+}$ with the boundary condition $\mathcal{B}^k_g=c$ on $\partial\mathbb{R}^n_+$, where $g=e^{2v}|dx|^2$ and $c$ is some nonnegative constant. This extends an earlier result of Wei, which assumes the existence of $\lim_{|x|\to\infty}(v(x)+2\log|x|)$. In addition, we establish a local gradient estimate for solutions of such equations, assuming an upper bound on the solution $v$.</description>

      <title>On regularity of solutions to the Navier--Stokes equation with initial data in $\mathrm{BMO}^{-1}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any mild solution in the Koch--Tataru space to the incompressible Navier--Stokes equation with initial data in $\mathrm{BMO}^{-1}$ belongs to $C([0,T);\mathrm{BMO}^{-1})$. We also show that the global solution vanishes in $\mathrm{BMO}^{-1}$ at infinity in time. As an application, we exhibit a spatio-temporal regularity result for global mild solutions evolving from small data in $\mathrm{BMO}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Neumann Problems for the Stokes Equations in Convex Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the Neumann boundary value problems for the Stokes equations in a convex domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We obtain nontangential-maximal-function estimates in $L^p$ and $W^{1, p}$ estimates for $p$ in certain ranges depending on $d$. These ranges are larger than the known ranges for Lipschitz domains. The proof relies on a $W^{2, 2}$ estimate for the Stokes equations in convex domains.</description>

      <title>Quasistatic evolution and accretive phase-change in finite-strain viscoelastic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the quasistatic evolution problem for a two-phase viscoelastic material at finite strains. Phase evolution is assumed to be irreversible as one phase accretes in time in its normal direction, at the expense of the other. Mechanical response depends on the phase, and growth is influenced by the mechanical state at the boundary of the accreting phase, making the model to be fully coupled. This setting is inspired by the early stage development of solid tumors, as well as by the swelling of polymer gels. We formulate the evolution problem by coupling the quasistatic balance of momenta in weak form and the growth dynamics in the viscosity sense. Both a diffused- and a sharp-interface variant of the model are proved to admit solutions.</description>

      <title>The Pohozaev identity for mixed local-nonlocal operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we prove the Pohozaev identity for the semilinear Dirichlet problem of the form $-\Delta u + a(-\Delta)^s u = f(u)$ in $\Omega$, and $u=0$ in $\Omega^c$, where $a$ is a non-negative constant and $\Omega$ is a bounded $C^2$ domain. We also establish similar identity for systems of equations. As applications of this identity, we deduce a unique continuation property of eigenfunctions and also the nonexistence of nontrivial solutions in star-shaped domains under suitable condition on $f$.</description>

      <title>A Non-Conservative, Non-Local Approximation of the Burgers Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analysis of non-local regularisations of scalar conservation laws is an active research program. Applications of such equations are found in the modelling of physical phenomena such as traffic flow. In this paper, we propose a novel inviscid, non-local regularisation in non-divergence form. The salient feature of our approach is that we can obtain sharp a priori estimates on the total variation and supremum norm, and justify the singular limit for Lipschitz initial data up to the time of catastrophe. For generic conservation laws, this result is sharp, since we can demonstrate non-convergence when the initial data features simple discontinuities. Conservation laws with linear flux derivative, such as the Burgers equation, behave better in the presence of discontinuities. Hence, we devote special attention to the limiting behaviour of non-local solutions with respect to the Burgers equation for a simple class of discontinuous initial data.</description>

      <title>Controllability and kinetic limit of spherical particles immersed in a viscous fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with systems of spherical particles immersed in a viscous fluid. Two aspects are studied, namely the controllability of such systems, with particular attention to the case of one active particle and either one or two passive ones, and the kinetic limit of such systems as the number of particles diverges. The former issue is tackled in the framework of geometric control theory, whereas the latter resorts to Boltzmann-type formulations of the system of interacting particles.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous uniqueness for a coefficient inverse problem in one-dimensional fractional diffusion equation from an interior point measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is concerned with an inverse problem of simultaneously determining a spatially varying coefficient and a Robin coefficient for a one-dimensional fractional diffusion equation with a time-fractional derivative of order $\alpha\in(0,1)$. We prove the uniqueness for the inverse problem by observation data at one interior point over a finite time interval, provided that a coefficient is known on a subinterval. Our proof is based on the uniqueness in the inverse spectracl problem for a Sturm-Liouville problem by means of the Weyl $m$-function and the spectral representation of the solution to an initial-boundary value problem for the fractional diffusion equation.</description>

      <title>Mathematical models and numerical methods for a capital valuation adjustment (KVA) problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we rigorously establish mathematical models to obtain the capital valuation adjustment (KVA) as part of the total valuation adjustments (XVAs). For this purpose, we use a semi-replication strategy based on market theory. We formulate single-factor models in terms of expectations and PDEs. For PDEs formulation, we rigorously obtain the existence and uniqueness of the solution, as well as some regularity and qualitative properties of the solution. Moreover, appropriate numerical methods are proposed for solving the corresponding PDEs. Finally, some examples show the numerical results for call and put European options and the corresponding XVA that includes the KVA.</description>

      <title>On the justification of Koiter's model for generalised membrane shells of the fist kind confined in a half-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we justify Koiter's model for linearly elastic generalised membrane shells of the first kind subjected to remaining confined in a prescribed half-space. After showing that the confinement condition considered in this paper is in general stronger, under the validity of the Kirchhoff-Love assumptions, than the classical Signorini condition, we formulate the corresponding obstacle problem for a three-dimensional linearly elastic generalised membrane shell of the first kind, and we conduct a rigorous asymptotic analysis as the thickness approaches to zero on the unique solution for one such model. We show that the solution to the three-dimensional obstacle problem converges to the unique solution of a two-dimensional model consisting of a set of variational inequalities that are posed over the abstract completion of a non-empty, closed and convex set. We recall that the two-dimensional limit model obtained departing from Koiter's model is characterised by the same variational inequalities as the two-dimensional model obtained departing from the variational formulation of a three-dimensional linearly elastic generalised membrane shell subjected to remaining confined in a prescribed half-space, with the remarkable difference that the sets where solutions for these two-dimensional limit models are sought do not coincide, in general. In order to complete the justification of Koiter's model for linearly elastic generalised membrane shells of the first kind subjected to remaining confined in a half-space, we give sufficient conditions ensuring that the sets where solutions for these two-dimensional limit models are sought coincide.</description>

      <title>Rainfall infiltration: Direct and Inverse problems on a linear evolution equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Originating from the mathematical modelling of rainfall infiltration, we derive the solution of an initial-boundary value problem of a linear evolution partial differential equation, by using the Fokas method. We present numerical examples which correspond to specific physical rainfall problems. Based on this formalism we present an effective algorithm for the associated null-controllability problem, namely we numerically derive a family of boundary controls that steer the solution to the desired flat final state. Finally, a regularisation scheme allows the derivation of relatively small controls, in cases where this is necessary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article addresses the stabilizability of a perturbed quintic defocusing Schr\"odinger equation in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ at the $H^1$--energy level, considering the influence of a damping mechanism. More specifically, we establish a profile decomposition for both linear and nonlinear systems and use them to show that, under certain conditions, the sequence of nonlinear solutions can be effectively linearized. Lastly, through microlocal analysis techniques, we prove the local exponential stabilization of the solution to the perturbed Schr\"odinger equation in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ showing an observability inequality for the solution of the system under consideration, which is the key result of this work.</description>

      <title>From bubbles to clusters: Multiple solutions to the Allen--Cahn system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend previous works on the multiplicity of solutions to the Allen-Cahn system on closed Riemannian manifolds by considering an arbitrary number of phases. Specifically, we show that on parallelizable manifolds, the number of solutions is bounded from below by topological invariants of the underlying manifold, provided the temperature parameter and volume constraint are sufficiently small. The Allen-Cahn system naturally arises in phase separation models, where solutions represent the distribution of distinct phases in a multi-component mixture. As the temperature parameter approaches zero, the system's energy approximates the multi-isoperimetric profile, leading to solutions concentrating in regions resembling isoperimetric clusters. For two or three phases, these results rely on classifying isoperimetric clusters. However, this classification remains incomplete for a larger number of phases. To address this technical issue, we employ a "volume-fixing variations" approach, enabling us to establish our results for any number of phases and small volume constraints. This offers deeper insights into phase separation phenomena on manifolds with arbitrary geometry.</description>

      <title>The Boltzmann equation for a multi-species inelastic mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A granular gas is a collection of macroscopic particles that interact through energy-dissipating collisions, also known as inelastic collisions. This inelasticity is characterized by a collision mechanics in which mass and momentum are conserved and kinetic energy is dissipated. Such a system can be described by a kinetic equation of the Boltzmann type. Nevertheless, due to the macroscopic aspect of the particles, any realistic description of a granular gas should be written as a mixture model composed of M different species, each with its own mass. We propose in this work such a granular multi-species model and analyse it, providing Povzner-type inequalities, and a Cauchy theory in general Orlicz spaces. We also analyse its large time behavior, showing that it exhibits a mixture analogue of the seminal Haff's Law.</description>

      <title>Bounded weak solutions with Orlicz space data: an overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that non-negative solutions to the Dirichlet
  problem $\Delta u =f$ in a bounded domain $\Omega$, where $f\in L^q(\Omega)$, $q&gt;\frac{n}2$, satisfy
  $\|u\|_{L^\infty(\Omega)} \leq C\|f\|_{L^q(\Omega)}$. We generalize
  this result by replacing the Laplacian with a degenerate elliptic
  operator, and we show that we can take the data $f$ in an Orlicz space
  $L^A(\Omega)$ that, in the classical case, lies strictly between $L^{\frac{n}{2}}(\Omega)$ and
  $L^q(\Omega)$, $q&gt;\frac{n}2$.</description>

      <title>Global strong solution for the stochastic tamed Chemotaxis-Navier-Stokes system in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17059v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the 3D Cauchy problem for a coupled system arising from the biomathematics, which consists of a chemotaxis model with cubic logistic source and the stochastic tamed Navier-Stokes equations (STCNS, for short). Our main goal is to establish the existence and uniqueness of global strong solution (strong in both the probabilistic and PDE senses) for the 3D STCNS system with large initial data. To achieve this, we first introduce a triple approximation scheme by virtue of the Friedrichs mollifier, frequency truncation operators and cut-off functions, which makes it possible for constructing sufficiently smooth approximation solutions, and facilitating the effective use of stochastic entropy-energy estimates. Then, building on the entropy-energy estimates, we further derive some higher-order energy estimates, which together with the stochastic compactness method permits us to construct the strong solution for the STCNS system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the system of viscoelasticity with higher-order gradients and nonconvex energy in several space dimensions. We establish the asymptotic limits when the viscosity $\nu\rightarrow 0$ or when the dispersion coefficient $\delta \rightarrow 0$. For the latter problem, it is worth noting that, for the case of two space dimensions, we also establish a rate of convergence. This result bears analogies to a result of Chemin \cite{jean1996remark} on the rate of convergence of the zero-viscosity limit for the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with bounded vorticity.</description>

      <title>Paracomposition Operators and Paradifferential Reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reducibility methods, aiming to simplify systems by conjugating them to those with constant coefficients, are crucial for studying the existence of quasiperiodic solutions. In KAM theory for PDEs, these methods help address the invertibility of linearized operators that arise in a Nash-Moser/KAM type scheme. The goal of this paper is to prove paradifferential reducibility results, enabling the reduction of nonlinear equations themselves, rather than just their linearizations, to constant coefficient form, modulo smoothing terms. As an initial application, we demonstrate the existence of quasiperiodic solutions for certain hyperbolic systems. Despite the small denominator problem, our proof does not rely on traditional Nash-Moser/KAM-type schemes. To achieve this, we develop two key toolsets. The first focuses on the calculus of paracomposition operators introduced by Alinhac, interpreted as the flow map of a paraproduct vector field. We refine this approach to establish new estimates that precisely capture the dependence on the diffeomorphism in question. The second toolset addresses two classical reducibility problems: one for matrix differential operators and another for nearly parallel vector fields on the torus. We resolve these problems by paralinearizing the conjugacy equation and exploiting, at the paradifferential level, the specific algebraic structure of conjugacy problems, akin to Zehnder's approximate Nash-Moser approach.</description>

      <title>Sharp well-posedness for the $k$-dispersion generalized Benjamin-Ono equations: Short and long time results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the $k$-dispersion generalized Benjamin-Ono ($k$-DGBO) equations. For nonlinearities with power $k \geq 4$, we establish local and global well-posedness results for the associated initial value problem (IVP) in both the critical and subcritical regimes, addressing sharp regularity in homogeneous and inhomogeneous Sobolev spaces. Additionally, our method enables the formulation of a scattering criterion and a scattering theory for small data. We also investigate the case $k = 3$ via frequency-restricted estimates, obtaining local well-posedness results for the IVP associated with the $3$-DGBO equation and generalizing the existing results in the literature for the whole subcritical range. For higher dispersion, these local results can be extended globally even for rough data, particularly for initial data in Sobolev spaces with negative indices. As a byproduct, we derive new nonlinear smoothing estimates.</description>

Abstract: We present a method of solving a nonlinear Dirichlet problem with discontinuous boundary data and we give a probabilistic representation of the solution using the nonlocal branching process associated with the nonlinear term of the operator. Instead of the pointwise convergence of the solution to the given boundary data we use the controlled convergence which allows to have discontinuities at the boundary.</description>

      <title>An Additive-Noise Approximation to Keller-Segel-Dean-Kawasaki Dynamics: Small-Noise Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an additive-noise approximation to Keller--Segel--Dean--Kawasaki dynamics which is proposed as an approximate model to the fluctuating hydrodynamics of chemotactically interacting particles around their mean-field limit. Two parameters play a key r\^ole in the approximation: the noise intensity which captures the amplitude of these fluctuations (tending to zero as the effective system size tends to infinity) and the correlation length which represents the effective scale under consideration. Using a mixture of pathwise and probabilistic tools we obtain analogues of law of large numbers and large deviation principles in regular function spaces under restrictive relative scaling assumptions on the noise intensity and the correlation length. Using methods of singular stochastic partial differential equations we also obtain analogues of law of large numbers, central limit theorems and large deviation principles in irregular spaces of distributions under general relative scaling assumptions. We further describe consequences of these results relevant to applications of our approximation in studying continuum fluctuations of particle systems.</description>

      <title>Restrictions of Maass forms on $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ to hyperbolic surfaces and geodesic tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\psi$ be an $L^2$-normalized Hecke-Maass form with a large spectral parameter $\lambda&gt;0$ on a compact arithmetic congruence hyperbolic 3-manifold $X=\Gamma\backslash\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})/\mathrm{SU}(2)$, and let $Y$ be a totally geodesic surface in $X$ with bounded diameter. The local $L^2$-bound for the restriction of $\psi$ to $Y$ is $\|\psi|_Y \|_{L^2(Y)}\ll\lambda^{1/4}$ by Burq, G\'erard, and Tzvetkov. We apply the method of arithmetic amplification developed by Iwaniec and Sarnak to obtain a power saving over the local bound. The new feature in the proof is that we establish two different estimates for the integrals of $\psi|_Y$ against geodesic beams over $Y$ via two amplification arguments. Combining these estimates, we can improve the local bound for generalized Fourier coefficients of $\psi|_Y$ against eigenfunctions on $Y$ with spectral parameters near $\lambda$. We also apply the amplification method to obtain a power saving over the trivial bound $O(1)$ for $L^2$-norms of $\psi$ restricted to $\lambda^{-1/2}$-neighborhoods of unit-length geodesic segments. Consequently, we obtain power savings over the local $L^p$-bounds of $\psi$ by Sogge for $2&lt;p&lt;4$ from our improvement for the Kakeya-Nikodym bound.</description>

      <title>On a diffuse interface model for incompressible viscoelastic two-phase flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns a diffuse interface model for the flow of two incompressible viscoelastic fluids in a bounded domain. More specifically, the fluids are assumed to be macroscopically immiscible, but with a small transition region, where the two components are partially mixed. Considering the elasticity of both components, one ends up with a coupled Oldroyd-B/Cahn--Hilliard type system, which describes the behavior of two-phase viscoelastic fluids. We prove the existence of weak solutions to the system in two dimensions for general (unmatched) mass densities, variable viscosities, different shear moduli, and a class of physically relevant and singular free energy densities that guarantee that the order parameter stays in the physically reasonable interval. The proof relies on a combination of a regularization of the original system and a new hybrid implicit time discretization for the regularized system together with the analysis of an Oldroyd-B type equation.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic expansions in large Grashof numbers for the steady states of the Navier-Stokes equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We enable a theory of intrinsic asymptotic expansions for the steady state solutions of the full Navier-Stokes equations. Such a theory was first developed in Foias et al (2024 Commun. Pure Appl. Anal. 23, 269-303) for Galerkin approximations. To overcome the lack of local compactness in infinite dimensional spaces, we introduce the notion of asymptotic expansions in nested spaces. When the inclusion maps between these spaces are compact, we establish the existence of such an asymptotic expansion for a subsequence of any bounded sequence. This consequently yields an intrinsic asymptotic expansion in a single normed space. We apply this result to the steady states of the Navier-Stokes equations by utilizing the spectral fractional Sobolev spaces. In the case of the two-dimensional periodic boundary conditions, more properties relating the terms of the asymptotic expansion are obtained.</description>

      <title>Real eternal PDE solutions are not complex entire: a quadratic parabolic example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In parabolic or hyperbolic PDEs, solutions which remain uniformly bounded for all real times $t=r\in\mathbb{R}$ are often called PDE entire or eternal. For example, consider the quadratic parabolic PDE \begin{equation*} \label{*} w_t=w_{xx}+6w^2-\lambda, \tag{*} \end{equation*} for $0&lt;x&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}$, under Neumann boundary conditions. By its gradient-like structure, all real eternal non-equilibrium orbits $\Gamma(r)$ of \eqref{*} are heteroclinic among equilibria $w=W_n(x)$. All nontrivial real $W_n$ are rescaled and properly translated real-valued Weierstrass elliptic functions with Morse index $i(W_n)=n$.
  We show that the complex time extensions $\Gamma(r+\mathrm{i}s)$, of analytic real heteroclinic orbits towards $W_0=-\sqrt{\lambda/6}$, are not complex entire. For example, consider the time-reversible complex-valued solution $\psi(s)$ of the nonlinear and nonconservative quadratic Schr\"odinger equation \begin{equation*} \label{**} \mathrm{i}\psi_s=\psi_{xx}+6\psi^2-\lambda \tag{**} \end{equation*} with real initial condition $\psi_0=\Gamma(r_0)$. Then there exist $r_0$ such that $\psi(s)$ blows up at some finite real times $\pm s^*$.
  Abstractly, our results are formulated in the setting of analytic semigroups. They are based on Poincar\'e non-resonance of unstable eigenvalues at equilibria $W_n$, near pitchfork bifurcation. Technically, we have to except a discrete set of $\lambda&gt;0$, and are currently limited to unstable dimensions $n\leq22$, or to fast unstable manifolds of dimensions $d&lt;1+\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study barycenters of $N$ probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with respect to the $p$-Wasserstein metric ($1&lt;p&lt;\infty$). We prove that
  -- $p$-Wasserstein barycenters of absolutely continuous measures are unique, and again absolutely continuous
  -- $p$-Wasserstein barycenters admit a multi-marginal formulation
  -- the optimal multi-marginal plan is unique and of Monge form if the marginals are absolutely continuous, and its support has an explicit parametrization as a graph over any marginal space.
  This extends the Agueh--Carlier theory of Wasserstein barycenters [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 43 (2011), no.2, 904--924] to exponents $p\neq 2$. A key ingredient is a quantitative injectivity estimate for the (highly non-injective) map from $N$-point configurations to their $p$-barycenter on the support of an optimal multi-marginal plan. We also discuss the statistical meaning of $p$-Wasserstein barycenters in one dimension.</description>

Abstract: In this article we study a coupled system of differential equations with Allen-Cahn type non-linearity. Motivated by physical phenomena one of the unknowns in the system is accompanied by a singular perturbation parameter ${\epsilon}^2$ . By employing variational techniques, we establish the existence of solutions for all values of ${\epsilon}$ and get results on their qualitative properties, including regularity. Additionally, we analyse the behaviour of solutions as ${\epsilon} {\to} 0$, demonstrating their pointwise convergence to the solution of the problem for ${\epsilon} = 0$. We establish the uniqueness of this solution modulo translations. Additionally, in the final section, through an appropriate change of scale, we relate this problem and the second Painlev\'e equation.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates the boundary stabilization problem of the Hirota-Satsuma system. In the problem under consideration, a boundary feedback law consisting of a linear combination of a damping mechanism and a time-delay term is designed. The study shows that, with time delay feedback and a smallness restriction on the size of the initial data the energy of the Hirota-Satsuma system decays exponentially by employing two approaches: the Lyapunov method and an observability inequality combined with a contradiction argument.</description>

      <title>Weak stability of the sum of $K$ solitary waves for Half-wave equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01919v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the subcritical half-wave equation in the one-dimensional case. Let $R_k(t,x)$ be $K$ solitary wave solutions of the half-wave equation with different translations $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_K$. If the relative distances of the solitary waves $x_k-x_{k-1}$ are large enough, we prove that the sum of the $R_k(t)$ is weakly stable. To prove this result, we use an energy method and the local mass monotonicity property. However, unlike the single-solitary wave or NLS cases, different waves exhibit the strongest interactions in dimension one. In order to obtain the local mass monotonicity property to estimate the remainder of the geometrical decomposition, as well as non-local effects on localization functions and non-local operator $|D|$, we utilize the Carlder\'on estimate and the integration representation formula of the half-wave operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a novel Unique Continuation Principle (UCP) for a system of second-order elliptic PDEs system and apply it to investigate inverse problems in conductive scattering. The UCP relaxes the typical assumptions imposed on the domain or boundary with certain interior transmission conditions. This is motivated by the study of the associated inverse scattering problem and enables us to establish several novel unique identifiability results for the determination of generalized conductive scatterers using a single far-field pattern, significantly extending the results in [12,18]. A key technical advancement in our work is the combination of Complex Geometric Optics (CGO) techniques from [12,18] with the Fourier expansion method to microlocally analyze corner singularities and their implications for inverse problems. We believe that the methods developed can have broader applications in other contexts.</description>

Abstract: We establish that the Lavrentiev gap between Sobolev and Lipschitz maps does not occur for a scalar variational problem of the form: \[ \textrm{to minimize} \qquad u \mapsto \int_\Omega f(x,u,\nabla u)\text{d}x \,, \] under a Dirichlet boundary condition. Here, $\Omega$ is a bounded Lipschitz open set in $\mathbb{R}^N$, $N\geq 1$ and the function $f$ is required to be measurable with respect to the spacial variable, continuous with respect to the second one, and continuous and comparable to convex with respect to the last variable. Moreover, we assume that $f$ satisfies a natural condition balancing the variations with respect to the first variable and the growth with respect to the last one. Remarkably, typical conditions that are usually imposed on $f$ to discard the Lavrentiev gap are dropped here: we do not require $f$ to be bounded or convex with respect to the second variable, nor impose any condition of $\Delta_2$-kind with respect to the last variable.</description>

      <title>An Additive-Noise Approximation to Keller-Segel-Dean-Kawasaki Dynamics: Local Well-Posedness of Paracontrolled Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.10711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the method of paracontrolled distributions, we show the local well-posedness of an additive noise approximation to the fluctuating hydrodynamics of the Keller-Segel model on the two-dimensional torus. Our approximation is a non-linear, non-local, parabolic-elliptic stochastic PDE with an irregular, heterogeneous space-time noise. As a consequence of the irregularity and heterogeneity, solutions to this equation must be renormalised by a sequence of diverging fields. Using the symmetry of the elliptic Green's function, which appears in our non-local term, we establish that the renormalisation diverges at most logarithmically, an improvement over the linear divergence one would expect by power counting. Similar cancellations also serve to reduce the number of diverging counterterms.</description>

      <title>Green functions for GJMS operators on spheres, Gegenbauer polynomials and rigidity theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02087v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive explicit representation formulae of Green functions for GJMS operators on $n$-spheres, including the fractional ones. These formulae have natural geometric interpretations concerning the extrinsic geometry of the round sphere. Conversely, we discover that this special feature uniquely characterizes spheres among closed embedded hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$. Furthermore, for $n=3,4,5$ we prove a strong rigidity theorem for Green functions of hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ using the Positive Mass Theorem.</description>

      <title>Regularization by Nonlinear Noise for PDEs: Well-posedness and Finite Time Extinction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06840v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on the regularization by nonlinear noise for a class of partial differential equations that may only have local solutions. In particular, we obtain the global existence, uniqueness and the Feller property for stochastic 3D Navier-Stokes equations, which provide positive answers to a longstanding open problem in this field.
  Moreover, we discover a new phenomenon that for a potentially explosive deterministic system, an appropriate intervention of nonlinear noise can not only prevent blow-up but also lead to the finite time extinction of the associated stochastic system. Our main results have broad applications, including stochastic $p$-Laplace equations with heat sources, stochastic surface growth models and stochastic quasi-geostrophic equations.</description>

      <title>The first Dirichlet eigenvalue and the width</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a geodesic ball with non-negative Ricci curvature and mean convex boundary, it is known that the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of this geodesic ball has a sharp lower bound in term of its radius. We show a quantitative explicit inequality, which bounds the width of geodesic ball in terms of the spectral gap between the first Dirichlet eigenvalue and the corresponding sharp lower bound.</description>

      <title>A spectral method for dispersive solutions of the nonlocal Sine-Gordon equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moved by the need for rigorous and reliable numerical tools for the analysis of peridynamic materials, the authors propose a model able to capture the dispersive features of nonlocal soliton-like solutions obtained by a peridynamic formulation of the Sine-Gordon equation. The analysis of the Cauchy problem associated to the peridynamic Sine-Gordon equation with local Neumann boundary condition is performed in this work through a spectral method on Chebyshev polynomials nodes joined with the Stormer-Verlet scheme for the time evolution. The choice for using the spectral method resides in the resulting reachable numerical accuracy, while, indeed, Chebyshev polynomials allow straightforward implementation of local boundary conditions. Several numerical experiments are proposed for thoroughly describe the ability of such scheme. Specifically, dispersive effects of the specific peridynamic kernel are demonstrated, while the internal energy behavior of the specified peridynamic operator is studied.</description>

      <title>Zero entropy on entire Grauert tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a real analytic Riemannian manifold a Grauert tube is an uniquely adapted complex structure defined on the tangent bundle. It is called entire if it may be defined on the whole tangent bundle. Here, we show that the geodesic flow of an analytic manifold with entire Grauert tube has zero topological entropy. Several consequences then follow. We find that Grauert tubes of convex analytic hypersurfaces of ${\bf R}^3$ are generically finite. We give a complete classification of 3-manifolds with entire Grauert tube, showing that these are precisely the 3-manifolds that admit good complexifications. Assuming a manifold has entire Grauert tube, we offer classification statements for several families of smooth 4-manifolds, determine all such simply connected 5-manifolds, and offer new topological restrictions for certain manifolds with infinite fundamental groups. Using these results we present an example of a simply connected and rationally elliptic 5-manifold which nonetheless does not admit any metric with entire Grauert tube.</description>

      <title>A finite difference method with symmetry properties for the high-dimensional Bratu equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving the three-dimensional (3D) Bratu equation is highly challenging due to the presence of multiple and sharp solutions. Research on this equation began in the late 1990s, but there are no satisfactory results to date. To address this issue, we introduce a symmetric finite difference method (SFDM) which embeds the symmetry properties of the solutions into a finite difference method (FDM). This SFDM is primarily used to obtain more accurate solutions and bifurcation diagrams for the 3D Bratu equation. Additionally, we propose modifying the Bratu equation by incorporating a new constraint that facilitates the construction of bifurcation diagrams and simplifies handling the turning points. The proposed method, combined with the use of sparse matrix representation, successfully solves the 3D Bratu equation on grids of up to $301^3$ points. The results demonstrate that SFDM outperforms all previously employed methods for the 3D Bratu equation. Furthermore, we provide bifurcation diagrams for the 1D, 2D, 4D, and 5D cases, and accurately identify the first turning points in all dimensions. All simulations indicate that the bifurcation diagrams of the Bratu equation on the cube domains closely resemble the well-established behavior on the ball domains described by Joseph and Lundgren [1]. Furthermore, when SFDM is applied to linear stability analysis, it yields the same largest real eigenvalue as the standard FDM despite having fewer equations and variables in the nonlinear system.</description>
