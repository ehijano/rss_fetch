      <title>A Compositional Approach to Higher-Order Structure in Complex Systems: Carving Nature at its Joints</title>

Abstract: Relating microscopic interactions to macroscopic observables is a central challenge in the study of complex systems. Addressing this question requires understanding both pairwise and higher-order interactions, but the latter are less well understood. Here, we show that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a general mathematical formalism for deriving higher-order interactions from macroscopic observables, relative to a chosen decomposition of the system into parts. Applying this framework to a diverse range of systems, we demonstrate that many existing notions of higher-order interactions, from epistasis in genetics and many-body couplings in physics, to synergy in game theory and artificial intelligence, naturally arise from an appropriate mereological decomposition. By revealing the common mathematical structure underlying seemingly disparate phenomena, our work highlights the fundamental role of decomposition choice in the definition and estimation of higher-order interactions. We discuss how this unifying perspective can facilitate the transfer of insights between domains, guide the selection of appropriate system decompositions, and motivate the search for novel interaction types through creative decomposition strategies. More broadly, our results suggest that the M\"obius inversion theorem provides a powerful lens for understanding the emergence of complex behaviour from the interplay of microscopic parts, with applications across a wide range of disciplines.</description>

      <title>Hyperphosphorylation-Induced Phase Transition in Vesicle Delivery Dynamics of Motor Proteins in Neuronal Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synaptic vesicle transport by motor proteins along microtubules is a crucial active process underlying neuronal communication. It is known that microtubules are destabilized by tau-hyperphosphorylation, which causes tau proteins to detach from microtubules and form neurofibril tangles. However, how tau-phosphorylation affects transport dynamics of motor proteins on the microtubule remains unknown. Here, we discover that long-distance unidirectional motion of vesicle-motor protein multiplexes (VMPMs) in living cells is suppressed under tau-hyperphosphorylation, with the consequent loss of fast vesicle-transport along the microtubule. The VMPMs in hyperphosphorylated cells exhibit seemingly bidirectional random motion, with dynamic properties far different from VMPM motion in normal cells. We establish a parsimonious physicochemical model of VMPM's active motion that provides a unified, quantitative explanation and predictions for our experimental results. Our analysis reveals that, under hyperphosphorylation conditions, motor-protein-multiplexes have both static and dynamic motility fluctuations. The loss of the fast vesicle-transport along the microtubule can be a mechanism of neurodegenerative disorders associated with tau-hyperphosphorylation.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lotka-Volterra Systems with Time Correlated Stochastic Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the dynamics of species abundances within ecological communities using the Generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) model. At variance with previous approaches, we present an analysis of stochastic GLV dynamics with temporal fluctuations in interaction strengths between species. We develop a dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) tailored for scenarios with annealed colored noise and simple functional responses. We show that time-dependent interactions can be effectively modeled as environmental noise in the DMFT and we obtain analytical predictions for the species abundance distribution that well matches empirical observations. Our results suggest that environmental noise favors species coexistence and allows to overcome the complexity-stability paradox, especially in comparison to dynamics with quenched disorder. This study offers new insights not only into the modeling of large ecosystem dynamics, but also proposes novel methodologies for examining ecological systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of vibrationally assisted energy transfer by proximity to exceptional points, probed by fluorescence-detected vibrational spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02819v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emulation of energy transfer processes in natural systems on quantum platforms can further our understanding of complex dynamics in nature. One notable example is the demonstration of vibrationally assisted energy transfer (VAET) on a trapped-ion quantum emulator, which offers insights for the energetics of light harvesting. In this work, we expand the study of VAET simulation with trapped ions to a non-Hermitian quantum system comprising a $\mathscr{PT}$-symmetric chromophore dimer weakly coupled to a vibrational mode. We first characterize exceptional points (EPs) and non- Hermitian features of the excitation energy transfer processes in the absence of the vibration, finding a degenerate pair of second-order EPs. Exploring the non-Hermitian dynamics of the whole system including vibrations, we find that energy transfer accompanied by absorption of phonons from a vibrational mode can be significantly enhanced near such a degenerate EP. Our calculations reveal a unique spectral feature accompanying the coalescing of eigenstates and eigenenergies that provides a novel approach to probe the degenerate EP by fluorescence-detected vibrational spectroscopy. Enhancement of the VAET process near the EP is found to be due to maximal favorability of phonon absorption at the degenerate EP, enabling multiple simultaneous excitations. Our work on improving VAET processes in non-Hermitian quantum systems paves the way for leveraging non-Hermiticity in quantum dynamics related to excitation energy transfer.</description>

      <title>Shaping an evanescent focus of light for high spatial resolution optogenetic activations in live cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confining light illumination in the three dimensions of space is a challenge for various applications. Among these, optogenetic methods developed for live experiments in cell biology would benefit from such a localized illumination as it would improve the spatial resolution of diffusive photosensitive proteins leading to spatially constrained biological responses in specific subcellular organelles. Here, we describe a method to create and move a focused evanescent spot across the field of view of a high numerical aperture microscope objective, using a digital micro-mirror device (DMD). We show that, after correcting the optical aberrations, light is confined within a spot of sub-micron lateral size and $\sim$100~nm axial depth, resulting in a volume of illumination drastically smaller than the one generated by a standard propagative focus. This evanescent focus is sufficient to induce a more intense and localized recruitment compared to a propagative focus on the optogenetic system CRY2-CIBN, improving the resolution of its pattern of activation.</description>

      <title>Transitions and Thermodynamics on Species Graphs of Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) exhibit complex dynamics governed by their underlying network structure. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to study the dynamics of CRNs by representing them on species graphs (S-graphs). By scaling concentrations by conservation laws, we obtain a graph representation of transitions compatible with the S-graph, which allows us to treat the dynamics in CRNs as transitions between chemicals. We also define thermodynamic-like quantities on the S-graph from the introduced transitions and investigate their properties, including the relationship between specieswise forces, activities, and conventional thermodynamic quantities. Remarkably, we demonstrate that this formulation can be developed for a class of irreversible CRNs, while for reversible CRNs, it is related to conventional thermodynamic quantities associated with reactions. The behavior of these specieswise quantities is numerically validated using an oscillating system (Brusselator). Our work provides a novel methodology for studying dynamics on S-graphs, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the intricate interplay between the structure and dynamics of chemical reaction networks.</description>
