      <title>Quantitative Edge Eigenvector Universality for Random Regular Graphs: Berry-Esseen Bounds with Explicit Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the first quantitative Berry-Esseen bounds for edge eigenvector statistics in random regular graphs. For any $d$-regular graph on $N$ vertices with fixed $d \geq 3$ and deterministic unit vector $\mathbf{q} \perp \mathbf{e}$, we prove that the normalized overlap $\sqrt{N}\langle \mathbf{q}, \mathbf{u}_2 \rangle$ satisfies \[ \sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} \left|\mathbb{P}\left(\sqrt{N}\langle \mathbf{q}, \mathbf{u}_2 \rangle \leq x\right) - \Phi(x)\right| \leq C_d N^{-1/6+\varepsilon} \] where $\mathbf{u}_2$ is the second eigenvector and $C_d \leq \tilde{C}d^3\varepsilon^{-10}$ for an absolute constant $\tilde{C}$. This provides the first explicit convergence rate for the recent edge eigenvector universality results of He, Huang, and Yau \cite{HHY25}.
  Our proof introduces a single-scale comparison method using constrained Dyson Brownian motion that preserves the degree constraint $\tilde{H}_t\mathbf{e} = 0$ throughout the evolution. The key technical innovation is a sharp edge isotropic local law with explicit constant $C(d,\varepsilon) \leq \tilde{C}d\varepsilon^{-5}$, enabling precise control of eigenvector overlap dynamics.
  At the critical time $t_* = N^{-1/3+\varepsilon}$, we perform a fourth-order cumulant comparison with constrained GOE, achieving optimal error bounds through a single comparison rather than the traditional multi-scale approach. We extend our results to joint universality for the top $K$ edge eigenvectors with $K \leq N^{1/10-\delta}$, showing they converge to independent Gaussians. Through analysis of eigenvalue spacing barriers, critical time scales, and comparison across multiple proof methods, we provide evidence that the $N^{-1/6}$ rate is optimal for sparse regular graphs. All constants are tracked explicitly throughout, enabling finite-size applications in spectral algorithms and network analysis.</description>

      <title>Multi-type logistic branching processes with selection: frequency process and genealogy for large carrying capacities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model for growth in a multi-species population. We consider two types evolving as a logistic branching process with mutation, where one of the types has a selective advantage, and are interested in the regime in which the carrying capacity of the system goes to $\infty$. We first study the genealogy of the population up until it almost reaches carrying capacity through a coupling with an independent branching process. We then focus on the phase in which the population has reached carrying capacity. After recovering a Gillespie--Wright--Fisher SDE in the infinite carrying capacity limit, we construct the Ancestral Selection Graph and show the convergence of the lineage counting process to the moment dual of the limiting diffusion.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the existence and uniqueness of random-field solutions to the elliptic SPDE $-\mathcal{L}u=\dot{\xi}$ on a bounded domain $D$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions $u=0$ on $\partial D$, driven by symmetric L\'evy noise $\dot{\xi}$. Under general sufficient conditions on the coefficients of the second-order operator $\mathcal{L}$, we prove the existence of a mild solution via the corresponding Green's function and show that the same framework applies to the spectral fractional Laplacian of power $\gamma \in (0,\infty)$. In particular, whenever $\gamma&gt;\tfrac{d}{2}$, the solution admits a continuous modification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show well-posedness for McKean--Vlasov equations with rough common noise and progressively measurable coefficients. Our results are valid under natural regularity assumptions on the coefficients, in agreement with the respective requirements of Ito and rough path theory. To achieve these goals, we work in the framework of rough stochastic differential equations recently developed by the authors of this article.</description>

Abstract: Liouville Brownian motion (LBM) is the canonical diffusion process on a Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) surface. In this work, we establish upper and lower bounds for the heat kernel for LBM when $\gamma=\sqrt{8/3}$ in terms of the $\sqrt{8/3}$-LQG metric which are sharp up to a polylogarithmic factor in the exponential.</description>

      <title>The Directed Spanning Forest: coalescence versus dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $p\in[1,\infty]$, the $\ell^p$ directed spanning forest (DSF) of dimension $d\geq 2$ is an oriented random geometric graph whose vertex set is given by a homogeneous Poisson point process $\mathcal N$ on $\mathbb R^d$ and whose edges consist of all pairs $(x, y)\in\mathcal N^2$ such that $y$ is the closest point to $x$ in $\mathcal N$ for the $\ell^p$ distance among points with a strictly larger $e_d$ coordinate. First introduced by Baccelli and Bordenave in 2007 in the case $p=d=2$, this graph has a natural forest structure. In this work, we study the number of disjoint trees in the $\ell^p$ DSF for arbitrary dimensions $d\geq2$ and various values of $p\in [1,\infty]$. We prove that for $p\in\{1, 2,\infty\}$, the graph is almost surely a tree when $d=3$, and consists of infinitely many disjoint trees when $d\geq 4$. Additionally, we show that for all $p\in[1,\infty]$, the DSF in dimension $2$ is almost surely a tree and, under appropriate diffusive scaling, converges weakly to the Brownian web, generalizing the result previously known for p=2. Although these results were expected from a heuristic point of view, and the main strategies and tools were largely understood, extending them beyond the planar setting ($d=2$) and to the singular case $p=\infty$ presented a significant challenge. Notably, in the absence of planarity, which plays a crucial role in existing arguments, delicate and innovative techniques were required to manage the complex geometric dependencies of the model. We develop substantially new ideas to handle arbitrary dimension $d\geq2$ and various values of $p\in [1,\infty]$ within a unified framework. In particular, we introduce a novel stochastic domination argument that allows us to compare the fully dependent model with a simplified version in which the geometric correlations are suppressed.</description>

      <title>Shape optimization of metastable states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The definition of metastable states is an ubiquitous task in the design and analysis of molecular simulation, and is a crucial input in a variety of acceleration methods for the sampling of long configurational trajectories.
  Although standard definitions based on local energy minimization procedures can sometimes be used, these definitions are typically suboptimal, or entirely inadequate when entropic effects are significant, or when the lowest energy barriers are quickly overcome by thermal fluctuations.
  In this work, we propose an approach to the definition of metastable states, based on the shape-optimization of a local separation of timescale metric directly linked to the efficiency of a class of accelerated molecular dynamics algorithms.
  To realize this approach, we derive analytic expressions for shape-variations of Dirichlet eigenvalues for a class of operators associated with reversible elliptic diffusions, and use them to construct a local ascent algorithm, explicitly treating the case of multiple eigenvalues.
  We propose two methods to make our method tractable in high-dimensional systems: one based on dynamical coarse-graining, the other on recently obtained low-temperature shape-sensitive spectral asymptotics.
  We validate our method on a benchmark biomolecular system, showcasing a significant improvement over conventional definitions of metastable states.</description>

      <title>Finite-Dimensional Gaussian Approximation for Deep Neural Networks: Universality in Random Weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Finite-Dimensional Distributions (FDDs) of deep neural networks with randomly initialized weights that have finite-order moments. Specifically, we establish Gaussian approximation bounds in the Wasserstein-$1$ norm between the FDDs and their Gaussian limit assuming a Lipschitz activation function and allowing the layer widths to grow to infinity at arbitrary relative rates. In the special case where all widths are proportional to a common scale parameter $n$ and there are $L-1$ hidden layers, we obtain convergence rates of order $n^{-({1}/{6})^{L-1} + \epsilon}$, for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Langevin midpoint methods using an anticipative Girsanov theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method for analyzing midpoint discretizations of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which are frequently used in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from a target measure $\pi \propto \exp(-V)$. Borrowing techniques from Malliavin calculus, we compute estimates for the Radon-Nikodym derivative for processes on $L^2([0, T); \mathbb{R}^d)$ which may anticipate the Brownian motion, in the sense that they may not be adapted to the filtration at the same time. Applying these to various popular midpoint discretizations, we are able to improve the regularity and cross-regularity results in the literature on sampling methods. We also obtain a query complexity bound of $\widetilde{O}(\frac{\kappa^{5/4} d^{1/4}}{\varepsilon^{1/2}})$ for obtaining a $\varepsilon^2$-accurate sample in $\mathsf{KL}$ divergence, under log-concavity and strong smoothness assumptions for $\nabla^2 V$.</description>

      <title>The Centrality Paradox: Why Your Friends Are Always More Important</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical friendship paradox which states that on an average one's friends have at least as many friends as oneself and generalize it to a variety of network centrality measures. In particular, we show that for any irreducible, undirected graph $G$, the "friends-average" of degree, eigenvector-centrality, walk-count, Katz, and PageRank centralities exceeds the global average. We show that the result follows from the variational characterisation of the eigenvector corresponding to the Perron eigenvalue.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we examine a class of $\alpha$-potential stochastic differential games with random coefficients via the backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) approach. Specifically, we show that the first and second order linear derivatives of the objective function for each player can be expressed through the corresponding first and second-order adjoint equations, which leads to rigorous estimates for $\alpha$. We illustrate the dependence of $\alpha$ on game characteristics through detailed analysis of linear-quadratic games, and with common noise.</description>

      <title>On Accelerated Mixing of the No-U-turn Sampler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress on the theory of variational hypocoercivity established that Randomized Hamiltonian Monte Carlo -- at criticality -- can achieve pronounced acceleration in its convergence and hence sampling performance over diffusive dynamics. Manual critical tuning being unfeasible in practice has motivated automated algorithmic solutions, notably the No-U-turn Sampler. Beyond its empirical success, a rigorous study of this method's ability to achieve accelerated convergence has been missing. We initiate this investigation combining a concentration of measure approach to examine the automatic tuning mechanism with a coupling based mixing analysis for Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. In certain Gaussian target distributions, this yields a precise characterization of the sampler's behavior resulting, in particular, in rigorous mixing guarantees describing the algorithm's ability and limitations in achieving accelerated convergence.</description>

      <title>Long-time analysis of a pair of on-lattice and continuous run-and-tumble particles with jamming interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Run-and-Tumble Particles (RTPs) are a key model of active matter. They are characterized by alternating phases of linear travel and random direction reshuffling. By this dynamic behavior, they break time reversibility and energy conservation at the microscopic level. It leads to complex out-of-equilibrium phenomena such as collective motion, pattern formation, and motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). In this work, we study two fundamental dynamical models of a pair of RTPs with jamming interactions and provide a rigorous link between their discrete- and continuous-space descriptions. We demonstrate that as the lattice spacing vanishes, the discrete models converge to a continuous RTP model on the torus, described by a Piecewise Deterministic Markov Process (PDMP). This establishes that the invariant measures of the discrete models converge to that of the continuous model, which reveals finite mass at jamming configurations and exponential decay away from them. This indicates effective attraction, which is consistent with MIPS. Furthermore, we quantitatively explore the convergence towards the invariant measure. Such convergence study is critical for understanding and characterizing how MIPS emerges over time. Because RTP systems are non-reversible, usual methods may fail or are limited to qualitative results. Instead, we adopt a coupling approach to obtain more accurate, non-asymptotic bounds on mixing times. The findings thus provide deeper theoretical insights into the mixing times of these RTP systems, revealing the presence of both persistent and diffusive regimes.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations of Cover Time of Tori in Dimensions $d\geq 3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider large deviations of the cover time of the discrete torus $(\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^d$, $d \geq 3$ by simple random walk. We prove a lower bound on the probability that the cover time is smaller than $\gamma\in (0,1)$ times its expected value, with exponents matching the upper bound from [Goodman-den Hollander, Probab. Theory Related Fields (2014)] and [Comets-Gallesco-Popov-Vachkovskaia, Electron. J. Probab. (2013)]. Moreover, we derive sharp asymptotics for $\gamma \in (\frac{d+2}{2d},1)$. The strong coupling of the random walk on the torus and random interlacements developed in a recent work [Pr\'evost-Rodriguez-Sousi, arXiv:2309.03192] serves as an important ingredient in the proofs.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear SPDEs and Maximal Regularity: An Extended Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18561v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this survey, we provide an in-depth exposition of our recent results on the well-posedness theory for stochastic evolution equations, employing maximal regularity techniques. The core of our approach is an abstract notion of critical spaces, which, when applied to nonlinear SPDEs, coincides with the concept of scaling-invariant spaces. This framework leads to several sharp blow-up criteria and enables one to obtain instantaneous regularization results. Additionally, we refine and unify our previous results, while also presenting several new contributions.
  In the second part of the survey, we apply the abstract results to several concrete SPDEs. In particular, we give applications to stochastic perturbations of quasi-geostrophic equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and reaction-diffusion systems (including Allen--Cahn, Cahn--Hilliard and Lotka--Volterra models). Moreover, for the Navier--Stokes equations, we establish new Serrin-type blow-up criteria. While some applications are addressed using $L^2$-theory, many require a more general $L^p(L^q)$-framework. In the final section, we outline several open problems, covering both abstract aspects of stochastic evolution equations, and concrete questions in the study of linear and nonlinear SPDEs.</description>

      <title>A sharper Lyapunov-Katz central limit error bound for i.i.d. summands Zolotarev-close to normal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06653v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a central limit error bound for convolution powers of laws with finite moments of order $r \in \mathopen]2,3\mathclose]$, taking a closeness of the laws to normality into account. Up to a universal constant, this generalises the case of $r=3$ of the sharpening of the Berry (1941) - Esseen (1942) theorem obtained by Mattner (2024), namely by sharpening here the Katz (1963) error bound for the i.i.d. case of Lyapunov's (1901) theorem. Our proof uses a partial generalisation of the theorem of Senatov and Zolotarev (1986) used for the earlier special case. A result more general than our main one could be obtained by using instead another theorem of Senatov (1980), but unfortunately an auxiliary inequality used in the latter's proof is wrong.</description>

      <title>Spectral Gap for the Stochastic Exchange Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a spectral gap inequality for the stochastic exchange model studied by Gaspard and Gilbert and by Grigo, Khanin and Sz\'asz in connection with understanding heat conduction in a deterministic billiards model. The bound on the spectral gap that we prove is uniform in the number of particles, as had been conjectured. We adapt techniques that were originally developed to prove spectral gap bounds for the Kac model with hard sphere collisions, which, like the stochastic exchange model, has degenerate jump rates.</description>

      <title>Discrete snakes with globally centered displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a scaling limit for globally centered discrete snakes on size-conditioned critical Bienaym\'e trees. More specifically, under a global finite variance condition, we prove convergence in the sense of random finite-dimensional distributions of the head of the discrete snake (suitably rescaled) to the head of the Brownian snake driven by a Brownian excursion. When the third moment of the offspring distribution is finite, we further prove uniform functional convergence under a necessary tail condition on the displacements. We also consider displacement distributions with heavier tails, for which we instead obtain convergence to a variant of the hairy snake introduced by Janson and Marckert. We further give two applications of our main result. Firstly, we obtain a scaling limit for the difference between the height process and the {\L}ukasiewicz path of a size-conditioned critical Bienaym\'e tree. Secondly, we obtain a scaling limit for the difference between the height process of a size-conditioned critical Bienaym\'e tree and the height process of its associated looptree.</description>

      <title>Admission Control for A Single Server Waiting Time Process in Heavy Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address a single server queue control problem (QCP) in heavy traffic originating from Lee and Weerasinghe (2011). The state process represents the offered waiting time, the customer arrival has a state-dependent intensity, and the customers' service and patience times are i.i.d with general distributions. We introduce an infinite-horizon discounted cost functional consisting of a control cost generated from the use of control and a penalty for idleness cost. Our primary goal is to tackle the QCP, taking into account a non-trivial control cost and a non-increasing cost function resulting from the control mechanisms in the waiting time. Under mild assumptions, the heavy traffic limit of the QCP yields a stochastic control problem described by a diffusion process, which we call a diffusion control problem (DCP). We find the optimal control of the associated DCP by incorporating the Legendre-Fenchel transform and a formal Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. Then, we ``translate'' this optimal strategy to the QCP, of which we obtain an asymptotically optimal policy. Apart from theoretical results, we also examine the REINFORCE algorithm, a Reinforcement learning (RL) approach, for solving stochastic controls motivated by recent literature. We highlight the advantages and limitations of simulation from theoretical results and data-driven algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Volterra equations (SVEs) serve as mathematical models for the time evolutions of random systems with memory effects and irregular behaviour. We introduce neural stochastic Volterra equations as a physics-inspired architecture, generalizing the class of neural stochastic differential equations, and provide some theoretical foundation. Numerical experiments on various SVEs, like the disturbed pendulum equation, the generalized Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, the rough Heston model and a monetary reserve dynamics, are presented, comparing the performance of neural SVEs, neural SDEs and Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets).</description>

      <title>Characterizing Dynamical Stability of Stochastic Gradient Descent in Overparameterized Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20209v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For overparameterized optimization tasks, such as those found in modern machine learning, global minima are generally not unique. In order to understand generalization in these settings, it is vital to study to which minimum an optimization algorithm converges. The possibility of having minima that are unstable under the dynamics imposed by the optimization algorithm limits the potential minima that the algorithm can find. In this paper, we characterize the global minima that are dynamically stable/unstable for both deterministic and stochastic gradient descent (SGD). In particular, we introduce a characteristic Lyapunov exponent that depends on the local dynamics around a global minimum and rigorously prove that the sign of this Lyapunov exponent determines whether SGD can accumulate at the respective global minimum.</description>

      <title>Rigidity for Patterson--Sullivan systems with applications to random walks and entropy rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce Patterson--Sullivan systems, which consist of a group action on a compact metrizable space and a quasi-invariant measure which behaves like a classical Patterson--Sullivan measure. For such systems we prove a generalization of Tukia's measurable boundary rigidity theorem. We then apply this generalization to (1) study the singularity conjecture for Patterson--Sullivan measures (or, conformal densities) and stationary measures of random walks on isometry groups of Gromov hyperbolic spaces, mapping class groups, and discrete subgroups of semisimple Lie groups; (2) prove versions of Tukia's theorem for word hyperbolic groups, Teichm\"uller spaces, and higher rank symmetric spaces; and (3) prove an entropy rigidity result for pseudo-Riemannian hyperbolic spaces.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference for Latent Variable Models in High Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational inference (VI) is a popular method for approximating intractable posterior distributions in Bayesian inference and probabilistic machine learning. In this paper, we introduce a general framework for quantifying the statistical accuracy of mean-field variational inference (MFVI) for posterior approximation in Bayesian latent variable models with categorical local latent variables (and arbitrary global latent variables). Utilizing our general framework, we capture the exact regime where MFVI 'works' for the celebrated latent Dirichlet allocation model. Focusing on the mixed membership stochastic blockmodel, we show that the vanilla fully factorized MFVI, often used in the literature, is suboptimal. We propose a partially grouped VI algorithm for this model and show that it works, and derive its exact finite-sample performance. We further illustrate that our bounds are tight for both the above models. Our proof techniques, which extend the framework of nonlinear large deviations, open the door for the analysis of MFVI in other latent variable models.</description>

      <title>Edgeworth corrections for the spiked eigenvalues of non-Gaussian sample covariance matrices with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Yang and Johnstone (2018) established an Edgeworth correction for the largest sample eigenvalue in a spiked covariance model under the assumption of Gaussian observations, leaving the extension to non-Gaussian settings as an open problem. In this paper, we address this issue by establishing first-order Edgeworth expansions for spiked eigenvalues in both single-spike and multi-spike scenarios with non-Gaussian data. Leveraging these expansions, we construct more accurate confidence intervals for the population spiked eigenvalues and propose a novel estimator for the number of spikes. Simulation studies demonstrate that our proposed methodology outperforms existing approaches in both robustness and accuracy across a wide range of settings, particularly in low-dimensional cases.</description>
