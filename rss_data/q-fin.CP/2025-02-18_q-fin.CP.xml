      <title>A Sea of Coins: The Proliferation of Cryptocurrencies in UniswapV2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain technology has revolutionized financial markets by enabling decentralized exchanges (DEXs) that operate without intermediaries. Uniswap V2, a leading DEX, facilitates the rapid creation and trading of new tokens, offering high return potential but exposing investors to significant risks. In this work, we analyze the financial impact of newly created tokens, assessing their market dynamics, profitability and liquidity manipulations. Our findings reveal that a significant portion of market liquidity is trapped in honeypots, reducing market efficiency and misleading investors. Applying a simple buy-and-hold strategy, we are able to uncover some major risks associated with investing in newly created tokens, including the widespread presence of rug pulls and sandwich attacks. We extract the optimal sandwich amount, revealing that their proliferation in new tokens stems from higher profitability in low-liquidity pools. Furthermore, we analyze the fundamental differences between token price evolution in swap time and physical time. Using clustering techniques, we highlight these differences and identify typical patterns of honeypot and sellable tokens. Our study provides insights into the risks and financial dynamics of decentralized markets and their challenges for investors.</description>

      <title>A deep BSDE approach for the simultaneous pricing and delta-gamma hedging of large portfolios consisting of high-dimensional multi-asset Bermudan options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A deep BSDE approach is presented for the pricing and delta-gamma hedging of high-dimensional Bermudan options, with applications in portfolio risk management. Large portfolios of a mixture of multi-asset European and Bermudan derivatives are cast into the framework of discretely reflected BSDEs. This system is discretized by the One Step Malliavin scheme (Negyesi et al. [2024, 2025]) of discretely reflected Markovian BSDEs, which involves a $\Gamma$ process, corresponding to second-order sensitivities of the associated option prices. The discretized system is solved by a neural network regression Monte Carlo method, efficiently for a large number of underlyings. The resulting option Deltas and Gammas are used to discretely rebalance the corresponding replicating strategies. Numerical experiments are presented on both high-dimensional basket options and large portfolios consisting of multiple options with varying early exercise rights, moneyness and volatility. These examples demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the method up to $100$ risk factors. The resulting hedging strategies significantly outperform benchmark methods both in the case of standard delta- and delta-gamma hedging.</description>

      <title>Trend-encoded Probabilistic Multi-order Model: A Non-Machine Learning Approach for Enhanced Stock Market Forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the dominance of machine learning in stock market forecasting has been evident. While these models have shown decreasing prediction errors, their robustness across different datasets has been a concern. A successful stock market prediction model minimizes prediction errors and showcases robustness across various data sets, indicating superior forecasting performance. This study introduces a novel multiple lag order probabilistic model based on trend encoding (TeMoP) that enhances stock market predictions through a probabilistic approach. Results across different stock indexes from nine countries demonstrate that the TeMoP outperforms the state-of-the-art machine learning models in predicting accuracy and stabilization.</description>
