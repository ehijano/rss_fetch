      <title>Annealed and quenched representations of the Gauss-R\'enyi measure by "periodic points"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider independently identically distributed random compositions of the Gauss and R\'enyi maps that generate random continued fractions. Using methods of ergodic theory, thermodynamic formalism and large deviations, we show that weighted cycles of this random dynamical system equidistribute with respect to the Gauss-R\'enyi measure. We present both annealed (sample-averaged) and quenched (samplewise) results.</description>

      <title>Flows with minimal subdynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a countably infinite discrete group. A $\Gamma$-flow $X$ (i.e., a nonempty compact Hausdorff space equipped with a continuous action of $\Gamma$) is called $S$-minimal for a subset $S \subseteq \Gamma$ if the partial orbit $S \cdot x$ is dense for every point $x \in X$. We show that for any countable family $(S_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ of infinite subsets of $\Gamma$, there exists a free $\Gamma$-flow $X$ that is $S_n$-minimal for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$; additionally, $X$ can be taken to be a subflow of $2^\Gamma$. This vastly generalizes a result of Frisch, Seward, and Zucker, in which each $S_n$ is required to be a normal subgroup of $\Gamma$. As a corollary, we show that for a given Polish $\Gamma$-flow $X$, there exists a free $\Gamma$-flow $Y$ disjoint from $X$ in the sense of Furstenberg if and only if $X$ has no wandering points. This completes a line of inquiry started by Glasner, Tsankov, Weiss, and Zucker. As another application, we strengthen some of the results of Gao, Jackson, Krohne, and Seward on the structure of Borel complete sections. For example, we show that if $B$ is a Borel complete section in the free part of $2^\Gamma$, then every union of sufficiently many shifts of $B$ contains an orbit (previously, this was only known for open sets $B$). Although our main results are purely dynamical, their proofs rely on recently developed machinery from descriptive set-theoretic combinatorics, namely the asymptotic separation index introduced by Conley, Jackson, Marks, Seward, and Tucker-Drob and its links to the Lov\'{a}sz Local Lemma.</description>

      <title>Phasor notation of Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is a powerful, data-driven method for diagnosing complex dynamics. Various DMD algorithms allow one to fit data with a low-rank model that decomposes it into a sum of coherent spatiotemporal patterns. Nominally, each rank of the DMD model is interpreted as a complex, stationary spatial mode modulated by a single set of complex time dynamics (consisting of exponential growth/decay and oscillation), and an amplitude. However, the specifics of how these DMD components are interpreted do not appear to be consistent with the information actually present in the DMD decomposition or the underlying data. While there is a clear physical interpretation for the complex time dynamics, there is practically no guidance on the complex spatial modes. To resolve these issues, we introduce the phasor notation of the DMD model for conjugate pair DMD modes, which results in a strictly positive and real spatial pattern as well as spatiotemporal waveform. The phasor notation terms result in an interpretable DMD model that provides a more complete diagnoses of the model components, as demonstrated on a toy model. This DMD interpretation needs to be adjusted for DMD variants which alter the relationship between the DMD model and the data, such as those that window data in time. We derive the phasor notation terms for one such method, multi-resolution Coherent Spatiotemporal Scale-separation, and demonstrate the new terms by interpreting a multi-scale data set.</description>

      <title>On the Spectrum of Schr\"{o}dinger Operators Interacting at Two Distinct Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger operators of the form $\Delta - W$ on $L^2_{\text{rad}}(\mathbb{R}^3)$, the space of radially symmetric square integrable functions are relevant in a variety of physical contexts. The potential $W$ is taken to be radially symmetric (i.e. $W(x) = W(|x|)$) and to decompose into two components with distinct spatial scales: $W=W_\varepsilon= V_0+V_{1,\varepsilon}$. The second component $V_{1,\varepsilon}(|x|) = \varepsilon^2V_1(\varepsilon |x|)$ represents a scaled potential that becomes increasingly delocalized as $\varepsilon \to 0$. We will assume that both potentials $V_0(r), V_1(r)$ exhibit certain decay properties as $r \to \infty$. We show how the eigenvalue count on the positive real axis is built out of the spectra associated with the two reduced eigenvalue problems on their separate scales. The result is that the total number of eigenvalues of $\Delta - W$ is the sum of the number of positive eigenvalues of $\Delta - V_0$ and $\Delta - V_1$. Our analysis combines dynamical systems techniques with a separation of scales argument, providing a novel framework for studying spectral properties of differential operators where multiple spatial scales interact.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Continuum of States and Intuitionistic Flows in a Cognitive Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a rigorous mathematical framework for an abstract continuous evolution of an internal state, inspired by the intuitive notion of a flowing thought sequence. Using tools from topology, functional analysis, measure theory, and logic, we formalize an indefinitely proceeding sequence of states as a non-linear continuum with rich structure. In our development, a trajectory of states is modeled as a continuous mapping on a topological state space (a potentially infinite-dimensional Banach space) and is further conceptualized intuitionistically as a choice sequence not fixed in advance. We establish fundamental properties of these state flows, including existence and uniqueness of evolutions under certain continuity conditions (via a Banach fixed-point argument), non-measurability results (demonstrating the impossibility of assigning a classical measure to all subsets of the continuum of states), and logical semantic frameworks (defining a Tarskian truth definition for propositions about states). Throughout, we draw on ideas of Brouwer, Banach, Tarski, Poincar\'e, Hadamard, and others--blending intuitionistic perspective with classical analysis--to rigorously capture a continuous, ever-evolving process of an abstract cognitive state without resorting to category-theoretic notions.</description>

      <title>Regularization of Port-Hamiltonian Descriptor Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the regularization problem for port-Hamiltonian descriptor systems by proportional and/or derivative output feedback. Necessary and sufficient conditions are given, which guarantee that there exist output feedbacks such that the closed-loop system is regular, has index at most one, and is still port-Hamiltonian with desired rank properties. All results are derived based on condensed forms, computations of these condensed form can be implemented using only orthogonal transformations and hence are numerically reliable.</description>

      <title>Modeling of radiating curved cables via coupled telegrapher's and Maxwell's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electromagnetic interactions of cable harnesses in the time domain. We present a novel model that allows for curved cables, extending the standard assumptions typically made in transmission line modeling. The cables are described by the telegrapher's equations, the classical model for transmission lines, driven by input signals implemented through appropriate boundary conditions, such as imposed voltages at cable ends. The cables interact via electromagnetic radiation; the latter is determined by Maxwell's equations. This interaction is incorporated into the model through boundary conditions imposed on the electromagnetic field. The resulting coupling between the transmission lines and Maxwell's equations is energetically consistent. In particular, we show that the coupled system satisfies a global power balance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper, based upon an unpublished manuscript by Maurice Heins, answers a question posed by Valiron about the dynamics of parabolic self-maps of the unit disk in the complex plane, considerably simplifying arguments previously used for answering the same question. The main new tool introduced is the notion of left straightening of a sequence of iterates, that can be effectively employed for studying the hyperbolic step of a parabolic map.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Infection Spread and Hotspot Growth in Bi-Pathogen Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the spatio-temporal evolution of epidemics with multiple pathogens requires not only new theoretical models but also careful analysis of their practical consequences. Building on the Multiplex Bi-Virus Reaction-Diffusion framework (MBRD) introduced in our companion paper, we investigate how the super-infection model (MBRD-SI) and the co-infection model (MBRD-CI) behave under different epidemiological and network conditions. Through numerical experiments, we study the effects of pathogen virulence, diffusion rates, and cross-diffusion on epidemic hotspot formation and long-term prevalence. Our results highlight the role of multiplex structure in amplifying or suppressing co-circulating infections, and provide quantitative insight into conditions that drive persistent epidemic patterns. Beyond epidemiology, these findings have broader implications for multiplex contagion processes such as information diffusion and malware propagation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper investigates a generalization of the classical Sitnikov problem, concentrating on the movement of a satellite along the Z-axis as it interacts with $n$ primary bodies in periodic motion. It establishes the existence of an infinite number of even and anti-periodic solutions with increasing periods. The proof employs the Leray-Schauder degree theory to trace the critical points of action functionals, using a homotopy from solutions when the primary bodies are transformed into circular orbits.</description>

      <title>Almost automorphic subshifts with finiteness conditions for the boundary of the separating cover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article we study orbits of proximal pairs in almost automorphic subshifts. The corresponding orbits in the maximal equicontinuous factor are precisely those orbits that intersect the boundary of the subshift's separating cover. We impose certain finiteness conditions on this boundary and explore the resulting consequences for the subshift, for instance in terms of complexity or the relations between proximal and asymptotic pairs. The last part of our article deals with Toeplitz subshifts without a finite boundary. There we treat the question of necessary conditions and sufficient conditions for the existence of a factor subshift with a finite boundary. Throughout the whole article, we provide explicit constructions for Toeplitz subshifts to illustrate our findings and the necessity of our assumptions.</description>

      <title>Particle, kinetic and hydrodynamic models for sea ice floes. Part I: Non-rotating floes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21809v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive modeling framework for the dynamics of sea ice floes using particle, kinetic, and hydrodynamic approaches. Building upon the foundational work of Ha and Tadmor on the Cucker-Smale model for flocking, we derive a Vlasov-type kinetic formulation and a corresponding hydrodynamic description. The particle model incorporates essential physical properties of sea ice floes, including size, position, velocity, and interactions governed by Newtonian mechanics. By extending these principles, the kinetic model captures large-scale features through the phase-space distribution, and we also present a hydrodynamic model using the velocity moments and a suitable closure condition. In this paper, as an idea-introductory step, we assume that ice floes are non-rotating and focus on the linear velocity dynamics. Our approach highlights the role of contact forces, ocean drag effects, and conservation laws in the multiscale description of sea ice dynamics, offering a potential pathway for the improved understanding and prediction of sea ice behaviors in changing climatic conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a closed hyperbolic 3-manifold. Let $\nu_{Gr(M)}$ denote the probability volume (Haar) measure of the 2-plane Grassmann bundle $Gr(M)$ of $M$ and let $\nu_T$ denote the area measure on $Gr(M)$ of an immersed closed totally geodesic surface $T\subset M$. We say a sequence of $\pi_1$-injective maps $f_i:S_i\to M$ of surfaces $S_i$ is asymptotically Fuchsian if $f_i$ is $K_i$-quasifuchsian with $K_i\to 1$ as $i\to \infty$. We show that the set of weak-* limits of the probability area measures induced on $Gr(M)$ by asymptotically Fuchsian minimal or pleated maps $f_i:S_i\to M$ of closed connected surfaces $S_i$ consists of all convex combinations of $\nu_{Gr(M)}$ and the $\nu_T$.</description>

      <title>FlowKac: An Efficient Neural Fokker-Planck solver using Temporal Normalizing Flows and the Feynman-Kac Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving the Fokker-Planck equation for high-dimensional complex dynamical systems remains a pivotal yet challenging task due to the intractability of analytical solutions and the limitations of traditional numerical methods. In this work, we present FlowKac, a novel approach that reformulates the Fokker-Planck equation using the Feynman-Kac formula, allowing to query the solution at a given point via the expected values of stochastic paths. A key innovation of FlowKac lies in its adaptive stochastic sampling scheme which significantly reduces the computational complexity while maintaining high accuracy. This sampling technique, coupled with a time-indexed normalizing flow, designed for capturing time-evolving probability densities, enables robust sampling of collocation points, resulting in a flexible and mesh-free solver. This formulation mitigates the curse of dimensionality and enhances computational efficiency and accuracy, which is particularly crucial for applications that inherently require dimensions beyond the conventional three. We validate the robustness and scalability of our method through various experiments on a range of stochastic differential equations, demonstrating significant improvements over existing techniques.</description>

Abstract: Let the infinite convolutions \begin{equation*}

  be generated by the sequence of pairs \(\{ (R_k,D_k) \}_{k=1}^{\infty} \), where $ R_k\in M_n(\mathbb{Z})$ is an expanding integer matric, $D_k$ is a finite integer digit sets that satisfies the following two conditions: (i). \( \# D_k = m \) and \( m&gt;2 \) is a prime; (ii). \( \{x: \sum_{d\in D_{k}}e^{2\pi i\langle d,x \rangle}=0\} =\cup_{i=1}^{\phi(k)}\cup_{j=1}^{m-1}(\frac{j}{m}\nu_{k,i}+\mathbb{Z}^{n}) \) for some \( \nu_{k,i} \in \{ (l_1, \cdots, l_n)^t : l_i \in [1, m-1] \cap \mathbb{Z}, 1\leq i\leq n \} \). In this paper, we study the spectrality of $\mu_{\{R_{k}\},\{D_{k}\}}$, and some necessary and sufficient conditions for \( L^{2}(\mu_{\{R_{k}\},\{D_{k}\}}) \) to have an orthogonal exponential function basis are established. Finally, we discuss the explanations and applications of our results.</description>
