      <title>Atomic state interferometry for complex vector light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Features of complex vector light become important in any interference effects, including scattering, diffraction, and non-linear processes. Here we are investigating the role of polarization-structured light in atomic state interferometers. Unlike optical or atomic path interferometers, these facilitate local interference between atomic transition amplitudes and hence the orthogonal optical polarization components driving these transitions. We develop a fully analytical description for the inter action of generalized structured light with an atomic four state system, that is multiply connected via optical as well as magnetic transitions. Our model allows us to identify spatially dependent dark states, associated with spatially structured absorption coefficients, which are defined by the geometry of the polarization state and the magnetic field direction. We illustrate this for a range of optical beams including polarization vortices, optical skyrmions and polarization lattices. This results in a new interpretation and an enhanced understanding of atomic state interferometry, and a versatile mechanism to modify and control optical absorption as a function of polarization and magnetic field alignment.</description>

      <title>Detecting White Dwarf Binary Mergers with Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mergers of white dwarf binaries are a possible progenitor channel for Type Ia supernovae. While white dwarfs are abundant in the universe and relatively well understood, their gravitational wave signals have not yet been directly observed. In order to detect gravitational waves from merging white dwarf binaries, a detector in the mid-band between LVK and LISA appears necessary. In this paper, we compute and discuss the gravitational waves emitted by inspiraling and merging white dwarf binaries, and assess their detectability with proposed space-based atom-interferometer detectors such as MAGIS Space and AEDGE. Gravitational waves from massive white dwarf binaries can be observed for many years before merger, offering a unique early warning of their final explosion. Our projections suggest that MAGIS Space could detect signals from Type Ia supernova progenitors at least once every four years, while AEDGE could observe at least a few hundred such events annually. The prolonged gravitational wave emission captured by atom-interferometers provides precise sky localisation and can allow observation of the final explosion with electromagnetic telescopes. The combined observation with electromagnetic radiation from the white dwarf binary coalescence could open a new pathway for multi-messenger astronomy involving some of the brightest transient events in the universe.</description>

      <title>The Opacity Project: R-Matrix Calculations for Opacities of High-Energy-Density Astrophysical and Laboratory Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate determination of opacity is critical for understanding radiation transport in both astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. We employ atomic data from R-Matrix calculations to investigate radiative properties in high-energy-density (HED) plasma sources. Specifically, we analyze environments such as the base of the convective zone (BCZ) of the Sun 2 x 10^6$ K, N_e = 10^{23}/cc and the inertial confinement fusion (ICF) device at the Sandia Z facility 2.11 x 10^6 K, N_e = 3.16 x 10^{22}/cc. We calculate Rosseland Mean Opacities (RMO) within a range of temperatures and densities and analyze how they vary under different plasma conditions. In this study, we specifically focus on electron collisional and Stark ion microfield broadening effects on autoionizing resonances in photoabsorption cross sections. Our results are relevant to astrophysical models, particularly in the context of the solar opacity problem, and provide insights into discrepancies between theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. In addition, we investigate the equation-of-state (EOS) and its impact on opacities. In addition, we examine the equation-of-state (EOS) and its impact on opacities of the "chemical picture" Mihalas-Hummer-Dappen EOS with respect to level populations of excited levels included in the R-matrix calculations. This study should contribute to improving opacity models of HED sources such as stellar interiors adn laboratory fusion plasma experiments.</description>

      <title>Trapping, manipulating and probing ultracold atoms: a quantum technologies tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Engineered ultracold atomic systems are a valuable platform for fundamental quantum mechanics studies and the development of quantum technologies. At near zero absolute temperature, atoms exhibit macroscopic phase coherence and collective quantum behavior, enabling their use in precision metrology, quantum simulation, and even information processing. This review provides an introductory overview of the key techniques used to trap, manipulate, and detect ultracold atoms, while highlighting the main applications of each method. We outline the principles of laser cooling, magnetic and optical trapping, and the most widely used techniques, including optical lattices and tweezers. Next, we discuss the manipulation methods of atomic internal and external degrees of freedom, and we present atom interferometry techniques and how to leverage and control interatomic interactions. Next, we review common ensemble detection strategies, including absorption and fluorescence imaging, state-selective readout, correlation and quantum non-demolition measurements and conclude with high-resolution approaches. This review aims to provide newcomers to the field with a broad understanding of the experimental toolkit that underpins research in ultracold atom physics and its applications across quantum science and technology.</description>

      <title>Calibration-free Rydberg Atomic Receiver for Sub-MHz Wireless Communications and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploitation of sub-MHz (\textless 1 MHz) can be beneficial for a plethora of applications like underwater vehicular communication, subsurface exploration, low-frequency navigation etc. The traditional electrical receivers in this band are either hundreds of meters long or, when miniaturized, inefficient and bandwidth-limited, making them inapplicable for practical underwater implementations. Such obstacles can be circumvented by the emerging Rydberg atomic receiving technology, which is capable of detecting fields from DC up to the terahertz regime with compact structure. Against this background, we propose a method to detect sub-MHz electric fields without further calibration. Specifically, a physics-based model of the combined DC and AC-Stark response is established. Based on the model, we modulate the DC-Stark spectrum with the received signal and extract its amplitude by fitting the cycle-averaged, symmetric Stark-split peaks. Then we map this swing directly to the intrinsic atomic polarizability. By such operations, the proposed method can remove the dependence on electrode spacing or field-amplitude references. For performance evaluation, six-level Lindblad simulations and experiments are conducted at a low-frequency field of 30 kHz demonstrate a minimum detectable field of 5.3 \text{mV}/\text{cm}, with stable readout across practical optical-power variations. The approach manages to expand operating range of Rydberg atomic receivers below 1 MHz, and enables compact, calibration-free quantum front ends for underwater and subsurface receivers.</description>

      <title>Tracking electron capture processes in classical molecular dynamics simulations for spectral line broadening in plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Plasma spectroscopy is a fundamental tool for diagnosing laboratory and astrophysical plasmas. Accurate interpretation of spectra depends upon precise modeling and comprehension of Stark broadening and other mechanisms affecting spectral lines. In this context, computer simulations have emerged as valuable tools, offering idealized experiments with well-defined conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations, in particular, excel at replicating the particle interactions within the plasma and their impact on the state of a radiating atom or ion. However, these simulations present challenges in tracking electron capture processes, since setting an unambiguous criterion to distinguish between bound and free electrons is not trivial. In this paper we introduce a new algorithm that, within a classical framework, precisely identifies the scenario in which an electron is captured by an ion and then follows a stable orbit around it. The algorithm's applicability extends to emitters with charges Z &gt;= 1. The procedure enables the correct identification of valid time-histories of the electric microfield perturbing the emitting ion, which will be used for subsequent line shape calculations. The ionization balance results obtained from the application of this algorithm are compared with an additional method based on the potential energy of the particles in the simulations, finding good agreement, therefore validating the use of this approach.</description>

      <title>Probing the QCD $\bar \theta$ term with paramagnetic molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The experimental search for CP violation in paramagnetic atomic and molecular systems has made impressive progress in recent years. This has led to strong upper limits on the electron electric dipole moment. The same measurements can also be used to constrain hadronic sources of CP violation through CP-violating interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. We employ heavy-baryon chiral perturbation theory to compute such CP-violating semileptonic electron-nucleus interactions arising from the QCD theta term. We sharpen earlier results by determining the relevant short-distance effects and by an explicit two-loop calculation of meson-photon diagrams. We derive a bound of $|\bar{\theta}| &lt; 1.5 \cdot 10^{-8}$ at $90\%$ confidence, based on HfF$^+$ experiments at JILA. A further experimental improvement of one to two orders of magnitude would make paramagnetic molecular electric dipole moment experiments competitive with the neutron and diamagnetic atom program in constraining strong CP violation and higher-dimensional CP-odd quark-gluon operators.</description>

      <title>Factor of 1000 suppression of the depolarization rate in ultracold thulium collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lanthanides are nowadays extensively used to investigate the properties of strongly correlated matter. Nevertheless, exploiting the Zeeman manifold of a lanthanide atom ground state is challenging due to the unavoidable presence of depolarization collisions. Here we demonstrate that in the case of the thulium atom, it is possible to suppress this depolarization by a factor of 1000 with a carefully tuned magnetic field thus opening the way for the efficient use of the Zeeman manifold in quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional sub-wavelength topological dark state lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17096v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D) sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures. Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases with high tunability.</description>

      <title>Electric-field metrology of a terahertz frequency comb using Rydberg atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20698v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Terahertz radiation finds an increasing number of applications, yet efficient generation and detection remain a challenge and an active area of research. In particular, the precise detection of weak and narrowband terahertz signals is notoriously difficult. Here, we employ a novel type of single-photon detector based on Rydberg atoms to both detect and calibrate a terahertz frequency comb over an octave-spanning range, yet with a MHz-level selectivity. We calibrate the intensity of the electric field of the comb against the fundamental atomic properties, while achieving the intensity (power) sensitivity down to 45.2 $\mathrm{fW\ cm^{-2}\ Hz^{-0.5}}$ (1.84 $\mathrm{fW\ Hz^{-0.5}}$) within a single mode of the frequency comb, all in a room-temperature operated setup. Our results elucidate the transition of terahertz frequency combs into the quantum regime, enabling high-precision and high-sensitivity spectroscopy. This breakthrough allows terahertz science to better leverage revolutionary techniques developed for optical frequency combs.</description>
