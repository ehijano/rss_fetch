      <title>On the Energy Consumption of Rotary Wing and Fixed Wing UAVs in Flying Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used to enable wireless communications. Due to their characteristics, such as the ability to hover and carry cargo, UAVs can serve as communications nodes, including Wi-Fi Access Points and Cellular Base Stations. In previous work, we proposed the Sustainable multi-UAV Performance-aware Placement (SUPPLY) algorithm, which focuses on the energy-efficient placement of multiple UAVs acting as Flying Access Points (FAPs). Additionally, we developed the Multi-UAV Energy Consumption (MUAVE) simulator to evaluate the UAV energy consumption, specifically when using the SUPPLY algorithm. However, MUAVE was initially designed to compute the energy consumption for rotary-wing UAVs only.
  In this paper, we propose eMUAVE, an enhanced version of the MUAVE simulator that allows the evaluation of the energy consumption for both rotary-wing and fixed-wing UAVs. Our energy consumption evaluation using eMUAVE considers reference and random networking scenarios. The results show that fixed-wing UAVs can be employed in the majority of networking scenarios. However, rotary-wing UAVs are typically more energy-efficient than fixed-wing UAVs when following the trajectories defined by SUPPLY.</description>

      <title>Vehicle-to-Grid Technology meets Packetized Energy Management: A Co-Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global energy landscape is experiencing a significant transformation driven by increased awareness of climate change and rapid technological advancements in renewable energy and electric vehicles (EVs). Packetized energy management (PEM) schemes are gaining attention as a potential solution for power management for effective load control. This study presents the development of a co-simulation platform to investigate integration of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) with packetized energy trading (PET) in microgrid scenarios. The platform facilitates the interaction between EVs and prosumers, with a focus on responsive loads, and solar photovoltaic (PV) as intermittently available resources. Using the developed co-simulation, this study evaluates how V2G-capable EVs can enhance the stability and efficiency of PET-based microgrids. The results demonstrate the capability of V2G EVs to act as an energy reservoir, effectively managing demand-side load, thus mitigating its fluctuation from available supply while maintaining quality-of-service.</description>

      <title>Understanding Routing-Induced Censorship Changes Globally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Internet censorship is pervasive, with significant effort dedicated to understanding what is censored, and where. Prior censorship work however have identified significant inconsistencies in their results; experiments show unexplained non-determinism thought to be caused by censor load, end-host geographic diversity, or incomplete censorship -- inconsistencies which impede reliable, repeatable and correct understanding of global censorship. In this work we investigate the extent to which Equal-cost Multi-path (ECMP) routing is the cause for these inconsistencies, developing methods to measure and compensate for them. We find ECMP routing significantly changes observed censorship across protocols, censor mechanisms, and in 17 countries. We identify that previously observed non-determinism or regional variations are attributable to measurements between fixed end-hosts taking different routes based on Flow-ID; i.e., choice of intra-subnet source IP or ephemeral source port leads to differences in observed censorship. To achieve this we develop new route-stable censorship measurement methods that allow consistent measurement of DNS, HTTP, and HTTPS censorship. We find ECMP routing yields censorship changes across 42% of IPs and 51% of ASes, but that impact is not uniform. We identify numerous causes of the behavior, ranging from likely failed infrastructure, to routes to the same end-host taking geographically diverse paths which experience differences in censorship en-route. Finally, we explore our results in the context of prior global measurement studies, exploring first the applicability of our findings to prior observed variations, and then demonstrating how specific experiments from two studies could be impacted by, and specific results are explainable by, ECMP routing. Our work points to methods for improving future studies, reducing inconsistencies and increasing repeatability.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Semantic Traffic Control in AVs Using RL and DQN for Dynamic Roadblocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), furnished with sensors capable of capturing essential vehicle dynamics such as speed, acceleration, and precise location, possess the capacity to execute intelligent maneuvers, including lane changes, in anticipation of approaching roadblocks. Nevertheless, the sheer volume of sensory data and the processing necessary to derive informed decisions can often overwhelm the vehicles, rendering them unable to handle the task independently. Consequently, a common approach in traffic scenarios involves transmitting the data to servers for processing, a practice that introduces challenges, particularly in situations demanding real-time processing. In response to this challenge, we present a novel DL-based semantic traffic control system that entrusts semantic encoding responsibilities to the vehicles themselves. This system processes driving decisions obtained from a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent, streamlining the decision-making process. Specifically, our framework envisions scenarios where abrupt roadblocks materialize due to factors such as road maintenance, accidents, or vehicle repairs, necessitating vehicles to make determinations concerning lane-keeping or lane-changing actions to navigate past these obstacles. To formulate this scenario mathematically, we employ a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and harness the Deep Q Learning (DQN) algorithm to unearth viable solutions.</description>

      <title>RiSi: Spectro-temporal RAN-agnostic Modulation Identification for OFDMA Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: RAN-agnostic communications can identify intrinsic features of the unknown signal without any prior knowledge, with which incompatible RANs in the same unlicensed band could achieve better coexistence performance than today's LBT-based coexistence. Blind modulation identification is its key building block, which blindly identifies the modulation type of an incompatible signal without any prior knowledge. Recent blind modulation identification schemes are built upon deep neural networks, which are limited to single-carrier signal recognition thus not pragmatic for identifying spectro-temporal OFDMA signals whose modulation varies with time and frequency. Therefore, this paper proposes RiSi, a semantic segmentation neural network designed to work on OFDMA's spectrograms, that employs flattened convolutions to better identify the grid-like pattern of OFDMA's resource blocks. We trained RiSi with a realistic OFDMA dataset including various channel impairments, and achieved the modulation identification accuracy of 86% on average over four modulation types of BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM. Then, we enhanced the generalization performance of RiSi by applying domain generalization methods while treating varying FFT size or varying CP length as different domains, showing that thus-generalized RiSi can perform reasonably well with unseen data.</description>

      <title>Toward Self-Adjusting k-ary Search Tree Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Datacenter networks are becoming increasingly flexible with the incorporation of new networking technologies, such as optical circuit switches. These technologies allow for programmable network topologies that can be reconfigured to better serve network traffic, thus enabling a trade-off between the benefits (i.e., shorter routes) and costs of reconfigurations (i.e., overhead). Self-Adjusting Networks (SANs) aim at addressing this trade-off by exploiting patterns in network traffic, both when it is revealed piecewise (online dynamic topologies) or known in advance (offline static topologies). In this paper, we take the first steps toward Self-Adjusting k-ary tree networks. These are more powerful generalizations of existing binary search tree networks (like SplayNets), which have been at the core of SAN designs. k-ary search tree networks are a natural generalization offering nodes of higher degrees, reduced route lengths for a fixed number of nodes, and local routing in spite of reconfigurations. We first compute an offline (optimal) static network for arbitrary traffic patterns in $O(n^3 \cdot k)$ time via dynamic programming, and also improve the bound to $O(n^2 \cdot k)$ for the special case of uniformly distributed traffic. Then, we present a centroid-based topology of the network that can be used both in the offline static and the online setting. In the offline uniform-workload case, we construct this quasi-optimal network in linear time $O(n)$ and, finally, we present online self-adjusting k-ary search tree versions of SplayNet. We evaluate experimentally our new structure for $k=2$ (allowing for a comparison with existing SplayNets) on real and synthetic network traces. Our results show that this approach works better than SplayNet in most of the real network traces and in average to low locality synthetic traces, and is only little inferior to SplayNet in all remaining traces.</description>
