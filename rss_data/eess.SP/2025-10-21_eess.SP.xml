      <title>Wideband Antenna Deconvolution for Bistatic Millimeter Wave Radar Reflectivity Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bistatic radar measurements offer unique spatial diversity and enhanced target characterization capabilities, rendering them increasingly vital for contemporary sensing application research. The reliability of such measurements is contingent upon precise system and antenna calibration. The prevailing technique is the substitution method, which involves the use of known reference objects. We propose an over-the-air calibration algorithm for spherical bistatic measurement systems. Our method is both significantly simpler and twice as fast as existing algorithms. The application of our technique to reflectivity measurements of a metal sphere from 76 to 81 GHz demonstrates a dynamic range enhancement of up to 40 dB when compared with uncalibrated data. A comparison with simulation data demonstrates a high degree of agreement between measurement and simulation.</description>

      <title>Fast, Differentiable, GPU-Accelerated Ray Tracing for Multiple Diffraction and Reflection Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fast, differentiable, GPU-accelerated optimization method for ray path tracing in environments containing planar reflectors and straight diffraction edges. Based on Fermat's principle, our approach reformulates the path-finding problem as the minimization of total path length, enabling efficient parallel execution on modern GPU architectures. Unlike existing methods that require separate algorithms for reflections and diffractions, our unified formulation maintains consistent problem dimensions across all interaction sequences, making it particularly suitable for vectorized computation. Through implicit differentiation, we achieve efficient gradient computation without differentiating through solver iterations, significantly outperforming traditional automatic differentiation approaches. Numerical simulations demonstrate convergence rates comparable to specialized Newton methods while providing superior scalability for large-scale applications. The method integrates seamlessly with differentiable programming libraries such as JAX and DrJIT, enabling new possibilities in inverse design and optimization for wireless propagation modeling.

      <title>Performance Comparison of Joint Delay-Doppler Estimation Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), radar, and beamforming require real-time, high-resolution estimation algorithms to determine delay-Doppler values of specular paths within the wireless propagation channel. Our contribution is the measurement-based performance comparison of the delay-Doppler estimation between three different algorithms, comprising maximum likelihood (ML), convolutional neural network (CNN), and constant false alarm rate (CFAR) approaches. We apply these algorithms to publicly available channel data which includes two spherical targets with analytically describable delay-Doppler parameters. The comparison of the three algorithms features the target detection rate, root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of the delay-Doppler estimates, and a runtime analysis. Notably, all three algorithms demonstrate similar parameter estimation capabilities in bi-static scenarios, achieving target detection probabilities of up to 80%. Conversely, forward and backward scattering conditions pose a problem to the estimation due to strong line-of-sight (LoS) contribution, reducing the corresponding detection probability down to 0%.</description>

      <title>Delay Minimization in Pinching-Antenna-enabled NOMA-MEC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel pinching antenna systems (PASS) enabled non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) multi-access edge computing (MEC) framework. An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the maximum task delay by optimizing offloading ratios, transmit powers, and pinching antenna (PA) positions, subject to constraints on maximum transmit power, user energy budgets, and minimum PA separation to mitigate coupling effects. To address the non-convex problem, a bisection search-based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed, where each subproblem is iteratively solved for a given task delay. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces the task delay compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>A Robust CSI-Based Scatterer Geometric Reconstruction Method for 6G ISAC System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twin (DT) is a core enabler of sixth generation (6G) mobile systems. As a prerequisite for DT, scatterer geometric reconstruction (SGR) in propagation environments is essential but typically requires extra sensors such as cameras and LiDAR. With integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G, we reinterpret the linear sampling method (LSM) from a wireless channel viewpoint and propose a CSI based variant for sensor free SGR: by exploiting the shared channel characteristics of multipath and scattering, in band CSI replaces the scattered field measurements usually required by LSM. However, aperture limited arrays reduce LSM robustness. To address this, we propose matched filtering enhanced multi frequency LSM (MF MLSM). Multi frequency data increases frequency diversity, and matched filtering coherently aligns inter frequency phases to avoid artifacts, both of which improve robustness. Experiments with apertures of 93.6 deg, 144 deg, and 180 deg and SNRs of 27 dB and 12 dB demonstrate robust SGR with this approach.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Sensing Performance Design for Enhancing Secure Communication in Networked ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The channel state information (CSI) of an eavesdropper is crucial for physical layer security (PLS) design, but it is difficult to obtain due to the passive and non-cooperative nature of the eavesdropper. To this end, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) offers a novel solution by estimating the CSI of the eavesdropper based on sensing information. However, existing studies normally impose explicit and fixed sensing performance requirement without considering the varying communication conditions, which hinders the system from fully exploiting the synergy between sensing and communication. To address this issue, this paper proposes sensing-enhanced secure communication with adaptive sensing performance. Specifically, we formulate the sensing performance implicitly in the information leakage rate and adaptively optimize it for the minimization of the power consumption, offering enhanced flexibility and adaptability in sensing performance. We consider both centralized and decentralized designs to thoroughly investigate the impact of network structure on system performance and complexity. Specifically, we devise a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based method for centralized design. For decentralized design, we develop an optimization framework based on consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to reduce complexity and information exchange overhead. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed implicit sensing performance requirement design due to its capability to adaptively adjust the sensing performance to enhance the system performance for varying system configurations.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of High Power Microwave Systems Against UAVs A Probabilistic Antenna Propagation Framework with Sensitivity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a probabilistic, antenna- and propagation-centric framework to quantify the effectiveness of high-power microwave (HPM) engagements against unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The model couples stochastic UAV kinematics, a beam-steering jitter-to-gain mapping, and atmospheric propagation (free-space spreading with gaseous and rain loss) to obtain closed-form statistics of the received pulse energy. From these, we derive analytically evaluable per-pulse and cumulative neutralization probabilities using log-normal closures and Gaussian--Hermite quadrature, and we provide a dwell-time expression under a standard pulse-independence assumption. Analytical predictions closely match large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations across broad parameter ranges. For a representative commercial threshold $E_{\mathrm{th}} = 10^{-2}\,\mathrm{J}$, the model predicts $\bar{P}_{\mathrm{kill}} \gtrsim 0.4$ per pulse and $P_{\mathrm{kill,tot}} &gt; 99\%$ within about $0.1\,\mathrm{s}$ at kHz PRF; for hardened platforms with $E_{\mathrm{th}} = 10^{-1}\,\mathrm{J}$, $\bar{P}_{\mathrm{kill}} &lt; 1\%$ and $P_{\mathrm{kill,tot}} &lt; 20\%$ after $1\,\mathrm{s}$. A closed-form sensitivity (elasticity) analysis shows performance is dominated by slant range ($S_{\bar{R}} \approx -2$), with strong secondary dependence on aperture diameter and transmit power; pointing jitter and atmospheric variability are comparatively less influential in the evaluated regimes. The framework yields fast, accurate, and physics-faithful performance predictions and exposes clear antenna/propagation design levers for HPM system sizing and risk-aware mission planning.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware Hybrid Wi-Fi/BLE Fingerprinting via Evidence-Theoretic Fusion and Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indoor localization remains challenging in GNSS-denied environments due to multipath, device heterogeneity, and volatile radio conditions. We propose a topology-aware, hybrid Wi-Fi/BLE fingerprinting framework that (i) applies physically consistent RSS normalization (dBm z-scoring or dBm -&gt; linear mW -&gt; z-score), (ii) denoises streams with classical Bayesian filters (KF/UKF/PF), (iii) combines complementary regressors (Random Forest and weighted kNN with a diagonal Mahalanobis metric), (iv) performs evidence-theoretic fusion via Dempster-Shafer theory (DST), and (v) augments each sample with persistent-homology (PH) descriptors. The system outputs both (x, y) estimates and interpretable belief maps, and is engineered for microcontroller-class deployment with per-update cost O(T log M + log M + Mp + S).
  We evaluate on two heterogeneous datasets, including a new 1,200-sample ESP32 survey, and report ablations, robustness to test-only noise, and significance across 10 stratified splits. Under 10% synthetic RSS noise, the full pipeline attains 3.40 m (Dataset 1) and 2.45 m (Dataset 2) RMSE, improving a strong PF + RF baseline by about 37%. Averaged across splits, it yields 4.993 +/- 0.15 m versus 6.292 +/- 0.13 m (20.6% relative reduction; p &lt; 0.001). In noise-free tests, accuracy tightens to 0.44 m and 0.32 m (up to 56% better). Compared with recent learning-heavy approaches that assume large site-specific datasets and GPU inference, our method delivers competitive accuracy with formal uncertainty quantification and low computational cost suitable for real-time deployment.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Geometry Analysis of Asymmetric Uplink Interference for Urban UAV-RC Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a flexible platform for providing coverage over challenging environments, particularly for public safety and surveillance missions in urban areas. However, deploying the UAVs in dense urban areas introduces unique challenges, most notably asymmetric uplink (UL, remote controller to UAV) interference due to a higher chance of line-of-sight (LoS) interference at the UAV. In this letter, we propose a stochastic geometry framework to tractably analyze the large-scale asymmetric interference in urban areas. We incorporate a log-Gaussian Cox process (LGCP) model to capture the spatial correlation of the interference field in both UL and downlink (DL) as a function of the UAV altitude and the two-dimensional (2-D) distance between the remote controller and UAV. To quantify the UL and the DL interference asymmetry, we also define the interference asymmetry ratio characterizing the interference disparity between the UL and the DL. Our numerical results demonstrate that the interference asymmetry ratio increases as the UAV altitude and 2-D distance increase, highlighting that the UL interference worsens.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Antenna Arrays: Bridging Electromagnetics and Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable antennas (RAs), capable of dynamically adapting their radiation patterns, polarization states, and operating frequencies, have emerged as a promising technology to meet the stringent performance requirements of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. This article systematically introduces essential hardware implementations of RAs and investigates advanced array architectures, such as fully-digital and tri-hybrid designs, emphasizing their capability to synergistically integrate electromagnetic (EM) reconfigurability with analog and digital signal processing. By facilitating coordinated beamforming across the EM and signal processing domains, RA arrays offer unprecedented flexibility and adaptability compared to conventional static antenna systems. Representative applications empowered by RA arrays, including integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), physical layer security (PLS), and near-field communications, are highlighted. A case study illustrates the effectiveness of RA arrays in optimizing beam steering, improving link robustness, and alleviating system power consumption. Finally, several open challenges and future research directions are outlined, emphasizing the need for advancements in theoretical modeling, hardware reliability, channel estimation techniques, intelligent optimization methods, and innovative network architectures, to fully realize the transformative impact of RAs in future 6G wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Robust Beamforming Optimization for STAR-RIS Empowered Multi-User RSMA Under Hardware Imperfections and Channel Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the synergy between rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) as a unified framework to enable ubiquitous, intelligent, and resilient connectivity in future sixth-generation networks, while improving spectral and energy efficiency. Specifically, we investigate a STAR-RIS-assisted multi-user RSMA system and develop an intelligent optimization strategy that jointly designs the transmitter's active beamforming, the common stream rate allocation, and the passive beamforming vectors for the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection regions, considering transceiver hardware impairments and imperfect channel state information (CSI). In addition, system robustness is ensured via a bounded channel estimation error model that captures CSI imperfections and guarantees resilience against worst-case errors. To address the highly non-convex problem, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm that decomposes it into two sub-problems. Firstly, active beamforming vectors for the common and private signals are determined by reformulating the original problem into a convex semi-definite programming (SDP) form using successive convex approximation (SCA) and semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Secondly, passive beamforming vectors are optimized through a convex SDP reformulation by exploiting SCA and SDR techniques. Moreover, when higher-rank solutions arise, Gaussian randomization is applied to obtain rank-one solutions. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves significant performance gains over benchmark schemes and exhibits fast convergence.</description>

      <title>When 5G NTN Meets GNSS: Tracking GNSS Signals under Overlaid 5G Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provide the backbone of Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) but remain vulnerable to interference. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations within Fifth-Generation (5G) Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) can enhance resilience by jointly supporting communication and navigation. This paper presents the first quantitative analysis of GNSS tracking and navigation message demodulation under a hybrid waveform where a low-power Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) component is overlaid on an Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) 5G downlink. We evaluate a minimally modified GNSS receiver that tracks a legacy Global Positioning System (GPS) L1 Coarse/Acquisition (C/A) overlay aligned with 5G frames while treating the 5G waveform as structured interference. Using Monte Carlo simulations under realistic LEO Doppler dynamics, we analyze the Bit Error Rate (BER) of GPS L1 C/A navigation bits and the subframe decoding probability versus Signalto- Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for multiple Signalto- Interference Ratios (SIR) and dynamic classes. Results show reliable demodulation across wide SINR ranges for low and medium dynamics, whereas high dynamics impose strict lock limits. These findings confirm the feasibility of Joint Communication and Positioning (JCAP) using a near-legacy GNSS chipset with minimal receiver modifications.</description>

      <title>Efficiency-Enhanced Open Earbud Earphone Antenna Using Dual-Feed Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stringent spatial constraints and the demand for high antenna efficiency in modern wireless earphones present significant design challenges. To address these issues, this paper presents and thoroughly investigates a novel earphone antenna design specifically tailored for open earbud wireless earphones. In contrast to traditional earphone antennas that rely on a conventional single-feed configuration, the proposed design introduces a dual-feed excitation technique incorporating a controlled phase difference between the two feeds. This innovative feeding strategy effectively enlarges the equivalent radiating aperture, thereby enhancing the overall radiation efficiency of the antenna system. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the dual-feed approach yields an efficiency improvement exceeding 1 dB when compared with standard single-feed designs. Furthermore, the fabricated prototype achieves a -6 dB impedance bandwidth that fully encompasses the 2.4 GHz ISM band, ensuring stable wireless communication performance. The measured total efficiencies reach -8.5 dB in free space and -9.5 dB under on-head conditions. These results confirm that the proposed antenna successfully achieves high efficiency and reliable performance within the extremely limited volume of an earbud device, demonstrating strong potential for integration into next-generation compact wireless earphones.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vision of a smart wireless factory (SWF) demands highly flexible, low-latency, and reliable connectivity that goes beyond conventional wireless solutions. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered communications, when integrated with the open radio access network (O-RAN) architectures, have emerged as a promising enabler to meet these challenging requirements. This article introduces the methodology for the orchestration of RIS with xApps (ORIX), bringing the RIS technology into the O-RAN ecosystem through xApp-based control for SWF environments. ORIX features three key components: an O-RAN-compliant RIS service model for dynamic configuration, an RIS channel simulator that supports 3GPP indoor factory models with multiple industrial scenarios, and practical RIS optimization strategies with finite-resolution control. Together, these elements provide a realistic end-to-end emulation platform for evaluating RIS placement, control, and performance in SWF environments prior to deployment. The presented case study demonstrates how ORIX enables the evaluation of achievable performance gains, exploration of trade-offs among key RIS design parameters, and identification of deployment strategies that balance system performance with practical implementation constraints. By bridging theoretical advances with industrial feasibility, ORIX lays the groundwork for RIS-assisted O-RAN networks to power next-generation wireless communication in industrial scenarios.</description>

      <title>6D Movable Metasurface (6DMM) in Downlink NOMA Transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel six-dimensional movable metasurface (6DMM)-assisted downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, in which a conventional base station (BS) equipped with fixed antennas serves multiple users with the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with six-dimensional spatial configurability. In contrast to traditional RIS with static surface, the proposed 6DMM architecture allows each element to dynamically adjust its position and orient the whole metasurface in yaw-pitch-roll axes, enabling both in spatial and electromagnetic controls. We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the BS NOMA-based beamforming, phase-shifts, element positions, and rotation angles of metasurface under constraints of NOMA power levels, unit-modulus of phase-shifts, power budget, inter-element separation and boundaries of element position/orientation. Due to non-convexity and high-dimensionality, we employ a probabilistic cross-entropy optimization (CEO) scheme to iteratively refine the solution distribution based on maximizing likelihood and elite solution sampling. Simulation results show that the proposed CEO-based 6DMM-NOMA architecture achieves substantial rate performance gains compared to 6DMM sub-structures, conventional static RIS, and other multiple access mechanisms. It also highlights the effectiveness of CEO providing probabilistic optimization for solving high-dimensional scalable metasurface.</description>

      <title>Semantic Joint Source Channel Coding for Distributed Subsurface Imaging in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are a promising solution for autonomous exploration tasks in hazardous or remote environments, such as planetary surveys. In such settings, communication among agents is essential to ensure collaborative task execution, yet conventional approaches treat exploration and communication as decoupled subsystems. This work presents a novel framework that tightly integrates semantic communication into the MAS exploration process, adapting communication strategies to the exploration methodology to improve overall task performance. Specifically, we investigate the application of semantic joint source-channel coding (JSCC) with over-the-air computation (AirComp) for distributed function computation for the application of cooperative subsurface imaging using the adapt-then-combine full waveform inversion (ATC-FWI) algorithm. Our results demonstrate that semantic JSCC significantly outperforms classical point-to-point and standard JSCC methods, especially in high-connectivity networks. Furthermore, incorporating side information at the receiving agent enhances communication efficiency and imaging accuracy, a feature previously unexplored in MAS-based exploration. We validate our approach through a use case inspired by subsurface anomaly detection, showing measurable improvements in imaging performance per agent. This work underscores the potential of semantic communication in distributed multi-agent exploration, offering a communication-aware exploration paradigm that achieves task-relevant performance gains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 5G, beam training consists of the efficient association of users to beams for a given beamforming codebook used at the base station and the given propagation environment in the cell. We propose a convolutional neural network approach that leverages the position of the base station and geospatial data to predict beam distributions for all user locations simultaneously. Our method generalizes to unseen environments without site-specific training or specialized sensors. The results show that it significantly reduces the number of candidate beams considered, thereby improving the efficiency of beam training.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system with multiple RISs. Joint design of transmit precoding, RIS coefficients, and receive combining is investigated for uplink sum-rate maximization under in-phase and quadrature phase imbalance (IQI) at user equipments (UEs) and access points (APs). A weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) based block coordinate descent (BCD) approach is proposed, where novel iterative methods are developed to efficiently solve the BCD subproblems. The efficiency of proposed approaches is demonstrated relative to heuristic methods via extensive simulations.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity Analysis of Multi-Target Detection via Markovian and Hard-Core Multi-Reference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we study the sample complexity of the multi-target detection (MTD) problem, in which an unknown signal appears multiple times at unknown locations within a long, noisy observation. We propose a patching scheme that reduces MTD to a non-i.i.d. multi-reference alignment (MRA) model. In the one-dimensional setting, the latent group elements form a Markov chain, and we show that the convergence rate of any estimator matches that of the corresponding i.i.d. MRA model, up to a logarithmic factor in the number of patches. Moreover, for estimators based on empirical averaging, such as the method of moments, the convergence rates are identical in both settings. We further establish an analogous result in two dimensions, where the latent structure arises from an exponentially mixing random field generated by a hard-core placement model. As a consequence, if the signal in the corresponding i.i.d. MRA model is determined by moments up to order $n_{\min}$, then in the low-SNR regime the number of patches required to estimate the signal in the MTD model scales as $\sigma^{2n_{\min}}$, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the noise variance.</description>

      <title>Task-Based Quantization for Channel Estimation in RIS Empowered MmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate channel estimation for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) empowered millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-user single-input multiple-output communication systems using low-resolution quantization. Due to the high cost and power consumption of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in large antenna arrays and for wide signal bandwidths, designing mmWave systems with low-resolution ADCs is beneficial. To tackle this issue, we propose a channel estimation design using task-based quantization that considers the underlying hybrid analog and digital architecture in order to improve the system performance under finite bit-resolution constraints. Our goal is to accomplish a channel estimation task that minimizes the mean squared error distortion between the true and estimated channel. We develop two types of channel estimators: a cascaded channel estimator for an RIS with purely passive elements, and an estimator for the separate RIS-related channels that leverages additional information from a few semi-passive elements at the RIS capable of processing the received signals with radio frequency chains. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimation designs exploiting task-based quantization outperform purely digital methods and can effectively approach the performance of a system with unlimited resolution ADCs. Furthermore, the proposed channel estimators are shown to be superior to baselines with small training overhead.</description>

      <title>A Real-Time BCI for Stroke Hand Rehabilitation Using Latent EEG Features from Healthy Subjects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a real-time, portable brain-computer interface (BCI) system designed to support hand rehabilitation for stroke patients. The system combines a low cost 3D-printed robotic exoskeleton with an embedded controller that converts brain signals into physical hand movements. EEG signals are recorded using a 14-channel Emotiv EPOC+ headset and processed through a supervised convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to extract meaningful latent features from single-trial data. The model is trained on publicly available EEG data from healthy individuals (WAY-EEG-GAL dataset), with electrode mapping adapted to match the Emotiv headset layout. Among several tested classifiers, Ada Boost achieved the highest accuracy (89.3%) and F1-score (0.89) in offline evaluations. The system was also tested in real time on five healthy subjects, achieving classification accuracies between 60% and 86%. The complete pipeline - EEG acquisition, signal processing, classification, and robotic control - is deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano platform with a real-time graphical interface. These results demonstrate the system's potential as a low-cost, standalone solution for home-based neurorehabilitation.</description>

      <title>WaveNet's Precision in EEG Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to automate the classification of EEG signals into physiological, pathological, artifact, and noise categories. Traditional methods for EEG signal classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of EEG recordings. Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St. Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and tested on 209,232 samples with a 70/20/10 percent split. The model achieved a classification accuracy exceeding previous CNN and LSTM-based approaches, and was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline. Notably, the model distinguishes noise and artifacts with high precision, although it reveals a modest but explainable degree of misclassification between physiological and pathological signals, reflecting inherent clinical overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis, is well suited for EEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and residual connections, enabling it to capture both fine-grained and long-range temporal dependencies. The research also details the preprocessing pipeline, including dynamic dataset partitioning and normalization steps that support model generalization.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Channel Estimation in RIS-aided Systems via Observation Matrix Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising technology for enhancing wireless communications through dense antenna arrays. Accurate channel estimation is critical to unlocking their full performance potential. To enhance RIS channel estimators, this paper proposes a novel observation matrix design scheme. Bayesian optimization framework is adopted to generate observation matrices that maximize the mutual information between received pilot signals and RIS channels. To solve the formulated problem efficiently, we develop an alternating Riemannian manifold optimization (ARMO) algorithm to alternately update the receiver combiners and RIS phase-shift matrices. An adaptive kernel training strategy is further introduced to iteratively refine the channel covariance matrix without requiring additional pilot resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ARMO-enhanced estimator achieves substantial gains in estimation accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Primer on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces Probabilistic Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (P-KAN), a novel probabilistic extension of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for time series forecasting. By replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions, P-KANs offer expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and heavy-tailed dynamics. We evaluate P-KANs on satellite traffic forecasting, where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic thresholding for resource allocation. Results show that P-KANs consistently outperform Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) baselines in both accuracy and calibration, achieving superior efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters. We build up P-KANs on two distributions, namely Gaussian and Student-t distributions. The Gaussian variant provides robust, conservative forecasts suitable for safety-critical scenarios, whereas the Student-t variant yields sharper distributions that improve efficiency under stable demand. These findings establish P-KANs as a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained domains.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Off-the-Grid Sparse Recovery with Unlimited Sensing: Simultaneous Super-Resolution in Time and Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recovery of Dirac impulses, or spikes, from filtered measurements is a classical problem in signal processing. As the spikes lie in the continuous domain while measurements are discrete, this task is known as super-resolution or off-the-grid sparse recovery. Despite significant theoretical and algorithmic advances over the past decade, these developments often overlook critical challenges at the analog-digital interface. In particular, when spikes exhibit strong-weak amplitude disparity, conventional digital acquisition may result in clipping of strong components or loss of weak ones beneath the quantization noise floor. This motivates a broader perspective: super-resolution must simultaneously resolve both amplitude and temporal structure. Under a fixed bit budget, such information loss is unavoidable. In contrast, the emerging theory and practice of the Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF) demonstrate that these fundamental limitations can be overcome. Building on this foundation, we demonstrate that modulo encoding within USF enables digital super-resolution by enhancing measurement precision, thereby unlocking temporal super-resolution beyond conventional limits. We develop new theoretical results that extend to non-bandlimited kernels commonly encountered in practice and introduce a robust algorithm for off-the-grid sparse recovery. To demonstrate practical impact, we instantiate our framework in the context of time-of-flight imaging. Both numerical simulations and hardware experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach under low-bit quantization, enabling super-resolution in amplitude and time.</description>

      <title>Traffic Prioritization Mechanisms for Mission and Time Critical Applications in Industrial Internet of Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) promises to revolutionize industrial operations and productions through utilizing Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. Since each node in such environments generates various types of data with diverse service requirements, MAC protocol holds crucial importance to ensure efficient delivery. In this context, simple to complex MAC schemes are found in literature. This paper focuses on evaluating the performance of two major techniques "slot stealing" and "packet fragmentation" for the IIoT; representative protocols SS-MAC and FROG-MAC have been chosen from each category respectively. We conducted realistic simulations for the two protocols using Contiki. Delay and packet loss comparison for SS-MAC and FROG-MAC indicates the superiority of FROG-MAC due to reduction in the waiting time for urgent traffic. Thus, a simple fragmentation scheme could be deployed for efficient scheduling of heterogenous traffic in the industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Channel Capacity for FMCW-based Optical Wireless Integrated Sensing and Communication: Asymptotic Analysis and Envelope Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical wireless integrated sensing and communication (OW-ISAC) is rapidly burgeoning as a complement and augmentation to its radio-frequency counterpart. In this paper, the channel capacity is analyzed to guide the design of a coherent OW-ISAC system based on frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW). Firstly, the system model of FMCW-based OW-ISAC is recast into an information-theoretic formulation, where an additional harmonic-mean constraint is imposed to ensure the sensing performance. Subsequently, both lower and upper bounds for channel capacity are derived under the imposed sensing constraint, based on which asymptotic expressions for channel capacity are presented for both low and high signal-to-noise-ratio regions. Moreover, the analysis of channel capacity provides guidance for the envelope design based on pulse amplitude modulation, whose capacity-achieving capabilities are demonstrated by numerical results. Furthermore, simulations reveal the trade-off between communication and sensing functionalities. In summary, the analysis of channel capacity under the sensing constraint provides insights into both the optimality and the practicality of OW-ISAC design.</description>

      <title>RINS-T: Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series Linear Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series data are often affected by various forms of corruption, such as missing values, noise, and outliers, which pose significant challenges for tasks such as forecasting and anomaly detection. To address these issues, inverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted data by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization, input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques.

      <title>S4ECG: Exploring the impact of long-range interactions for arrhythmia prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) exemplifies biosignal-based time series with continuous, temporally ordered structure reflecting cardiac physiological and pathophysiological dynamics. Detailed analysis of these dynamics has proven challenging, as conventional methods capture either global trends or local waveform features but rarely their simultaneous interplay at high temporal resolution. To bridge global and local signal analysis, we introduce S4ECG, a novel deep learning architecture leveraging structured state space models for multi-epoch arrhythmia classification. Our joint multi-epoch predictions significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC, with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998, demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.</description>

      <title>Delay-Doppler Pulse Shaping in Zak-OTFS Using Hermite Basis Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The performance of Zak-OTFS modulation is critically dependent on the choice of the delay-Doppler (DD) domain pulse shaping filter. The design of pulses for $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ is constrained by the Balian-Low Theorem, which imposes an inescapable trade-off between time-frequency localization and orthogonality for spectrally efficient systems. In Zak-OTFS, this trade-off requires balancing the need for localization for input/output (I/O) relation estimation with the need for orthogonality for reliable data detection when operating without time or bandwidth expansion. The well-known sinc and Gaussian pulse shapes represent the canonical extremes of this trade-off, while composite constructions such as the Gaussian-sinc (GS) pulse shape offer a good compromise. In this work, we propose a systematic DD pulse design framework for Zak-OTFS that expresses the pulse as a linear combination of Hermite basis functions. We obtain the optimal coefficients for the Hermite basis functions that minimize the inter-symbol interference (ISI) energy at the DD sampling points by solving a constrained optimization problem via singular value decomposition. For the proposed class of Hermite pulses, we derive closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and noise covariance in Zak-OTFS. Simulation results of Zak-OTFS with embedded pilot and model-free I/O relation estimation in Vehicular-A channels with fractional DDs demonstrate that the optimized pulse shape achieves a bit error rate performance that is significantly superior compared to those of the canonical sinc and Gaussian pulses and is on par with that of the state-of-the-art GS pulse, validating the proposed framework which provides greater design flexibility in terms of control of ISI and sidelobe energies.</description>

      <title>Reliable Inference in Edge-Cloud Model Cascades via Conformal Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Edge intelligence enables low-latency inference via compact on-device models, but assuring reliability remains challenging. We study edge-cloud cascades that must preserve conditional coverage: whenever the edge returns a prediction set, it should contain the true label with a user-specified probability, as if produced by the cloud model. We formalize conditional coverage with respect to the cloud predictive distribution, and introduce a conformal alignment-based (CAb) cascading mechanism that certifies this property with user control over the risk level. Our method casts escalation from edge to cloud models as a multiple-hypothesis testing (MHT) problem, tailoring conformal alignment (CA) to select which inputs can be safely handled at the edge. The proposed CAb model cascading method yields statistical guarantees on the average fraction of edge decisions that satisfy cloud-level conditional coverage. The procedure applies to arbitrary edge prediction sets, including variants of conformal prediction (CP), and exposes a tunable trade-off among coverage, deferral rate, and set size. Experiments on CIFAR-100 image classification and the TeleQnA question-answering (QA) benchmark show that the proposed CAb cascade maintains the target conditional coverage for edge predictions while substantially reducing offloading to the cloud and incurring modest increases in prediction-set size.</description>

      <title>A Closed-Form Solution for Kernel Adaptive Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike the conventional kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) approach of using a fixed kernel to define the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), this paper embeds the statistics of the input data in the kernel definition, obtaining a closed-form solution for nonlinear adaptive filtering. We call this solution the Functional Wiener Filter (FWF), and it is formally an extension of Parzen's work on the autocorrelation RKHS to nonlinear functional spaces. We present a method for approximating the FWF in an explicit, finite-dimensional RKHS to model time series directly from realizations, which is less computationally demanding at test time than other KAF methods. We show that FWF outperforms KAF on a synthetic dataset that meets the conditions of the theory, and is comparable to other KAF algorithms for both a chaotic and real-world time series. We demonstrate how the difference equation learned by the FWF can be extracted, leading to possible applications in system identification.</description>

      <title>Radiance Field Delta Video Compression in Edge-Enabled Vehicular Metaverse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11857v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offload computationally intensive tasks to multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, enabling applications within the vehicular metaverse, which transforms physical environment into the digital space enabling advanced analysis or predictive modeling. A core challenge is physical-to-virtual (P2V) synchronization through digital twins (DTs), reliant on MEC networks and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). To address this, we introduce radiance field (RF) delta video compression (RFDVC), which uses RF-encoder and RF-decoder architecture using distributed RFs as DTs storing photorealistic 3D urban scenes in compressed form. This method extracts differences between CAV-frame capturing actual traffic and RF-frame capturing empty scene from the same camera pose in batches encoded and transmitted over the MEC network. Experiments show data savings up to 71% against H.264 codec and 44% against H.265 codec under different conditions as lighting changes, and rain. RFDVC also demonstrates resilience to transmission errors, significantly outperforming the standard codec in non-rainy conditions with up to a +0.26 structural similarity index measure (SSIM) improvement over H.264 codec, and maintaining a +0.18 SSIM improvement even in challenging rainy conditions, both measured at a block error rate (BLER) of 0.25.</description>

      <title>Dimension Scaling SR-Net for Super-Resolution Radar Range Profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-resolution radar range profile (RRP) is crucial for accurate target recognition and scene perception. To get a high-resolution RRP, many methods have been developed, such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC), orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), and a few deep learning-based approaches. Although they break through the Rayleigh resolution limit determined by radar signal bandwidth, these methods either get limited super-resolution capability or work well just in high signal to noise ratio (SNR) scenarios. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, an interpretable unfolded neural network for super-resolution RRP (DSSR-Net) is proposed by integrating the advantages of both model-guided and data-driven models. Specifically, DSSR-Net is designed based on a sparse representation model with dimension scaling, and then trained on a training dataset. Through dimension scaling, DSSR-Net lifts the radar signal into high-dimensional space to extract subtle features of closely spaced objects and suppress the noise of the high-dimensional features. It improves the super-resolving power of closely spaced objects and lowers the SNR requirement of radar signals compared to existing methods. The superiority of the proposed algorithm for super-resolution RRP reconstruction is verified via experiments with both synthetic and measured data.</description>

      <title>CrossRF: A Domain-Invariant Deep Learning Approach for RF Fingerprinting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting offers a promising approach for drone identification and security, although it suffers from significant performance degradation when operating on different transmission channels. This paper presents CrossRF, a domain-invariant deep learning approach that addresses the problem of cross-channel RF fingerprinting for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) identification. Our approach aims to minimize the domain gap between different RF channels by using adversarial learning to train a more robust model that maintains consistent identification performance despite channel variations. We validate our approach using the UAVSig dataset, comprising real-world over-the-air RF signals from identical drone models operating across several frequency channels, ensuring that the findings correspond to real-world scenarios. The experimental results show CrossRF's efficiency, achieving up to 99.03% accuracy when adapting from Channel 3 to Channel 4, compared to only 26.39% using conventional methods. The model maintains robust performance in more difficult multi-channel scenarios (87.57% accuracy adapting from Channels 1,3 to 2,4) and achieves 89.45% accuracy with 0.9 precision for controller classification. These results confirm CrossRF's ability to significantly reduce performance degradation due to cross-channel variations while maintaining high identification accuracy with minimal training data requirements, making it particularly suitable for practical drone security applications.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised-ISAR-Net Enables Fast Sparse ISAR Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerous sparse inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging methods based on unfolded neural networks have been developed for high-quality image reconstruction with sparse measurements. However, their training typically requires paired ISAR images and echoes, which are often difficult to obtain. Meanwhile, one property can be observed that for a certain sparse measurement configuration of ISAR, when a target is rotated around its center of mass, only the image of the target undergoes the corresponding rotation after ISAR imaging, while the grating lobes do not follow this rotation and are solely determined by the sparse-sampling pattern. This property is mathematically termed as the equivariant property. Taking advantage of this property, an unfolded neural network for sparse ISAR imaging with self-supervised learning, named SS-ISAR-Net is proposed. It effectively mitigates grating lobes caused by sparse radar echo, allowing high-quality training to be achieved using only sparse radar echo data. The superiority of the proposed SS-ISAR-Net, compared to existing methods, is verified through experiments with both synthetic and real-world measurement data.</description>

      <title>Distance-Domain Degrees of Freedom in Near-Field Region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely large aperture arrays operating in the near-field regime unlock additional spatial resources, which can be exploited to simultaneously serve multiple users even when they share the same angular direction. This work investigates the distance-domain degrees of freedom (DoF), defined as the DoF when a user varies only its distance to the base station and not the angle. To obtain the distance-domain DoF, we study a line-of-sight (LoS) channel with a source representing a base station and an observation region representing users, where the source is a large two-dimensional transmit (Tx) array with arbitrary shape and the observation region is an arbitrarily long linear receive (Rx) array with collinearly aligned elements located at different distances from the Tx array. We assume that both the Tx and Rx arrays have continuous apertures with an infinite number of elements and infinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the distance-domain DoF in the case of a finite number of elements. First, we analyze an ideal case where the Tx array is a single piece and the Rx array is on the broadside of the Tx array. By reformulating the channel as an integral operator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form expression for the distance-domain DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows that the distance-domain DoF is predominantly determined by the extreme boundaries of both the Tx and Rx arrays rather than their detailed interior structure. We further extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a projection method that converts the problem to an equivalent broadside case. Finally, we extend the analytical framework to modular arrays and show the distance-domain DoF gain over a single-piece array under a fixed total physical length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated analysis of lung sound auscultation is essential for monitoring respiratory health, especially in regions facing a shortage of skilled healthcare workers. While respiratory sound classification has been widely studied in adults, its ap plication in pediatric populations, particularly in children aged &lt;6 years, remains an underexplored area. The developmental changes in pediatric lungs considerably alter the acoustic proper ties of respiratory sounds, necessitating specialized classification approaches tailored to this age group. To address this, we propose a multistage hybrid CNN-Transformer framework that combines CNN-extracted features with an attention-based architecture to classify pediatric respiratory diseases using scalogram images from both full recordings and individual breath events. Our model achieved an overall score of 0.9039 in binary event classifi cation and 0.8448 in multiclass event classification by employing class-wise focal loss to address data imbalance. At the recording level, the model attained scores of 0.720 for ternary and 0.571 for multiclass classification. These scores outperform the previous best models by 3.81% and 5.94%, respectively. This approach offers a promising solution for scalable pediatric respiratory disease diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings.</description>

Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) has garnered significant attention due to its superior performance in high-mobility scenarios, coupled with multiple waveform parameters that provide greater degrees of freedom for system design. This paper introduces a novel secure affine frequency division multiplexing (SE-AFDM) system, which advances prior designs by dynamically varying an AFDM pre-chirp parameter to enhance physical-layer security. In the SE-AFDM system, the pre-chirp parameter is dynamically generated from a codebook controlled by a long-period pseudo-noise (LPPN) sequence. Instead of applying spreading in the data domain, our parameter-domain spreading approach provides additional security while maintaining reliability and high spectrum efficiency. We also propose a synchronization framework to solve the problem of reliably and rapidly synchronizing the time-varying parameter in fast time-varying channels. The theoretical derivations prove that unsynchronized eavesdroppers cannot eliminate the nonlinear impact of the time-varying parameter and further provide useful guidance for codebook design. Simulation results demonstrate the security advantages of the proposed SE-AFDM system in high-mobility scenarios, while our hardware prototype validates the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization framework.</description>

      <title>A Tracking prior to Localization workflow for Ultrasound Localization Microscopy</title>

Abstract: Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) has proven effective in resolving microvascular structures and local mean velocities at sub-diffraction-limited scales, offering high-resolution imaging capabilities. Dynamic ULM (DULM) enables the creation of angiography or velocity movies throughout cardiac cycles. Currently, these techniques rely on a Localization-and-Tracking (LAT) workflow consisting in detecting microbubbles (MB) in the frames before pairing them to generate tracks. While conventional LAT methods perform well at low concentrations, they suffer from longer acquisition times and degraded localization and tracking accuracy at higher concentrations, leading to biased angiogram reconstruction and velocity estimation. In this study, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges by reversing the current workflow. The proposed method, Tracking-and-Localization (TAL), relies on first tracking the MB and then performing localization. Through comprehensive benchmarking using both in silico and in vivo experiments and employing various metrics to quantify ULM angiography and velocity maps, we demonstrate that the TAL method consistently outperforms the reference LAT workflow. Moreover, when applied to DULM, TAL successfully extracts velocity variations along the cardiac cycle with improved repeatability. The findings of this work highlight the effectiveness of the TAL approach in overcoming the limitations of conventional LAT methods, providing enhanced ULM angiography and velocity imaging.</description>

      <title>UniCrossFi: A Unified Framework For Cross-Domain Wi-Fi-based Gesture Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06328v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing systems are severely hindered by cross domain problem when deployed in unseen real-world environments. Existing methods typically design separate frameworks for either domain adaptation or domain generalization, often relying on extensive labeled data. Existing methods that designed for domain generalization is often relying on extensive labeled data. However, real-world scenarios are far more complex, where the deployed model must be capable of handling generalization under limited labeled source data. To this end, we propose UniCrossFi, a unified framework designed to mitigate performance drop in CSI-based sensing across diverse deployment settings. Our framework not only extends conventional Domain Generalization (DG) to a more practical Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization (SSDG) setting, where only partially labeled source data are available, but also introduces a physics-informed data augmentation strategy, Antenna Response Consistency (ARC). ARC mitigates the risk of learning superficial shortcuts by exploiting the intrinsic spatial diversity of multi-antenna systems, treating signals from different antennas as naturally augmented views of the same event. In addition, we design a Unified Contrastive Objective to prevent conventional contrastive learning from pushing apart samples from different domains that share the same class. We conduct extensive experiments on the public Widar and CSIDA datasets. The results demonstrate that UniCrossFi consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods across all unsupervised domain adaptation, DG, and SSDG benchmarks. UniCrossFi provides a principled and practical solution to the domain shift challenge, advancing the feasibility of robust, real-world Wi-Fi sensing systems that can operate effectively with limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>Sum Rate Maximization for NOMA-Assisted Uplink Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an uplink communication scenario in which multiple users communicate with an access point (AP) employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). A pinching antenna, which can be activated at an arbitrary point along a dielectric waveguide, is deployed at the AP to dynamically reconfigure user channels. The objective is to maximize the system sum rate by jointly optimizing the pinching-antenna's position and the users' transmit powers. Two scenarios are considered: one without quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees, and the other with QoS guarantees. In the former case, users transmit at full power, and the antenna position is determined using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In the latter, an alternating optimization approach is adopted, where a low-complexity solution is derived for power allocation, and a modified PSO algorithm is applied to optimize the antenna position. Numerical results show that the proposed pinching-antenna-assisted system significantly improves the sum rate compared to the conventional fixed-antenna architecture. Furthermore, the NOMA-based approach consistently outperforms its TDMA-based counterpart. Finally, the proposed PSO-based method achieves near-optimal performance, particularly when the QoS constraints are moderate.</description>

      <title>Reliable Wireless Indoor Localization via Cross-Validated Prediction-Powered Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20268v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wireless indoor localization using predictive models with received signal strength information (RSSI) requires proper calibration for reliable position estimates. One remedy is to employ synthetic labels produced by a (generally different) predictive model. But fine-tuning an additional predictor, as well as estimating residual bias of the synthetic labels, demands additional data, aggravating calibration data scarcity in wireless environments. This letter proposes an approach that efficiently uses limited calibration data to simultaneously fine-tune a predictor and estimate the bias of synthetic labels, yielding prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees. Experiments on a fingerprinting dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Direct data-driven interpolation and approximation of linear parameter-varying system trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating missing values in trajectories of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems. We solve this interpolation problem for the class of shifted-affine LPV systems. Conditions for the existence and uniqueness of solutions are given and a direct data-driven algorithm for its computation is presented, i.e., the data-generating system is not given by a parametric model but is implicitly specified by data. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed solution on illustrative examples of a mass-spring-damper system with exogenous and endogenous parameter variation.</description>
