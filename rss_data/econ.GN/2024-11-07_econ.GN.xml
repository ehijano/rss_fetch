      <title>Age Normalized Testosterone Peaks at Series B for Male Startup Founders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a study of 107 male Y Combinator founders, a surprising correlation between age-normalized testosterone and company stage was uncovered. Testosterone, a hormone associated with confidence, dominance, and drive, increased by 55.7% from pre-seed to seed funding, peaking at the Series B stage, where levels were 99.6% higher than pre-seed. After series B funding, testosterone was observed to drop by 42.2%, coinciding with a spike in cortisol levels. This age-normalized biomarker analysis supports the dual-hormone hypothesis, illustrating that early startup success fosters feelings of dominance and confidence, while later-stage pressures and stresses erode these feelings. An alternative interpretation of the data, which suggests the opportunity for a longitudinal study, is that male founders with higher testosterone are more likely to raise larger rounds of funding.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Shock Compensation in the Multi-layer Network of Global Food Production and Trade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global food production and trade networks are highly dynamic, especially in response to shortages when countries adjust their supply strategies. In this study, we examine adjustments across 123 agri-food products from 192 countries resulting in 23616 individual scenarios of food shortage, and calibrate a multi-layer network model to understand the propagation of the shocks. We analyze shock mitigation actions, such as increasing imports, boosting production, or substituting food items. Our findings indicate that these lead to spillover effects potentially exacerbating food inequality: an Indian rice shock resulted in a 5.8 % increase in rice losses in countries with a low Human Development Index (HDI) and a 14.2 % decrease in those with a high HDI. Considering multiple interacting shocks leads to super-additive losses of up to 12 % of the total available food volume across the global food production network. This framework allows us to identify combinations of shocks that pose substantial systemic risks and reduce the resilience of the global food supply.</description>

      <title>Hiring as Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper views hiring as a contextual bandit problem: to find the best workers over time, firms must balance exploitation (selecting from groups with proven track records) with exploration (selecting from under-represented groups to learn about quality). Yet modern hiring algorithms, based on supervised learning approaches, are designed solely for exploitation. Instead, we build a resume screening algorithm that values exploration by evaluating candidates according to their statistical upside potential. Using data from professional services recruiting within a Fortune 500 firm, we show that this approach improves the quality (as measured by eventual hiring rates) of candidates selected for an interview, while also increasing demographic diversity, relative to the firm's existing practices. The same is not true for traditional supervised learning based algorithms, which improve hiring rates but select far fewer Black and Hispanic applicants.
  Together, our results highlight the importance of incorporating exploration in developing decision-making algorithms that are potentially both more efficient and equitable.</description>

      <title>Comparing Electoral Polarization Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a definition of ideological polarization of an electorate around a particular central point. This definition does not assume a particular location or boundaries of the center. Using US survey data, the paper shows how this approach can be used to establish whether polarization is occurring, and find the position around which it is happening. I then show the ideological polarization as defined here is related to other phenomena, such as affective polarization and increased salience of divisive issues.</description>

      <title>Multilingual hierarchical classification of job advertisements for job vacancy statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to develop a multilingual classifier and conditional probability estimator of occupation codes for online job advertisements according in accordance with the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) extended with the Polish Classification of Occupations and Specializations (KZiS), which is analogous to the European Classification of Occupations. In this paper, we utilise a range of data sources, including a novel one, namely the Central Job Offers Database, which is a register of all vacancies submitted to Public Employment Offices. Their staff members code the vacancies according to the ISCO and KZiS. A hierarchical multi-class classifier has been developed based on the transformer architecture. The classifier begins by encoding the jobs found in advertisements to the widest 1-digit occupational group, and then narrows the assignment to a 6-digit occupation code. We show that incorporation of the hierarchical structure of occupations improves prediction accuracy by 1-2 percentage points, particularly for the hand-coded online job advertisements. Finally, a bilingual (Polish and English) and multilingual (24 languages) model is developed based on data translated using closed and open-source software. The open-source software is provided for the benefit of the official statistics community, with a particular focus on international comparability.</description>

      <title>Generative AI at Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the staggered introduction of a generative AI-based conversational assistant using data from 5,172 customer support agents. Access to AI assistance increases worker productivity, as measured by issues resolved per hour, by 15\% on average, with substantial heterogeneity across workers. Less experienced and lower-skilled workers improve both the speed and quality of their output while the most experienced and highest-skilled workers see small gains in speed and small declines in quality. We also find evidence that AI assistance facilitates worker learning and improves English fluency, particularly among international agents. While AI systems improve with more training data, we find that the gains from AI adoption are largest for relatively rare problems, where human agents have less baseline training and experience. Finally, we provide evidence that AI assistance improves the experience of work along two key dimensions: customers are more polite and less likely to ask to speak to a manager.</description>

      <title>Skills or Degree? The Rise of Skill-Based Hiring for AI and Green Jobs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emerging professions in fields like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sustainability (green jobs) are experiencing labour shortages as industry demand outpaces labour supply. In this context, our study aims to understand whether employers have begun focusing more on individual skills rather than formal qualifications in their recruitment processes. We analysed a large time-series dataset of approximately eleven million online job vacancies in the UK from 2018 to mid-2024, drawing on diverse literature on technological change and labour market signalling. Our findings provide evidence that employers have initiated "skill-based hiring" for AI roles, adopting more flexible hiring practices to expand the available talent pool. From 2018-2023, demand for AI roles grew by 21% as a proportion of all postings (and accelerated into 2024). Simultaneously, mentions of university education requirements for AI roles declined by 15%. Our regression analysis shows that university degrees have a significantly lower wage premium for both AI and green roles. In contrast, AI skills command a wage premium of 23%, exceeding the value of degrees up until the PhD-level (33%). In occupations with high demand for AI skills, the premium for skills is high, and the reward for degrees is relatively low. We recommend leveraging alternative skill-building formats such as apprenticeships, on-the-job training, MOOCs, vocational education and training, micro-certificates, and online bootcamps to fully utilise human capital and address talent shortages.</description>
