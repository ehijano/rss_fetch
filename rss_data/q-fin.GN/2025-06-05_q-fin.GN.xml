      <title>Gauging Growth: AGI Mathematical Metrics for Economic Progress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Today, the economy is greatly influenced by Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). The purpose of this paper is to determine the impact of the quantitative relations of AGI on the country's economic parameters. The authors use the analysis of historical data in the research, develop a new mathematical algorithm that refers to the level of AGI development, and conduct a regression analysis. The economic effect of AGI is deduced if it affects the growth of real GDP. As a result of the analysis, it is revealed that there is a positive Pearson correlation between the growth of AGI and real GDP; that is, to increase GDP by 1%, an average increase of 12.5% of AGI is required.</description>

      <title>Hedging Deposit Run Risk Prior to the 2023 Regional Banking Crisis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this analysis we determine factors driving the cross-sectional variation in uninsured deposits during the interest rate raising cycle of 2022 to 2023. The goal of our analysis is to determine whether banks proactively managed deposit run risk prior to the hiking cycle which produced the 2023 Regional Banking Crisis. We find evidence that interest rate forward, futures, and swap use affected the change in a bank uninsured deposits over the period. Interest rate option use, however, has no effect on the change in uninsured deposits. Similarly, bank equity levels were uncorrelated with uninsured deposit changes. We conclude we find no evidence of banks managing run risk via their balance sheet prior to the 2023 Regional Banking Crisis.</description>
