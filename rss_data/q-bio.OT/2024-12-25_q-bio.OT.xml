      <title>A New Parameterization of Photoinhibition For Phytoplankton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical models of photosynthesis-irradiance relationships in phytoplankton are used to compute integrated water-column photosynthetic rates and predict primary production in ecosystem models. Models typically ignore an important phenomenon observed in most experiments: photosynthetic rate is an approximately constant maximum value over a range of irradiances until photoinhibition leads to decreasing photosynthetic rate. Here we develop a new model of photoinhibition that captures this plateau. We test six new models of photoinhibition and ten more photoinhibition models from the literature against a database of 1808 photosynthesis-irradiance curves exhibiting photoinhibition. In the best model, photoinhibition is phenomenologically described by multiplication by a saturating function of the reciprocal of irradiance, simplifies to the widely-used Jassby &amp; Platt photosynthesis-irradiance curve in the absence of photoinhibition, and only requires one new parameter. This photoinhibition parameter identifies the onset of photoinhibition and is the rate of decrease in photosynthetic rate at that irradiance. The parameters common to both of these models have a consistent interpretation, but our analysis of 3,615 experiments and 10,000 simulated datasets revealed significant discrepancies in parameter interpretation across other widely-used photoinhibition models. Deviations in parameter estimates across models of up to 40% were observed underscoring the need for consistent modeling approaches and supporting the application of our new photoinhibition model.</description>

      <title>Moving boundaries: An appreciation of John Hopfield</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to John Hopfield and Geoffrey Hinton, "for foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks." As noted by the Nobel committee, their work moved the boundaries of physics. This is a brief reflection on Hopfield's work, its implications for the emergence of biological physics as a part of physics, the path from his early papers to the modern revolution in artificial intelligence, and prospects for the future.</description>
