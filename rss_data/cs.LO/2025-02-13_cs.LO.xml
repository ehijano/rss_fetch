      <title>A Case Study on Evaluating Encodings Between Process Calculi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two process calculi may be compared in their expressive power using encodings between them. Not every such translation is meaningful and therefore quality criteria are necessary. There are several frameworks to assess the quality of encodings. A rather prominent approach consists of five criteria for valid encodings collected by Gorla. An alternative notion of validity up to a semantic equivalence was proposed by one of the authors. Here the quality of the encoding is measured by the strength of the semantic equivalence that makes it valid.
  In this paper we analyse two well-known translations from the synchronous into the asynchronous $\pi$-calculus, both meeting Gorla's criteria, and evaluate the encodings' validity up to different semantic equivalences.
  While Honda and Tokoro's translation is valid only for the weakest of the considered behavioural equivalences, Boudol's encoding also respects stronger ones. One could hence argue that Boudol's translation is more faithful.</description>

      <title>Low rank MSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new logic for describing properties of graphs, which we call low rank MSO. This is the fragment of monadic second-order logic in which set quantification is restricted to vertex sets of bounded cutrank. We prove the following statements about the expressive power of low rank MSO.
  - Over any class of graphs that is weakly sparse, low rank MSO has the same expressive power as separator logic. This equivalence does not hold over all graphs.
  - Over any class of graphs that has bounded VC dimension, low rank MSO has the same expressive power as flip-connectivity logic. This equivalence does not hold over all graphs.
  - Over all graphs, low rank MSO has the same expressive power as flip-reachability logic.
  Here, separator logic is an extension of first-order logic by basic predicates for checking connectivity, which was proposed by Boja\'nczyk [ArXiv 2107.13953] and by Schirrmacher, Siebertz, and Vigny [ACM ToCL 2023]. Flip-connectivity logic and flip-reachability logic are analogues of separator logic suited for non-sparse graphs, which we propose in this work. In particular, the last statement above implies that every property of undirected graphs expressible in low rank MSO can be decided in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Foundations of Digital Circuits: Denotation, Operational, and Algebraic Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis details a project to define a fully compositional theory of synchronous sequential circuits built from primitive components, motivated by applying techniques successfully used in programming languages to hardware.
  The first part of the thesis defines the syntactic foundations of sequential circuit morphisms, and then builds three different semantic theories: denotational, operational and algebraic. We characterise the denotational semantics of sequential circuits as certain causal stream functions, as well as providing a link to existing circuit methodologies by mapping between circuit morphisms, stream functions and Mealy machines. The operational semantics is defined as a strategy for applying some global transformations followed by local reductions to demonstrate how a circuit processes a value, leading to a notion of observational equivalence. The algebraic semantics consists of equations for bringing circuits into a pseudo-normal form, and then encoding between different state sets. This part of the thesis concludes with a discussion of some novel applications, such as those for using partial evaluation for digital circuits.
  While mathematically rigorous, the categorical string diagram formalism is not suited for reasoning computationally. The second part of this thesis details an extension of string diagram rewriting with hypergraphs so that it is compatible with the traced comonoid structure present in the category of digital circuits. We identify the properties that characterise cospans of hypergraphs corresponding to traced comonoid terms, and demonstrate how to identify rewriting contexts valid for rewriting modulo traced comonoid structure. We apply the graph rewriting framework to fixed point operators as well as the operational semantics from the first part, and present a new hardware description language based on these theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>The Queue Automaton Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the computational model of the Queue Automaton. An old result is that the deterministic queue automaton is equally expressive as the Turing machine. We introduced the Reactive Turing Machine, enhancing the Turing machine with a notion of interaction. The Reactive Turing Machine defines all executable processes. In this paper, we prove that the non-deterministic queue automaton is equally expressive as the Reactive Turing Machine. Together with finite automata, pushdown automata and parallel pushdown automata, queue automata form a nice hierarchy of executable processes, with stacks, bags and queues as central elements.</description>

      <title>A Semantic Parsing Algorithm to Solve Linear Ordering Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm to semantically parse linear ordering problems, which require a model to arrange entities using deductive reasoning. Our method takes as input a number of premises and candidate statements, parsing them to a first-order logic of an ordering domain, and then utilizes constraint logic programming to infer the truth of proposed statements about the ordering.
  Our semantic parser transforms Heim and Kratzer's syntax-based compositional formal semantic rules to a computational algorithm. This transformation involves introducing abstract types and templates based on their rules, and introduces a dynamic component to interpret entities within a contextual framework.
  Our symbolic system, the Formal Semantic Logic Inferer (FSLI), is applied to answer multiple choice questions in BIG-bench's logical_deduction multiple choice problems, achieving perfect accuracy, compared to 67.06% for the best-performing LLM (GPT-4) and 87.63% for the hybrid system Logic-LM.
  These promising results demonstrate the benefit of developing a semantic parsing algorithm driven by first-order logic constructs.</description>

      <title>Useful Evaluation: Syntax and Semantics (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides the first inductive definition of useful CBV evaluation. For that, we first restrict the substitution operation in the Value Substitution Calculus to be linear, yielding the LCBV strategy. We then further restrict substitution in LCBV, so that substitution contributes to the progress of the computation. This optimisation is the UCBV strategy, and its notion of substitution is sensitive to the surrounding evaluation context, so it is non-trivial to capture it inductively. Moreover, we show that UCBV is a sound and complete implementation of LCBV, optimised to implement useful evaluation. As a further contribution, we show that an existing notion of usefulness in the literature, namely the GLAMoUr abstract machine, implements the UCBV strategy with polynomial overhead in time. This establishes that UCBV is time-invariant, i.e., that the number of reduction steps to normal form in UCBV can be used as a measure of time complexity. Defining UCBV leads us to the first semantic model of useful CBV evaluation through system U, a non-idempotent intersection type system. Our main result is a characterisation of termination for useful CBV evaluation via system U: a term is typable in system U if and only if it terminates in UCBV. Additionally, system U provides a quantitative interpretation for UCBV, offering exact step-count information for program evaluation. Even though the specification of the operational semantics of UCBV is highly complex, system U is notably simple. As far as we know, system U is one of the scarce quantitative type systems capturing exactly the substitution step-count for a call-by-value strategy.</description>

      <title>Drawing with Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Drawing (a multiset of) coloured balls from an urn is one of the most basic models in discrete probability theory. Three modes of drawing are commonly distinguished: multinomial (draw-replace), hypergeometric (draw-delete), and Polya (draw-add). These drawing operations are represented as maps from urns to distributions over multisets of draws. The set of urns is a metric space via the Kantorovich distance. The set of distributions over draws is also a metric space, using Kantorovich-over-Kantorovich. It is shown that these three draw operations are all isometries, that is, they exactly preserve the Kantorovich distances. Further, drawing is studied in the limit, both for large urns and for large draws. First it is shown that, as the urn size increases, the Kantorovich distances go to zero between hypergeometric and multinomial draws, and also between P\'olya and multinomial draws. Second, it is shown that, as the drawsize increases, the Kantorovich distance goes to zero (in probability) between an urn and (normalised) multinomial draws from the urn. These results are known, but here, they are formulated in a novel metric manner as limits of Kantorovich distances. We call these two limit results the law of large urns and the law of large draws.</description>

      <title>On the expressive power of inquisitive epistemic logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inquisitive modal logic, InqML, in its epistemic incarnation, extends standard epistemic logic to capture not just the information that agents have, but also the questions that they are interested in. We use the natural notion of bisimulation equivalence in the setting of InqML, as introduced in [Ciardelli/Otto: JSL 2021], to characterise the expressiveness of InqML as the bisimulation invariant fragment of first-order logic over natural classes of two-sorted first-order structures that arise as relational encodings of inquisitive epistemic (S5-like) models. The non-elementary nature of these classes crucially requires non-classical model-theoretic methods for the analysis of first-order expressiveness, irrespective of whether we aim for characterisations in the sense of classical or of finite model theory.</description>
