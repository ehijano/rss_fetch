      <title>Phase Transitions without gap closing in monitored quantum mean-field systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the monitored dynamics of many-body quantum systems in which projective measurements of extensive operators are alternated with unitary evolution. Focusing on mean-field models characterized by all-to-all interactions, we develop a general framework that captures the thermodynamic limit, where a semiclassical description naturally emerges. Remarkably, we uncover novel stationary states, distinct from the conventional infinite-temperature state, that arise upon taking the infinite-volume limit. Counterintuitively, this phenomenon is not linked to the closing of the Lindbladian gap in that limit. We provide analytical explanation for this unexpected behavior.</description>

      <title>From informal markets to Limit Order Book dynamics: a mean field connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified mean-field framework that bridges the dynamics of informal financial markets and formal markets governed by Limit Order Books (LOBs). Both settings are modeled as interacting particle systems on a 1D price lattice, with temporal evolution described by master equations that account for new entries, cancellations, and executions. The key insight is the introduction of a preferential interaction parameter $\Psi$, which modulates the likelihood of transactions based on price compatibility: when $\Psi=0$, interactions are random and uncoordinated, reproducing the structure of informal markets; as $\Psi\to \infty$, only optimal (most mutually attractive) trades occur, recovering LOB-like dynamics. A grand-canonical interpretation is used to identify effective thermodynamic quantities -such as interaction energy and price-dependent chemical potentials -that underlie both systems. Most results are validated through numerical integration and simulations, although an analytical solution is shown to exist at least for the symmetric stationary case of the informal market.</description>

      <title>Persson's Theory of Purely Normal Elastic Rough Surface Contact: A Tutorial Based on Stochastic Process Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persson's theory of purely normal rough surface contact was developed two decades ago during the study of tire-road interaction, and gradually became one of the dominant approaches to study the solid-solid interaction between rough surfaces. Contrary to its popular applications in various cross-disciplinary fields, the fundamental study of Persson's theory of contact attracted little attention from the tribology and contact mechanics communities. As far as the authors know, many researchers struggle to understand the derivation of the theory. Few attempts have been made to clarify the oversimplified derivation provided by Persson (Persson, 2001). The present work provides a detailed tutorial on Persson's theory, which does not simply follow the commonly adopted derivation initiated by Persson. A new derivation is given based on stochastic process theory, assuming that the variation of the random contact pressure with respect to scale is a Markov process. We revisit the essential assumptions utilized to derive the diffusion equation, boundary conditions, drift and diffusion coefficients, and closed-form results. This tutorial can serve as a self-consistent introduction for solid mechanicians, tribologists, and postgraduate students who are not familiar with Persson's theory, or who struggle to understand it.</description>

      <title>Smeared phase transition in the dissipative random quantum Ashkin-Teller model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of dissipation in the phase diagram of the random quantum Ashkin-Teller model by means of a generalization of the strong-disorder renormalization group combined with adiabatic renormalization. This model has three phases and three quantum phase transitions. We demonstrate that the combined effect of Ohmic dissipation and quenched disorder smears two out of the three quantum phase transitions. Our analytical theory allows us to understand why one of the phase transitions remains sharp. This is due to a cancellation of the dissipation effects on the nontrivial nature of the intertwined order parameter of one of the phases.</description>

      <title>On Sak's criterion for statistical models with long-range interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the threshold value $\sigma_*$ that separates the short-range (SR) and long-range (LR) universality classes in phase transitions remains a controversial issue. While Sak's criterion, $\sigma_* = 2 - \eta_{\mathrm{SR}}$, has been widely accepted, recent studies of two-dimensional (2D) models with long-range interactions have challenged it. In this work, we focus on the crossover between LR and SR criticality in several classical 2D statistical models, including the XY, Heisenberg, percolation, and Ising models, whose interactions decay as $1/r^{2+\sigma}$. Our previous simulations for the XY, Heisenberg, and percolation models consistently indicate a universal boundary at $\sigma_* = 2$. Here, we complete the picture by performing large-scale Monte Carlo simulations of the 2D LR-Ising model, reaching lattice sizes up to $L = 8192$. By analyzing the Fortuin-Kasteleyn critical polynomial $R_p$, the Binder ratio $Q_m$, and the anomalous dimension $\eta$, we obtain convergent and self-consistent evidence that the universality class already changes sharply at $\sigma = 2$. Taken together, these results establish a unified scenario for LR interacting systems: across all studied models, the crossover from LR to SR universality occurs at $\sigma_* = 2$.</description>

      <title>Degrees of universality in wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence of weakly interacting waves displays a great deal of universality: independence of the details of the interaction and of the pumping and dissipation scales. Here we study how inverse turbulent cascades (from small to large scales) transition from weak to strong. We find that while one-loop corrections can be dependent on excitation and dissipation scales, new types of universality appear in strong turbulence. We contrast turbulence of spin waves in ferromagnets with turbulent cascades in the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation (NSE) and in an MMT-like model in higher dimensions having a multiplicative interaction vertex: vertex renormalization gives rise to dependence on the pumping (UV scale) in the former but not in the latter. As a result of this spectral nonlocality, spin-wave turbulence stops being weak if one is sufficiently far from the pumping scale, even when the interaction of waves with comparable wavenumbers is weak. We paraphrase this as: nonlocality enhances nonlinearity.
  We then describe strong turbulence in a multi-component version of these models with a large number of components. We argue that strong spin-wave turbulence is similar to turbulence of the focusing NSE, as it realizes a critical-balance state. However, UV nonlocality causes the level of spin-wave turbulence at large scales to decrease with increasing pumping level, culminating in a state that is independent of the level of pumping.</description>

      <title>Balancing information and dissipation with partially observed fluctuating signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological systems sense and extract information from fluctuating signals while operating under energetic constraints and limited resolution. We introduce a general chemical model in which a sensor, coupled to a signaling pathway activated by hidden signals, can allosterically tune the production of a readout molecule. We propose viable strategies for the sensor to estimate, and eventually balance, information gathering on the hidden process and the associated dissipative cost relying solely on counting statistics of observed trajectories. We show that these strategies can be successfully implemented to adapt the readout production even with finite-time measurements and limited dynamic resolution, and remain effective in the presence of inhibitory regulatory mechanisms. Our study provides a plausible mechanism to actively balance information and dissipation, paving the way for an implementable design principle underpinning biological and biochemical adaptation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement membrane in the Brownian SYK chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is mounting evidence that entanglement dynamics in chaotic many-body quantum systems in the limit of large subsystems and long times is described by an entanglement membrane effective theory. In this paper, we derive the membrane description in a solvable chaotic large-$N$ model, the Brownian SYK chain. This model has a collective field description in terms of fermion bilinears connecting different folds of the multifold Schwinger-Keldysh path integral used to compute R\'enyi entropies. The entanglement membrane is a traveling wave solution of the saddle point equations governing these collective fields. The entanglement membrane is characterised by a velocity $v$ and a membrane tension ${\cal E}(v)$ that we calculate. We find that the membrane has finite width for $v&lt;v_B$ (the butterfly velocity), however for $v &gt; v_B$, the membrane splits into two wave fronts, each moving with the butterfly velocity. Our results provide a new viewpoint on the entanglement membrane and uncover new connections between quantum information dynamics and scrambling.</description>

      <title>Probing false vacuum decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum field theory (QFT), the "vacuum" is not just empty space but the lowest-energy state of a quantum field. If the energy landscape has multiple local minima, the local ground states are the false vacuum (FV) which can tunnel towards the global ground state (true vacuum, TV). This process exhibits signature akin to classical supercooled gas transitions and many-body tunneling in discrete quantum systems. Here, we study the FV decay and bubble nucleation in a Rydberg atom ring. The long-range van-der-Waals interactions and individual-site addressability allow us to explore physics beyond the standard Ising model. We observe that the FV decay rate decreases exponentially with the inverse of the symmetry-breaking field, directly mirroring QFT predictions. Moreover, we demonstrate that even minor deviations from the ideal metastable state can cause a stark departure from this universal scaling law. Extending beyond short-time decay dynamics, we also examine resonant bubble nucleation, a feature distinctive to systems with discrete energy spectra. Our findings and methods open avenues for future studies of many-body tunneling in higher dimensions or more complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Modular Hamiltonian of the massive scalar field on the half line: A numerical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the modular Hamiltonian of an interval for the ground state of a massive free scalar field on the half line with Robin boundary conditions, by employing a numerical method. When the interval is adjacent to the boundary, we find numerical evidence that the modular Hamiltonian is non-local, except for the limiting cases of the massless scalar satisfying either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. When the interval is separated from the boundary, the numerical analysis indicates that the modular Hamiltonian is non-local for all these boundary conditions and any value of the mass.</description>

      <title>Diffusive geodesics wandering in networks of rigid chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an ensemble of spatial networks built from the junctions of hindered-rotation chains, incorporating directional correlations between bonds, an aspect ignored in the standard network modeling paradigm. The emergent random networks support geodesics with a wandering exponent $\xi = 1/2$, and a travel-time fluctuation exponent $\chi = 0$, consistent with the KPZ relation, yet violating the bound~$\chi\geq1/8$ predicted in the Poissonian framework. Transverse deviations follow the Kolmogorov distribution, indicating similarities between Brownian bridge excursions and geodesics in a random medium with correlated edges orientations. These results reveal a new universality class of Euclidean first-passage percolation, where local orientational memory reshapes transport properties and challenges existing bounds for random spatial networks.</description>

      <title>On six-loop scaling dimensions of $(\phi^2)^n$ operators in $d=3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of singlet operators $(\phi^2)^n$ in the three-dimensional $O(N)$ model with $\lambda^2 \phi^6$ interaction. Recently, the corresponding anomalous dimensions $\gamma_{2n}$ were computed by semiclassical methods and the all-loop result for the leading-$n$ corrections in the small $\lambda$ limit was found. In this letter, we obtain the six-loop expressions not only for the leading-$n$ contribution but also for the subleading one. While the leading correction confirms the predictions of recent semiclassical calculation, the subleading one is a new result and will serve as a future welcome check for the all-loop expressions. As an important by-product of our calculation, we provide a full dependence on $n$ of the four-loop $\gamma_{2n}$ in the $O(N)$ case.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic universality across dissipative quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study finite-time driving across second-order dissipative quantum phase transitions described by Lindblad dynamics. We show that the nonadiabatic entropy production, which quantifies deviations from the instantaneous nonequilibrium steady state, exhibits universal power-law scaling with the ramp duration in analogy to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for closed systems. This establishes the universality of irreversible dissipation induced by driving an open quantum system near criticality. Furthermore, in systems described by bosonic Gaussian states, our scaling laws predict that the nonadiabatic entropy production is independent of driving speed to leading order, revealing a distinctive feature of Gaussian dissipative quantum phase transitions. We validate these analytical predictions in the thermodynamic limit of the driven-dissipative Dicke model and via finite-size scaling in the open Kerr model. Our results establish a general framework for understanding universal nonequilibrium response and thermodynamic irreversibility in critical open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Global phase diagram of two-dimensional dirty hyperbolic Dirac liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the canonical nearest-neighbor tight-binding model for spinless fermions, a family of two-dimensional bipartite hyperbolic lattices hosts massless Diraclike excitations near half-filling with the iconic vanishing density of states (DOS) near zero energy. We show that a collection of such ballistic quasiparticles remains stable against sufficiently weak pointlike charge impurities, a feature captured by the vanishing average [$\rho_{a}(0)$] and typical [$\rho_{t}(0)$] DOS at zero energy, computed by employing the kernel polynomial method in sufficiently large $\{ 10, 3\}$ hyperbolic lattices (Schl\"afli symbol) with more than $10^8$ and $10^5$ sites, respectively, with open boundary conditions. However, at moderate disorder the system enters a metallic state via a continuous quantum phase transition where both $\rho_{a}(0)$ and $\rho_{t}(0)$ become finite. With increasing strength of disorder, ultimately an Anderson insulator sets in, where only $\rho_{t}(0) \to 0$. The resulting phase diagram for dirty Dirac fermions living on a hyperbolic space solely stems from the background negative spatial curvature, as confirmed from the vanishing $\rho_{t}(0)$ for arbitrarily weak disorder on honeycomb lattices, fostering relativistic fermions on a flatland, as the thermodynamic limit is approached.</description>

      <title>Matrix approach to generalized ensemble theory for nonequilibrium discrete systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A universal and rigorous ensemble framework for nonequilibrium system remains lacking. Here, we provide a concise framework for the generalized ensemble theory of nonequilibrium discrete systems using matrix-based approach. By introducing an observation matrix, we show that any discrete probability distribution can be formulated as a generalized Boltzmann distribution, with observables and their conjugate variables serving as basis vectors and coordinates in a vector space. Within this framework, we identify the minimal sufficient statistics required to infer the Boltzmann distribution. The nonequilibrium thermodynamic relations and fluctuation-dissipation relations naturally emerge from this framework. Our findings provide a new approach to developing generalized ensemble theory for nonequilibrium discrete systems.</description>

      <title>Entropy Production in Non-Gaussian Active Matter: A Unified Fluctuation Theorem and Deep Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a general framework for deriving entropy production rates (EPRs) in active matter systems driven by non-Gaussian active fluctuations. Employing the probability-flow equivalence technique, we rigorously obtain an entropy production (EP) decomposition formula. We demonstrate that the EP, $\Delta s_\mathrm{tot}$, satisfies a detailed fluctuation theorem, $\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(\Sigma)/\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(-\Sigma)=e^{\Sigma}$, which holds for the distribution $\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(\Sigma)$ defined as the probability of observing a value $\Sigma$ of the quantity $\mathcal{R}\equiv \Delta s_\mathrm{tot}-B_\mathrm{act}$, where $B_\mathrm{act}$ is a path-dependent random variable associated with active fluctuations. Moreover, an integral fluctuation theorem, $\langle e^{- \mathcal{R} } \rangle = 1$, and the generalized second law of thermodynamics, $\langle \Delta s_\mathrm{tot} \rangle \ge \langle B_\mathrm{act} \rangle$, follow directly. Our results hold under steady-state conditions and can be straightforwardly extended to arbitrary initial states. In the limiting case where active fluctuations vanish, these theorems reduce to the established results of stochastic thermodynamics. Building on this theoretical foundation, we introduce a deep-learning-based methodology for efficiently computing the EP, utilizing the L\'{e}vy score we propose. To illustrate the validity of our approach, we apply it to two representative systems: a Brownian particle in a periodic active bath and an active polymer composed of an active Brownian cross-linker interacting with passive Brownian beads. Our work provides a unified framework for analyzing EP in active matter and offers practical computational tools for investigating complex nonequilibrium behavior.</description>

      <title>Half-ice, half-fire driven ultranarrow phase crossover in 1D decorated q-state Potts ferrimagnets: An AI-co-led exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: OpenAI's reasoning model o3-mini-high was used to carry out an exact analytic study of onedimensional ferrimagnetic site- and bond-decorated q-state Potts models. We demonstrate that the finitetemperature ultranarrow phase crossover (UNPC), driven by a hidden "half-ice, half-fire" state recently discovered in the $q = 2$ case (Ising model), persists for $q &gt; 2$. We identify unique novel features for $q &gt; 2$, including the dome structure in the field-temperature phase diagram and for large $q$ a secondary high-temperature UNPC to the fully disordered paramagnetic state. Moreover, while the crossover temperature $T_0$ in the site-decorated Potts model is independent of the spin interaction $J$ between the backbone spins and thus remains unchanged as the UNPC quickly approaches a genuine transition -- the crossover width is narrowed exponentially -- by enhancing $J$ (referred to as Type-I UNPC), $T_0$ in the bond-decorated Potts model with $q &gt; 2$ depends on $J$ and quickly shifts toward a finite temperature as $J$ increases (referred to as Type-II UNPC). These novel results establish a versatile framework for engineering controlled fast state-flipping switches in low-dimensional systems. Our nine-level AI-contribution rating assigns AI the meritorious status of AI-co-led discovery in this work.</description>

Abstract: Although one-dimensional classical spin chains do not exhibit phase transitions, we found that a phase transition does occur when they are coupled to a cavity photon mode. This provides the simplest exactly solvable examples demonstrating that finite-temperature superradiant phase transitions can emerge from long-range fully connected interactions mediated by photons and interactions within the material.</description>

      <title>The Geometric Origin of Time's Arrow: Loschmidt Resolved</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resolve Loschmidt's paradox-the 150-year-old contradiction between time-reversible microscopic dynamics and irreversible macroscopic evolution. The resolution requires both quantum mechanics and classical chaos; neither alone suffices. Quantum uncertainty without chaos produces slow, polynomial spreading-not fundamentally irreversible. Classical chaos without quantum uncertainty produces computational intractability-trajectories diverge exponentially, yet the system remains on one trajectory, reversible in principle with sufficient precision. Only together do they produce geometric impossibility: chaos exponentially amplifies irreducible $\hbar$-scale uncertainty until stable manifolds contract below quantum resolution, rendering time-reversed trajectories physically inaccessible despite being mathematically valid and equiprobable. Information is never destroyed-it becomes geometrically inaccessible. The Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate is identical in both time directions, preserving microscopic symmetry while explaining macroscopic irreversibility. Three decades of Loschmidt echo experiments confirm perturbation-independent decay consistent with geometric inaccessibility. The framework unifies thermodynamic, quantum, and information-theoretic arrows of time.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing thermal versus quantum annealing using probability-flux signatures across interaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulated annealing provides a heuristic solution to combinatorial optimization problems. The cost function of a problem is mapped onto the energy function of a physical many-body system, and, by using thermal or quantum fluctuations, the system explores the state space to find the ground state, which corresponds to the optimal solution of the problem. Studies have highlighted both the similarities and differences between thermal and quantum fluctuations. Nevertheless, fundamental understanding of thermal and quantum annealing remains incomplete, making it unclear how quantum annealing outperforms thermal annealing in which problem instances. Here, we investigate the many-body dynamics of thermal and quantum annealing by examining all possible interaction networks of $\pm J$ Ising spin systems up to seven spins. Our comprehensive investigation reveals that differences between thermal and quantum annealing emerge for particular interaction networks, indicating that the structure of the energy landscape distinguishes the two dynamics. We identify the microscopic origin of these differences through probability fluxes in state space, finding that the two dynamics are broadly similar, but that quantum tunnelling produces qualitative differences. Our results provide insight into how thermal and quantum fluctuations navigate a system toward the ground state in simulated annealing, and are experimentally verifiable in atomic, molecular, and optical systems. Furthermore, these insights may improve mappings of optimization problems to Ising spin systems, yielding more accurate solutions in faster simulated annealing and thus benefiting real-world applications in industry. Our comprehensive survey of interaction networks and visualization of probability flux can help to understand, predict, and control quantum advantage in quantum annealing.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the Heider model in the presence of an external social field. This field was introduced to break the symmetry between the probabilities of hostile and friendly relationships. We consider the system in the presence of fluctuations generated by thermal noise and present the results of a comparative study of two-dimensional triangular and square networks with periodic boundary conditions. The results were obtained using three different methods: exact calculations for small systems, Monte Carlo simulations of medium-sized systems, and exact calculations in the thermodynamic limit (corresponding to infinite size) of certain limiting cases for which analytical solutions are possible. In particular, we exploit the recently discovered equivalence between structurally balanced systems and the Ising model to derive an exact form of the edge magnetization susceptibility for systems in Heider equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of quantum annealing via n-local catalysts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The potential quantum speedup in solving optimization problems via adiabatic quantum annealing is often hindered by the closing of the energy gap during the anneal, especially when this gap scales exponentially with system size. In this work, we alleviate this bottleneck by demonstrating that for the NP-complete Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem, an informed choice of $n-$local catalysts (operators involving $n$ qubits) can re-open the gap during the annealing process. By analyzing first-order phase transitions in toy instances of the MWIS problem, we first identify direct-tunneling catalysts that effectively eliminate the transition and provide an analytical discussion on when the sign of the catalyst influences its impact. We then reveal that $n-$local catalysts exponentially improve gap scaling and in certain scenarios are as effective as direct tunnel coupling between two minima. Utilizing this understanding, we show that they also increase the efficiency of ground state preparation via adiabatic quantum annealing in random graphs and analytically demonstrate the necessity of their placement across unfrustrated loops in the graph for effective performance in MWIS problems. Additionally, using a circuit implementation of the $n$-local catalyst (requiring $2n$ nearest-neighbour gates), we demonstrate that both the circuit depth and the total number of gates required to solve the problem are reduced by several orders of magnitude when compared to the discrete-time version of traditional quantum annealing using local drivers. Our analysis suggests that non-local quantum fluctuations entangling multiple qubits as a catalyst are key to achieving the desired quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>D-commuting SYK model: building quantum chaos from integrable blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12806v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a new family of quantum chaotic models by combining multiple copies of integrable commuting SYK models. As each copy of the commuting SYK model does not commute with others, this construction breaks the integrability of each commuting SYK and the family of models demonstrates the emergence of quantum chaos. We study the spectrum of this model analytically in the double-scaled limit. As the number of copies tends to infinity, the spectrum becomes compact and equivalent to the regular SYK model. For finite $d$ copies, the spectrum is close to the regular SYK model in UV but has an exponential tail $e^{E/T_c}$ in the IR. We identify the reciprocal of the exponent in the tail as a critical temperature $T_c$, above which the model should be quantum chaotic. $T_c$ monotonically decreases as $d$ increases, which expands the chaotic regime over the non-chaotic regime. We propose the existence of a new phase around $T_c$, and the dynamics should be very different in two phases. We further carry out numeric analysis at finite $d$, which supports our proposal.
  Given any finite dimensional local Hamiltonian, by decomposing it into $d$ groups, in which all terms in one group commute with each other but terms from different groups may not, our analysis can give an estimate of the critical temperature for quantum chaos based on the decomposition. We also comment on the implication of the critical temperature to future quantum simulations of quantum chaos and quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Numerical extraction of crosscap coefficients in microscopic models for (2+1)D conformal field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal field theory (CFT) can be placed on disparate space-time manifolds to facilitate investigations of their properties. For (2+1)-dimensional [(2+1)D] theories, one useful choice is the real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^3$ obtained by identifying antipodal points on the boundary sphere of a three-dimensional ball. One-point functions of scalar primary fields on this manifold generally do not vanish and encode the so-called crosscap coefficients. These coefficients also manifest on the sphere as the overlaps between certain crosscap states and CFT primary states. Taking the (2+1)D Ising CFT as a concrete example, we demonstrate that crosscap coefficients can be extracted from microscopic models. We construct crosscap states in both lattice models defined on polyhedrons and continuum models in Landau levels, where the degrees of freedom at antipodal points are entangled in Bell-type states. By computing their overlaps with the eigenstates of many-body Hamiltonians, we obtain results consistent with those from conformal bootstrap. Importantly, our approach directly reveals the absolute values of crosscap overlaps, whereas bootstrap calculations typically yield only their ratios. Furthermore, we investigate the finite-size scaling of these overlaps and their evolution under perturbations away from criticality.</description>

      <title>Electronic modes induced by spin and charge perturbations in Mott and Kondo insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic band structures usually remain unaffected by doping via a chemical-potential shift or by increasing the temperature in conventional band insulators. In contrast, it has been shown that those of Mott and Kondo insulators can be altered by doping or by increasing the temperature: electronic modes are induced within the band gap, exhibiting momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion relations from the band edges. Here, this study demonstrates that the underlying mechanism of the remarkable strong-correlation effects can be generalized to the emergence of electronic modes caused by various spin and charge perturbations, including magnetization of spin-gapped Mott and Kondo insulators. These emergent modes can alter the band structure if a macroscopic number of spins or charges are excited by the perturbations at a given moment. The origins and dispersion relations of these emergent modes, particularly why and how the dispersion relations depend on the momentum and energy of the perturbations, are elucidated by investigating the selection rules and using the Bethe ansatz and the effective theory for weak inter-unit-cell hopping. The validity and generality of the theoretical results across different models and spatial dimensions are verified by numerical calculations for the one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models, periodic Anderson models, Kondo lattice models, and ladder and bilayer Hubbard models. This study provides crucial insights into why and how spin and charge perturbations can alter the band structure in strongly correlated insulators, thereby paving the way for band-structure engineering in strong-correlation electronics, which enables previously unexplored functionalities by exploiting the unconventional characteristics revealed in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a recently synthesizable class of active interfaces formed by linked self--propelled colloids, we investigate the dynamics and fluctuations of a phoretically (chemically) interacting active interface with roto--translational coupling. We enumerate all steady--state shapes of the interface across parameter space and identify a regime where the interface acquires a finite curvature, leading to a characteristic ''C--shaped'' topology, along with persistent self--propulsion. In this phase, the interface height fluctuations obey Family--Vicsek scaling but with novel exponents: a dynamic exponent $z_h \approx 0.5$, a roughness exponent $\alpha_h \approx 0.9$ and a super--ballistic growth exponent $\beta_h \approx 1.7$. In contrast, the orientational fluctuations of the colloidal monomers exhibit a negative roughness exponent, reflecting a surprising smoothness law, where steady--state fluctuations diminish with increasing system size. Together, these findings point towards a unique non--equilibrium universality class associated with self--propelled interfaces of non--standard shape.</description>
