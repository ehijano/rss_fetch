      <title>Photomolecular Effect: Visible Light Absorption at Water-Vapor Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.10646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evaporation of water is ubiquitous in nature and industrial technologies. The known mechanism for evaporation is "thermal evaporation" which highlights the energy input for evaporation is via heat. Due to the weak absorption of water to visible light, the first step to using solar energy to evaporate water is usually by converting it into thermal energy through photothermal processes via additional absorbing materials. Contrary to this conventional wisdom, we report here strong absorption of photons in the visible spectrum at the water-vapor interface by direct cleavage of water clusters via a process we call photomolecular effect. We show that this process happens at the water-vapor interface by measuring the dependence of the photomolecular evaporation rate on the wavelength, the angle of incidence, and the polarization of the incident light. The spectra signatures in the vapor phase further support the photomolecular effect. Despite the long propagation lengths of visible light in bulk water, we demonstrate that they can heat a thin layer of fog easily, suggesting that this process is ubiquitous. The photomolecular effect will have significant implications for the earth's water cycle, global warming, plant transpiration, as well as different technologies involving the evaporation of liquids from drying to power generation</description>
