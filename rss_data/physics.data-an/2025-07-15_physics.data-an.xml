      <title>Mind the Gap: Navigating Inference with Optimal Transport Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) techniques have recently enabled enormous gains in sensitivity across the sciences. In particle physics, much of this progress has relied on excellent simulations of a wide range of physical processes. However, due to the sophistication of modern machine learning (ML) algorithms and their reliance on high-quality training samples, discrepancies between simulation and experimental data can significantly limit the effectiveness of ML techniques. In this work, we present a solution to this ``mis-specification'' problem: a calibration approach based on optimal transport, which we apply to high-dimensional simulations for the first time. We demonstrate the performance of our approach through jet tagging, using a CMS-inspired dataset. A 128-dimensional internal jet representation from a powerful general-purpose classifier is studied; after calibrating this internal ``latent'' representation, we find that a wide variety of quantities derived from it for downstream tasks are also properly calibrated: using this calibrated high-dimensional representation, powerful new applications of jet flavor information can be utilized in LHC analyses. This is a key step toward allowing properly-calibrated ``foundation models'' in particle physics. More broadly, this calibration framework has broad applications for correcting high-dimensional simulations across the sciences.</description>

      <title>Similarity networks of ordinal-pattern transitions classify falling paper trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paper fragments in free fall constitute a simple yet paradigmatic mechanical system exhibiting remarkably complex motions. Despite a long history of investigation, this system has defied comprehensive first-principles modeling, motivating the development of phenomenological and experimental approaches to classify the free-fall dynamics of small paper fragments. Here we apply the Bandt-Pompe symbolization method to extract high-dimensional features corresponding to ordinal-pattern transitions (so-called ordinal networks) from observed area time series of video-recorded falling papers shaped as circles, squares, hexagons, and crosses. We then represent each trajectory as a node in a weighted similarity network, with edges encoding pairwise dynamical similarity, and identify motion classes via community detection. Our method automatically clusters trajectories into tumbling and chaotic falls in excellent agreement with expert visual classification. Notably, it outperforms previous approaches based on classical physical features derived from complete three-dimensional trajectories -- especially for cross-shaped papers -- and requires no prior specification of the number of motion classes. We further find that trajectories diverging from expert classifications occupy more central positions in the similarity network, suggesting more complex and ambiguous dynamic behavior.</description>

      <title>Inference of time delay in stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time delay is ubiquitous in many experimental and real-world situations. It is often unclear whether time delay plays a significant role in observed phenomena, and if it does, how long the time lag really is. This would be invaluable knowledge when analyzing and modeling such systems. Hitherto, no universal method is available by which the time delay can be inferred. To address this problem, we propose and demonstrate two different methods to infer time delay in overdamped Langevin systems with delayed feedback. In the first part, we focus on the power spectral density based on the positional data and use a characteristic signature of the time delay to infer the delay time. In limiting cases, we establish a direct relation of the observations made for nonlinear time-delayed feedback forces to analytical results obtained for the linear system. In other situations despite the absence of this direct relation, the characteristic signature remains and can be exploited by a semiautomatic method to infer the delay time. Furthermore, it may not always desirable or possible to observe a system for a long time to infer dependencies and parameters. Thus, in the second part, we propose for the first time a probing method combined with a neural network to infer the delay time, which requires only short observation time series. These proposed methods for inferring time delays in stochastic systems may prove to be valuable tools for gaining deeper insight into the role of delay across a wide range of applications -- from the behavior of individual colloidal particles under feedback control to emergent collective phenomena such as flocking and swarming.</description>

      <title>A NuSTAR study of quasi-periodic oscillations from the ultraluminous X-ray sources in M82</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of quasi-periodic oscillations in X-ray binaries provides valuable insights into the physics of accretion around compact objects. The M82 galaxy hosts two ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), one of which is suspected to harbor an intermediate-mass black hole. Using 39 NuSTAR observations acquired between 2014--2024, we investigate the aperiodic X-ray variability in M82. In particular, we study in detail the evolution of the QPO from M82 X-1 in the range 20--300 mHz. We do not find additional timing features in the data, besides a frequent broad noise component at lower frequencies. The QPO behaves similarly to other classes of low-frequency oscillations in accreting compact objects, both black holes and neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Linear Acceleration Is a Primary Risk Factor for Concussion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotational acceleration of the head has long been posited as the primary cause of concussion due to its ability to generate shear strains that disrupt neuronal structure and function [1,2]. Linear acceleration, by contrast, is considered less injurious due to the brain's suspension in cerebrospinal fluid within the rigid skull [3,4]. As a result, the rotational acceleration hypothesis has predominantly driven international safety standards and protective equipment design. However, direct measurements of rotational acceleration during human concussion remain limited, leaving the rotational hypothesis largely untested in vivo. Here we show that linear acceleration is a significantly more precise predictor of concussion than rotational acceleration. We used mouthguards instrumented with inertial sensors to directly measure head kinematics during concussions occurring in children and adults of both sexes. Surprisingly, we found that rotational acceleration was not a significant independent predictor of concussion. Finite-element computed brain strains also had little predictive power, suggesting limitations in modeling the intracranial contents purely as solid materials. We suspect that modeling cerebrospinal fluid flow might reveal a protective effect that is limited by the magnitude of linear acceleration and the size of the subarachnoid space. Inspired by the protective role of cerebrospinal fluid, we invented a liquid shock absorbing technology and modeled it in a bicycle helmet. Using linear acceleration as a concussion risk function, we predict that our liquid technology can reduce the risk of concussion by up to 73 percent compared to a conventional foam helmet. Together, our findings support the inclusion of linear acceleration in concussion safety regulations and the need for advanced technologies to reduce impact forces and injury risk.</description>

      <title>Capturing Unseen Spatial Extremes Through Knowledge-Informed Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observed records of climate extremes provide an incomplete picture of risk, missing "unseen" extremes that exceed historical bounds. In parallel, neglecting spatial dependence undervalues the risk of synchronized hazards that amplify impacts. To address these challenges, we develop DeepX-GAN (Dependence-Enhanced Embedding for Physical eXtremes - Generative Adversarial Network), a knowledge-informed deep generative model designed to better capture the spatial structure of rare extremes. The zero-shot generalizability of DeepX-GAN enables simulation of unseen extremes that fall outside historical experience yet remain statistically plausible. We define two types of unseen extremes: "checkmate" extremes that directly hit targets, and "stalemate" extremes that narrowly miss. These unrealized scenarios expose latent risks in fragile systems and may reinforce a false sense of resilience if overlooked. Near misses, in particular, can prompt either proactive adaptation or dangerous complacency, depending on how they are interpreted. Applying DeepX-GAN to the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), we find that these unseen extremes disproportionately affect regions with high vulnerability and low socioeconomic readiness, but differ in urgency and interpretation. Future warming could expand and redistribute these unseen extremes, with emerging exposure hotspots in Indo-Pakistan and Central Africa. This distributional shift highlights critical blind spots in conventional hazard planning and underscores the need to develop spatially adaptive policies that anticipate emergent risk hotspots rather than simply extrapolating from historical patterns.</description>

      <title>Universal Scaling Laws in Freeway Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic congestion, a daily frustration for millions and a multi-billion dollar drain on economies, has long resisted deep physical understanding. While simple theoretical models of traffic flow have suggested connections to critical phenomena and non-equilibrium universality, direct empirical validation is lacking. Using extensive, high-resolution vehicle trajectory data from the I-24 MOTION testbed, we show that traffic flow exhibits both a percolation phase transition that is self-organized critical and fluctuations consistent with the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality in 1+1 dimensions. This suggests that the complex and seemingly chaotic formation of traffic jams has predictable statistical properties, which opens new avenues in traffic science for developing advanced forecasting and management strategies grounded in universal scaling laws.</description>

      <title>A Practical Guide to Unbinned Unfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unfolding, in the context of high-energy particle physics, refers to the process of removing detector distortions in experimental data. The resulting unfolded measurements are straightforward to use for direct comparisons between experiments and a wide variety of theoretical predictions. For decades, popular unfolding strategies were designed to operate on data formatted as one or more binned histograms. In recent years, new strategies have emerged that use machine learning to unfold datasets in an unbinned manner, allowing for higher-dimensional analyses and more flexibility for current and future users of the unfolded data. This guide comprises recommendations and practical considerations from researchers across a number of major particle physics experiments who have recently put these techniques into practice on real data.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Evolution of Two-dimensional Carbon Nitride Research: Integrating Machine Learning into Conventional Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon nitride research has reached a promising point in today's research endeavours with diverse applications including photocatalysis, energy storage, and sensing due to their unique electronic and structural properties. Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have opened new avenues for exploring and optimizing the potential of these materials. This study presents a comprehensive review of the integration of ML techniques in carbon nitride research with an introduction to CN classifications and recent advancements. We discuss the methodologies employed, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning, in predicting material properties, optimizing synthesis conditions, and enhancing performance metrics. Key findings indicate that ML algorithms can significantly reduce experimental trial-and-error, accelerate discovery processes, and provide deeper insights into the structure-property relationships of carbon nitride. The synergistic effect of combining ML with traditional experimental approaches is highlighted, showcasing studies where ML driven models have successfully predicted novel carbon nitride compositions with enhanced functional properties. Future directions in this field are also proposed, emphasizing the need for high-quality datasets, advanced ML models, and interdisciplinary collaborations to fully realize the potential of carbon nitride materials in next-generation technologies.</description>

      <title>Discovering Governing Equations in the Presence of Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the study of complex dynamical systems, understanding and accurately modeling the underlying physical processes is crucial for predicting system behavior and designing effective interventions. Yet real-world systems exhibit pronounced input (or system) variability and are observed through noisy, limited data conditions that confound traditional discovery methods that assume fixed-coefficient deterministic models. In this work, we theorize that accounting for system variability together with measurement noise is the key to consistently discover the governing equations underlying dynamical systems. As such, we introduce a stochastic inverse physics-discovery (SIP) framework that treats the unknown coefficients as random variables and infers their posterior distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the push-forward of the posterior samples and the empirical data distribution. Benchmarks on four canonical problems -- the Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system (multi- and single-trajectory), the historical Hudson Bay lynx-hare data, the chaotic Lorenz attractor, and fluid infiltration in porous media using low- and high-viscosity liquids -- show that SIP consistently identifies the correct equations and lowers coefficient root-mean-square error by an average of 82\% relative to the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) approach and its Bayesian variant. The resulting posterior distributions yield 95\% credible intervals that closely track the observed trajectories, providing interpretable models with quantified uncertainty. SIP thus provides a robust, data-efficient approach for consistent physics discovery in noisy, variable, and data-limited settings.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian Expansion of Minkowski Tensors in Redshift Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on extending the use of Minkowski Tensors to analyze anisotropic signals in cosmological data, focusing on those introduced by redshift space distortion. We derive the ensemble average of the two translation-invariant, rank-2 Minkowski Tensors for a matter density field that is perturbatively non-Gaussian in redshift space. This is achieved through the Edgeworth expansion of the joint probability density function of the field and its derivatives, expressing the ensemble averages in terms of cumulants up to cubic order. Our goal is to connect these theoretical predictions to the underlying cosmological parameters, allowing for parameter estimation by measuring them from galaxy surveys. The work builds on previous analyses of Minkowski Functionals in both real and redshift space and addresses the effects of Finger-of-God velocity dispersion and shot noise. We validate our predictions by matching them to measurements of the Minkowski Tensors from dark matter simulation data, finding that perturbation theory is a qualified success. Non-perturbative Finger-of-God effects remain significant at relatively large scales (R&lt; 20 Mpc/h) and are particularly pronounced in the components parallel to the line of sight.</description>

      <title>History Matching under Uncertainty of Geological Scenarios with Implicit Geological Realism Control with Generative Deep Learning and Graph Convolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The graph-based variational autoencoder represents an architecture that can handle the uncertainty of different geological scenarios, such as depositional or structural, through the concept of a lowerdimensional latent space. The main difference from recent studies is utilisation of a graph-based approach in reservoir modelling instead of the more traditional lattice-based deep learning methods. We provide a solution to implicitly control the geological realism through the latent variables of a generative model and Geodesic metrics. Our experiments of AHM with synthetic dataset that consists of 3D realisations of channelised geological representations with two distinct scenarios with one and two channels shows the viability of the approach. We offer in-depth analysis of the latent space using tools such as PCA, t-SNE, and TDA to illustrate its structure.</description>

      <title>Statistics of stochastic entropy for recorded transitions between ENSO states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the transitions between established phases of the El Ni\~no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) by surveying the daily data of the Southern Oscillation Index from an entropic viewpoint using the framework of stochastic Statistical Physics. We evaluate the variation of entropy produced due to each recorded path of that index during each transition as well as taking only into consideration the beginning and the end of the change between phases and verified both integral fluctuation relations. The statistical results show that these entropy variations have not been extreme entropic events; only the transition between the strong $1999-2000$ La Ni\~na to the moderate $2002-2003$ El Ni\~no is at the edge of being so. With that, the present work opens a long and winding avenue of research over the application of stochastic Statistical Physics to Climate Dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological simulations are a powerful tool to advance our understanding of galaxy formation and many simulations model key properties of real galaxies. A question that naturally arises for such simulations in light of high-quality observational data is: How close are the models to reality? Due to the high-dimensionality of the problem, many previous studies evaluate galaxy simulations using simplified summary statistics of physical properties. In this work, we combine simulation-based Bayesian model comparison with a novel misspecification detection technique to compare simulated galaxy images of 6 hydrodynamical models observations. Since cosmological simulations are computationally costly, we address the problem of low simulation budgets by first training a $k$-sparse variational autoencoder (VAE) on the abundant dataset of SDSS images. The VAE learns to extract informative latent embeddings and delineates the typical set of real images. To reveal simulation gaps, we then perform out-of-distribution detection (OOD) based on the logits of classifiers trained on the embeddings of simulated images. Finally, we perform amortized Bayesian model comparison using probabilistic classification, identifying the relatively best-performing model along with partial explanations through SHAP values.</description>

      <title>Maximum entropy for dynamic processes on networks</title>

Abstract: Dynamic processes on networks are fundamental to understanding modern-day phenomena such as information diffusion and opinion polarization on the internet or epidemics spreading through society. However, such processes are notoriously difficult to study broadly as small changes in initial conditions, the process, or the network can lead to very different evolution trajectories. Here we apply the information-theoretic framework of maximum caliber to study the statistics of such systems analytically, focusing on processes that can be interpreted as driven by interactions between populations of different types of individuals in the network. We verify the dynamics deduced from maximum caliber by using simulations of different processes on different networks, introduce an approximation of the dynamics that significantly simplifies the problem, and show that the approximation can be used to recover well-established models of population dynamics that are typically not thought of as taking place on networks.</description>

      <title>How Easy Is It to Learn Motion Models from Widefield Fluorescence Single Particle Tracks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motion models are often deduced from fluorescence widefield tracking experiments by analyzing single-particle trajectories post-processed from the data. This analysis immediately raises the following question: To what degree is our ability to learn motion models impacted by analyzing post-processed trajectories versus the raw measurements? To answer this question, we mathematically formulate a data likelihood for diffraction-limited fluorescence widefield tracking experiments. In particular, we explicitly make the likelihood's dependence on the motion model versus the emission model (or measurement model). The emission model describes how photons emitted by fluorescently labeled particles are distributed in space according to the optical point spread function, with intensities subsequently integrated over a pixel, and convoluted with camera noise. Logic dictates that if the data likelihood is primarily informed by the motion model, then it should be straightforward to learn the motion model from the trajectory post-processed from the data. On the other hand, if the majority of the likelihood is numerically dominated by the emission model, then the post-processed trajectory inferred from data is primarily informed by the emission model, and very little information on the motion model permeates into the post-processed trajectories analyzed downstream to learn motion models. We find that for typical diffraction-limited fluorescence experiments, the emission model often robustly contributes approximately 99% to the likelihood, leaving motion models to explain approximately 1% of the data. This result immediately casts doubt on our ability to reliably learn motion models from post-processed data, raising further questions on the significance of motion models learned thus far from post-processed single-particle trajectories from single-molecule widefield fluorescence tracking experiments.</description>
