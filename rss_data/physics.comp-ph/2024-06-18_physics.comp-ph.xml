      <title>Analytical approximations closed as desired to special functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for constructing global analytical expressions that approximate a function over its entire range. These approximations not only mirror the original function as accurately as desired, but are purposefully created to possess features that the original function lacks. This is particularly useful for functions that lack closed form and are defined by integrals or infinite series. Replacing these definitions with simple analytical expressions enables in-depth qualitative analysis and replaces the current methods of evaluation. We demonstrate this procedure by providing replacements for a variety of pivotal functions in physics and cosmology including the pressure and density of quantum gas, the one-loop correction in thermal field theory, common polylog functions, and the error function.</description>

      <title>Structured Detection for Simultaneous Super-Resolution and Optical Sectioning in Laser Scanning Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast and sensitive detector arrays enable image scanning microscopy (ISM), overcoming the trade-off between spatial resolution and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) typical of confocal microscopy. However, current ISM approaches cannot provide optical sectioning and fail with thick samples, unless the size of the detector is limited. Thus, another trade-off between optical sectioning and SNR persists. Here, we propose a method without drawbacks that combines uncompromised super-resolution, high SNR, and optical sectioning. Furthermore, our approach enables super-sampling of images, relaxing Nyquist's criterion by a factor of two. Based on the observation that imaging with a detector array inherently embeds axial information about the sample, we designed a straightforward reconstruction algorithm that inverts the physical model of ISM. We present the comprehensive theoretical framework and validate our method with synthetic and experimental images of biological samples captured using a custom setup equipped with a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array detector. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach exciting fluorescence emission both in the linear and non-linear regime. Moreover, we generalize the algorithm for fluorescence lifetime imaging, fully exploiting the single-photon timing ability of the SPAD array detector. Our method outperforms conventional approaches to ISM and can be extended to any LSM technique.</description>

      <title>Imaging 3D Chemistry at 1 nm Resolution with Fused Multi-Modal Electron Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of chemistry in nanoscale matter is a longstanding challenge for metrological science. The inelastic scattering events required for 3D chemical imaging are too rare, requiring high beam exposure that destroys the specimen before an experiment completes. Even larger doses are required to achieve high resolution. Thus, chemical mapping in 3D has been unachievable except at lower resolution with the most radiation-hard materials. Here, high-resolution 3D chemical imaging is achieved near or below one nanometer resolution in a Au-Fe$_3$O$_4$ metamaterial, Co$_3$O$_4$ - Mn$_3$O$_4$ core-shell nanocrystals, and ZnS-Cu$_{0.64}$S$_{0.36}$ nanomaterial using fused multi-modal electron tomography. Multi-modal data fusion enables high-resolution chemical tomography often with 99\% less dose by linking information encoded within both elastic (HAADF) and inelastic (EDX / EELS) signals. Now sub-nanometer 3D resolution of chemistry is measurable for a broad class of geometrically and compositionally complex materials.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation analysis of a two-dimensional magnetic Rayleigh-B\'enard problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a bifurcation analysis of a two-dimensional magnetic Rayleigh--B\'enard problem using a numerical technique called deflated continuation. Our aim is to study the influence of the magnetic field on the bifurcation diagram as the Chandrasekhar number $Q$ increases and compare it to the standard (non-magnetic) Rayleigh--B\'enard problem. We compute steady states at a high Chandrasekhar number of $Q=10^3$ over a range of the Rayleigh number $0\leq \Ra\leq 10^5$. These solutions are obtained by combining deflation with a continuation of steady states at low Chandrasekhar number, which allows us to explore the influence of the strength of the magnetic field as $Q$ increases from low coupling, where the magnetic effect is almost negligible, to strong coupling at $Q=10^3$. We discover a large profusion of states with rich dynamics and observe a complex bifurcation structure with several pitchfork, Hopf, and saddle-node bifurcations. Our numerical simulations show that the onset of bifurcations in the problem is delayed when $Q$ increases, while solutions with fluid velocity patterns aligning with the background vertical magnetic field are privileged. Additionally, we report a branch of states that stabilizes at high magnetic coupling, suggesting that one may take advantage of the magnetic field to discriminate solutions.</description>

      <title>A unified moment tensor potential for silicon, oxygen, and silica</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Si and its oxides have been extensively explored in theoretical research due to their technological and industrial importance. Simultaneously describing interatomic interactions within both Si and SiO$_2$ without the use of \textit{ab initio} methods is considered challenging, given the charge transfers involved. Herein, this challenge is overcome by developing a unified machine learning interatomic potentials describing the Si/ SiO$_2$/ O system, based on the moment tensor potential (MTP) framework. This MTP is trained using a comprehensive database generated using density functional theory simulations, encompassing a wide range of crystal structures, point defects, extended defects, and disordered structure. Extensive testing of the MTP is performed, indicating it can describe static and dynamic features of very diverse Si, O, and SiO$_2$ atomic structures with a degree of fidelity approaching that of DFT</description>

      <title>Class Symbolic Regression: Gotta Fit 'Em All</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce 'Class Symbolic Regression' (Class SR) a first framework for automatically finding a single analytical functional form that accurately fits multiple datasets - each realization being governed by its own (possibly) unique set of fitting parameters. This hierarchical framework leverages the common constraint that all the members of a single class of physical phenomena follow a common governing law. Our approach extends the capabilities of our earlier Physical Symbolic Optimization ($\Phi$-SO) framework for Symbolic Regression, which integrates dimensional analysis constraints and deep reinforcement learning for unsupervised symbolic analytical function discovery from data. Additionally, we introduce the first Class SR benchmark, comprising a series of synthetic physical challenges specifically designed to evaluate such algorithms. We demonstrate the efficacy of our novel approach by applying it to these benchmark challenges and showcase its practical utility for astrophysics by successfully extracting an analytic galaxy potential from a set of simulated orbits approximating stellar streams.</description>

      <title>Symbolic, numeric and quantum computation of Hartree-Fock equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we discuss how a kind of hybrid computation, which employs symbolic, numeric, classic, and quantum algorithms, allows us to conduct Hartree-Fock electronic structure computation of molecules. In the proposed algorithm, we replace the Hartree-Fock equations with a set of equations composed of multivariate polynomials. We transform those polynomials to the corresponding Gr\"obner bases, and then we investigate the corresponding quotient ring, wherein the orbital energies, the LCAO coefficients, or the atomic coordinates are represented by the variables in the ring. In this quotient ring, the variables generate the transformation matrices that represent the multiplication with the monomial bases, and the eigenvalues of those matrices compose the roots of the equation. The quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm enables us to record those roots in the quantum states, which would be used in the input data for more advanced and more accurate quantum computations.</description>

      <title>Exploring Li-ion Transport Properties of Li$_3$TiCl$_6$: A Machine Learning Molecular Dynamics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We performed large-scale molecular dynamics simulations based on a machine-learning force field (MLFF) to investigate the Li-ion transport mechanism in cation-disordered Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode at six different temperatures, ranging from 25$^\mathrm{o}$C to 100$^\mathrm{o}$C. In this work, deep neural network method and data generated by $ab-initio$ molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were deployed to build a high-fidelity MLFF. Radial distribution functions, Li-ion mean square displacements (MSD), diffusion coefficients, ionic conductivity, activation energy, and crystallographic direction-dependent migration barriers were calculated and compared with corresponding AIMD and experimental data to benchmark the accuracy of the MLFF. From MSD analysis, we captured both the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics. The latter reveals that the Li-ions are involved in anti-correlation motion that was rarely reported for solid-state materials. Similarly, the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics were used to determine Haven's ratio to describe the Li-ion transport mechanism in Li$_3$TiCl$_6$. Obtained trajectory from molecular dynamics infers that the Li-ion transportation is mainly through interstitial hopping which was confirmed by intra- and inter-layer Li-ion displacement with respect to simulation time. Ionic conductivity (1.06 mS/cm) and activation energy (0.29eV) calculated by our simulation are highly comparable with that of experimental values. Overall, the combination of machine-learning methods and AIMD simulations explains the intricate electrochemical properties of the Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode with remarkably reduced computational time. Thus, our work strongly suggests that the deep neural network-based MLFF could be a promising method for large-scale complex materials.</description>

      <title>Bridging electronic and classical density-functional theory using universal machine-learned functional approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of density-functional theory (DFT) is determined by the quality of the approximate functionals, such as exchange-correlation in electronic DFT and the excess functional in the classical DFT formalism of fluids. The exact functional is highly nonlocal for both electrons and fluids, yet most approximate functionals are semi-local or nonlocal in a limited weighted-density form. Machine-learned (ML) nonlocal density-functional approximations are promising in both electronic and classical DFT, but have so far employed disparate approaches with limited generality. Here, we formulate a universal approximation framework and training protocol for nonlocal ML functionals, combining features of equivariant convolutional neural networks and the weighted-density approximation. We prototype this approach for several 1D and quasi-1D problems and demonstrate that a functional with exactly the same hyperparameters achieves excellent accuracy for the hard-rod fluid, the inhomogeneous Ising model, the exact exchange functional for electrons, the electron kinetic energy functional for orbital-free DFT, as well as for liquid water with 1D inhomogeneities. These results lay the foundation for a universal ML approach to exact 3D functionals spanning electronic and classical DFT.</description>

      <title>Plasma stratification in AC discharges in noble gases at low currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hybrid kinetic-fluid model is used to study plasma stratification in alternating current (AC) discharges in noble gases at low plasma densities. Self-consistent coupled solutions of a non-local kinetic equation for electrons, a drift-diffusion equation of ions, and a Poisson equation for the electric field are obtained for a positive column with periodic boundary conditions and for the entire discharge to study near-electrode effects within a 1d model with radial ambipolar loss. A simplified two-level excitation-ionization model neglects the nonlinear effects due to stepwise ionization, gas heating, and Coulomb interactions among electrons. Standing striations are obtained for the reduced values of electric fields corresponding to the inelastic energy balance of electrons in a range of driving frequencies. An analog of Novak law (striation length proportional to the excitation threshold of atoms and inversely proportional to the mean square root of the electric field) is observed in simulations, indicating the nonlocal nature of standing striations in AC discharges at low plasma densities. Stratified plasma operates in a dynamic regime for a wide range of driving frequencies because heat conduction occurs much faster than the ambipolar diffusion controlled by slow ion motion. We demonstrate that standing striations in symmetric AC discharges previously observed in experiments are similar to moving striations in DC discharges and are both due to nonlocal kinetic effects at low discharge currents.</description>
