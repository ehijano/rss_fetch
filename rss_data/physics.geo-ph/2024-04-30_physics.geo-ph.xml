      <title>Melting Temperature of Iron Under the Earth's Inner Core Condition from Deep Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraining the melting temperature of iron under Earth's inner core conditions is crucial for understanding core dynamics and planetary evolution. Here, we develop a deep potential (DP) model for iron that explicitly incorporates electronic entropy contributions governing thermodynamics under Earth's core conditions. Extensive benchmarking demonstrates the DP's high fidelity across relevant iron phases and extreme pressure and temperature conditions. Through thermodynamic integration and direct solid-liquid coexistence simulations, the DP predicts melting temperatures for iron at the inner core boundary, consistent with previous \textit{ab initio} results. This resolves the previous discrepancy of iron's melting temperature at ICB between the DP model and \textit{ab initio} calculation and suggests the crucial contribution of electronic entropy. Our work provides insights into machine learning melting behavior of iron under core conditions and provides the basis for future development of binary or ternary DP models for iron and other elements in the core.</description>

      <title>Discovery of physically interpretable wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using symbolic regression to discover physical laws from observed data is an emerging field. In previous work, we combined genetic algorithm (GA) and machine learning to present a data-driven method for discovering a wave equation. Although it managed to utilize the data to discover the two-dimensional (x,z) acoustic constant-density wave equation u_tt=v^2(u_xx+u_zz) (subscripts of the wavefield, u, are second derivatives in time and space) in a homogeneous medium, it did not provide the complete equation form, where the velocity term is represented by a coefficient rather than directly given by v^2. In this work, we redesign the framework, encoding both velocity information and candidate functional terms simultaneously. Thus, we use GA to simultaneously evolve the candidate functional and coefficient terms in the library. Also, we consider here the physics rationality and interpretability in the randomly generated potential wave equations, by ensuring that both-hand sides of the equation maintain balance in their physical units. We demonstrate this redesigned framework using the acoustic wave equation as an example, showing its ability to produce physically reasonable expressions of wave equations from noisy and sparsely observed data in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous media. Also, we demonstrate that our method can effectively discover wave equations from a more realistic observation scenario.</description>

      <title>Around-the-world seismic echo as a trigger for aftershocks and the main shock of an earthquake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The essence of the cumulative effect of a round-the-world seismic echo is that the echo can serve as a trigger for a second tremors in the epicentral zone of the earthquake that gave rise to the echo. According to the classification of triggers, the round-the-world echo is an endogenous force mechanical additive trigger. The round-the-world echo excited by the main shock as a trigger for aftershocks has been studied in detail previously. In this work, the question of whether a foreshock can excite a round-the-world echo, which will turn out to be a trigger for the main shock, is posed and experimentally studied. In the course of the study, the classification of the so-called triads of earthquakes was considered. When studying one of the six types of triads, indirect signs were found that the answer to the question posed may be positive Key words: earthquake source, main rupture, foreshock, triad of earthquakes, cumulative effect, free vibrations of the Earth.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of nonlinear perturbations in the dynamics of planar crack fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of crack fronts with asperities is central to the criteria of fracture in heterogeneous materials and for the prediction of fracture surface formation. It is known how dynamic crack fronts respond to small, 1st-order, perturbations. Large and localized disturbances to crack motion, however, induce dynamic and geometric nonlinear effects that are beyond the existing linear theories. Because the determination of the 3D elastic fields surrounding perturbed crack fronts is a necessary step towards any theoretical study of crack front dynamics, we develop a 2nd-order perturbation theory for the asymptotic fields of planar crack fronts. Based on previous work, we consider two models of fracture. In the so-called scalar elastic model, which is analogous to anti-plane (Mode III) fracture, the stress and displacement fields are obtained through matched asymptotic expansions. A self-consistent expansion is used to resolve the fields near tensile (Mode I) crack fronts. Both methods can be extended to higher perturbation orders. The main results of this work are the explicit 2nd-order expressions of the local dynamic energy-release-rates for perturbations of straight fronts. These general formulae recover the known energy-release-rates of curved quasi-static fronts and of straight dynamic fronts.</description>

      <title>Spectral measures and iterative bounds for effective diffusivity of steady and space-time periodic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over three decades ago the advection-diffusion equation for a steady fluid velocity field was homogenized, leading to a Stieltjes integral representation for the effective diffusivity, which is given in terms of a spectral measure of a compact self-adjoint operator and the P\'eclet number of the fluid flow. This result was recently extended to space-time periodic flows, instead involving an unbounded self-adjoint operator. Pad\'e approximants provide rigorous upper and lower bounds for Stieltjes functions in terms of the moments of the spectral measure. However, with the lack of a method for calculating the moments of the spectral measure for general fluid velocity fields, the utility of this powerful mathematical framework for calculating bounds for the effective diffusivity has not been fully realized. Here we significantly expand the applicability of this framework by providing an iterative method that enables an arbitrary number of moments, hence bounds, to be calculated analytically in closed form for both spatially and space-time periodic flows. The method is demonstrated for periodic flows in two spatial dimensions. The known asymptotic behavior of the effective diffusivity for a steady flow is accurately captured by high order upper and lower bounds, demonstrating the ability of the method to provide accurate estimates for the effective diffusivity for a broad range of parameter values.</description>
