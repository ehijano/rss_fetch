      <title>Event-Driven Market Co-Movement Dynamics in Critical Mineral Equities: An Empirical Framework Using Change Point Detection and Cross-Sectional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines market behavior in critical mineral investments using a novel analytical framework that combines change-point detection (PELT algorithm) with cross-sectional analysis. This research analyzes ESG-ranked critical mineral ETFs from March 31, 2014, to April 19, 2024, using the S&amp;P 500 as a benchmark to evaluate market co-movements. The findings demonstrate that different critical mineral investments experienced change points at distinct times, but three major dates, July 23, 2015; March 17, 2020; and December 1, 2020, were common and aligned with global events such as the oil market shock, the COVID-19 pandemic, and later market adjustments. Herding behavior among investors increased after these shocks, following the 2015 and 2020 crises, but shifted to anti-herding after positive vaccine news in late 2020 and after the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The sensitivity analysis shows that investor coordination is strongest during market downturns but exhibits greater variation during stable periods or after major developments, with these dynamics sensitive to the length of the observation period. Additionally, anti-herding became more apparent during crises, suggesting investors reacted to specific risks rather than moving in lockstep, especially in response to geopolitical shocks.</description>

      <title>Beyond Validity: SVAR Identification Through the Proxy Zoo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a framework for robust identification in SVARs when researchers face a zoo of proxy variables. Instead of imposing exact exogeneity, we introduce generalized ranking restrictions (GRR) that bound the relative correlation of each proxy with the target and non-target shocks through a continuous proxy-quality parameter. Combining GRR with standard sign and narrative restrictions, we characterize identified sets for structural impulse responses and show how to partially identify the proxy-quality parameter using the joint information contained in the proxy zoo. We further develop sensitivity and diagnostic tools that allow researchers to assess transparently how empirical conclusions depend on proxy exogeneity assumptions and the composition of the proxy zoo. A simulation study shows that proxies constructed from sign restrictions can induce biased proxy-SVAR estimates, while our approach delivers informative and robust identified sets. An application to U.S.\ monetary policy illustrates the empirical relevance and computational tractability of the framework.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-Based Ergodicity Transformations in Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series often exhibit non-ergodic behaviour that complicates forecasting and inference. This article proposes a likelihood-based approach for estimating ergodicity transformations that addresses such challenges. The method is broadly compatible with standard models, including Gaussian processes, ARMA, and GARCH. A detailed simulation study using geometric and arithmetic Brownian motion demonstrates the ability of the approach to recover known ergodicity transformations. A further case study on the large macroeconomic database FRED-QD shows that incorporating ergodicity transformations can provide meaningful improvements over conventional transformations or naive specifications in applied work.</description>

      <title>KRED: Korea Research Economic Database for Macroeconomic Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce KRED (Korea Research Economic Database), a new FRED MD style macroeconomic dataset for South Korea. KRED is constructed by aggregating 88 key monthly time series from multiple official sources (e.g., Bank of Korea ECOS, Statistics Korea KOSIS) into a unified, publicly available database. The dataset is aligned with the FRED MD format, enabling standardized transformations and direct comparability; an Appendix maps each Korean series to its FRED MD counterpart. Using a balanced panel of 80 series from 2009 to 2024, we extract four principal components via PCA that explain approximately 40% of the total variance. These four factors have intuitive economic interpretations, capturing monetary conditions, labor market activity, real output, and housing demand, analogous to diffusion indexes summarizing broad economic movements. Notably, the factor based diffusion indexes derived from KRED clearly trace major macroeconomic fluctuations over the sample period such as the 2020 COVID 19 recession. Our results demonstrate that KRED's factor structure can effectively condense complex economic information into a few informative indexes, yielding new insights into South Korea's business cycles and co movements.</description>

      <title>Uncovering Sparse Financial Networks with Information Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical measures of financial connectedness based on Forecast Error Variance Decompositions (FEVDs) often yield dense network structures that obscure true transmission channels and complicate the identification of systemic risk. This paper proposes a novel information-criterion-based approach to uncover sparse, economically meaningful financial networks. By reformulating FEVD-based connectedness as a regression problem, we develop a model selection framework that consistently recovers the active set of spillover channels. We extend this method to generalized FEVDs to accommodate correlated shocks and introduce a data-driven procedure for tuning the penalty parameter using pseudo-out-of-sample forecast performance. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate the approach's effectiveness with finite samples and its robustness to approximately sparse networks and heavy-tailed errors. Applications to global stock markets, S&amp;P 500 sectoral indices, and commodity futures highlight the prevalence of sparse networks in empirical settings.</description>

      <title>Extremal Quantiles under Two-Way Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19268v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies extremal quantiles under two-way clustered dependence. We show that the limiting distribution of unconditional intermediate-order tail quantiles is Gaussian. This result is notable because two-way clustering typically leads to non-Gaussian limiting behavior. Remarkably, extremal quantiles remain asymptotically Gaussian even in degenerate cases. Building on this insight, we extend our analysis to extremal quantile regression at intermediate orders. Simulation results corroborate our theoretical findings. Finally, we provide an empirical application to growth-at-risk, showing that earlier empirical conclusions remain robust even after accounting for two-way clustered dependence in panel data and the focus on extreme quantiles.</description>

      <title>High-Dimensional Tail Index Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the empirical observation of power-law distributions in the credits (e.g., ``likes'') of viral posts in social media, we introduce a high-dimensional tail index regression model and propose methods for estimation and inference of its parameters. First, we propose a regularized estimator, establish its consistency, and derive its convergence rate. Second, we debias the regularized estimator to facilitate inference and prove its asymptotic normality. Simulation studies corroborate our theoretical findings. We apply these methods to the text analysis of viral posts on X (formerly Twitter).</description>
