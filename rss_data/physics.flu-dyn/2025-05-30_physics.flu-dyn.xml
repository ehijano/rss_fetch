      <title>Nonlinear Diffusion and Decay of an Expanding Turbulent Blob</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence, left unforced, decays and invades the surrounding quiescent fluid. Though ubiquitous, this simple phenomenon has proven hard to capture within a simple and general framework. Experiments in conventional turbulent flow chambers are inevitably complicated by proximity to boundaries and mean flow, obscuring the fundamental aspects of the relaxation to the quiescent fluid state. Here, we circumvent these issues by creating a spatially-localized blob of turbulent fluid using eight converging vortex generators focused towards the center of a tank of water, and observe its decay and spread over decades in time, using particle image velocimetry with a logarithmic sampling rate. The blob initially expands and decays until it reaches the walls of the tank and eventually transitions to a second regime of approximately spatially uniform decay. We interpret these dynamics within the framework of a nonlinear diffusion equation, which predicts that the ideal quiescent-turbulent fluid boundary is sharp and propagates non-diffusively, driven by turbulent eddies while decaying with characteristic scaling laws. We find direct evidence for this model within the expansion phase of our turbulent blob and use it to account for the detailed behavior we observe, in contrast to earlier studies. Our work provides a detailed spatially-resolved narrative for the behavior of turbulence once the forcing is removed, and demonstrates unexpectedly that the turbulent cascade leaves an indelible footprint far into the decay process.</description>

      <title>Effects of thrust, tip-speed ratio, and time variations on wind-turbine wakes at high Reynolds numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of rotor wakes is an important problem for a wide range of wind-energy and aerodynamic applications, and is of particular relevance to dynamic wake control strategies for wind farms. This study aims to clarify the influence of turbine thrust and tip-speed ratio on tip-vortex breakdown and the evolution of the near wake. Scaling arguments show that these parameters contribute to the wake dynamics in distinct ways, and that neither thrust nor tip-speed ratio are alone sufficient to describe near and intermediate wake development. These considerations are especially critical for time-varying flows. To demonstrate these principles, a wind turbine at a near utility-scale Reynolds number ($Re_D=4\times10^6$) is forced in periodic rotation-rate oscillations at low Strouhal numbers ($St=0.04$). The slow time-varying forcing protocol decouples thrust and tip-speed ratio effects without introducing nonlinear dynamics into the wake that would appear at higher forcing frequencies. Flow measurements in the wake of the turbine show disturbances propagate through the wake as traveling waves, with thrust and tip-speed ratio variations displaying synergistic or competing effects on wake dynamics depending on the relative phase and amplitude of such disturbances. The results provide key insights into the dynamics of time-varying wakes, limitations in existing models of rotor wake dynamics, and to future novel wake-control schemes.</description>

      <title>Theory and simulation of elastoinertial rectification of oscillatory flows in two-dimensional deformable rectangular channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A slender two-dimensional (2D) channel bounded by a rigid bottom surface and a slender elastic layer above deforms when a fluid flows through it. Hydrodynamic forces cause deformation at the fluid-solid interface, which in turn changes the cross-sectional area of the fluidic channel. The nonlinear coupling between flow and deformation, along with the attendant asymmetry in geometry caused by flow-induced deformation, produces a streaming effect (a non-zero cycle-average despite time-periodic forcing). Surprisingly, fluid inertia provides another nonlinear coupling, tightly connected to deformation, that enhances streaming, termed ``elastoinertial rectification'' by Zhang and Rallabandi [J. Fluid Mech. 996, A16 (2024)]. We adapt the latter theory of how two-way coupled fluid--structure interaction (FSI) produces streaming to a 2D rectangular configuration, specifically taking care to capture the deformations of the nearly incompressible slender elastic layer via the combined foundation model of Chandler and Vella [Proc. R. Soc. A 476, 20200551 (2020)]. We supplement the elastoinertial rectification theory with direct numerical simulations performed using a conforming arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) FSI formulation with streamline upwind Petrov-Galerkin stabilization, implemented via the open-source computing platform FEniCS. We examine the axial variation of the cycle-averaged pressure as a function of key dimensionless groups of the problem: the Womersley number, the elastoviscous number, and the compliance number. Assuming a small compliance number, we find excellent agreement between theory and simulations for the leading-order pressure and deformation across a range of conditions. At the next order, the cycle-averaged pressures agree well; however, the cycle-averaged deformation is found to exhibit significant axial and vertical displacements, unlike the combined foundation model.</description>

      <title>A unified quaternion-complex framework for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations: new insights and implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel, unified quaternion-complex framework for formulating the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations that reveals the geometric structure underlying viscous fluid motion and resolves the Clay Institute's Millennium Prize problem. By introducing complex coordinates $z = x + iy$ and expressing the velocity field as $F = u + iv$, we demonstrate that the nonlinear convection terms decompose as $(u \cdot \nabla)F = F \cdot \frac{\partial F}{\partial z} + F^* \cdot \frac{\partial F}{\partial \bar{z}}$, separating inviscid convection from viscous coupling effects. We extend this framework to three dimensions using quaternions and prove global regularity through geometric constraints inherent in quaternion algebra. The incompressibility constraint naturally emerges as a requirement that $\frac{\partial F}{\partial z}$ be purely imaginary, linking fluid mechanics to complex analysis fundamentally. Our main result establishes that quaternion orthogonality relations prevent finite-time singularities by ensuring turbulent energy cascade remains naturally bounded. The quaternion-complex formulation demonstrates that turbulence represents breakdown of quaternion-analyticity while maintaining geometric stability, providing rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding why real fluids exhibit finite turbulent behavior rather than mathematical singularities. We prove that for any smooth initial data, there exists a unique global smooth solution to the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, directly resolving the Clay Institute challenge. Applications to atmospheric boundary layer physics demonstrate immediate practical relevance for environmental modeling, weather prediction, and climate modeling.</description>

      <title>Monolithic framework to simulate fluid-structure interaction problems using geometric volume-of-fluid method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a three-dimensional Eulerian framework to simulate fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems on a fixed Cartesian grid using the geometric volume-of-fluid (VOF) method. The coupled problem involves incompressible flow and viscous hyperelastic solids. A VOF-based one-continuum formulation is used to describe the unified momentum conservation equations with incompressibility constraints that are solved using the finite volume method (FVM). In the geometric VOF interface-capturing (IC) approach, the PLIC method is used to reconstruct the interface, and the Lagrangian Explicit (LE) method is used in the directionally split advection procedure. To model the hyperelastic behavior of the solid, we consider Mooney-Rivlin material models, where we use the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor (B) to account for the solid deformation on an Eulerian grid and the fifth-order WENO-Z reconstruction method is utilized to treat the advection terms involved in the transport equation of B. Multiple benchmark problems are considered to verify the accuracy of the approach. Furthermore, to demonstrate the capability of the solver to handle turbulent interactions, we perform direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent channel flow with a deformable compliant bottom wall and a rigid top wall; our observations align well with previous experimental and numerical works. The detailed numerical experiments show that: (i) Despite the discontinuity of the interface across the cell boundaries and stress discontinuity across the interface, a VOF/PLIC-based FSI framework can provide stable and accurate solutions that significantly minimizes numerical artifacts (e.g., flotsam and spurious currents) while maintaining a sharp interface. (ii) The accuracy of a VOF/PLIC-based FSI approach on coarse grids is comparable to the accuracy of a diffusive IC method-based FSI approach on much finer grids.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of lift-up and instability of the viscous flow induced by a rotating cone-cylinder in an enclosure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper probes into the flow induced by a rotating cone-cylinder model in an enclosure. Two component particle image velocimetry measurements in the symmetry plane reveal that the rotating cone-cylinder causes an outward jet on the cylinder section, which lifts the rotating boundary layers away from the wall. A large-scale counter-rotating vortex pair sets up with its mutual upwash aligned with the lift-up region. Furthermore, the centrifugal instability induces Taylor vortices in the rotating boundary layer, which are convected by the mean flow field and are lifted away from the surface, causing a high standard deviation. The lift-up phenomenon shows two preferred axial locations: below a critical Reynolds number $Re_{b,c}$, the lift-up occurs close to the cone-cylinder junction, and for Reynolds number higher than $Re_{b,c}$ lift-up is pushed away from the cone-cylinder junction, towards the model base. The value of the critical Reynolds number $Re_{b,c}$ lies within $2 \times 10^3-2.5 \times 10^3$ for the investigated cases.</description>

      <title>On the flow topology of swirl jets upon impingement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet impingement enhances heat transfer and is characterised by the complex flow patterns formed when a jet impacts a plate aligned normal to it. While traditional round jet impingement has been extensively studied to understand flow and associated heat transfer, there is still room for research in investigating flow structures in swirl jet impingement. This paper focuses on the flow topology of swirl jets generated by a 45-degree vane swirler, impinging on a flat plate studied at dimensionless jet-plate distances (H/D=1-4) and Reynolds numbers (Re = 16600 and 23000). The flow structures, mean velocity components, and turbulence characteristics are presented using a 2D Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiment at the front and top planes. Furthermore, results from the 3D numerical simulations are presented to support the results where the PIV study had experimental limitations. The effect of impingement distance or jet-plate distance on the mean flow properties and turbulence parameters is discussed. A Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) analysis has been performed to understand the dominant coherent structures in different cases of impingement distance. We show that the turbulence parameters are more pronounced at smaller jet-plate distances $(H/D \leq 2)$, which could explain the enhanced heat transfer for these jets.</description>

      <title>Orientation dynamics of a spheroid in the simple shear flow of a weakly elastic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the orientation dynamics of a neutrally buoyant spheroid, of an arbitrary aspect ratio ($\kappa$), freely rotating in a weakly viscoelastic fluid undergoing simple shear flow. Weak elasticity is characterized by a small but finite Deborah number ($De$), and the suspending fluid rheology is therefore modeled as a second-order fluid, with the constitutive equation involving a material parameter $\epsilon$ related to the ratio of the first and second normal stress differences; polymer solutions correspond to $\epsilon\in[-0.7,-0.5]$. Employing a reciprocal theorem formulation, along with expressions for the relevant disturbance fields in terms of vector spheroidal harmonics, we obtain the spheroid angular velocity to $O(De)$. In the Newtonian limit, a spheroid rotates along Jeffery orbits parametrized by an orbit constant $C$, although this closed-trajectory topology is structurally unstable, being susceptible to weak perturbations. For $De$ well below a threshold, $De_c(\kappa)$, weak viscoelasticity transforms the closed-trajectory topology into a tightly spiralling one. A multiple-scales analysis is used to interpret the resulting orientation dynamics in terms of an $O(De)$ orbital drift. The drift in orbit constant over a Jeffery period $\Delta C$, when plotted as a function of $C$, identifies four different orientation dynamics regimes on the $\kappa-\epsilon$ plane. For $\epsilon$ in the polymeric range, prolate spheroids always drift towards the spinning mode. Oblate spheroids drift towards the tumbling mode for $\kappa &gt; \kappa_c(\epsilon)$, but towards an intermediate kayaking mode for $\kappa &lt; \kappa_c(\epsilon)$. The rotation of spheroids of extreme aspect ratios, either slender prolate spheroids ($\kappa \gg 1$) or thin oblate ones ($\kappa \ll 1$), about the vorticity axis, is arrested for $De \geq De_c(\kappa)$</description>

      <title>Lift augmentation by incorporating bend twist coupled composites in flapping wing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing inspiration from the adaptive wing shape of birds in flight, this study introduces a bio-inspired concept for shape adaptation utilizing bend-twist coupling (BTC) in composite laminates. The primary aim of the design optimization is to identify the optimal fibre orientation angles needed to produce the required bending and twisting deformations, which directly contribute to the design's goal of maximizing lift without relying on external mechanisms for twisting. This novel technique increases lift by up to five times compared to a curved bending wing. We have highlighted the vortex dynamics to provide insight into the underlying reasons for such a significant lift increment. In addition, the study presents the Von Mises stress experienced by the wing, offering a comprehensive understanding of the structural behavior. Furthermore, it highlights a significant improvement in efficiency, particularly within the optimal reduced frequency range of 0.25 to 0.4. These findings underscore the potential of this method for future applications in biomimetic drones, micro-air vehicles, and other flapping wing-based systems, ultimately paving the way for new advancements in aerodynamics and structural optimization for next-generation aerial vehicle designs.</description>

      <title>Competing Mechanisms at Vibrated Interfaces of Density-Stratified Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid--fluid interfacial instability and subsequent fluid mixing are ubiquitous in nature and engineering. Two hydrodynamic instabilities have long been thought to govern the interface behavior: the pressure gradient-driven long-wavelength Rayleigh--Taylor (RT) instability and resonance-induced short-wavelength Faraday instability. However, neither instability alone can explain the dynamics when both mechanisms act concurrently. Instead, we identify a previously unseen multi-modal instability emerging from their coexistence. We show how vibrations govern transitions between the RT and Faraday instabilities, with the two competing instead of resonantly enhancing each other. The initial transient growth is captured by the exponential modal growth of the most unstable Floquet exponent, along with its accompanying periodic behavior. Direct numerical simulations validate these findings and track interface breakup into the multiscale and nonlinear regimes, in which the growing RT modes are shown to suppress Faraday responses via a nonlinear mechanism.</description>

      <title>Study of the Turbulent/Non-turbulent Interface of Zero-Pressure-Gradient Turbulent Boundary Layer Using the Uniform Momentum Zone Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the turbulent--non-turbulent interface (TNTI) in a zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer (ZPG-TBL) using a novel, threshold-free method based on the uniform momentum zone (UMZ) concept. Requiring only planar streamwise velocity data, the method is directly applicable to experimental PIV and ensures consistent TNTI detection across simulations and experiments. Its performance is demonstrated using DNS data at $Re_\tau = 1,000 - 2,000$. The TNTI height scales with the local boundary layer thickness ($\delta$), yielding an error-function-like intermittency profile and statistics consistent with prior studies. Sensitivity to streamwise domain length is minimal. Compared to TKE- and vorticity-based methods, the UMZ-TNTI partially overlaps with the TKE interface but differs significantly from the vorticity threshold, which lies farther from the wall. Conditional averages reveal sharp velocity gradients across the TNTI, consistent with mixing-layer-like dynamics. When normalized by TNTI height and velocity jump, mean velocity profiles collapse across Reynolds numbers. Reynolds stresses respond asymmetrically: $\tilde{\overline{u'u'}}$ varies most, $\tilde{\overline{v'v'}}$ moderately, and $\tilde{\overline{w'w'}}$ least. Mean and fluctuating vorticity profiles collapse well when scaled by the UMZ-TNTI vorticity scale. A localized peak in spanwise mean vorticity is observed within the TNTI, while $\tilde{\overline{\omega_x'\omega_x'}}$ decreases across it and the other components show local maxima.</description>

      <title>Aggregation of vortex structures in 2D: the blob-wave system and its role in zonal flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a rigorous mathematical result, supported by accurate numerical simulations, of the aggregation of a concentrated vortex blob with an underlying non constant vorticity field: the blob moves in the direction of the gradient of the field. It is a unique example of Lagrangian explanation of aggregation of vortex structures of the same sign in 2D inviscid fluids. A conceptual model of zonal flow maintenance and modulation based on this idea is then developed, which produces shapes in accordance with observations.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Tuning of Interface Physics in Multiphase Lattice Boltzmann</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tuning the interface properties of multiphase models is of paramount importance to the final goal of achieving a one-to-one matching with nucleation and cavitation experiments. The surface tension, at the leading order, and the Tolman length, at higher order, play a crucial role in the estimation of the free-energy barrier determining the experimentally observed nucleation rates. The lattice Boltzmann method allows for a computationally efficient modelling approach of multiphase flows, however, tuning results are concerned with the surface tension and neglect the Tolman length. We present a novel perspective that leverages all the degrees of freedom hidden in the forcing stencil of the Shan-Chen multiphase model. By means of the lattice pressure tensor we determine and tune the coefficients of higher-order derivative terms related to surface tension and Tolman length at constant interface width and density ratio. We test the method by means of both hydrostatic and dynamic simulations and demonstrate the dependence of homogeneous nucleation rates on the value of the Tolman length. This work provides a new tool that can be integrated with previously existing strategies thus marking a step forwards to a high-fidelity modelling of phase-changing fluid dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The current work analyses the onset characteristics of buoyancy and thermocapillary-driven instabilities in two-layer binary fluid systems near their upper critical solution temperature (UCST). The dynamics of the binary fluids are modelled here via a diffuse interface approach (phase-field method) involving a modified free energy formulation to capture the temperature-dependent solubility and interfacial width. Using spectral collocation-based discretization and a suitable grid mapping strategy, the present work accurately predicts the neutral curves for different fluid combinations that adhere to the concept of balanced contrasts. In the case of pure buoyancy-driven (Rayleigh-Benard) convection, the parametric range for oscillatory onset is found to shrink when the system approaches USCT, as the increased solubility results in less favourable conditions for oscillatory onset. The marginal stability curves of each fluid combination exhibit their own drift pattern based on the thermo-physical and transport properties. For systems with added thermocapillarity effects (Rayleigh-Benard-Marangoni convection), the changing solubilities and the interfacial thickness act along with the interfacial tension to exhibit a dual role that results in system-specific expansion/shrinkage of the parametric space for oscillatory flow onset.</description>

      <title>Evaporation of Finite-Size Ammonia and n-Heptane Droplets in Weakly Compressible Turbulence: An Interface-Resolved DNS Study</title>

Abstract: This study presents direct numerical simulation (DNS) of finite-size, interface-resolved ammonia and n-heptane droplets evaporating in decaying homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Simulations are conducted for each fuel to model the dynamics in a dense spray region, where the liquid volume fraction exceeds $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$. The focus is on investigating the complex interactions between droplets, turbulence, and phase change, with emphasis on droplet-droplet interactions and their influence on the evaporation process. The present study also explores how varying turbulence intensities affect the evaporation rates of each fuel, unveiling the differences in the coalescence and energy transfer from the liquid to the gaseous phase. The results reveal that, when comparing ammonia with n-heptane with equal liquid volume fractions, ammonia exhibits faster initial evaporation due to its higher volatility. However, this rate declines over time as frequent droplet coalescence reduces the total surface area available for evaporation. When numerical experiments are initialized with equal energy content, increasing turbulence intensity enhances the evaporation of n-heptane throughout the simulation, while ammonia evaporation soon becomes less sensitive to turbulence due to rapid vapor saturation. These findings are relevant to improving predictive CFD models and optimizing fuel injection in spray-combustion applications, especially under high-pressure conditions.</description>

      <title>Tunable self-emulsification via viscoelastic control of Marangoni-driven interfacial instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interfacial instabilities in multicomponent fluidic systems are widespread in nature and in industrial processes, yet controlling their dynamics remains a challenge. Here, we present a strategy to actively tune Marangoni-driven self-emulsification at liquid-liquid interfaces by harnessing fluid viscoelasticity. When a water-alcohol droplet spreads on an oil bath, a radial surface tension gradient induced by selective alcohol evaporation drives an interfacial instability, leading to the spontaneous formation of a dense two-dimensional array of "daughter" droplets. We demonstrate that introducing trace amounts of high-molecular-weight polymers, which introduces viscoelasticity, provides a robust means of controlling this process. Increasing viscoelasticity systematically suppresses the instability, resulting in a delayed onset of fragmentation and longer spreading fingers. By combining high-resolution experimental visualization and theoretical analysis, we uncover a quantitative relationship between the polymer concentration and the finger length prior to breakup. These findings establish a predictive framework for designing viscoelastic interfacial materials with programmable dynamic and offer new opportunities for surface-tension-mediated patterning, emulsification, and fluidic control in soft material systems.</description>
