      <title>The Reciprocal Velocity Force of a Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the course of their studies, students of physics accumulate experience in solving problems for a variety forces, not only developing a strong physical intuition for each force but also having an understanding of how each force is realized in the physical world. With this in mind we believe not enough emphasis is placed on the reciprocal velocity force $F(v)=\frac{C}{v}$. The theoretical importance of this force is illustrated by the units of the constant $C$ which are power. Such a force has constant power as $P(t)=F(v(t))v(t)=C$. The goal of this paper is to use graphical methods to explain how such a peculiar force arises from a device called a transmission, to explore some of the consequences of this force, and to briefly discuss its role in automotive physics.</description>

      <title>Linear theory of viscoelasticity in a generalized hydrodynamic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized hydrodynamic theory that systematically incorporates elasticity and viscoelasticity had been derived about a quarter of a century ago. It is based on a strictly Euler point of view, as is natural for hydrodynamics. We used and adapted this theory particularly in a linear framework. There, it is straightforward to focus on what are the flow and displacement fields in linearized hydrodynamics and elasticity, which provides some advantages. Since this theoretical approach appears not to be as commonly widespread as it deserves to be, we here overview and review the formalism. Specific further focus is on pointing out relations to the commonly known Kelvin-Voigt model and Maxwell model. They are naturally contained within this description. The two limits of perfect long-term elasticity on one hand and long-term flow on the other hand can be represented by adjusting only one parameter.</description>

      <title>Enhancing performance in bolt torque tightening using a connected torque wrench and augmented reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern production rates and the increasing complexity of mechanical systems require efficient and effective manufacturing and assembly processes. The transition to Industry 4.0, supported by the deployment of innovative tools such as Augmented Reality (AR), equips the industry to tackle future challenges. Among critical processes, the assembly and tightening of bolted joints stand out due to their significant safety and economic implications across various industrial sectors. This study proposes an innovative tightening method designed to enhance the reliability of bolted assembly tightening through the use of Augmented Reality and connected tools. A 6-Degrees-of-Freedom (6-DoF) tracked connected torque wrench assists the operator during tightening, ensuring each screw is tightened to the correct torque. The effectiveness of this method is compared with the conventional tightening method using paper instructions. Participants in the study carried out tightening sequences on two simple parts with multiple screws. The study evaluates the impact of the proposed method on task performance and its acceptability to operators. The tracked connected torque wrench provides considerable assistance to the operators, including wrench control and automatic generation of tightening reports. The results suggest that the AR-based method has the potential to ensure reliable torque tightening of bolted joints.</description>

      <title>Emergence of a Classical Dirac-Type Spin from On-Shell Factorisation and Liouvillian Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Liouville's theorem is first order in time for the phase-space distribution itself, the relativistic mass-shell constraint $p^\mu p_\mu = m^2$ is naively second order in energy. We argue it is reasonable to unify both energy branches within a single Hamiltonian by factorising $(p^2 - m^2)$ in analogy with Dirac's approach in relativistic quantum mechanics. We show the resulting matrix-based Liouville equation remains first order and naturally yields a $4\times4$ matrix-valued probability density function in phase space as a classical analogue of a relativistic spin-half Wigner function.</description>
