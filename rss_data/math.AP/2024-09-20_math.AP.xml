      <title>Positive solutions of singular elliptic problems with unbounded exponents and unbounded convection term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence of a solution for a class of Dirichlet problems with a singularity and a convection term. Precisely, we consider the existence of a positive solution to the Dirichlet problem $$-\Delta_p u = \frac{\lambda}{u^{\alpha}} + f(x,u,\nabla u)$$ in a bounded, smooth domain $\Omega$. The convection term has exponents with no upper limitations neither in $u$ nor in $\nabla u$. This is somewhat unexpected and rare. So, we address a wide range of problems not yet contained in the literature.
  The solution of the problem combines the definition of an auxiliary problem, the method of sub- and super-solution and Schauder's fixed point theorem.</description>

      <title>On a novel UCP result and its application to inverse conductive scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a novel Unique Continuation Principle (UCP) for a system of second-order elliptic PDEs system and apply it to investigate inverse problems in conductive scattering. The UCP relaxes the typical assumptions imposed on the domain or boundary with certain interior transmission conditions. This is motivated by the study of the associated inverse scattering problem and enables us to establish several novel unique identifiability results for the determination of generalized conductive scatterers using a single far-field pattern, significantly extending the results in [12,18]. A key technical advancement in our work is the combination of Complex Geometric Optics (CGO) techniques from [12,18] with the Fourier expansion method to microlocally analyze corner singularities and their implications for inverse problems. We believe that the methods developed can have broader applications in other contexts.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Stability of 3D Out-flowing Compressible Viscous Fluid under Non-Spherical Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an outflow problem for the $3$-dimensional isentropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations. The fluid under consideration occupies the exterior domain of unit ball, $\Omega=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^3\,\vert\, |x|\ge 1\}$, and it is flowing out from $\Omega$ at a constant speed $|u_b|$, in the normal direction to the boundary surface $\partial\Omega$. It is shown in Hashimoto-Matsumura(2021) that if the fluid velocity at the far-field is assumed to be zero, and $|u_b|$ is sufficiently small, then there exists a unique spherically symmetric stationary solution $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})(x)$. In this paper, we prove that $(\tilde{\rho},\tilde{u})(x)$ is asymptotically stable in time, under small, possibly non-spherically symmetric initial perturbations.</description>

      <title>Spatially-invariant opinion dynamics on the circle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a nonlinear opinion dynamics model for an agent making decisions about a continuous distribution of options in the presence of distributed input. Inspired by perceptual decision-making, we develop the theory for options distributed on the circle, representing, e.g., the set of possible heading directions in planar robotic navigation problems. Interactions among options are encoded through a spatially invariant kernel. We design the kernel to ensure that decision-making is robust, in the sense that only a finite subset of options can be favored over the continuum. We prove the spatial invariance of the model linearization and use this result to prove an opinion-forming bifurcation in the model with zero input. We then use space and time frequency domain analysis of the model linearization to infer the ultra-sensitive input-output behavior of the nonlinear dynamics with input. We illustrate our model's versatility with a robotic navigation example in crowded spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new parabolic flow deforming any Riemannian metric on a spin manifold by following a constrained gradient flow of the total scalar curvature. This flow is built out of the well-known Dirac-Einstein functional. We prove local well-posedness of smooth solutions. The present contribution is the first installment of more general program on the Einstein-Dirac problem.</description>

      <title>Complete classification on traveling waves in monotone dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that traveling waves with the minimal speed in monotone dynamical systems are typically categorized into two types: pushed fronts and pulled fronts. In this paper, using a new approach, we identify a general rule for monotone dynamical systems: the pushed front always decays at a fast rate. Additionally, we provide a complete classification of traveling waves based on their decay rates.</description>

      <title>Fujita type results for a parabolic inequality with a non-linear convolution term on the Heisenberg group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the non-existence of global weak solutions of the following degenerate inequality on the Heisenberg group $$ \begin{cases} u_{t}-\Delta_{\mathbb{H}}u\geq (\mathcal{K}\ast_{_{\mathbb{H}}}|u|^p)|u|^q ,\qquad {\eta\in \mathbb{H}^n,\,\,\,t&gt;0,}
  \\{}\\ u(\eta,0)=u_{0}(\eta), \qquad\qquad\qquad\quad \eta\in \mathbb{H}^n,
  \end{cases} $$ where $n\geq1$, $p,q&gt;0$, $u_0\in L^1_{loc}(\mathbb{H}^n)$, $\Delta_{\mathbb{H}}$ is the Heisenberg Laplacian, and $\mathcal{K}:(0,\infty)\rightarrow(0,\infty)$ is a continuous function satisfying $\mathcal{K}(|\cdotp|_{_{\mathbb{H}}})\in L^1_{loc}(\mathbb{H}^n)$ which decreases in a vicinity of infinity. In addition, $\ast_{_{\mathbb{H}}}$ denotes the convolution operation in $\mathbb{H}^n$. Our approach is based on the non-linear capacity method.</description>

      <title>Compensated Integrability in bounded domains: Applications to gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate functional inequality for Div-BV positive symmetric tensors $A$ in a bounded domain $U\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ arises whenever the tangential part of the normal trace $\gamma_\nu A\sim A\vec\nu$ is a finite measure over $\partial U$. The proof involves an extension operator to a neighbourhood of $\bar U$. The resulting inequality depends upon the domain only through the $C^3$-regularity of $\partial U$, some constant involving the curvature and its first derivatives.This abstract statement applies to several models of Gas Dynamics (Euler system, Hard Spheres dynamics), as the boundary condition (slip, or reflection) tells us that $A\vec\nu$ is parallel to $\vec\nu$, where $A$ is the mass-momentum tensor.</description>

      <title>Regularity of solutions of the steady linearized Boltzmann equation with soft potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the H\"older regularity of solutions to the steady Boltzmann equation with in-flow boundary condition in bounded and strictly convex domains $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^{3}$ for gases with cutoff soft potential $(-3&lt;\gamma&lt;0)$. We prove that there is a unique solution with a bounded $L^{\infty}$ norm in space and velocity. This solution is H\"older continuous, and it's order depends not only on the regularity of the incoming boundary data, but also on the potential power $\gamma$. The result for modulated soft potential case $-2&lt;\gamma&lt;0$ is similar to hard potential case $(0\leq\gamma&lt;1)$ since we have $C^{1}$ velocity regularity from collision part. However, we observe that for very soft potential case $(-3&lt;\gamma\leq -2)$, the regularity in velocity obtained by the collision part is lower (H\"older only), but the boundary regularity still can transfer to solution (in both space and velocity) by transport and collision part under the restriction of $\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Higher order Hardy-Rellich identities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show Hardy-Rellich identities for polyharmonic operators $\Delta^m$ and radial Laplacian $\Delta_r^m$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with Hardy-H\'enon weight $|x|^\alpha$ for all $m, n\in \mathbb{N}, \alpha\in \mathbb{R}$. Moreover, the iterative method is applied to give Hardy-Rellich equalities with general weights on Riemannian manifolds. These identities provide naturally an alternative approach to obtain and improve Hardy-Rellich type inequalities. As example of application, we extend several Rellich inequalities of Tertikas-Zographopoulos (Adv. Math. 2007) to the weighted case; using equality with weights involving logarithmic, we show another new weighted Rellich estimate between integrals of $\Delta u$ and $|\nabla u|$; we establish also a Rellich identity involving the Laplace-Beltrami operator $\Delta_\mathbb{H}$ and the radial Laplacian $\Delta_{\rho, \mathbb{H}}$ of the hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$, which yields in particular brand-new Rellich inequalities for $\|\Delta_\mathbb{H} u\|$ in $\mathbb{H}^3$ and $\mathbb{H}^4$.</description>

      <title>Biomechanical Effects on Traveling Waves at the Interface of Cell Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study builds upon a model proposed by Joanny and collaborators that examines the dynamics of interfaces between two distinct cell populations, particularly during tumor growth in healthy tissues. This framework leads to the investigation of a general model with a non-local and strongly nonlinear advection term representing the biomechanical interaction between both populations. The model captures the evolution of front propagation, reflecting the interaction between cell population dynamics and tissue mechanics. We explore the existence of traveling wave solutions to this problem and establish upper and lower bounds on the propagation speed across various biological parameters. In this way, the model accounts for both biomechanical and biochemical interactions.</description>

      <title>On a PDE-ODE-PDE model for two interacting cell populations under the influence of an acidic environment and with nonlocal intra- and interspecific growth limitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a model for the dynamics of active cells interacting with their quiescent counterparts under the influence of acidity characterized by proton concentration. The active cells perform nonlinear diffusion and infer proliferation or decay, according to the strength of spatially nonlocal intra- and interspecific interactions. The two cell phenotypes are interchangeable, the transitions depending on the environmental acidity. We prove global existence of a weak solution to the considered PDE-ODE-PDE system and perform numerical simulations in 1D to informally investigate boundedness and patterning behavior in dependence of the system's parameters and kernels involved in the nonlocal terms.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic blow-up behavior for the semilinear heat equation with non scale invariant nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the asymptotic behavior near blowup points for positive solutions of the semilinear heat equation  \begin{equation*} \partial_t u-\Delta u =f(u), \end{equation*}  for nonlinearities which are genuinely non scale invariant, unlike in the standard case $f(u)=u^p$. Indeed, our results apply to a large class of nonlinearities of the form $f(u)=u^pL(u)$, where $p&gt;1$ is Sobolev subcritical and  $L$ is a slowly varying function at infinity (which includes for instance logarithms and their powers and iterates, as well as some strongly oscillating functions).  More precisely, denoting by $\psi$ the unique positive solution of the corresponding ODE $y'(t)=f(y(t))$ which blows up at the same time $T$, we show that if $a\in\Omega$ is a blowup point of $u$, then  \begin{equation*} \lim_{t\to T}\frac{u(a+y\sqrt{T-t},t)}{\psi(t)}= 1,\quad \text{uniformly for $y$ bounded.} \end{equation*} Additional blow-up properties are obtained, including the compactness of the blow-up set for the Cauchy problem with decaying initial data.</description>

      <title>Iterative algorithms for the reconstruction of early states of prostate cancer growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of mathematical models of cancer informed by time-resolved measurements has enabled personalised predictions of tumour growth and treatment response. However, frequent cancer monitoring is rare, and many tumours are treated soon after diagnosis with limited data. To improve the predictive capabilities of cancer models, we investigate the problem of recovering earlier tumour states from a single spatial measurement at a later time. Focusing on prostate cancer, we describe tumour dynamics using a phase-field model coupled with two reaction-diffusion equations for a nutrient and the local prostate-specific antigen. We generate synthetic data using a discretisation based on Isogeometric Analysis. Then, building on our previous analytical work (Beretta et al., SIAP (2024)), we propose an iterative reconstruction algorithm based on the Landweber scheme, showing local convergence with quantitative rates and exploring an adaptive step size that leads to faster reconstruction algorithms. Finally, we run simulations demonstrating high-quality reconstructions even with long time horizons and noisy data.</description>

      <title>Design and control of quasiperiodic patterns of particles with standing acoustic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method to design tunable quasiperiodic structures of particles suspended in a fluid by controlling standing acoustic waves. One application of our results is to ultrasound directed self-assembly, which allows fabricating composite materials with desired microstructures. Our approach is based on identifying the minima of a functional, termed the acoustic radiation potential, determining the locations of the particle clusters. This functional can be viewed as a two- or three-dimensional slice of a similar functional in higher dimensions as in the cut-and-project method of constructing quasiperiodic patterns. The higher dimensional representation allows for translations, rotations, and reflections of the patterns. Constrained optimization theory is used to characterize the quasiperiodic designs based on local minima of the acoustic radiation potential and to understand how changes to the controls affect particle patterns. We also show how to transition smoothly between different controls, producing smooth transformations of the quasiperiodic patterns. The developed approach unlocks a route to creating tunable quasiperiodic and moir\'e structures known for their unconventional superconductivity and other extraordinary properties. Several examples of constructing quasiperiodic structures, including in two and three dimensions, are given.</description>

Abstract: We provide a short proof of $L^3$-asymptotic stability around vector fields that are small in weak-$L^3$, including small Landau solutions. We show that asymptotic stability also holds for vector fields in the range of Lorentz spaces strictly between $L^3$ and weak-$L^3$, as well as in the closure of the test functions in weak-$L^3$. To provide a comprehensive perspective on the matter, we observe that asymptotic stability of Landau solutions does not generally extend to weak-$L^3$ via a counterexample.</description>

      <title>Residual Diffusivity for Noisy Bernoulli Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a discrete time Markov process $X^\varepsilon$ on $\mathbb R^d$ that makes a deterministic jump prescribed by a map $\varphi \colon \mathbb R^d \to \mathbb R^d$, and then takes a small Gaussian step of variance $\varepsilon^2$. For certain chaotic maps $\varphi$, the effective diffusivity of $X^\varepsilon$ may be bounded away from $0$ as $\varepsilon \to 0$. This is known as residual diffusivity, and in this paper we prove residual diffusivity occurs for a class of maps $\varphi$ obtained from piecewise affine expanding Bernoulli maps.</description>

      <title>The effective use of BLAS interface for implementation of finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods of the ADER family, in particular finite-element ADER-DG and finite-volume ADER-WENO methods, are among the most accurate numerical methods for solving quasilinear PDE systems. The internal structure of ADER-DG and ADER-WENO numerical methods contains a large number of basic linear algebra operations related to matrix multiplication. At the moment, the main interface of software libraries for high-performance computing is BLAS. This paper presents an effective method for integration the standard functions of the BLAS interface into the implementation of these numerical methods. The calculated matrices are small matrices; at the same time, the proposed implementation makes it possible to effectively use existing JIT technologies. The proposed approach immediately operates on AoS, which makes it possible to efficiently calculate flux, source and non-conservative terms without need to carry out transposition. The obtained computational costs allowed to conclude that the effective implementation, based on the use of the JIT functions of the BLAS, outperformed both the implementation based on the general BLAS functions and the naive implementations by several times. At the same time, the complexity of developing an implementation based on the approach proposed in this work does not exceed the complexity of developing a naive optimized implementation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the resolution of discontinuous singularities in gas dynamics via rarefaction waves. The mechanism is well-understood in the one dimensional case. We will prove the non-nonlinear stability of the Riemann problem for multi-dimensional isentropic Euler equations in the regime of rarefaction waves. The proof relies on the new energy estimates \emph{without loss of derivatives}. We also give a detailed geometric description of the rarefaction wave fronts. This is the first paper in the series which provides the \emph{a priori} energy bounds.</description>

Abstract: This is the second paper in a series studying the nonlinear stability of rarefaction waves in multi-dimensional gas dynamics. We construct initial data near singularities in the rarefaction wave region and, combined with the a priori energy estimates from the first paper, demonstrate that any smooth perturbation of constant states on one side of the diaphragm in a shock tube can be connected to a centered rarefaction wave. We apply this analysis to study multi-dimensional perturbations of the classical Riemann problem for isentropic Euler equations. We show that the Riemann problem is structurally stable in the regime of two families of rarefaction waves.</description>

Abstract: We consider a parabolic-elliptic type of Keller-Segel equations with generalized diffusion and logistic source under homogeneous Neumann-Neumann boundary conditions. We construct bounded weak solutions globally in time in an unbalanced optimal transport framework, provided that the magnitude of the chemotactic sensitivity can be restricted depending on parameters. In the case of subquadratic degradation of the logistic source, we quantify the chemotactic sensitivity, in particular, in terms of the power of degradation and the pointwise bound of the initial density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze finite-time blowup scenarios of locally self-similar type for the inviscid generalized surface quasi-geostrophic equation (gSQG) in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Under an $L^r$ growth assumption on the self-similar profile and its gradient, we identify appropriate ranges of the self-similar parameter where the profile is either identically zero, and hence blowup cannot occur, or its $L^p$ asymptotic behavior can be characterized, for suitable $r, p$. Our results extend the work [Xue; Journal of Differential Equations, 2016] regarding the SQG equation, and also partially recover the results proved in [Cannone, Xue; Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society, 2015] concerning globally self-similar solutions of the gSQG equation.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study a $3\times 3$ triangular reaction-diffusion system. Our main objective is to understand the long time behaviour of solutions to this reaction-diffusion system when there are degeneracies. More precisely, we treat cases when one of the diffusion coefficients vanishes while the other two diffusion coefficients stay positive. We prove convergence to equilibrium type results. In all our results, the constants appearing in the decay estimates are explicit.</description>

      <title>Weak stability of the sum of $K$ solitary waves for Half-wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the subcritical half-wave equation in the one-dimensional case. Let $R_k(t,x)$ be $K$ solitary wave solutions of the half-wave equation with different translations $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_K$. If the relative distances of the solitary waves $x_k-x_{k-1}$ are large enough, we prove that the sum of the $R_k(t)$ is weakly stable. To prove this result, we use an energy method and the local mass monotonicity property. However, unlike the single-solitary wave or NLS cases, different waves exhibit the strongest interactions in dimension one. In order to obtain the local mass monotonicity property to estimate the remainder of the geometrical decomposition, as well as non-local effects on localization functions and non-local operator $|D|$, we utilize the Carlder\'on estimate and the integration representation formula of the half-wave operator.</description>

      <title>Approximation of divergence-free vector fields vanishing on rough planar sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09880v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given any divergence-free vector field of Sobolev class $W^{m,p}_0(\Omega)$ in a bounded open subset $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$, we are interested in approximating it in the $W^{m,p}$ norm with divergence-free smooth vector fields compactly supported in $\Omega$. We show that this approximation property holds in the following cases: For $p&gt;2$, this holds given that $\partial \Omega$ has zero Lebesgue measure (a weaker but more technical condition is sufficient); For $p \leq 2$, this holds if $\Omega^c$ can be decomposed into finitely many disjoint closed sets, each of which is connected or $d$-Ahlfors regular for some $d\in[0,2)$. This has links to the uniqueness of weak solutions to the Stokes equation in $\Omega$. For H\"older spaces, we prove this approximation property in general bounded domains.</description>

      <title>Existence, symmetry and regularity of ground states of a non linear choquard equation in the hyperbolic space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the positive solutions of the following nonlinear Choquard equation involving the green kernel of the fractional operator $(-\Delta_{\mathbb{B}^N})^{-\alpha/2}$ in the hyperbolic space \begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned} -\Delta_{\mathbb{B}^{N}} u \, - \, \lambda u \, &amp;= \left[(- \Delta_{\mathbb{B}^{N}})^{-\frac{\alpha}{2}}|u|^p\right]|u|^{p-2}u,
  \end{aligned}
  \end{equation} where $\Delta_{\mathbb{B}^{N}}$ denotes the Laplace-Beltrami operator on $\mathbb{B}^{N}$, $\lambda \leq \frac{(N-1)^2}{4}$, $1 &lt; p &lt; 2^*_{\alpha} = \frac{N+\alpha}{N-2}$, $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; N$, $N \geq 3$, $2^*_\alpha$ is the critical exponent in the context of the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality. This study is analogous to the Choquard equation in the Euclidean space, which involves the non-local Riesz potential operator. We consider the functional setting within the Sobolev space $H^1(\mathbb{B}^N)$, employing advanced harmonic analysis techniques, particularly the Helgason Fourier transform and semigroup approach to fractional Laplacian. Moreover, the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality on complete Riemannian manifolds, as developed by Varopoulos, is pivotal in our analysis. We prove an existence result for the above problem in the subcritical case. Moreover, we also demonstrate that solutions exhibit radial symmetry, and establish the regularity properties.</description>

Abstract: We study the two-dimensional MHD boundary layer equations. For small perturbation around a tangential background magnetic field, we obtain the global-in-time existence and uniqueness of solutions in Sobolev spaces. The proof relies on the novel combination of the well-explored cancellation mechanism and the idea of linearly-good unknowns, and we use the former idea to deal with the top tangential derivatives and the latter one admitting fast decay rate to control lower-order derivatives.</description>

      <title>On some singularly perturbed elliptic systems modeling partial segregation: uniform H\"older estimates and basic properties of the limits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove uniform H\"older estimates in a class of singularly perturbed competition-diffusion elliptic systems, with the particular feature that the interactions between the components occur three by three (ternary interactions). These systems are associated to the minimization of Gross-Pitaevski energies modeling ternary mixture of ultracold gases and other multicomponent liquids and gases. We address the question whether this regularity holds uniformly throughout the approximation process up to the limiting profiles, answering positively. A very relevant feature of limiting profiles in this process is that they are only partially segregated, giving rise to new phenomena of geometric pattern formation and optimal regularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.14619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hawking's local rigidity theorem, proven in the smooth setting by Alexakis-Ionescu-Klainerman, says that the event horizon of any stationary non-extremal black hole is a non-degenerate Killing horizon. In this paper, we prove that the full asymptotic expansion of any smooth vacuum metric at a non-degenerate Killing horizon is determined by the geometry of the horizon. This gives a new perspective on the black hole uniqueness conjecture. In spacetime dimension $4$, we also prove an existence theorem: Given any non-degenerate horizon geometry, Einstein's vacuum equations can be solved to infinite order at the horizon in a unique way (up to isometry). The latter is a gauge invariant version of Moncrief's classical existence result, without any restriction on the topology of the horizon. In the real analytic setting, the asymptotic expansion is shown to converge and we get well-posedness of this characteristic Cauchy problem.</description>

      <title>A convergent stochastic scalar auxiliary variable method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss an extension of the scalar auxiliary variable approach, which was originally introduced by Shen et al. ([Shen, Xu, Yang, J. Comput. Phys., 2018]) for the discretization of deterministic gradient flows. By introducing an additional scalar auxiliary variable, this approach allows to derive a linear scheme, while still maintaining unconditional stability. Our extension augments the approximation of the evolution of this scalar auxiliary variable with higher order terms, which enables its application to stochastic partial differential equations. Using the stochastic Allen--Cahn equation as a prototype for nonlinear stochastic partial differential equations with multiplicative noise, we propose an unconditionally energy stable, linear, fully discrete finite element scheme based on our augmented scalar auxiliary variable method. Recovering a discrete version of the energy estimate and establishing Nikolskii estimates with respect to time, we are able to prove convergence of discrete solutions towards pathwise unique martingale solutions by applying Jakubowski's generalization of Skorokhod's theorem. A generalization of the Gy\"ongy--Krylov characterization of convergence in probability to quasi-Polish spaces finally provides convergence of fully discrete solutions towards strong solutions of the stochastic Allen--Cahn equation. Finally, we present numerical simulations underlining the practicality of the scheme and the importance of the introduced augmentation terms.</description>

      <title>Optimality conditions for sparse optimal control of viscous Cahn-Hilliard systems with logarithmic potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the optimal control of a parabolic initial-boundary value problem of viscous Cahn-Hilliard type with zero Neumann boundary conditions. Phase field systems of this type govern the evolution of diffusive phase transition processes with conserved order parameter. It is assumed that the nonlinear functions driving the physical processes within the spatial domain are double-well potentials of logarithmic type whose derivatives become singular at the boundary of their respective domains of definition. For such systems, optimal control problems have been studied in the past. We focus here on the situation when the cost functional of the optimal control problem contains a nondifferentiable term like the L1-norm, which leads to sparsity of optimal controls. For such cases, we establish first-order necessary and second-order sufficient optimality conditions for locally optimal controls. In the approach to second-order sufficient conditions, the main novelty of this paper, we adapt a technique introduced by E. Casas, C. Ryll and F. Tr\"oltzsch in the paper [SIAM J. Control Optim. 53 (2015), 2168-2202]. In this paper, we show that this method can also be successfully applied to systems of viscous Cahn-Hilliard type with logarithmic nonlinearity. Since the Cahn-Hilliard system corresponds to a fourth-order partial differential equation in contrast to the second-order systems investigated before, additional technical difficulties have to be overcome.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1910, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz delved into the enigmatic Laplace eigenvalue equation, also known as the Helmholtz equation, pondering to what extent the geometry in which one solves the equation can be recovered from knowledge of the eigenvalues. Lorentz, inspired by physical and musical analogies, conjectured a fundamental relationship between eigenvalues, domain volume, and dimensionality. While his conjecture initially seemed insurmountable, Hermann Weyl's groundbreaking proof in 1912 illuminated the deep connection between eigenvalues and geometric properties. Over the ensuing 112 years, mathematicians and physicists have continued to decipher the intricate interplay between eigenvalues and geometry. From Weyl's law to Milnor's example of isospectral non-isometric flat tori, and Kac's inspiring question about hearing the shape of a drum, the field has witnessed remarkable progress, uncovering spectral invariants and advancing our understanding of geometric properties discernible through eigenvalues. We present an overview of this field amenable to both physicists and mathematicians.</description>
