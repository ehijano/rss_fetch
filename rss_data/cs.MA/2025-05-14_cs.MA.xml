      <title>Scalable UAV Multi-Hop Networking via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In disaster scenarios, establishing robust emergency communication networks is critical, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer a promising solution to rapidly restore connectivity. However, organizing UAVs to form multi-hop networks in large-scale dynamic environments presents significant challenges, including limitations in algorithmic scalability and the vast exploration space required for coordinated decision-making. To address these issues, we propose MRLMN, a novel framework that integrates multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) and large language models (LLMs) to jointly optimize UAV agents toward achieving optimal networking performance. The framework incorporates a grouping strategy with reward decomposition to enhance algorithmic scalability and balance decision-making across UAVs. In addition, behavioral constraints are applied to selected key UAVs to improve the robustness of the network. Furthermore, the framework integrates LLM agents, leveraging knowledge distillation to transfer their high-level decision-making capabilities to MARL agents. This enhances both the efficiency of exploration and the overall training process. In the distillation module, a Hungarian algorithm-based matching scheme is applied to align the decision outputs of the LLM and MARL agents and define the distillation loss. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating significant improvements in network performance, including enhanced coverage and communication quality.</description>

      <title>MACH: Multi-Agent Coordination for RSU-centric Handovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces MACH, a novel approach for optimizing task handover in vehicular computing scenarios. To ensure fast and latency-aware placement of tasks, the decision-making -- where and when should tasks be offloaded -- is carried out decentralized at the Road Side Units (RSUs) who also execute the tasks. By shifting control to the network edge, MACH moves away from the traditional centralized or vehicle-based handover method. Still, it focuses on contextual factors, such as the current RSU load and vehicle trajectories. Thus, MACH improves the overall Quality of Service (QoS) while fairly balancing computational loads between RSUs. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we develop a robust simulation environment composed of real-world traffic data, dynamic network conditions, and different infrastructure capacities. For scenarios that demand low latency and high reliability, our experimental results demonstrate how MACH significantly improves the adaptability and efficiency of vehicular computations. By decentralizing control to the network edge, MACH effectively reduces communication overhead and optimizes resource utilization, offering a robust framework for task handover management.</description>

      <title>Patchwork: A Unified Framework for RAG Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a new paradigm for enhancing Large Language Model reliability through integration with external knowledge sources. However, efficient deployment of these systems presents significant technical challenges due to their inherently heterogeneous computational pipelines comprising LLMs, databases, and specialized processing components. We introduce Patchwork, a comprehensive end-to-end RAG serving framework designed to address these efficiency bottlenecks. Patchwork's architecture offers three key innovations: First, it provides a flexible specification interface enabling users to implement custom RAG pipelines. Secondly, it deploys these pipelines as distributed inference systems while optimizing for the unique scalability characteristics of individual RAG components. Third, Patchwork incorporates an online scheduling mechanism that continuously monitors request load and execution progress, dynamically minimizing SLO violations through strategic request prioritization and resource auto-scaling. Our experimental evaluation across four distinct RAG implementations demonstrates that Patchwork delivers substantial performance improvements over commercial alternatives, achieving throughput gains exceeding 48% while simultaneously reducing SLO violations by ~24%.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Product 3.0: Decentralised AI Agents and Web3 Intelligence Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07835v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twenty-five years ago, the specification of the Intelligent Product was established, envisaging real-time connectivity that not only enables products to gather accurate data about themselves but also allows them to assess and influence their own destiny. Early work by the Auto-ID project focused on creating a single, open-standard repository for storing and retrieving product information, laying a foundation for scalable connectivity. A decade later, the approach was revisited in light of low-cost RFID systems that promised a low-cost link between physical goods and networked information environments. Since then, advances in blockchain, Web3, and artificial intelligence have introduced unprecedented levels of resilience, consensus, and autonomy. By leveraging decentralised identity, blockchain-based product information and history, and intelligent AI-to-AI collaboration, this paper examines these developments and outlines a new specification for the Intelligent Product 3.0, illustrating how decentralised and AI-driven capabilities facilitate seamless interaction between physical AI and everyday products.</description>

      <title>Moving From Monolithic To Microservices Architecture for Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition from monolithic to microservices architecture revolutionized software development by improving scalability and maintainability. This paradigm shift is now becoming relevant for complex multi-agent systems (MAS). This review article explores the evolution from monolithic architecture to microservices architecture in the specific context of MAS. It will highlight the limitations of traditional monolithic MAS and the benefits of adopting a microservices-based approach. The article further examines the core architectural principles and communication protocols, including Agent Communication Languages (ACLs), the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and the Application-to-Application (A2A) protocol. The article identifies emerging architectural patterns, design challenges, and considerations through a comparative lens of the paradigm shift.</description>

      <title>Conceptual Logical Foundations of Artificial Social Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What makes a society possible at all? How is coordination and cooperation in social activity possible? What is the minimal mental architecture of a social agent? How is the information about the state of the world related to the agents intentions? How are the intentions of agents related? What role does communication play in this coordination process? This essay explores the conceptual and logical foundations of artificial social intelligence in the context of a society of multiple agents that communicate and cooperate to achieve some end. An attempt is made to provide an introduction to some of the key concepts, their formal definitions and their interrelationships. These include the notion of a changing social world of multiple agents. The logic of social intelligence goes beyond classical logic by linking information with strategic thought. A minimal architecture of social agents is presented. The agents have different dynamically changing, possible choices and abilities. The agents also have uncertainty, lacking perfect information about their physical state as well as their dynamic social state. The social state of an agent includes the intentional state of that agent, as well as, that agent's representation of the intentional states of other agents. Furthermore, it includes the evaluations agents make of their physical and social condition. Communication, semantic and pragmatic meaning and their relationship to intention and information states are investigated. The logic of agent abilities and intentions are motivated and formalized. The entropy of group strategic states is defined.</description>

      <title>CCL: Collaborative Curriculum Learning for Sparse-Reward Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning via Co-evolutionary Task Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sparse reward environments pose significant challenges in reinforcement learning, especially within multi-agent systems (MAS) where feedback is delayed and shared across agents, leading to suboptimal learning. We propose Collaborative Multi-dimensional Course Learning (CCL), a novel curriculum learning framework that addresses this by (1) refining intermediate tasks for individual agents, (2) using a variational evolutionary algorithm to generate informative subtasks, and (3) co-evolving agents with their environment to enhance training stability. Experiments on five cooperative tasks in the MPE and Hide-and-Seek environments show that CCL outperforms existing methods in sparse reward settings.</description>

      <title>Land-Coverage Aware Path-Planning for Multi-UAV Swarms in Search and Rescue Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become vital in search-and-rescue (SAR) missions, with autonomous mission planning improving response times and coverage efficiency. Early approaches primarily used path planning techniques such as A*, potential-fields, or Dijkstra's algorithm, while recent approaches have incorporated meta-heuristic frameworks like genetic algorithms and particle swarm optimization to balance competing objectives such as network connectivity, energy efficiency, and strategic placement of charging stations. However, terrain-aware path planning remains under-explored, despite its critical role in optimizing UAV SAR deployments. To address this gap, we present a computer-vision based terrain-aware mission planner that autonomously extracts and analyzes terrain topology to enhance SAR pre-flight planning. Our framework uses a deep segmentation network fine-tuned on our own collection of landcover datasets to transform satellite imagery into a structured, grid-based representation of the operational area. This classification enables terrain-specific UAV-task allocation, improving deployment strategies in complex environments. We address the challenge of irregular terrain partitions, by introducing a two-stage partitioning scheme that first evaluates terrain monotonicity along coordinate axes before applying a cost-based recursive partitioning process, minimizing unnecessary splits and optimizing path efficiency. Empirical validation in a high-fidelity simulation environment demonstrates that our approach improves search and dispatch time over multiple meta-heuristic techniques and against a competing state-of-the-art method. These results highlight its potential for large-scale SAR operations, where rapid response and efficient UAV coordination are critical.</description>

      <title>Aitomia: Your Intelligent Assistant for AI-Driven Atomistic and Quantum Chemical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed Aitomia - a platform powered by AI to assist in performing AI-driven atomistic and quantum chemical (QC) simulations. This intelligent assistant platform is equipped with chatbots and AI agents to help experts and guide non-experts in setting up and running the atomistic simulations, monitoring their computation status, analyzing the simulation results, and summarizing them for the user in text and graphical forms. We achieve these goals by exploiting fine-tuned open-source large language models (LLMs), rule-based agents, and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system. Aitomia leverages the versatility of our MLatom ecosystem for AI-enhanced computational chemistry. This intelligent assistant is going to be integrated into the Aitomistic Hub and XACS online computing services, with some functionality already publicly available as described at http://mlatom.com/aitomia. Aitomia is expected to lower the barrier to performing atomistic simulations, accelerating research and development in the relevant fields.</description>

      <title>Reciprocity as the Foundational Substrate of Society: How Reciprocal Dynamics Scale into Social Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major bottleneck in multi-agent AI is the lack of simulateable models for the bottom-up emergence of social structure under realistic behavioral constraints. Similarly, many foundational theories in economics and sociology including the concepts of "institutions" and "norms" tend to describe social structures post hoc, often relying on implicit assumptions of shared culture, morality, or symbolic agreement. These concepts are often treated as primitives rather than reconstructed from agent-level behavior, leaving both their origins and operational definitions under-specified. To address this, we propose a three-stage bottom-up framework: Reciprocal Dynamics, capturing individual-level reciprocal exchanges; Norm Stabilization, the consolidation of shared expectations; and Institutional Construction, the externalization of stable patterns into scalable structures. By grounding social emergence in agent-level reciprocity, our framework enables the systematic exploration of how moral, cultural, and institutional structures emerge from cognitively minimal interactions.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking AI scientists in omics data-driven biological research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of large language models and multi-agent systems has sparked growing interest in AI scientists capable of autonomous biological research. However, existing benchmarks either focus on reasoning without data or on data analysis with predefined statistical answers, lacking realistic, data-driven evaluation settings. Here, we introduce the Biological AI Scientist Benchmark (BaisBench), a benchmark designed to assess AI scientists' ability to generate biological discoveries through data analysis and reasoning with external knowledge. BaisBench comprises two tasks: cell type annotation on 31 expert-labeled single-cell datasets, and scientific discovery through answering 198 multiple-choice questions derived from the biological insights of 41 recent single-cell studies. Systematic experiments on state-of-the-art AI scientists and LLM agents showed that while promising, current models still substantially underperform human experts on both tasks. We hope BaisBench will fill this gap and serve as a foundation for advancing and evaluating AI models for scientific discovery. The benchmark can be found at: https://github.com/EperLuo/BaisBench.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores multi-agent systems and identify challenges that remain inadequately addressed. By leveraging the diverse capabilities and roles of individual agents, multi-agent systems can tackle complex tasks through agent collaboration. We discuss optimizing task allocation, fostering robust reasoning through iterative debates, managing complex and layered context information, and enhancing memory management to support the intricate interactions within multi-agent systems. We also explore potential applications of multi-agent systems in blockchain systems to shed light on their future development and application in real-world distributed systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based agents face significant challenges in handling complex GUI (Graphical User Interface) interactions on devices. These challenges arise from the dynamic and structured nature of GUI environments, which integrate text, images, and spatial relationships, as well as the variability in action spaces across different pages and tasks. To address these limitations, we propose MobA, a novel MLLM-based mobile assistant system. MobA introduces an adaptive planning module that incorporates a reflection mechanism for error recovery and dynamically adjusts plans to align with the real environment contexts and action module's execution capacity. Additionally, a multifaceted memory module provides comprehensive memory support to enhance adaptability and efficiency. We also present MobBench, a dataset designed for complex mobile interactions. Experimental results on MobBench and AndroidArena demonstrate MobA's ability to handle dynamic GUI environments and perform complex mobile tasks.</description>

      <title>Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks for Flexible Heterogeneous Multi-Robot Coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06058v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances have enabled heterogeneous multi-robot teams to learn complex and effective coordination skills. However, existing neural architectures that support heterogeneous teaming tend to force a trade-off between expressivity and efficiency. Shared-parameter designs prioritize sample efficiency by enabling a single network to be shared across all or a pre-specified subset of robots (via input augmentations), but tend to limit behavioral diversity. In contrast, recent designs employ a separate policy for each robot, enabling greater diversity and expressivity at the cost of efficiency and generalization. Our key insight is that such tradeoffs can be avoided by viewing these design choices as ends of a broad spectrum. Inspired by recent work in transfer and meta learning, and building on prior work in multi-robot task allocation, we propose Capability-Aware Shared Hypernetworks (CASH), a soft weight sharing architecture that uses hypernetworks to efficiently learn a flexible shared policy that dynamically adapts to each robot post-training. By explicitly encoding the impact of robot capabilities (e.g., speed and payload) on collective behavior, CASH enables zero-shot generalization to unseen robots or team compositions. Our experiments involve multiple heterogeneous tasks, three learning paradigms (imitation learning, value-based, and policy-gradient RL), and SOTA multi-robot simulation (JaxMARL) and hardware (Robotarium) platforms. Across all conditions, we find that CASH generates appropriately-diverse behaviors and consistently outperforms baseline architectures in terms of performance and sample efficiency during both training and zero-shot generalization, all with 60%-80% fewer learnable parameters.</description>

Abstract: Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) has recently emerged as a popular framework for cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), where agents can use additional global state information to guide training in a centralized way and make their own decisions only based on decentralized local policies. Despite the encouraging results achieved, CTDE makes an independence assumption on agent policies, which limits agents to adopt global cooperative information from each other during centralized training. Therefore, we argue that existing CTDE methods cannot fully utilize global information for training, leading to an inefficient joint-policy exploration and even suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce a novel Centralized Advising and Decentralized Pruning (CADP) framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning, that not only enables an efficacious message exchange among agents during training but also guarantees the independent policies for execution. Firstly, CADP endows agents the explicit communication channel to seek and take advices from different agents for more centralized training. To further ensure the decentralized execution, we propose a smooth model pruning mechanism to progressively constraint the agent communication into a closed one without degradation in agent cooperation capability. Empirical evaluations on StarCraft II micromanagement and Google Research Football benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art counterparts. Our code will be made publicly available.</description>

Abstract: The swift progress of Generative Artificial intelligence (GenAI), notably Large Language Models (LLMs), is reshaping the digital landscape. Recognizing this transformative potential, the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) launched a pilot initiative to explore the integration of GenAI techniques into its daily operation for performance excellence, where 22 projects were launched in May 2024. Within these projects, this paper presents the development of the intelligent agent Pubbie as a case study, targeting the automation of performance measurement, data management and insight reporting at the NRC. Cutting-edge techniques are explored, including LLM orchestration and semantic embedding via RoBERTa, while strategic fine-tuning and few-shot learning approaches are incorporated to infuse domain knowledge at an affordable cost. The user-friendly interface of Pubbie allows general government users to input queries in natural language and easily upload or download files with a simple button click, greatly reducing manual efforts and accessibility barriers.</description>
