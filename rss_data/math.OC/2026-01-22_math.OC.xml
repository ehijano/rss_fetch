      <title>Topology optimization concerning the mass distribution via filtered gradient flows on the Wasserstein space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we formulate topology optimization problems concerning the mass distribution as minimization problems for functionals on the Wasserstein space. We relax optimization problems regarding non-convex objective functions on the Wasserstein space by using the Neumann heat semigroup and prove the existence of minimizers of relaxed problems. Furthermore, we introduce the filtered Wasserstein gradient flow and derive the error estimate between the original Wasserstein gradient flow and the filtered one in terms of the Wasserstein distance. We also construct a candidate for the optimal mass distribution for a given fixed total mass and simultaneously obtain the shape of the material by the numerical calculation of filtered Wasserstein gradient flows.</description>

      <title>$\pi$MPC: A Parallel-in-horizon and Construction-free NMPC Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has gained increasing popularity in embedded model predictive control (MPC) due to its code simplicity and pain-free parameter selection. However, existing ADMM solvers either target general quadratic programming (QP) problems or exploit sparse MPC formulations via Riccati recursions, which are inherently sequential and therefore difficult to parallelize for long prediction horizons. This technical note proposes a novel \textit{parallel-in-horizon} and \textit{construction-free} nonlinear MPC algorithm, termed $\pi$MPC, which combines a new variable-splitting scheme with a velocity-based system representation in the ADMM framework, enabling horizon-wise parallel execution while operating directly on system matrices without explicit MPC-to-QP construction. Numerical experiments and accompanying code are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Newton Extremum Seeking for Multivariable Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a static event-triggered control strategy for multivariable Newton-based extremum seeking. The proposed method integrates event-triggered actuation into the Newton-based optimization framework to reduce control updates while maintaining rapid convergence to the extremum. Unlike traditional gradient-based extremum seeking, where the convergence rate depends on the unknown Hessian of the cost function, the proposed approach employs a dynamic estimator of the Hessian inverse, formulated as a Riccati equation, enabling user-assignable convergence rates. The event-triggering mechanism is designed to minimize unnecessary actuation updates while preserving stability and performance. Using averaging theory, we establish local stability results and exponential convergence to a neighborhood of the unknown extremum point. Additionally, numerical simulations illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach over gradient-based and continuously actuated Newton-based extremum seeking, showing improved convergence rates and reduced control update frequency, leading to more efficient implementation in real-time optimization scenarios.</description>

      <title>New operator designs for Halpern iterations with explicit rates under H\"older error bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behavior of Halpern-type iterations applied to quasi-nonexpansive operators arising in best approximation problems over the intersection of finitely many closed convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Assuming a local decrease condition for the underlying operator and standard requirements on the stepsizes $(\alpha_k) \subset (0,1)$, we first prove strong convergence of the Halpern sequence $x_{k+1} = \alpha_k x_0 + (1-\alpha_k) T x_k$ to the best approximation point $x^\star$ in the intersection set, that is, the metric projection of $x_0$ onto that set. Under the additional assumption that the intersection satisfies a H\"older-type error bound with exponent $\gamma \in (0,1]$, we then derive explicit convergence rates for both feasibility and norm error: the distance from $x_k$ to the intersection set decays like $\mathcal O(\alpha_k^{\gamma/(2-\gamma)})$, while the norm error $\|x_k - x^\star\|$ decays like $\mathcal O(\alpha_k^{\gamma/(4-2\gamma)})$. These results apply to most projection-type operators used in convex feasibility problems (including MAP, CRM/SCCRM, Cimmino and 3PM/A3PM) and extend classical convergence analyses of the Halpern-type iterations by providing explicit, geometry-dependent rates governed by H\"older-type error bounds. Our numerical experiments show that Halpern-type iterations combined with most of these projection-type operators are quicker than Dykstra's algorithm to find the projection of a point in an intersection of ellipsoids or in an intersection of polyhedrons.</description>

      <title>Online Linear Programming with Replenishment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an online linear programming (OLP) model in which inventory is not provided upfront but instead arrives gradually through an exogenous stochastic replenishment process. This replenishment-based formulation captures operational settings, such as e-commerce fulfillment, perishable supply chains, and renewable-powered systems, where resources are accumulated gradually and initial inventories are small or zero. The introduction of dispersed, uncertain replenishment fundamentally alters the structure of classical OLPs, creating persistent stockout risk and eliminating advance knowledge of the total budget.
  We develop new algorithms and regret analyses for three major distributional regimes studied in the OLP literature: bounded distributions, finite-support distributions, and continuous-support distributions with a non-degeneracy condition. For bounded distributions, we design an algorithm that achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. For finite-support distributions with a non-degenerate induced LP, we obtain $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ regret, and we establish an $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound for degenerate instances, demonstrating a sharp separation from the classical setting where $\mathcal{O}(1)$ regret is achievable. For continuous-support, non-degenerate distributions, we develop a two-stage accumulate-then-convert algorithm that achieves $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 T)$ regret, comparable to the $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ regret in classical OLPs. Together, these results provide a near-complete characterization of the optimal regret achievable in OLP with replenishment. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithms and demonstrate their advantages over natural adaptations of classical OLP methods in the replenishment setting.</description>

      <title>TRSVR: An Adaptive Stochastic Trust-Region Method with Variance Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic trust-region method for unconstrained nonconvex optimization that incorporates stochastic variance-reduced gradients (SVRG) to accelerate convergence. Unlike classical trust-region methods, the proposed algorithm relies solely on stochastic gradient information and does not require function value evaluations. The trust-region radius is adaptively adjusted based on a radius-control parameter and the stochastic gradient estimate. Under mild assumptions, we establish that the algorithm converges in expectation to a first-order stationary point. Moreover, the method achieves iteration and sample complexity bounds that match those of SVRG-based first-order methods, while allowing stochastic and potentially gradient-dependent second-order information. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that incorporating SVRG accelerates convergence, and that the use of trust-region methods and Hessian information further improves performance. We also highlight the impact of batch size and inner-loop length on efficiency, and show that the proposed method outperforms SGD and Adam on several machine learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Methods for Unknown Piecewise Smooth Problems I: Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an optimal and nearly parameter-free algorithm for minimizing piecewise smooth (PWS) convex functions under the quadratic growth (QG) condition, where the locations and structure of the smooth regions are entirely \textit{unknown}. Our algorithm, \apex{} (Accelerated Prox-Level method for Exploring Piecewise Smoothness), is an accelerated bundle-level method designed to adaptively exploit the underlying PWS structure. APEX enjoys optimal theoretical guarantees, achieving a tight oracle complexity bound that matches the lower bound established in this work for convex PWS optimization. Furthermore, APEX generates a verifiable and accurate termination certificate, enabling a robust, almost parameter-free implementation. To the best of our knowledge, APEX is the first algorithm to simultaneously achieve the optimal convergence rate for PWS optimization and provide certificate guarantees.</description>

      <title>A fast-pivoting algorithm for Whittle's restless bandit index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Whittle index for restless bandits (two-action semi-Markov decision processes) provides an intuitively appealing optimal policy for controlling a single generic project that can be active (engaged) or passive (rested) at each decision epoch, and which can change state while passive. It further provides a practical heuristic priority-index policy for the computationally intractable multi-armed restless bandit problem, which has been widely applied over the last three decades in multifarious settings, yet mostly restricted to project models with a one-dimensional state. This is due in part to the difficulty of establishing indexability (existence of the index) and of computing the index for projects with large state spaces. This paper draws on the author's prior results on sufficient indexability conditions and an adaptive-greedy algorithmic scheme for restless bandits to obtain a new fast-pivoting algorithm that computes the $n$ Whittle index values of an $n$-state restless bandit by performing, after an initialization stage, $n$ steps that entail $(2/3) n^3 + O(n^2)$ arithmetic operations. This algorithm also draws on the parametric simplex method, and is based on elucidating the pattern of parametric simplex tableaux, which allows to exploit special structure to substantially simplify and reduce the complexity of simplex pivoting steps. A numerical study demonstrates substantial runtime speed-ups versus alternative algorithms.</description>

      <title>MIQCP and MISOCP-Based Solution Methods for the Multi-Layer Thin Films Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Multi-Layer Thin Films Problem is a materials science problem that aims to enhance the reflectance of a metallic substrate by designing multi-layer coatings composed of different dielectric materials and thicknesses. While previous studies on the problem mostly rely on heuristic approaches and are designed for single wavelength applications, this work addresses the problem using global optimization techniques for multiple wavelengths. We develop an exact nonconvex mixed-integer quadratically constrained programming (MIQCP) model to solve this problem. We also develop a mixed-integer second-order cone programming relaxation that has computational advantage over the MIQCP model. Our numerical experiments yield solutions that have average reflectance of 99% over the visible spectrum (380-770 nm) and 95% over the broad spectrum (300-3000 nm).</description>

      <title>On Dimension Varying Control Systems: A Universal State Space Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cross-dimensional Euclidian space ($\Omega$) is proposed for the state space of dimension varying (control) systems. It is shown that the topological structure of $\Omega$ is consistent with all $\mathbb{R}^n$, which are the state spaces of each component modes of a dimension varying system. Using the universal metric from $\Omega$, the switching laws are assumed to be Lipschitz. Some reasonable conventional switching laws are proposed. Under the topology deduced by the metric on $\Omega$ some fundamental properties of dimension varying dynamic systems, such as stability and robustness, are investigated. Then some control problems of dimension varying control systems, including controllability, observability, stabilization, disturbance decoupling, etc. are investigated. Finally, an aggregation approach for large scale hierarchical dimension varying networks is proposed.</description>

      <title>Practical prescribed-time prescribed performance control with asymptotic convergence -- A vanishing sigma-modification approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a method capable of ensuring practical prescribed-time control with guaranteed performance for a class of nonlinear systems in the presence of time-varying parametric and dynamic uncertainties, and uncertain control coefficients. Our design consists of two key steps. First, we construct a performance-rate function that freezes at and after a user-specified time T, playing a crucial role in achieving desired precision within prescribed time T and dealing with unmodeled dynamics. Next, based on this function and a sigma-modification strategy in which the leakage term starts to vanish at t &gt; T, we develop an adaptive dynamic surface control framework to reduce control complexity, deal with uncertainties, ensure prescribed performance, practical prescribed-time convergence to a specific region, and ultimately achieve asymptotic convergence. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is validated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Biquadratic Cauchy Tensors and Spherical Biquadratic Polynomial Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses biquadratic polynomial programming (BPP), an NP-hard optimization problem closely related to biquadratic tensors. We first establish several necessary and sufficient conditions for the positive semi-definiteness and positive definiteness of biquadratic Cauchy tensors. Leveraging the structured properties of these tensors, we then prove that the BPP and its equivalent multilinear formulation share the same set of optimal solutions. This result allows us to establish the global sequence convergence of the proximal alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm via the Kurdyka- Lojasiewicz (KL) property, extending the analysis in [8]. Furthermore, by reformulating the equivalent multilinear problem as an unconstrained optimization model, we enable the analysis of its KL exponent and derive an explicit expression for the convergence rate of PAM. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on both biquadratic Cauchy tensors and general biquadratic tensor instances to evaluate the efficiency, stability, and practical performance of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>From carbon management strategies to implementation: Modeling and physical simulation of CO2 pipeline infrastructure -- a case study for Germany</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15090v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbon capture and storage or utilization (CCUS) will play an important role to achieve climate neutrality in many economies. Pipelines are widely regarded as the most efficient means of CO2 transport; however, they are currently non-existent. Policy-makers and companies need to develop large-scale infrastructure under substantial uncertainty. Methods and analyses are needed to support pipeline planning and strategy development. This paper presents an integrated method for designing CO2 pipeline networks by combining energy system scenarios with physical network simulation. Using Germany as a case study, we derive spatially highly resolved CO2 balances to develop a dense-phase CO2 pipeline topology that follows existing gas pipeline corridors. The analyzed system includes existing sites for cement and lime production, waste incineration, carbon users, four coastal CO2 hubs, and border crossing points. We then apply the multiphysical network simulator MYNTS to assess the technical feasibility of this network. We determine pipeline diameters, pump locations, and operating conditions that ensure stable dense-phase transport. The method explicitly accounts for elevation and possible impurities. The results indicate that a system of about 7000 km pipeline length and a mixed normed diameter of DN700 on main corridors and of DN500/DN400 on branches presents a feasible solution to connect most sites. Investment costs for the optimized pipeline system are calculated to be about 17 billion Euros. The method provides a reproducible framework and is transferable to other countries and to European scope.</description>

      <title>Federated Incremental Subgradient Method for Convex Bilevel Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we consider a bilevel optimization problem in which the outer-level objective function is strongly convex, whereas the inner-level problem consists of a finite sum of convex functions. Bilevel optimization problems arise in situations where the inner-level problem does not have a unique solution. This has led to the idea of introducing an outer-level objective function to select a solution with the specific desired properties. We propose an iterative method that combines an incremental algorithm with a broadcast algorithm, both based on the principles of federated learning. Under appropriate assumptions, we establish the convergence results of the proposed algorithm. To demonstrate its performance, we present two numerical examples related to binary classification and a location problem.</description>

      <title>Path-OED for infinite-dimensional Bayesian linear inverse problems governed by PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider infinite-dimensional Bayesian linear inverse problems governed by time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) and develop a mathematical and computational framework for optimal design of mobile sensor paths in this setting. The proposed path optimal experimental design (path-OED) framework is established rigorously in a function space setting and elaborated for the case of Bayesian c-optimality, which quantifies the posterior variance in a linear functional of the inverse parameter. The latter is motivated by goal-oriented formulations, where we seek to minimize the uncertainty in a scalar prediction of interest. To facilitate computations, we complement the proposed infinite-dimensional framework with discretized formulations, in suitably weighted finite-dimensional inner product spaces, and derive efficient methods for finding optimal sensor paths. The resulting computational framework is flexible, scalable, and can be adapted to a broad range of linear inverse problems and design criteria. We also present extensive computational experiments, for a model inverse problem constrained by an advection-diffusion equation, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Finite de Finetti for convex bodies and Polynomial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging a recently proposed notion of relative entropy in general probabilistic theories (GPT), we prove a finite de Finetti representation theorem for general convex bodies. We apply this result to address a fundamental question in polynomial optimization: the existence of a convergent outer hierarchy for problems with inequality constraints and analytical convergence guarantees. Our strategy generalizes a quantitative monogamy-of-entanglement argument from quantum theory to arbitrary convex bodies, establishing a uniform upper bound on mutual information in multipartite extensions. This leads to a finite de Finetti theorem and, subsequently, a convergent conic hierarchy for a wide class of polynomial optimization problems subject to both equality and inequality constraints. We further provide a constructive rounding scheme that yields certified interior points with controlled approximation error. As an application, we express the optimal GPT value of a two-player non-local game as a polynomial optimization problem, allowing our techniques to produce approximation schemes with finite convergence guarantees.</description>

      <title>Penalty-Based Smoothing of Convex Nonsmooth Supremum Functions with Accelerated Inertial Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a penalty-based smoothing framework for convex nonsmooth functions with a supremum structure. The regularization yields a differentiable surrogate with controlled approximation error, a single-valued dual maximizer, and explicit gradient formulas. We then study an accelerated inertial dynamic with vanishing damping driven by a time-dependent regularized function whose parameter decreases to zero. Under mild integrability and boundedness conditions on the regularization schedule, we establish an accelerated $\mathcal{O}(t^{-2})$ decay estimate for the regularized residual and, in the regime $\alpha&gt;3$, a sharper $o(t^{-2})$ decay together with weak convergence of trajectories to a minimizer of the original nonsmooth problem via an Opial-type argument. Applications to multiobjective optimization (through Chebyshev/max scalarization) and to distributionally robust optimization (via entropic regularization over ambiguity sets) illustrate the scope of the framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the $\mathcal W_\infty$ Wasserstein distance by the $\mathcal W_p$ Wasserstein distance is interesting both for theorical and numerical applications. A first paper on this problem was written several years ago [3]. Some year later [14] framed it in the same inequality for more general costs which increase with the distance. In this paper, we prove this type of inequality for optimal transport problems with pointwise cost which is a decreasing function of the distance. We show, in particular, that there is a general framework that encompasses all the cases above.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we are concerned about the velocity tracking optimal control problem for 3D critical convective Brinkman-Forchheimer equations defined on a simply connected bounded domain $\mathbb{D}\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ with $\mathrm{C}^2$-boundary $\partial\mathbb{D}$. The control is introduced through an external force. The objective is to optimally minimize a velocity tracking cost functional, for which the velocity vector field is oriented towards a target velocity. Most importantly, we are concerned about the first-order necessary optimality conditions for above-mentioned optimal control problem which is the main challenging task of this article. To overcome the difficulties related to the differentiability of the control-to-state mapping, consequence of the lack of regularity of the state variable on bounded domains, we first establish some intermediate optimality conditions and then pass to the limit.</description>

      <title>Automating Idealness Proofs for Binary Programs with Application to Rectangle Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integer program is called ideal if its continuous relaxation coincides with its convex hull allowing the problem to be solved as a continuous program and offering substantial computational advantages. Proving idealness analytically can be extraordinarily tedious -- even for small formulations -- such proofs often span many pages of intricate case analysis which motivates the development of automated verification methods. We develop a general-purpose framework for certifying idealness in Mixed Binary Linear Programs (MBLPs), formulating the verification problem as a linear program when the data is fixed and as a nonconvex quadratic program when the data is parametric. We apply this framework to study several formulations of the rectangle packing problem that are conjectured to be pairwise-ideal, obtaining computational proofs where analytic proofs were previously unknown or impractical. As our second contribution, we introduce and model a novel generalization of the rectangle packing problem that enforces edge clearances between selected rectangles. We present both existing and novel MBLP formulations which arise from different encodings of the underlying disjunctive constraints. We perform some computational experiments on these formulations under a strip-packing objective to determine the importance of pairwise-idealness in practice.</description>

      <title>p-Wasserstein distances on networks and 3D to 1D convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study transport distances on metric graphs representing gas networks. Starting from the dynamic formulation of the Wasserstein distance, we review extensions to networks, with and without the possibility of storing mass on the vertices.
  Next, we examine the asymptotic behavior of the static Wasserstein distance on a three-dimensional network domain that converges to a metric graph. We show convergence of the distance with a proof that is based on the characterization of optimal transport plans as $c$-cyclically monotone sets.
  We conclude by illustrating our finding with several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>All-Pass Fractional OPF: A Solver-Friendly, Physics-Preserving Approximation of AC OPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a fractional approximation of the AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem based on an all-pass approximation of the exponential power flow kernel. The classical AC OPF relies on trigonometric coupling between bus voltage phasors, which yields a nonconvex program with oscillatory derivatives that can slow, or in some cases destabilize, interior-point methods. We replace the trigonometric terms with an all-pass fractional (APF) approximation whose real and imaginary components act as smooth surrogates for the cosine and sine functions, and we introduce a pre-rotation to shift the argument of the approximation toward its most accurate region, ensuring that the reformulated power flow model preserves physical loss behavior, maintains the symmetry of the classical kernels, and improves the conditioning of the Jacobian and Hessian matrices. The proposed APF OPF formulation remains nonconvex, as in the classical model, but it eliminates trigonometric evaluations and empirically produces larger and more stable Newton steps under standard interior-point solvers. Numerical results on more than 25 IEEE and PGLib test systems ranging from 9 to 10{,}000 buses demonstrate that the APF OPF model achieves solutions with accuracy comparable to that of the classical formulation while reducing solver times, indicating a more solver-friendly nonconvex representation of AC OPF. All code, functions, verification scripts, and generated results are publicly available on \href{https://github.com/LSU-RAISE-LAB/APF-OPF}{GitHub}, along with a README describing how to run and reproduce the experiments.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Spot Instances for Time-Critical Cloud Workloads Using Optimal Randomized Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of deadline-aware online scheduling for jobs in hybrid cloud environments, where jobs may run on either cost-effective but unreliable spot instances or more expensive on-demand instances, under hard deadlines. We first establish a fundamental limit for existing (predominantly-) deterministic policies, proving a worst-case competitive ratio of $\Omega(K)$, where $K$ is the cost ratio between on-demand and spot instances. We then present a novel randomized scheduling algorithm, ROSS, that achieves a provably optimal competitive ratio of $\sqrt{K}$ under reasonable deadlines, significantly improving upon existing approaches. Extensive evaluations on real-world trace data from Azure and AWS demonstrate that ROSS effectively balances cost optimization and deadline guarantees, consistently outperforming the state-of-the-art by up to $30\%$ in cost savings, across diverse spot market conditions.</description>

      <title>Helmholtz transmission problem and intrinsic impedance scattering problem on extension domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a transmission problem for the Helmholtz equation across the boundary of an extension domain. A such boundary can be Lipschitz, fractal, or of varying Hausdorff dimension for instance. We generalise the notions of layer potential and Neumann-Poincar{\'e} operators, and of Calder{\'o}n projectors in that context. Those boundary operators allow to connect the transmission problem (on the whole space) to one-sided problems -- notably, scattering problems -- with Dirichlet, Neumann and Robin boundary conditions. Since an extension domain needs no specific boundary measure, the Robin (impedance) condition is not understood in a boundary L^2-type space, rather by duality on the trace space itself. We discuss the well-posedness of the impedance scattering problem in that framework and compare to the classical L^2 setting. Our analysis allows to generalise optimisation results for acoustic scattering when the obstacle is an extension domain in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Economic Warehouse Lot Scheduling: Approximation Schemes via Efficiently-Representable DP-Encoded Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this focused technical paper, we present long-awaited algorithmic advances toward the efficient construction of near-optimal replenishment policies for a true inventory management classic, the economic warehouse lot scheduling problem. While this paradigm has accumulated a massive body of surrounding literature since its inception in the late '50s, we are still very much in the dark as far as basic computational questions are concerned, perhaps due to the intrinsic complexity of dynamic policies in this context. The latter feature forced earlier attempts to either study highly-structured classes of policies or to forgo provably-good performance guarantees altogether; to this day, rigorously analyzable results have been few and far between.
  The current paper develops novel analytical foundations for directly competing against dynamic policies. Combined with further algorithmic progress and newly-gained insights, these ideas culminate in a polynomial-time approximation scheme for constantly-many commodities. In this regard, the efficient design of $\epsilon$-optimal dynamic policies appeared to have been out of reach, since beyond their inherent algorithmic challenges, even the polynomial-space representation of such policies has been a fundamental open question.</description>

      <title>Economic Warehouse Lot Scheduling: Breaking the 2-Approximation Barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The economic warehouse lot scheduling problem is a foundational inventory-theory model, capturing computational challenges in dynamically coordinating replenishment decisions for multiple commodities subject to a shared capacity constraint. Even though this model has generated a vast body of literature over the last six decades, our algorithmic understanding has remained surprisingly limited. Indeed, for general problem instances, the best-known approximation guarantees have remained at a factor of $2$ since the mid-1990s. These guarantees were attained by the now-classic work of Anily [Operations Research, 1991] and Gallego, Queyranne, and Simchi-Levi [Operations Research, 1996] via the highly-structured class of "stationary order sizes and stationary intervals" (SOSI) policies, thereby avoiding direct competition against fully dynamic policies.
  The main contribution of this paper resides in developing new analytical foundations and algorithmic techniques that enable such direct comparisons, leading to the first provable improvement over the $2$-approximation barrier. Leveraging these ideas, we design a constructive approach that allows us to balance cost and capacity at a finer granularity than previously possible via SOSI-based methods. Consequently, given any economic warehouse lot scheduling instance, we present a polynomial-time construction of a random capacity-feasible dynamic policy whose expected long-run average cost is within factor $2-\frac{17}{5000} + \epsilon$ of optimal.</description>

      <title>A Safe Approximation Based on Mixed-Integer Optimization for Non-Convex Distributional Robustness Governed by Univariate Indicator Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11185v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present an algorithmically tractable safe approximation of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) problems that contain univariate indicator functions. The latter appear in different applications, but render the model nonlinear and nonconvex. The considered ambiguity sets can exploit moment information. Typically, reformulation approaches using duality theory need to make strong assumptions on the structure of the underlying constraints, such as convexity in the decisions or concavity in the uncertainty which cannot be assumed in our setting. We nevertheless present an equivalent semi-infinite reformulation that is subsequently approximated by a discretized counterpart. Under mild assumptions, the latter provides a safe approximation that is formulated as a tractable mixed-integer linear problem, which can be solved by available standard software. Obtained solutions are guaranteed to be feasible for the original distributionally robust problem. Although we show that in general convergence to the true DRO problem cannot be expected, we furthermore prove that the approximation of the adversarial problem indeed converges to its true value for increasingly fine discretization. On the practical side, the approach is made concrete for a challenging, fundamental task in material design, namely in particle separation. Computational results for a realistic setting show that the safe approximation yields robust solutions of high-quality and can be computed within short time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sample average approximation (SAA) is a technique for obtaining approximate solutions to stochastic programs that uses the average from a random sample to approximate the expected value that is being optimized. Since the outcome from solving an SAA is random, statistical estimates on the optimal value of the true problem can be obtained by solving multiple SAA replications with independent samples. We study techniques to accelerate the solution of this set of SAA replications, when solving them sequentially via Benders decomposition. We investigate how to exploit similarities in the problem structure, as the replications just differ in the realizations of the random samples. Our extensive computational experiments provide empirical evidence that our techniques for using information from solving previous replications can significantly reduce the solution time of later replications.</description>

      <title>Nonnegative Low-rank Matrix Recovery Can Have Spurious Local Minima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-rank matrix recovery is well-known to exhibit benign nonconvexity under the restricted isometry property (RIP): every second-order critical point is globally optimal, so local methods provably recover the ground truth. Motivated by the strong empirical performance of projected gradient methods for nonnegative low-rank recovery problems, we investigate whether this benign geometry persists when the factor matrices are constrained to be elementwise nonnegative. In the simple setting of a rank-1 nonnegative ground truth, we confirm that benign nonconvexity holds in the fully-observed case with RIP constant $\delta=0$. This benign nonconvexity, however, is unstable. It fails to extend to the partially-observed case with any arbitrarily small RIP constant $\delta&gt;0$, and to higher-rank ground truths $r^{\star}&gt;1$, regardless of how much the search rank $r\ge r^{\star}$ is overparameterized. Together, these results undermine the standard stability-based explanation for the empirical success of nonconvex methods and suggest that fundamentally different tools are needed to analyze nonnegative low-rank recovery.</description>

      <title>New Perspectives on the Polyak Stepsize: Surrogate Functions and Negative Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Polyak stepsize has been proven to be a fundamental stepsize in convex optimization, giving near optimal gradient descent rates across a wide range of assumptions. The universality of the Polyak stepsize has also inspired many stochastic variants, with theoretical guarantees and strong empirical performance. Despite the many theoretical results, our understanding of the convergence properties and shortcomings of the Polyak stepsize or its variants is both incomplete and fractured across different analyses. We propose a new, unified, and simple perspective for the Polyak stepsize and its variants as gradient descent on a surrogate loss. We show that each variant is equivalent to minimize a surrogate function with stepsizes that adapt to a guaranteed local curvature. Our general surrogate loss perspective is then used to provide a unified analysis of existing variants across different assumptions. Moreover, we show a number of negative results proving that the non-convergence results in some of the upper bounds is indeed real.</description>

Abstract: We study the generalized forward-reflected-backward (GFRB) method, an extension of the forward-reflected-backward (FRB) scheme due to Malitsky and Tam, for solving monotone inclusion problems in real Hilbert spaces. We first analyze GFRB equipped with a non-decreasing step-size rule that does not require prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of the operator involved. We then present two illustrative examples: in the first, we show that the convergence rate of GFRB is bounded from below by that of FRB, and in the second, we obtain an improved convergence rate for GFRB via an appropriate choice of initial parameters. In the sequel, we propose an extended primal-dual twice-reflected (PDTR) algorithm and show that it can be recovered from GFRB under suitable metric selections. Finally, we validate the proposed approach on several state-of-the-art problems and demonstrate better numerical performance compared to the existing ones.</description>

      <title>Global convergence of the subgradient method for robust signal recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the subgradient method for factorized robust signal recovery problems, including robust PCA, robust phase retrieval, and robust matrix sensing. The resulting objectives are nonsmooth and nonconvex, and can have unbounded sublevel sets, so standard analyses based on descent and coercivity do not apply. For locally Lipschitz semialgebraic objectives, we develop a convergence framework that replaces these requirements with a boundedness condition on continuous-time subgradient trajectories. Under this condition and sufficiently small step sizes of order $1/k$, we show that iterates of the subgradient method remain bounded and the full sequence converges to a critical point. We then verify the required boundedness property for the three robust objectives by adapting existing trajectory analyses, assuming a mild nondegeneracy condition in the matrix sensing case. Finally, for rank-one symmetric robust PCA, we prove that for almost every initialization, the method cannot converge to spurious critical points; consequently, under the same step-size regime, it converges to a global minimum.</description>

      <title>Deceptive Sequential Decision-Making via Regularized Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous systems are increasingly expected to operate in the presence of adversaries, though adversaries may infer sensitive information simply by observing a system. Therefore, present a deceptive sequential decision-making framework that not only conceals sensitive information, but actively misleads adversaries about it. We model autonomous systems as Markov decision processes, with adversaries using inverse reinforcement learning to recover reward functions. To counter them, we present three regularization strategies for policy synthesis problems that actively deceive an adversary about a system's reward. ``Diversionary deception'' leads an adversary to draw any false conclusion about the system's reward function. ``Targeted deception'' leads an adversary to draw a specific false conclusion about the system's reward function. ``Equivocal deception'' leads an adversary to infer that the real reward and a false reward both explain the system's behavior. We show how each form of deception can be implemented in policy optimization problems and analytically bound the loss in total accumulated reward induced by deception. Next, we evaluate these developments in a multi-agent setting. We show that diversionary, targeted, and equivocal deception all steer the adversary to false beliefs while still attaining a total accumulated reward that is at least 98% of its optimal, non-deceptive value.</description>

      <title>Target search optimization by threshold resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of first passage time optimization driven by threshold resetting, inspired by many natural processes where crossing a critical limit triggers failure, degradation or transition. In here, search agents are collectively reset when a threshold is reached, creating event-driven, system-coupled simultaneous resets that induce long-range interactions. We develop a unified framework to compute search times for these correlated stochastic processes, with ballistic- and diffusive searchers as key examples uncovering diverse optimization behaviors. A cost function, akin to breakdown penalties, reveals that optimal resetting can forestall larger losses. This formalism generalizes to broader stochastic systems with multiple degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Collision Probability Estimation for Optimization-based Vehicular Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21161v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many motion planning algorithms for automated driving require estimating the probability of collision (POC) to account for uncertainties in the measurement and estimation of the motion of road users. Common POC estimation techniques often utilize sampling-based methods that suffer from computational inefficiency and a non-deterministic estimation, i.e., each estimation result for the same inputs is slightly different. In contrast, optimization-based motion planning algorithms require computationally efficient POC estimation, ideally using deterministic estimation, such that typical optimization algorithms for motion planning retain feasibility. Estimating the POC analytically, however, is challenging because it depends on understanding the collision conditions (e.g., vehicle's shape) and characterizing the uncertainty in motion prediction. In this paper, we propose an approach in which we estimate the POC between two vehicles by over-approximating their shapes by a multi-circular shape approximation. The position and heading of the predicted vehicle are modelled as random variables, contrasting with the literature, where the heading angle is often neglected. We guarantee that the provided POC is an over-approximation, which is essential in providing safety guarantees. For the particular case of Gaussian uncertainty in the position and heading, we present a computationally efficient algorithm for computing the POC estimate. This algorithm is then used in a path-following stochastic model predictive controller (SMPC) for motion planning. With the proposed algorithm, the SMPC generates reproducible trajectories while the controller retains its feasibility in the presented test cases and demonstrates the ability to handle varying levels of uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A mean field game model with non-local spatial interactions and resources accumulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01200v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a family of mean field games arising in modeling the behavior of strategic economic agents which move across space maximizing their utility from consumption and have the possibility to accumulate resources for production (such as human capital). The resulting mean field game PDE system is not covered in the actual literature on the topic as it displays weaker assumptions on the regularity of the data (in particular global Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of the objective are lost), state constraints, and a non-standard interaction term. We obtain a first result on the existence of solution of the mean field game PDE system.</description>

      <title>Optimal phase change for a generalized Grover's algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized Grover's algorithm with an arbitrary amplitude vector to find the optimal phase change for maximizing the gain in probability for the target of each iteration. In the classic setting of Grover's algorithm with a real initial amplitude vector, we find that a phase change of $\pi$ stays optimal until the probability of observing the target is quite close to 1. We provide a formula for identifying this cut-off point based on the size of the data set. When the amplitude is truly complex, we find that the optimal phase change depends non-trivially on the complexity of the amplitude vector. We provide an optimization formula to identify the required optimal phase change.</description>

      <title>Computation of attractor dimension and maximal sums of Lyapunov exponents using polynomial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14870v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two approaches are presented for computing upper bounds on Lyapunov exponents and their sums, and on the Lyapunov dimension, among all trajectories of a dynamical system governed by ordinary differential equations. The first approach expresses a sum of Lyapunov exponents as a time average in an augmented dynamical system and then applies methods for bounding time averages. This generalizes the method of Oeri \&amp; Goluskin (Nonlinearity 36:5378--5400, 2023) for bounding the single largest Lyapunov exponent. The second approach considers a different augmented dynamical system, where bounds on sums of Lyapunov exponents are implied by stability of certain sets, and such stability is verified using Lyapunov function methods. Both of our approaches also can be adapted to directly compute bounds on Lyapunov dimension, which in turn imply bounds on the fractal dimension of a global attractor. For systems of ordinary differential equations with polynomial right-hand sides, all of our bounding formulations lead to polynomial optimization problems with sum-of-squares constraints. These sum-of-squares problems can be solved computationally for a chosen system to yield numerical bounds, provided the number of variables and degree of polynomials are not prohibitive. Most of our bounding formulations are proved to be sharp under mild assumptions. In the case of the polynomial optimization problems, sharpness means that upper bounds converge to the quantities being bounded as polynomial degrees are raised. Computational examples demonstrate upper bounds that are sharp to several digits, including for a six-dimensional dynamical system where sums of Lyapunov exponents are maximized on periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Extended-Krylov-subspace methods for trust-region and norm-regularization subproblems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an effective new method for solving trust-region and norm-regularization problems that arise as subproblems in many optimization applications. We show that the solutions to such subproblems lie on a manifold of approximately very low rank as a function of their controlling parameters (trust-region radius or regularization weight). Based on this, we build a basis for this manifold using an efficient extended-Krylov-subspace iteration that involves a single matrix factorization. The problems within the subspace using such a basis may be solved at very low cost using effective high-order root-finding methods. This then provides an alternative to common methods using multiple factorizations or standard Krylov subspaces. We provide numerical results to illustrate the effectiveness of our {\tt TREK}/{\tt NREK} approach.</description>

      <title>On Viscosity Solutions of Hamilton-Jacobi Equations in the Wasserstein space and the Vanishing Viscosity Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this article is twofold. First, we develop a unified framework for viscosity solutions to both first-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations and semilinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations driven by the idiosyncratic operator, defined on the Wasserstein Space. Second, we establish a vanishing-viscosity limit-extending beyond the classical control-theoretic setting-for solutions of semilinear Hamilton-Jacobi equations, proving their convergence to the corresponding first-order solution as the idiosyncratic noise vanishes. Our approach provides an optimal convergence rate. We also present some results of independent interest. These include existence theorems for the first-order equation, obtained through an appropriate Hopf-Lax representation, and a useful description of the action of the idiosyncratic operator on geodesically convex functions.</description>

      <title>A Constraint Programming Model for the Super-Agile Earth Observation Satellite Imaging Scheduling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the dependence on satellite imaging continues to grow, modern satellites have become increasingly agile, with the new generation, namely super-agile Earth observation satellites (SAEOS), providing unprecedented imaging flexibility. The highly dynamic capabilities of these satellites introduce additional challenges to the scheduling of observation tasks, as existing approaches for conventional agile satellites do not account for variable observation durations and multiple imaging directions. Although some efforts have been made in this regard, the SAEOS imaging scheduling problem (SAEOS-ISP) remains largely unexplored, and no exact approaches have yet been proposed. In this context, this study presents the first exact Constraint Programming formulation for the SAEOS-ISP, considering flexible observation windows, multiple pointing directions and sequence-dependent transition times across multiple satellites. Computational experiments on a newly generated benchmark set demonstrate that the model can be solved efficiently and within very short computational times. Moreover, the results also show that the proposed approach has the potential to achieve higher computational performance compared to the non-exact approaches that are currently considered state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>On the Provable Suboptimality of Momentum SGD in Nonstationary Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While momentum-based acceleration has been studied extensively in deterministic optimization problems, its behavior in nonstationary environments -- where the data distribution and optimal parameters drift over time -- remains underexplored. We analyze the tracking performance of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and its momentum variants (Polyak heavy-ball and Nesterov) under uniform strong convexity and smoothness in varying stepsize regimes. We derive finite-time bounds in expectation and with high probability for the tracking error, establishing a sharp decomposition into three components: a transient initialization term, a noise-induced variance term, and a drift-induced tracking lag. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a fundamental trade-off: while momentum can suppress gradient noise, it incurs an explicit penalty on the tracking capability. We show that momentum can substantially amplify drift-induced tracking error, with amplification that becomes unbounded as the momentum parameter approaches one, formalizing the intuition that using 'stale' gradients hinders adaptation to rapid regime shifts. Complementing these upper bounds, we establish minimax lower bounds for dynamic regret under gradient-variation constraints. These lower bounds prove that the inertia-induced penalty is not an artifact of analysis but an information-theoretic barrier: in drift-dominated regimes, momentum creates an unavoidable 'inertia window' that fundamentally degrades performance. Collectively, these results provide a definitive theoretical grounding for the empirical instability of momentum in dynamic environments and delineate the precise regime boundaries where SGD provably outperforms its accelerated counterparts.</description>
