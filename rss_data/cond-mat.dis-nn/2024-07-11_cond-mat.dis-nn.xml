      <title>Statistical mechanics of transfer learning in fully-connected networks in the proportional limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer learning (TL) is a well-established machine learning technique to boost the generalization performance on a specific (target) task using information gained from a related (source) task, and it crucially depends on the ability of a network to learn useful features. Leveraging recent analytical progress in the proportional regime of deep learning theory (i.e. the limit where the size of the training set $P$ and the size of the hidden layers $N$ are taken to infinity keeping their ratio $\alpha = P/N$ finite), in this work we develop a novel single-instance Franz-Parisi formalism that yields an effective theory for TL in fully-connected neural networks. Unlike the (lazy-training) infinite-width limit, where TL is ineffective, we demonstrate that in the proportional limit TL occurs due to a renormalized source-target kernel that quantifies their relatedness and determines whether TL is beneficial for generalization.</description>

      <title>A Very Effective and Simple Diffusion Reconstruction for the Diluted Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models are machine learning models that use diffusion processes to learn the probability distribution of high-dimensional data. In recent years, they have become extremely successful in generating multimedia content. However, it is still unknown if such models can be used to generate high-quality datasets of physical models. In this work, we use a Landau-Ginzburg-like diffusion model to infer the distribution of a $2D$ bond-diluted Ising model. Our approach is simple and effective, and we show that the generated samples reproduce correctly the statistical and critical properties of the physical model.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Asymmetry in Density within the Shear Bands of Metallic Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plastic deformation in metallic glasses at room temperature leads to the development of shear bands due to shear localization. In many experiments, shear bands have shown local density variations along their path, with a distinct imbalance in magnitude between local densification and dilation. However, a comprehensive mechanistic understanding or theory to explain this asymmetry has been lacking until now. Here, we introduce a new model that consists of a sequential arrangement of alternating topological 'charges', generating a dipolar field. The resulting microscopic displacement field, when integrated into the deformation gradient tensor, provides an accurate analytical solution for the observed imbalances in the density variations. The implications of this method are discussed, highlighting the potential to elucidate a broader range of observations in shear bands.</description>

      <title>Impact of dendritic non-linearities on the computational capabilities of neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple neurophysiological experiments have shown that dendritic non-linearities can have a strong influence on synaptic input integration. In this work we model a single neuron as a two-layer computational unit with non-overlapping sign-constrained synaptic weights and a biologically plausible form of dendritic non-linearity, which is analytically tractable using statistical physics methods. Using both analytical and numerical tools, we demonstrate several key computational advantages of non-linear dendritic integration with respect to models with linear synaptic integration. We find that the dendritic non-linearity concurrently enhances the number of possible learned input-output associations and the learning velocity, and we characterize how capacity and learning speed depend on the implemented non-linearity and the levels of dendritic and somatic inhibition. We find that experimentally observed connection probabilities naturally emerge in neurons with sign-constrained synapses as a consequence of non-linear dendritic integration, while in models with linear integration, an additional robustness parameter must be introduced in order to reproduce realistic connection probabilities. Non-linearly induced sparsity comes with a second central advantage for neuronal information processing, i.e. input and synaptic noise robustness. By testing our model on standard real-world benchmark datasets inspired by deep learning practice, we observe empirically that the non-linearity provides an enhancement in generalization performance, showing that it enables to capture more complex input/output relations.</description>

      <title>Inverse modeling of time-delayed interactions via the dynamic-entropy formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although instantaneous interactions are unphysical, a large variety of maximum entropy statistical inference methods match the model-inferred and the empirically-measured equal-time correlation functions. Focusing on collective motion of active units, this constraint is reasonable when the interaction timescale is much faster than that of the interacting units, as in starling flocks, yet it fails in a number of counter examples, as in leukocyte coordination (where signalling proteins diffuse among two cells). Here, we relax this assumption and develop a path integral approach to maximum-entropy framework, which includes delay in signalling. Our method is able to infer the strength of couplings and fields, but also the time required by the couplings to completely transfer information among the units. We demonstrate the validity of our approach providing excellent results on synthetic datasets of non-Markovian trajectories generated by the Heisenberg-Kuramoto and Vicsek models equipped with delayed interactions. As a proof of concept, we also apply the method to experiments on dendritic migration, where matching equal-time correlations results in a significant information loss.</description>

      <title>Absence of quantization in the circular photogalvanic effect in disordered chiral Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The circularly polarized photogalvanic effect (CPGE) is studied in chiral Weyl semimetals with short-ranged quenched disorder. Without disorder, the topological properties of chiral Weyl semimetals lead to the quantization of the CPGE, which is a second-order optical response. Using a combination of diagrammatic perturbation theory in the continuum and exact numerical calculations via the kernel polynomial method on a lattice model we show that disorder perturbatively destabilizes the quantization of the CPGE.</description>
