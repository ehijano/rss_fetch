      <title>The $^{18}$O$(p,n)^{18}$F Reaction as a Quasi-stellar Neutron Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The s-process in AGB stars produces elements with atomic mass numbers $A\gtrsim60$ through successive neutron captures and beta decays. In stellar environments where the s-process occurs, neutrons quickly thermalize, adopting a Maxwell-Boltzmann energy distribution determined by the local temperature independent of their production via ($\alpha$,n) reactions. Laboratory experiments reproduce this Maxwell-Boltzmann neutron energy spectrum using (p, n) reactions. Specifically, the 7Li(p,n)7Be reaction is commonly employed to measure s-process cross-sections at kT$\approx$25 keV. Expanding the range of reactions used for measuring neutron-induced s-process cross-sections can offer valuable insights into the s-process in AGB stars. One such reaction is 18O(p,n)18F, which can be used to mimic s-process cross-sections, as its neutron energy distribution is similar to the thermal flux distribution at the stellar environment where the 13C($\alpha$,n)16O reaction (kT = 8 keV) takes place. Heil et al. showed that the neutron energy spectrum emitted from the 18O(p,n)18F reaction at proton energy of Ep = 2582 keV, close to the reaction threshold of 2574 keV, closely resembles a Maxwellian flux with kT$\approx$5 keV. This experiment was repeated at PTB and a computational tool, OxyGen, was created to calculate the expected neutron energy spectrum and angular distribution at a planned liquid water-based 18O target at SARAF. OxyGen was incorporated into Geant4 transport simulations, which were compared to experimental results. Overall, the findings of this thesis demonstrate that the OxyGen simulation provides a reliable prediction of the neutron energy spectrum for the 18O(p,n)18F reaction and can be effectively used to plan and analyze future experiments at SARAF for different proton energies.</description>

      <title>Searching for new physics with $^{136}$Xe double beta decay spectrum in PandaX-4T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The continuous spectrum of double beta decay ($\beta\beta$) provides a sensitive probe to test the predictions of the Standard Model and to search for signatures of new physics beyond it. We present a comprehensive analysis of the $^{136}$Xe $\beta\beta$ spectrum utilizing $37.8 \pm 0.6$ kg$\cdot$yr of $^{136}$Xe exposure from the PandaX-4T experiment. The analysis yields the most precise measurement to date of the $^{136}$Xe two-neutrino double beta decay ($2\nu\beta\beta$) half-life, $(2.14 \pm 0.05) \times 10^{21}$ years, the uncertainty of which is reduced by a factor of two compared to our previous result. We measure the parameter $\xi_{31}^{2\nu}$, defined as the ratio between the subleading and leading components of the $^{136}$Xe $2\nu\beta\beta$ nuclear matrix element, to be $0.59^{+0.41}_{-0.38}$, which is consistent with theoretical predictions. We also search for Majoron-emitting modes of $^{136}$Xe $\beta\beta$, establishing the most stringent limit for the spectral index $n=7$.</description>

      <title>First Study of the Nuclear Response to Fast Hadrons via Angular Correlations between Pions and Slow Protons in Electron-Nucleus Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the first measurement of angular correlations between high-energy pions and slow protons in electron-nucleus ($eA$) scattering, providing a new probe of how a nucleus responds to a fast-moving quark. The experiment employed the CLAS detector with a 5-GeV electron beam incident on deuterium, carbon, iron, and lead targets. For heavier nuclei, the pion-proton correlation function is more spread-out in azimuth than for lighter ones, and this effect is more pronounced in the $\pi p$ channel than in earlier $\pi\pi$ studies. The proton-to-pion yield ratio likewise rises with nuclear mass, although the increase appears to saturate for the heaviest targets. These trends are qualitatively reproduced by state-of-the-art $eA$ event generators, including BeAGLE, eHIJING, and GiBUU, indicating that current descriptions of target fragmentation rest on sound theoretical footing. At the same time, the precision of our data exposes model-dependent discrepancies, delineating a clear path for future improvements in the treatment of cold-nuclear matter effects in $eA$ scattering.</description>

      <title>Search for the $Y(2175)$ in the photoproduction cross section measurement of $\gamma p \to \phi \pi^{+} \pi^{-} p$ at GlueX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on 334 pb$^{-1}$ of photoproduction data collected with the GlueX detector at Jefferson Lab, we have measured for the first time the cross section of the exclusive reaction $\gamma + p \to \phi(1020) \pi^+\pi^- p$ by reconstructing the final state $K^+K^- \pi^+\pi^- p$ produced with a photon beam of energies between $8.0 {\rm GeV}$ and $11.6 {\rm GeV}$. Based on the measured differential cross section, we have performed a search for the strangeonium-like exotic candidate $Y(2175)$, recently renamed to $\phi(2170)$. This state has been reported by different $e^+e^-$ annihilation experiments and it is addressed here for the first time in a photoproduction experiment. We do not find evidence for this state when using the resonance parameters quoted by the Particle Data Group and provide upper limits on the photoproduction cross section. Instead, we find a structure at a mass of $m(\phi\pi^+\pi^-)= 2.24$ GeV/$c^2$ with a statistical significance of about 5 $\sigma$. The parameters of this structure differ from those quoted by the Particle Data Group for the $\phi(2170)$ and are consistent with a previous observation in $e^+e^-$ annihilation. In addition, there is evidence for a second structure at 1.82 GeV/$c^2$.</description>

      <title>Nucleon Short-Range Correlations and High-Momentum Dynamics: Implications on the Equation of State of Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleon short-range correlations (SRCs) and their high-momentum tails (HMTs) encode key short-range dynamics in nuclei and dense matter. This review provides a concise overview of SRC features relevant to the Equation of State (EOS) of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter. We summarize empirical and theoretical properties of the single-nucleon momentum distribution $n(k)$, emphasizing the role of the neutron--proton tensor force, the dominance of correlated np pairs, and the enhancement of minority-species HMTs. Links to nucleon effective E-masses, quasi-deuteron components, and orbital entanglement are briefly noted. We examine how SRC-induced HMTs modify kinetic and potential contributions to the EOS in both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks, including the softening of the kinetic symmetry energy and departures from the isospin parabolic approximation of asymmetric nuclear EOS. Sensitivity to high-momentum components and generalizations to arbitrary dimensions are also highlighted. Implications for heavy-ion reactions are summarized, including effects on particle yields, collective flows, deeply sub-threshold particle production and hard photon emission, driven by modified initial nucleon momentum distributions and abundant high relative-momentum np pairs during the reaction. Finally, we outline SRC-HMT consequences for neutron-star matter, covering proton fractions, tidal deformabilities, $Z$-factors, cooling, and the core--crust transition, as well as possible connections to dark-matter interactions in dense environments.</description>

      <title>Exploring the QCD phase diagram through correlations and fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram is a central goal of relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments. This review focuses on the role of fluctuations and correlations as sensitive probes of the phase structure. We discuss theoretical advancements and experimental methodologies employed to map the QCD phase diagram, highlighting constraints derived from both lattice QCD calculations and existing experimental data. Key observables such as cumulants and factorial cumulants of conserved charges (e.g., net-proton, net-charge) are explored as promising signatures of phase transitions and the QCD critical point. We discuss how these quantities are measured experimentally and compared with theoretical predictions, addressing challenges and best practices for meaningful comparisons. Special attention is given to predictions and current experimental results at high baryon density, including recent findings from the STAR collaboration at RHIC. Finally, we identify open issues and future directions for fluctuation and correlation studies at lower collision energies, relevant for future measurements, for example by the CBM experiment.</description>

      <title>Nucleon to Roper transition amplitudes and electromagnetic form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second excitation of the nucleon, the Roper, has properties differentiated from other low-lying nucleon resonances. Their properties challenge our understanding of the structure of the baryons in terms of the degrees of freedom from QCD. In the present work we discuss the properties of the Roper resonance and the nucleon to Roper electromagnetic transition, based on the quark degrees of freedom, that are expected to dominate for large square momentum transfer $Q^2$. We also discuss the analytic structure of the transition amplitudes in the low-$Q^2$ region, and how the contributions of baryon-meson states can help to describe the low and intermediate $Q^2$ data, and the nature of the Roper.</description>

      <title>Complex-energy eigenvector continuation for nuclear many-body broad resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Broad resonances are a unique phenomenon in nuclear many-body systems. Theoretical studies usually involve the continuum degree of freedom, which drastically increases the model space of calculations, and may lead to non-convergence or instability of computations. In this paper, we present the extension of the eigenvector continuation (EC) method to the complex-energy space to treat the broad resonances of open quantum systems of nuclei. EC provides an efficient method to predict the solution of a large-space many-body problem within a small subspace. Using only a few bound and narrow resonance solutions as input in EC, we can obtain the solution of a broad resonance. We have applied the complex-energy EC to the broad resonances of $^4$H, four-neutron $^4n$, $^6$He and $^7$He systems.</description>

      <title>Study of the reaction $\Xi^{0}n\rightarrow\Lambda\Lambda X$ using $\Xi^{0}$-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using $(10087\pm44)\times10^{6}$$J/\psi$ events collected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring in $2009$, $2012$, $2018$, and $2019$, we perform a search for the reaction $\Xi^0n\rightarrow\Lambda\Lambda X$, where $X$ denotes any additional final particles. Given the highly suppressed phase space for producing extra pions, the $X$ consists of either nothing or a photon, corresponding to the processes $\Xi^0 n \rightarrow \Lambda\Lambda$ and $\Xi^{0}n\rightarrow\Lambda\Sigma^0\rightarrow\Lambda\Lambda\gamma$. The $\Xi^0$ comes from the decay of $J/\psi\rightarrow\Xi^0\bar{\Xi}^0$, while the neutron originates from material of the beam pipe. A signal is observed for the first time with a statistical significance of 6.4$\sigma$. The cross section for the reaction $\Xi^0+{^9\rm{Be}}\rightarrow\Lambda+\Lambda+X$ is measured to be $(43.6\pm10.5_{\text{stat}}\pm11.1_{\text{syst}})$ mb at $P_{\Xi^0}\approx0.818$ GeV/$c$, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second systematic. No significant $H$-dibaryon signal is observed in the $\Lambda\Lambda$ final state.</description>

      <title>Nuclear excitation functions for medical isotope production: targeted radionuclide therapy via natIr(d,x)193mPt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 193mPt is an Auger emitting radionuclide which may have therapeutic potential, particularly when labeled to the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin. One challenge to broader explorations of its clinical potential is the need for production routes with high specific activity. As part of a larger campaign to address gaps in reaction data for emerging medical radionuclides, this work seeks to characterize the natIr(d,x) reactions as a potential production pathway for 193mPt. A stacked target irradiation, consisting of natural iridium, iron, nickel, and copper foils, was performed using a 33 MeV deuteron beam at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory 88-Inch Cyclotron. This measurement, along with previous experimental data, suggests an energy window between 11 to 18 MeV to maximize the production and radiopurity of 193mPt. This experiment has yielded cross sections for 43 channels of deuteron-induced reactions from threshold to 30 MeV, including the first experimental results of natIr(d,x)188m1+g,190m1+gIr (cumulative), natNi(d,x)56,57,58m,58gCo (independent), natCu(d,x)61Co (cumulative) and natFe(d,x)53Fe, 48V (cumulative). The results were compared with literature data, the TENDL-2023 database, and default theoretical calculations from the TALYS-2.04, CoH-3.6.0, EMPIRE-3.2.3, and ALICE-2020 reaction modeling codes. This work presents another example of the lack of predictive capabilities for this set of modern nuclear-reaction modeling codes, and highlights the unsatisfactory modeling of experimental cross sections. Experimental data are important to improve the codes in general, and new experimental results can be used to improve the models. Finally, this measurement has revealed the need for an updated evaluation of the natCu(d,x)63Zn deuteron monitor reaction.</description>

      <title>Shape evolution in neutron-rich odd-even $^{105-109}$Nb isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron-rich nuclei around $Z\sim40$ exhibit multiple shape transitions. This region shows one of the sharpest transitions in the nuclear chart, from a spherical vibrator at $N=58$ to a strongly deformed prolate shape at $N=60$, with largest deformations seen for $_{38}$Sr and $_{40}$Zr. Below $Z=36$, a spherical-to-oblate transition is predicted, while above $Z=42$ and $N\ge60$, the shape evolves from axial to triaxial. Even-$Z$ nuclei have been well studied, but odd-$Z$ isotopes such as Nb offer additional insights into these mechanisms. The Nb isotopes lie at the boundary between axially deformed Zr and triaxially deformed Mo nuclei. This work explores the structure of neutron-rich Nb nuclei up to $N=68$, aiming to understand shape evolution with isospin and the onset of triaxiality. Two complementary fission experiments were used: (i) $^{238}$U+$^9$Be at GANIL in inverse kinematics with AGATA, EXOGAM, and VAMOS++, allowing prompt and delayed $\gamma$-ray spectroscopy with isotopic identification; (ii) spontaneous fission of $^{252}$Cf with the Gammasphere array providing high-fold $\gamma$-coincidence data. The level scheme of $^{105}$Nb was significantly extended with two new negative-parity bands. A revised scheme is proposed for $^{107}$Nb, differing from previous results, and new structures are reported in $^{109}$Nb. The signature splitting analysis indicates triaxial deformation for positive-parity bands, while negative-parity bands show axial symmetry, similar to Zr. This reveals a shape coexistence in neutron-rich Nb nuclei.</description>

      <title>Extraction of neutron-capture cross sections on $^{92}$Zr using the charge-exchange Oslo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $^{93}$Nb($t$,$^{3}$He) reaction at 115 MeV/u was studied to demonstrate that nuclear level densities and $\gamma$-ray strength functions can be extracted from charge-exchange reactions at intermediate energies using the Oslo technique. The matrix of excitation energy in $^{93}$Zr, reconstructed from the ($t$,$^{3}$He) reaction, versus the energy of $\gamma$ rays emitted by the excited $^{93}$Zr nuclei, was obtained in an experiment with the S800 Spectrograph operated in coincidence with the GRETINA $\gamma$-ray detector. The extracted level density and $\gamma$-ray strength function obtained by applying the Oslo method to this matrix were used to estimate the $^{92}$Zr($n$,$\gamma$)$^{93}$Zr cross section by combining the new results with other experimental data and theoretical calculations for $E$1 and $M$1 strength functions at higher energies. Good agreement with direct measurements of the $^{92}$Zr($n$,$\gamma$)$^{93}$Zr cross section was found. The contribution from the upbend in the extracted $\gamma$-ray strength function was important to achieve the consistency as the neutron-capture cross section without this contribution is significantly below the direct measurements otherwise. Since charge-exchange reactions at intermediate energies have long been used for extracting Gamow-Teller strengths, the successful demonstration of the charge-exchange Oslo method enables experiments in which ($n$,$\gamma$) cross sections and Gamow-Teller strengths can be measured simultaneously, which is of benefit for astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Calculations of the Carbon and Oxygen Isotopes: Energies, Correlations, and Superfluid Pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform \textit{ab initio} nuclear lattice calculations of the neutron-rich carbon and oxygen isotopes using high-fidelity chiral interactions. We find good agreement with the observed binding energies and compute correlations associated with each two-nucleon interaction channel. For the isospin $T=1$ channels, we show that the dependence on $T_z$ provides a measure of the correlations among the extra neutrons in the neutron-rich nuclei. For the spin-singlet S-wave channel, we observe that any paired neutron interacts with the nuclear core as well as its neutron pair partner, while any unpaired neutron interacts primarily with only the nuclear core. For the other partial waves, the correlations among the extra neutrons grow more slowly and smoothly with the number of neutrons. These general patterns are observed in both the carbon and oxygen isotopes and may be universal features that appear in many neutron-rich nuclei.</description>
