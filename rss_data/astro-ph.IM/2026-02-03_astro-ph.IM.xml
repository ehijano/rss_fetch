      <title>aurel: A Python package for automatic relativistic calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \texttt{aurel} is an open-source Python package designed to \emph{au}tomatically calculate \emph{rel}ativistic quantities. It uses an efficient, flexible and user-friendly caching and dependency-tracking system, ideal for managing the highly nonlinear nature of general relativity. The package supports both symbolic and numerical calculations. The symbolic part extends \texttt{SymPy} with additional tensorial calculations. The numerical part computes a wide range of tensorial quantities, such as curvature, matter kinematics and much more, directly from any spacetime and matter data arrays using finite-difference methods. Inputs can be either generated from analytical expressions or imported from Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations, with helper functions provided to read in data from standard NR codes. Given the increasing use of NR, \texttt{aurel} offers a timely post-processing tool to support the popularisation of this field.</description>

      <title>Model-Agnostic Population Inference for Gravitational-Wave Astronomy: From LIGO to LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring the intrinsic population of compact binary mergers is complicated by detector selection biases and measurement uncertainties. Traditional parametric methods are limited by the need to presuppose functional forms, introducing model-dependent biases. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an inference framework powered by deep generative modeling. We develop a flexible, data-driven population model using a Correlated Compound-Mixture Density Network. This architecture integrates mixture models to handle multimodality, Gaussian copulas for parameter dependencies, and a library of flexible marginal distributions. The network is trained to approximate the posterior distribution of the population's hyperparameters using amortized variational inference with Normalizing Flows on catalogs of gravitational-wave events. We demonstrate the framework's capabilities in two distinct regimes. First, using simulated catalogs of supermassive black hole binary mergers for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), we show that the method accurately recovers complex three-dimensional distributions and absolute merger rates from sparse datasets, effectively correcting for selection effects and measurement uncertainties. Second, we validate the framework on real observational data from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA GWTC-3 catalog, successfully inferring the population of stellar-mass binary black holes using an injection-based selection effect correction. Our results confirm that the method is robust, scalable, and applicable across different detector sensitivities and source populations.</description>

      <title>An autoencoder-based surrogate waveform model for quasi-circular binary-black-hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of accurate waveforms from binary black hole (BBH) mergers is a major effort in Gravitational-Wave Astronomy. In recent years, machine-learning-based surrogate models for BBH waveforms have been proposed. Those offer the potential to dramatically accelerate waveform generation while maintaining accuracy competitive with that of traditional waveform approximants. In this work, we investigate the viability of autoencoders as generative models for gravitational-wave signals from quasi-circular BBH mergers. We introduce AESur3dq8, a novel surrogate waveform model based on autoencoders that enables the rapid and accurate construction of large template banks, producing millions of waveforms in under a second using modest computational resources. The model is trained on the numerical-relativity-informed surrogate NRHybSur3dq8 and subsequently fine-tuned using the SXS catalog of BBH simulations. We demonstrate that waveforms generated by AESur3dq8 achieve mismatches of order $10^{-4}$ with respect to Numerical Relativity waveforms, and that parameter estimation performed with these templates yields results fully consistent with those reported by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration for observed gravitational-wave events.</description>

      <title>A Roman Coronagraph Spectroscopic Mode Demonstration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose 730 nm high-contrast spectroscopic observations of selected self-luminous directly-imaged planets as a key test of the Roman Coronagraph's planet characterization capabilities. The planet sample draws from ground-based IR discoveries with the NASA headquarters-supported Subaru/OASIS survey -- HIP 99770 b and HIP 54515 b -- and ``emblematic" planets $\beta$ Pic b and HR 8799 e. All of these planets are likely unsuitable for achieving the coronagraph's core TTR5 goal at 575 nm but are detectable at longer wavelength passbands. Their predicted contrasts at 730 $\mu m$ cover two orders of magnitude range; all companions reside within the dark hole region enabled by the shaped-pupil coronagraph at 730 nm. These observations will help to fulfill multiple Coronagraph Objectives, providing a first assessment of the wavelength dependence of speckle noise and the ability to extract accurate atmospheric information in the face of this noise. Additionally, they will provide a first experiment at extracting optical planet spectra in the face of signal contamination from a debris disk: prefiguring challenges that the Habitable Worlds Observatory may encounter with imaging Earths in exozodi-contaminated systems.</description>

      <title>Multigroup Thermal Radiation Transport with Tensor Trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the application of tensor train (TT) algorithms to multigroup thermal radiation transport (i.e., photon radiation transport). The TT framework enables simulations at discretizations that might otherwise be computationally infeasible on conventional hardware. We show that solutions to certain multigroup problems possess an intrinsic low-rank structure, which the TT representation leverages effectively. This enables us to solve problems where the discretized solution size exceeds a trillion parameters on a single node. We consistently achieve compression factors $&gt;$100$\times$ and speedups $&gt;$2$\times$. The solver is evaluated across a range of test problems with varying levels of complexity. In addition, we further analyze the low-rank structure of the merged spatio-spectral core to evaluate the potential for additional compression via more advanced TT decompositions.</description>

      <title>3D Printed Alumina as a Millimeter-Wave Optical Element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present millimeter and sub-millimeter room temperature transmission and loss measurements of 3D printed alumina disc and of a disc with one-sided 3D printed sub-wavelength structures anti-reflection coatings (SWS-ARC). For four bands spanning 158 - 700~GHz we find an index of refraction consistent with $n= 3.107 \pm 0.007$. The loss over the entire frequency band between 158~GHz and 700~GHz spans $ 1 \cdot 10^{-3} \leq \tan \delta \leq 2.49 \cdot 10^{-3}$ with 10%-30% uncertainty at the lower range of frequencies shrinking to $\sim\!2\%$ at the higher frequencies. As expected, constructive and destructive interference fringes that are apparent with the flat disc data are absent with the disc that has SWS-ARC. The measured data are consistent with finite element analysis predictions that are based on the measured shape of the SWS. At frequencies between 158~GHz and 200~GHz, below the onset of diffraction effects, reflectance is reduced from a maximum of 64% to about 25%, closely matching predictions. These measurements of the index, loss, and SWS-ARC of 3D printed alumina suggest that the material and fabrication technique could be useful for astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Simulating Roman+Gaia Combined Astrometry, Parallaxes, and Proper Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of high-precision astrometry is rapidly approaching thanks to ongoing and upcoming missions like Euclid, LSST, and RST. We present a new tool (available at https://github.com/KevinMcK95/gaia_roman_astrometry) to simulate the astrometric precision that will be achieved when combining Gaia data with Roman images. We construct realistic Roman position uncertainties as a function of filter, magnitude, and exposure time, which are combined with Gaia precisions and user-defined Roman observing strategies to predict the expected uncertainty in position, parallax, and proper motion (PM). We also simulate the core Roman surveys to assess their end-of-mission astrometric capabilities, finding that the High Latitude and Galactic Bulge Time Domain Surveys will deliver Gaia-DR3-quality PMs down to G=26.5 mag and G=29.0 mag, respectively. Due to its modest number of repeat observations, we find that the astrometry of the High Latitude Wide Area Survey (HLWAS) is very sensitive to particular choices in observing strategies. We compare possible HLWAS strategies to highlight the impact of parallax effects and conclude that a multi-year Roman-only baseline is required for useful PM uncertainties (&lt;100 mas/yr). This simulation tool is actively being used for ongoing Roman proposal writing to ensure astrometric requirements for science goals will be met. Subsequent work will expand this tool to include simulated observations from other telescopes to plan for a future where all surveys and datasets are harnessed together.</description>

      <title>GBD-DART-I : Pulsars and transient source observation between 130 MHz and 350 MHz at Gauribidanur</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauribidanur Diamond Array Radio Telescope (GBD-DART) is a new small LPDA antenna array consisting of 64 short dipoles and associated receivers that has been custom developed and deployed at the Gauribidanur observatory (13.604 N, 77.427 E) to study bright Pulsars and Solar transients in the frequency range of 130-350 MHz. The LPDAs are arranged in a checkerboard layout, with opposite pairs combined to enable dual-polarised operation. A diamond-shaped (tilted square) array configuration was chosen to achieve high sidelobe suppression in the East-West and North-South directions. The tile measures 5.9 meters by 5.9 meters, with diagonals along both the North-South and East-West directions, each measuring about 8.4 meters. The LPDA array with one diamond-shaped tile has been fully commissioned and is operating in transit-observing mode, successfully detecting strong pulsars and solar flares over the last seven months. The present digital backend restricts the instantaneous bandwidth for observations to 16 MHz. The array operations are streamlined to facilitate remote operations. Apart from investigating Pulsar and Solar phenomena at low radio frequencies in selected sources, this work aims to provide a training platform for radio astronomy through simple-to-construct, low-cost radio telescopes. In this paper, we present details of the array, including antenna and array response studies, brief descriptions of front-end and backend instrumentation, and illustrative results from observations of both pulsars and solar flares. It will also provide brief details of future upgrade plans, particularly for the tiles and digital backend, to facilitate the observation of additional sources.</description>

      <title>Prospects for the detection of gamma rays using Cherenkov telescopes enhanced by a ground array observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Single-Mirror Small-Size imaging atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (SST-1M) to be located inside a high-altitude array of Water-Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs) inspired by the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO). For such a hybrid observatory, using detailed Monte Carlo simulations, we show an improvement in the flux sensitivity of monocular and stereoscopic SST-1M observation by about 60% and 30% above 10 TeV, respectively, due to the improved gamma/hadron separation when additional parameters from the WCD array are used. We also discuss further benefits of the hybrid SWGO concept and its technical challenges.</description>

      <title>GBD-DART-II: 175 MHz Polarimetric Observation of Pulsars from Gauribidanur and a New Pulsar Signal Processing Pipeline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new pulsar signal-processing pipeline has been developed for observing pulsars with the Diamond Array Radio Telescope at the Gauribidanur radio observatory. The array consists of 32 off-axis dual-polarised LPDAs, with a nominal gain of 22 dBi between 130 and 350 MHz and a 15-degree HPBW at 175 MHz for transit observations on pulsars. Custom-built receivers and real-time data-capture and analysis tools have been developed and used. Receiver output voltages from a transient buffer, as well as full-polar spectral data at both high and low resolutions, suitable for transient searches and pulsar studies. Additionally, full-polar folded profile archives are generated for known pulsars in subintegrations and both coherent and incoherent dedispersion. Custom-developed Python routines, FFT libraries, DSPSR, PSRCHIVE, and Presto modules have been used to build the pipeline. The functionalities of the pipeline were validated with artificially generated pulsar signals and strong celestial sources before it was released for routine observations. Presently, the pipeline is configured to observe pulsars between 170 and 196 MHz, with a daily cadence. Recorded data are reduced in-line immediately following each observation, nearly matching the observation time at a 1:1 ratio. An Intel i9 server captures the data, and an AMD R9 CPU does the primary data reduction. The archives are routinely backed up to a remote system via the internet. The paper presents the architecture of the signal processing pipeline developed, its validation, and initial polarimetric results observing five bright pulsars at 175 MHz. Results also include RM estimates and single-pulse study results for B0953+08, B0531+21, and B1133+16, as well as from monitoring the spin-down of the Crab pulsar over 200 days of observation. Finally, it presents a discussion on the potential improvements for the array.</description>

      <title>Method on Using Shadow Altitude to Remove Geocoronal H$\alpha$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic surveys allow spatially resolved spectroscopy of galaxies to study their interstellar medium (ISM). However, observations of Galactic H$\alpha$ emission are contaminated by geocoronal H$\alpha$ emission. The latter is known to depend on the shadow altitude, a geometric parameter relating the line of sight to Earth's shadow cone. Using fibres on blank skys from the SDSS-IV/MaStar survey, we established an empirical relation between the geocoronal H$\alpha$ emission and the shadow altitude, with a root mean square fractional scatter of 23.52$\%$. This relation can be used to predict geocoronal H$\alpha$ emission so that it can be removed from observed spectra. This removal method is advantageous when the observed targets are extensive in the sky, and it does not require a large velocity separation between the observed target and the local standard of rest. This will enable reliable studies of Galactic H$\alpha$ in intermediate spectral resolution integral field spectroscopic surveys. We also find tentative evidences for the dependences of geocoronal emission on solar activity and the distance between the Earth and the Sun.</description>

      <title>Factorized neural posterior estimation for rapid and reliable inference of parameterized post-Einsteinian deviation parameters in gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct detection of gravitational waves (GWs) by LIGO has strikingly confirmed general relativity (GR), but testing GR via GWs requires estimating parameterized post-Einsteinian (ppE) deviation parameters in waveform models. Traditional Bayesian inference methods like Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) provide reliable estimates but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, failing to meet the real-time demands and surging data volume of future GW detectors. Here, we propose a factorized neural posterior estimation framework: we construct independent normalizing flow models for each of the nine ppE deviation parameters and effectively integrate prior information from other source parameters via a conditional embedding network. Leveraging a hybrid neural network with a convolutional neural network and a Residual Neural Network for feature extraction, our method performs rapid and statistically reliable posterior inference directly from binary black hole signals. Compared to conventional MCMC, our approach achieves millisecond-scale inference time with a speedup factor of $9 \times 10^4$. Comprehensive validations show that the posterior estimates pass the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and achieve empirical coverage probabilities close to theoretical targets. This work demonstrates the great potential of deep learning for GW parameter estimation and provides a viable technical solution for real-time GR tests with next-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>Astro-COLIBRI: An Innovative Platform for Real-Time Multi-Messenger Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of transient phenomena, such as supernovae, novae, Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), and stellar flares, together with the emergence of new cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and Gravitational Waves (GWs), has revolutionized astrophysics in recent years. To fully exploit the scientific potential of multi-messenger and multi-wavelength follow-up observations, as well as serendipitous detections, researchers need a tool capable of rapidly compiling and contextualizing essential information for every new event. We present Astro-COLIBRI, an advanced platform designed to meet this challenge.
  Astro-COLIBRI is a comprehensive platform that combines a public RESTful API, real-time databases, a cloud-based alert system, and user-friendly interfaces including a website and mobile app for iOS and Android. It ingests alerts from multiple sources in real time, applies user-defined filters, and situates each event within its multi-messenger and multi-wavelength context. The platform provides clear data visualization, concise summaries of key event properties, and evaluations of observing conditions across a wide network of observatories worldwide. We here detail the architecture of Astro-COLIBRI, from the data pipelines that manage real-time alert ingestion and processing to the design of the RESTful API, which enables seamless integration with other astronomical software and services.</description>

      <title>JWST NIRSpec's Cosmic Ray Experience at L2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize cosmic ray interactions in blanked-off \JWST NIRSpec ``dark'' exposures. In its Sun/Earth-Moon L2 halo orbit, \JWST encounters energetic ions that penetrate NIRSpec's radiation shielding. The shielded cosmic ray hit rate decreased from approximately $4.3$ to $2.3~\mathrm{ions~cm^{-2}}~s^{-1}$ during the first three years of operation. A typical hit affects about 7.1~pixels necessitating mitigation during calibration and deposits around $6~\mathrm{keV}$ in the $\lambda_\mathrm{co} = 5.4~\mu$m HgCdTe detector material (equivalent to $\sim5200$ charges). The corresponding linear energy transfer is about $0.86~\mathrm{keV~\mu m^{-1}}$. As we are currently near solar maximum, galactic cosmic ray flux is expected to increase as solar activity declines, leading to an anticipated rise in the NIRSpec rate from $2.3$ to $4.3~\mathrm{ions~cm^{-2}}~s^{-1}$ by early 2027 and potentially reaching $\sim6~\mathrm{ions~cm^{-2}}~s^{-1}$ in the early 2030s. We investigate rare, large ``snowball'' hits and, less frequently, events with secondary showers that pose significant calibration challenges. We explore their possible origins as heavy ions, secondary particles from shielding, or inelastic scattering in the HgCdTe detector material. We discuss the implications of these findings for future missions including the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>LISA Non-Linear Dynamics and Tilt-To-Length Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the LISA mission, Tilt-To-Length (TTL) coupling is expected to be one of the dominant instrumental noise contributions after laser frequency noise is suppressed based, on assumptions on the size of the coupling and angular jitter levels. This work uses for the first time a closed-loop, non-linear, and time-varying dynamics implementation to simulate detailed angular jitters for the spacecraft and optical benches. In turn, this gives an improved expectation of the TTL contribution to the interferometric output. It is shown that the TTL coupling impact is limited given current estimates on the size of coupling coefficients. A time-domain Least Squares estimator is used to infer the TTL parameters from the simulated measurements. The bias and correlations limit the estimator in the case of regular datasets with amplified TTL coefficients to a relative error of $10\%$, but the subtraction of the TTL signal still works well. For lower readout noises, the estimation error diverges, which can be mitigated using a regularization term. Alternatively, using sinusoidal maneuvers improves the inference to a high accuracy of $0.1\%$ for TTL coefficients around the expected level, removing all correlations in the inferred parameters. This validates the maneuver design by Wegener et al. (2025) in this closed-loop setting.</description>

      <title>Simple Improved Reference Subtraction for H4RG, H2RG, and H1RG Near-infrared Array Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teledyne's H4RG, H2RG, and H1RG near-infrared array detectors provide reference pixels embedded in their data streams. Although they do not respond to light, the reference pixels electronically mimic normal pixels and track correlated read noise. In this paper, we describe how the reference pixels can be used with linear algebra and training data to optimally reduce correlated read noise. Simple Improved Reference Subtraction (SIRS) works with common detector clocking patterns and, when applicable, relies only on post-processing existing data so long as the reference pixels are available. The resulting reference correction is optimal, in a least squares sense, when the embedded reference pixels are the only references and the reference columns on the left and right are treated as two reference streams. We demonstrate SIRS using H4RG ground test data from the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope Project. The Julia language SIRS software is freely available for download from the NASA GitHub. The package includes a python-3 ``backend'' that can be used to apply SIRS corrections if a SIRS calibration file has been provided by the instrument builders.</description>

      <title>The Nulling Interferometry Cryogenic Experiment (NICE): Architecture, requirements, and preliminary warm precursor results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE) space mission depends on measuring the faint mid-infrared emission spectra of exoplanets while suppressing the glare of a host star. This requires an instrument capable of high-contrast nulling interferometry with exceptional sensitivity. While previous testbeds have proven the principle of deep, stable nulls, they have not combined high contrast with the high throughput and cryogenic operation required for LIFE. Here, we present the architecture of the Nulling Interferometry Cryogenic Experiment (NICE), a mid-infrared nulling testbed, to increase the technological readiness of LIFE. We derive the laboratory requirements necessary to validate the LIFE beam combiner and present the optical design of NICE. Finally, we report results from the ambient \enquote{Warm Bench} precursor, which has successfully demonstrated the required null depth ($&lt; 10^{-5}$) using a polarized narrowband 4.7 um source, and the required throughput (&gt; 17%) using one of the two nulling channels.</description>

      <title>Surface Interactions in Photon Monte Carlo Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement a comprehensive simulation of photon surface interactions using a Monte Carlo approach. This is effective in simulating the interaction of light with telescope mirrors and lenses. We use a full electromagnetic solution to simulate the wavelength and angular dependence at surfaces. This includes bare interfaces, monolayer interfaces, protected layer coatings, and multilayer coatings. We handle special cases when multilayer data is incomplete or when there is photo-conversion in the interface as with sensors. We implement interactions with surface micro-roughness and predict the corresponding angular distribution using a Monte Carlo implementation of the Harvey-Shack scatter theory for a microroughness power spectrum. Finally, we simulate surface interaction with contamination from dust or condensation using Mie scattering applied efficiently to individual contaminants. The combination of these implementations can efficiently simulate rough to polished surfaces of arbitrary materials that are fully cleaned or dusty. The observational consequences includes complex wavelength and spatial-dependent photometric errors, the dominant effect of the wings of point-spread-functions, dust rings, and wavelength and angle-dependent throughput losses. We find agreement with the point-spread-function wings of WIYN ODI observations of bright stars and properties of dust rings, and demonstrate the ability to disentangle mirror microroughness from the turbulence PSF patterns. The comprehensive numerical implementation of surface interactions has wide applicability in non-astronomical applications as well.</description>

      <title>Depth Calibration of Double-sided Strip Germanium Detectors for the Compton Spectrometer and Imager Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double-sided strip high-purity germanium detectors with three-dimensional position reconstruction capability have been developed over three decades, with space-based applications in high-energy astrophysics and heliophysics. Position resolution in three dimensions is key to reconstruction of Compton scattering events, including for the upcoming Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) satellite mission. Two-dimensional position reconstruction is enabled by segmentation of the two detector faces into orthogonal strip contacts, enabling a pixelized analysis. The depth of an interaction cannot be measured directly but must be inferred from the charge collection time difference between the two faces of the detector. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the depth calibration of a detector with the COSI satellite geometry read out using an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed for the COSI mission. In this work, we map collection time difference to depth using the Julia-based simulation package SolidStateDetectors.jl and validate it with comparison to the timing distributions observed in data. We also use simulations and data to demonstrate the depth resolution on a per-pixel basis, with &gt;90% of pixels having &lt;0.9 mm (FWHM) resolution at 59.5 keV and &lt;0.6 mm (FWHM) resolution at 122.1 keV.</description>

      <title>X-ray characterization of fully-depleted p-channel Skipper-CCDs for the DarkNESS mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark matter Nanosatellite Equipped with Skipper Sensors (DarkNESS) mission is a 6U CubeSat designed to search for X-ray lines from decaying dark matter using Skipper-CCDs. Thick, fully-depleted p-channel Skipper-CCDs provide low readout noise and high quantum efficiency for 1-10 keV X-rays, but their X-ray performance has not yet been demonstrated in the space environment. DarkNESS will operate in low-Earth orbit, where trapped protons induce displacement damage in the sensor that increases charge-transfer inefficiency and degrades the X-ray energy resolution. This work measures the X-ray line response of Skipper-CCDs before and after proton irradiation and quantifies the associated degradation. A sensor was exposed to 217 MeV protons at a fluence of 8.4 x 10^10 protons cm^-2, corresponding to a displacement-damage dose more than an order of magnitude above the three-year expectation for representative mid-inclination and Sun-synchronous low-Earth orbits. A 55Fe source was used to compare the energy resolution of the beam-exposed quadrant to adjacent unexposed quadrants and a non-irradiated reference sensor. These measurements provide a quantitative assessment of radiation-induced spectral degradation in Skipper-CCDs and enable an estimate of the end-of-life X-ray energy resolution expected for DarkNESS operation in low-Earth orbit.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Characterizing Companions with a Calibrated Gaia DR2, DR3, and Hipparcos Catalog (G23H)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia DR4 epoch astrometry will enable the detection of thousands of exoplanets through astrometric motion. Here, we present a composite catalog and modeling framework that extracts the maximum information from existing Hipparcos and Gaia data releases. We calibrate Gaia DR2 proper motions and DR3-DR2 scaled position differences against the Gaia DR3 reference frame, and combine these with the Hipparcos-Gaia Catalog of Accelerations, the Hipparcos intermediate astrometric data, Gaia astrometric excess noise, and Gaia radial velocity variability constraints. We implement a joint likelihood model for these data in Octofitter that marginalizes over Gaia's unpublished observation epochs. This results in full orbit posteriors that can be computed uniformly for a large class of companions. We compare these posteriors to published orbital solutions for 25 stellar binaries from the Sixth Catalog of Orbits of Visual Binary Stars, recovering all companions at high significance and broadly consistent orbital separations. We then recover independent evidence to support 94 of 120 tested Jovian exoplanetary systems from the NASA Exoplanet Archive (plus 3 known stellar companions, and one previously detected planet we now rule out). We demonstrate that in cases like 14 Her b, the posteriors confirm the planetary nature of a signal using only Gaia and Hipparcos data. We find no false positives among 25 RV-quiet standard stars without significant Hipparcos-Gaia accelerations. Our method can break degeneracies inherent to proper motion anomaly or excess noise modeling alone by resolving orbital curvature within the Gaia baseline. The catalog and updated Octofitter are made publicly available to the community.</description>

      <title>Energy Absorption Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.00745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy Absorption Interferometry (EAI) is a technique for measuring the responsivities and complex-valued spatial polarimetric forms of the individual degrees of freedom through which a many-body system can absorb energy. It was originally formulated using the language of quantum correlation functions, making it applicable to different kinds of excitation (electromagnetic, elastic and acoustic fields). EAI has been applied in a variety of theoretical and experimental ways. It is particularly effective at characterising the multimode behaviour of ultra-low-noise far-infrared and optical devices, imaging arrays, and complete instruments, where it can be used to ensure that a system is maximally responsive to those partially coherent fields that carry signal whilst avoiding those that only carry noise. Despite its utility there is no comprehensive overview of electromagnetic EAI. In this paper we describe the theoretical foundations of the method, and present a range of new techniques in areas relating to sampling, phase referencing, mode reconstruction and noise. We present, for the first time, an analysis of how noise propagates through an experiment resulting in errors and artefacts on spectral and modal plots. A noise model is essential, because it determines the signal to noise ratio needed to ensure a given level of experimental fidelity.</description>

Abstract: The study of the spatial layout of Christian churches has been of great interest since late Antiquity and the beginning of the Early Middle Ages, and has received a new impetus in recent literature when it was recognized that the orientation of their main axes represents a key feature of their architecture. From the earliest Christian communities, the orientation of the church allowed the faithful to pray facing the east, towards the rising Sun. Several authors were careful to point this out in their writings; in particular, prior to the Council of Nicaea (325 AD), the Apostolic Constitutions indicated: "And let it be, first, the elongated building, with its head facing east". We present a detailed analysis of the spatial orientation of the historic churches located in the Jesuit towns of Chiquitania (Bolivia). We have measured in situ the main characteristics of eight churches currently standing and the ruins of a ninth construction. In all cases, we carry out a thorough survey of the landscape surrounding each church, trying to find some common pattern, possibly astronomical, that explains its orientations. To our list we also add the orientation measures of a tenth church based on work with plans and satellite maps. We complement our data with a detailed cultural and historical study of the characteristics of missionary towns. Unlike the churches of the Guarani towns of the historic province of Paraquaria where the meridian orientations stand out, in the case of the Jesuit churches of Chiquitos, half of the measured constructions show orientations that fall within the solar range, with three churches oriented equinoctially with high precision. We analyze the reasons for these orientations and delve further on the possible relevance that lighting effects could have had for the architects of these churches, which represent true hidden cathedrals in the virgin tropical forest.</description>

      <title>A parametric model for externally irradiated protoplanetary disks with photoevaporative winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks in massive star-forming regions may be exposed to ultraviolet radiation fields orders of magnitude stronger than the interstellar background. This intense radiation drives photoevaporative winds that fundamentally shape disk evolution and chemistry. However, full radiation hydrodynamic simulations of these systems remain computationally expensive, preventing systematic exploration of the parameter space. We present a parametric framework for efficiently generating density structures of externally irradiated protoplanetary disks with photoevaporative winds. Our approach implements a spherically diverging wind configuration with smooth transitions between the disk interior, the FUV-heated surface layer, and the wind itself. We validate this framework extensively against the FRIED grid of hydrodynamical simulations, demonstrating accurate reproduction of density structures across stellar masses from 0.3 to 3.0 M_sun, disk radii from 20 to 150 au, and external FUV fields from 100 to 100,000 G0. The complete framework is available as 'PUFFIN', a Python package that generates full 1D or 2D density structures in seconds to minutes, compared to weeks or months for equivalent hydrodynamical calculations. We demonstrate the scientific utility of this approach by modelling CO chemistry across a comprehensive parameter grid, using our density structures as inputs to thermochemical calculations. Our results show that external FUV irradiation significantly enhances CO gas-phase abundances through indirect heating mechanisms, which raise midplane temperatures and enhance thermal desorption of CO ice. This effect is strongest in the outer disk and scales with both external field strength and disk mass, with important implications for volatile budgets available to forming planets in clustered environments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Messenger Modeling of Low-Luminosity Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>

Abstract: Low-luminosity gamma-ray bursts (LL GRBs), a subclass of the most powerful transients in the Universe, remain promising sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos, despite strong IceCube constraints on typical long GRBs. In this work, a novel approach is introduced to study a sample of seven LL~GRBs with their multi-wavelength observations to investigate leptohadronic processes during their prompt emission phases. The relative energy densities in magnetic fields, non-thermal electrons, and protons are constrained, with the latter defining the cosmic-ray (CR) loading factor. Our results suggest that LL~GRBs exhibit diverse emission processes, as confirmed by a machine-learning analysis of the fitted parameters. Across the seven LL~GRBs, we find the posterior medians of the CR loading factor in the range of $\xi_p \sim 0.2$--$1.6$. GRB~060218 and GRB~100316D, the lowest-luminosity bursts ($L_{\gamma, \rm iso} \sim 10^{46}$-$10^{47}\rm~erg~s^{-1}$) consistent with the shock-breakout (SBO) scenario, yield the highest CR loading factor and therefore are expected to produce neutrinos more efficiently. Our model predicts the expected number of neutrino signals that are consistent with current limits but would be detectable with next-generation neutrino observatories. These results strengthen the case for LL~GRBs as promising sources of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos and motivate real-time searches for coincident LL~GRB and neutrino events. Next-generation X-ray and MeV facilities will be critical for identifying more LL~GRBs and strengthening their role in multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Mitigating half-wave plate systematics at the map-making level: calibration requirements for LiteBIRD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although half-wave plates (HWPs) are becoming a popular choice of polarization modulators for cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments, their non-idealities can introduce systematic effects that should be carefully characterized and mitigated. One possible mitigation strategy is to incorporate information about the non-idealities at the map-making level, which helps to reduce the HWP-induced distortions of the reconstructed CMB. Nevertheless, the non-idealities can only be known with finite precision. In this paper we investigate the consequences of discrepancies between their true frequency profiles and those assumed by the map-maker. We present an end-to-end framework, including a blind component-separation step, and use it to translate these discrepancies into a bias on the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, for the LiteBIRD satellite mission. We subsequently derive realistic and conservative measurement requirements for accurately characterizing the HWP non-idealities to ensure they do not compromise LiteBIRD's ambitious scientific goals. We find that the obtained results are robust against sky models with varying complexity.</description>

      <title>The Kratos Framework for Heterogeneous Astrophysical Simulations: Ray Tracing, Reacting Flow and Thermochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermochemistry, ray-tracing radiation, and radiation-matter interactions are important processes which are computationally difficult to model in astrophysical simulations, addressed by introducing novel algorithms optimized for heterogeneous architectures in the Kratos framework. Key innovations include a stoichiometry-compatible reconstruction scheme for consistent chemical species advection, which ensures element conservation while avoiding matrix inversions, and a LU decomposition method specifically designed for multi-thread parallelization in order to solve stiff thermochemical ordinary differential equations with high efficiency. The framework also implements efficient ray-tracing techniques for radiation transport for radiation-matter interactions. Various verification tests, spanning from chemical advection, combustion, Str\"omgren spheres, and detonation dynamics, are conducted to demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of Kratos, with results closely matching semi-analytic solutions and benchmarks such as Cantera and the Shock and Detonation Toolbox. The modular design and performance optimizations position it as a versatile tool for studying coupled microphysical processes in the diverse environments of contemporary astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>Observational strategies for ultrahigh-energy neutrinos: the importance of deep sensitivity for detection and astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting ultrahigh-energy neutrinos can take two complementary approaches with different trade-offs. 1)~Wide and shallow: aim for the largest effective volume, and to be cost-effective, go for wide field-of-view but at the cost of a shallow instantaneous sensitivity -- this is less complex conceptually, and has strong discovery potential for serendipitous events. However, it is unclear if any source can be identified, following detection. And 2)~Deep and narrow: here one uses astrophysical and multi-messenger information to target the most likely sources and populations that could emit neutrinos -- these instruments have deep instantaneous sensitivity albeit a narrow field of view. Such an astrophysically-motivated approach provides higher chances for detection of known/observed source classes, and ensures multi-messenger astronomy. However, it has less potential for serendipitous discoveries. In light of the recent progress in multi-messenger and time-domain astronomy, we assess the power of the deep and narrow instruments, and contrast the strengths and complementarities of the two detection strategies. We update the science goals and associated instrumental performances that envisioned projects can include in their design in order to optimize discovery potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11803v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Habitable Worlds Observatory is the first telescope ever designed to search for life and will be a powerhouse of discovery across topics in astrophysics. The observatory was the top recommendation of the Astro2020 Decadal Survey for large missions and a new HWO Technology Maturation Project Office was formed in August 2024 to mature the architecture, science and technology. In this paper we review the overall approach taken to mature the mission concept. We show progress on architecture development, integrated modeling, science cases, and technology roadmaps consistent with pre-formulation studies. We discuss plans for instrument studies and international engagement and science engagement including a Community Science and Instrument Team. Finally, we describe the plan forward to the Mission Concept Review.</description>

      <title>proto-Lightspeed: a high-speed, ultra-low read noise imager on the Magellan Clay Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: proto-Lightspeed is a new instrument that has been commissioned on the Nasmyth East port of the Magellan Clay Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory to deliver high-speed optical imaging with deep sub-electron read noise. Making use of commercial re-imaging lenses and the ORCA-Quest 2 camera from Hamamatsu, proto-Lightspeed images a field $1'$ in diameter at up to $200$ Hz or windowed fields at higher rates, up to 6600 Hz for a $1.6''\times 1'$ field of view. proto-Lightspeed delivers seeing-limited image quality in the $g'$, $r'$, and $i'$ bands and adjustable magnification for pixel scales between $0.017''-0.050''$. proto-Lightspeed is well suited to studying compact binary systems, exoplanet transits, rapid flaring associated with accretion, periodic optical emission from pulsars, occultations of background stars by small trans-Neptunian Objects, and any other rapidly variable source. proto-Lightspeed will be a P.I. instrument beginning in 2026B, available for use by members of the Magellan Consortium. In this paper, we discuss the design and performance of the instrument, results from its two commissioning runs, and plans for a facility instrument, Lightspeed, to support simultaneous multicolor imaging across a $7'\times4'$ field.</description>

      <title>Classification and Nomenclature of Planets in the Mass-Radius Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16063v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 6500+ exoplanets have been detected using various techniques. This prompted the emergence of many recent works on the taxonomy, or classification, of exoplanets. However, there is still no basic, fundamental definition of 'What is a planet?'. IAU has forwarded a definition in 2006, which however, raised more questions than it solved. The first task here is to establish if there are limits on the size/mass of planets. The lower mass limit may be assumed as of Mimas (0.03 EU) - approximately minimum mass required to attain a nearly spherical hydrostatic equilibrium shape. The upper mass limit may be easier - there is a natural lower limit to what constitutes a star: 0.08 SU. But then there are brown dwarfs: IAU has defined brown dwarfs as objects exceeding the deuterium burning limit (~13 JU), and giant exoplanets generally have masses of 0.3 to 60 JU. The resolution requires assembling the basic physical parameters that define planets quantitatively. Mass and radius are the two fundamental properties, and we propose to use a third correlated parameter: the moment of inertia. Based on this, we create the parametric Fundamental Planetary Plane where the two parameters are correlated with the third. The fundamental planetary plane (FPP) with turn-off point diagrams is constructed for visual representation. We propose an alternate potential description of a planet definition as 'A celestial spherical object, bound to a star or unbound, that lies on the fundamental planetary plane, within a mass range between 0.02 EU to 13 JU'. This definition is intended to complement existing taxonomies by providing a quantitative, structure-based criterion applicable to both Solar System planets, exoplanets and free-floating planets. These turn-off point diagrams serve as an alternative to the Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram, but for planets.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Gravity through Realistic 3D Modeling of Wide Binary Orbits: General Algorithm and a Pilot Study with HARPS Radial Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11996v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When 3D relative displacement $\mathbf{r}$ and velocity $\mathbf{v}$ between the pair in a gravitationally-bound system are precisely measured, the six measured quantities at one phase can allow elliptical orbit solutions at a given gravitational parameter $G$. Due to degeneracies between orbital-geometric parameters and $G$, individual Bayesian inferences and their statistical consolidation are needed to infer $G$ as recently suggested by a Bayesian 3D modeling algorithm. Here I present a fully general Bayesian algorithm suitable for wide binaries with two (almost) exact sky-projected relative positions (as in the Gaia data release 3) and the other four sufficiently precise quantities. Wide binaries meeting the requirements of the general algorithm to allow for its full potential are rare at present, largely because the measurement uncertainty of the line-of-sight (radial) separation is usually larger than the true separation. As a pilot study, the algorithm is applied to 32 Gaia binaries for which precise HARPS radial velocities are available. The value of $\Gamma \equiv \log_{10}\sqrt{G/G_{\rm N}}$ (where $G_{\rm N}$ is Newton's constant) is $-0.002_{-0.018}^{+0.012}$ supporting Newton for a combination of 24 binaries with Newtonian acceleration $g_{\rm N}&gt;10^{-9}$m\,s$^{-2}$, while it is $\Gamma=0.134_{-0.036}^{+0.056}$ ($0.143_{-0.041}^{+0.068}$) for 8 (6) binaries with $g_{\rm N}&lt;10^{-9}$ ($&lt;10^{-9.5}$) m\,s$^{-2}$ representing $&gt; 3.5\sigma$ discrepancy with Newton. However, one system (Stars HD189739 and HD189760) dominates the signal. Without it, the tension with Newton is significantly lessened with $\Gamma=0.063_{-0.041}^{+0.065}$. Thus, to verify the tentative signal, many such systems need to be discovered and their kinematic nature such as any possibility of hidden tertiary stars needs to be thoroughly addressed. The pilot study demonstrates the potential of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Measuring gravitational lensing time delays with quantum information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational fields of astrophysical bodies bend the light around them, creating multiple paths along which light from a distant source can arrive at Earth. Measuring the difference in photon arrival time along these different paths provides a means of determining the mass of the lensing system, which is otherwise difficult to constrain. This is particularly challenging in the case of microlensing, where the images produced by lensing cannot be individually resolved; existing proposals for detecting time delays in microlensed systems are significantly constrained due to the need for large photon flux and the loss of signal coherence when the angular diameter of the light source becomes too large.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach to measuring astrophysical time delays. Our method uses exponentially fewer photons than previous schemes, enabling observations that would otherwise be impossible. Our approach, which combines a quantum-inspired algorithm and quantum information processing technologies, saturates a provable lower bound on the number of photons required to find the time delay. Our scheme has multiple applications: we explore its use both in calibrating optical interferometric telescopes and in making direct mass measurements of ongoing microlensing events. To demonstrate the latter, we present a fiducial example of microlensed stellar flares sources in the Galactic Bulge. Though the number of photons produced by such events is small, we show that our photon-efficient scheme opens the possibility of directly measuring microlensing time delays using existing and near-future ground-based telescopes.</description>

      <title>The Eschatian Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The history of astronomical discovery shows that many of the most detectable phenomena, especially detection firsts, are not typical members of their broader class, but rather rare, extreme cases with disproportionately large observational signatures. Motivated by this, we propose the Eschatian Hypothesis: that the first confirmed detection of an extraterrestrial technological civilization is most likely to be an atypical example, one that is unusually "loud" (i.e., producing an anomalously strong technosignature), and plausibly in a transitory, unstable, or even terminal phase. Using a toy model, we derive conditions under which such loud civilizations dominate detections, finding for example that if a society is loud for only $10^{-6}$ of its lifetime, it must emit ${\gtrsim}1$% of its total observable energy budget during that phase to outrun quieter populations. The hypothesis naturally motivates agnostic anomaly searches in wide-field, multi-channel, continuous surveys as a practical strategy for a first detection of extraterrestrial technology.</description>

      <title>The formation of periodic three-body orbits for Newtonian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Braids are periodic solutions to the general N-body problem in gravitational dynamics. These solutions seem special and unique, but they may result from rather usual encounters between four bodies. We aim at understanding the existence of braids in the Galaxy by reverse engineering the interactions in which they formed. We simulate self-gravitating systems of N particles, starting with the constructing of a specific braid, and bombard it with a single object. We study how frequently the bombarded braid dissolves in four singles, a triple and a single, a binary and 2 singles, or 2 binaries. The relative proportion of those events gives us insight into how easy it is to generate a braid through the reverse process. It turns out that braids are easily generated from encounters between 2 binaries, or a triple with a single object, independent on the braid's stability. We find that 3 of the explored braids are linearly stable against small perturbations, whereas one is unstable and short-lived. The shortest-lived braid appears the least stable and the most chaotic. nonplanar encounters also lead to braid formation, which, in our experiments, themselves are planar. The parameter space in azimuth and polar angle that lead to braid formation via binary-binary or triple-single encounters is anisotropic, and the distribution has a low fractal dimension. Since a substantial fraction of ~9% of our calculations lead to periodic 3-body systems, braids may be more common than expected. They could form in multi-body interactions. We do not expect many to exist for time, but they may be common as transients, as they survive for tens to hundreds of periodic orbits. We argue that braids are common in relatively shallow-potential background fields, such as the Oort cloud or the Galactic halo. If composed of compact objects, they potentially form interesting targets for gravitational wave detectors.</description>

Abstract: The gravitational wave event GW190521 seems to be the only BH merger event possibly correlated with an electromagnetic counterpart, which appeared about 34 days after the GW event. This work aims to confirm that the electromagnetic bump towards the Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) J1249+3449 can be explained within the framework of the gravitational microlensing phenomenon. In particular, considering the data of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), what emerges from a detailed analysis of the observed light curve using three fitting models (Point Source Point Lens, Finite Source Point Lens, Uniform Source Binary Lens) is that the optical bump can be explained as a microlensing event caused by a lens with mass {$\sim\,$0.1 $M_{\odot}$}, lying in the host galaxy of the AGN in question.}</description>
