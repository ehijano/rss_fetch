      <title>The orbital period changes for novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cataclysmic variable (CVs) are close interacting binaries in which a white dwarf accretes materials from a low mass main sequence companion. CVs can experience nova eruptions due to low mass transfer rates. In the standard theory of CV evolution, the ejected materials during nova eruptions are assumed to leave the system in the form of fast, isotropic, optically thick winds, which predicts that novae only result in positive variation (expansion) of orbital period (i.e. positive $\Delta P$). In addition, the angular momentum losses (magnetic braking and gravitational radiation) only predicts a steady long-term decay in the orbital period of CVs, i.e. $\dot P$ is negative. Interestingly, an observation lasting over 30 years reveals positive and negative values for both $\Delta P$ and $\dot P$ in CVs, strongly conflicting with the standard evolutionary patterns. However, it cannot be excluded that these observations originate from short-term phenomena caused by nova eruptions because of a short timescale of observations. In this paper, we model the effect of instantaneous nova eruptions on the evolution of CVs, considering three mechanisms associated with mass loss in nova eruptions, including fast wind, Frank jet and binary-driven mass loss. By assuming that the observed $\Delta P$ and $\dot P$ are dominated by short-term phenomena, our results show that the binary-driven mass loss can explain almost all of the observations of normal CVs. However, the Frank jet may be needed for some of long-period CVs with evolved companions.</description>

      <title>The Binary Fraction of B-type Runaway Stars from LAMOST DR8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runaway stars are defined as stars that depart from their birth clusters at high peculiar velocities. There are two main mechanisms for the formation of runaway stars, i.e., the binary-supernova scenario (BSS) and the dynamical ejection scenario (DES). Investigating the binary fraction of runaway stars is an important step in further exploring the relative significance of the two mechanisms. We analyzed the binary fraction of 203 Galactic B-type runaway stars identified in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope Data Release 8 database. Our analysis of radial velocity variations in the runaway star sample reveals an observed spectroscopic binary fraction of $5.4\%\pm 1.6\%$, representing the proportion of objects that exhibit statistically significant variations in radial velocity with amplitudes larger than $\rm 16~km~s^{-1}$. We employed a Monte Carlo method to correct for observational biases and determined an intrinsic binary fraction of $27\%\pm 8\%$. The period and mass ratio distributions that best reproduce the observation are $f(P)\propto P^{-5.7}$ for $1\leq P\leq 1000$ days, and $f(q)\propto q^{-3.6}$ for $0.1\leq q\leq 1.0$, indicating a preference for binaries with shorter periods and less massive companions compared to a uniform distribution. The intrinsic binary fraction, in combination with previous studies on the binary fractions of runaway stars formed by the BSS and the DES, implies that both scenarios contribute comparably to the formation of Galactic B-type runaway stars, where the ratio of the BSS to the DES is 0.86.</description>

      <title>V Sge: Supersoft Source or Exotic Hot Binary? I. An X-Shooter campaign in the high state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V Sge is a peculiar, highly luminous long-period (12.34h) binary star that can display a super-soft X-ray emitting component when in the faint phase of its V~ 10-13mag variability range. Apparently undergoing Eddington-limited accretion from its more massive secondary, it is in a very rare, short-lived evolutionary phase towards the double degenerate channel. Its complex and highly variable optical emission features, from Balmer and Heii to high-ionisation lines, including strong fluorescence features, have been challenging to interpret, especially given the absence of any absorption lines associated with photospheric features from either stellar component. With the detailed properties of V Sge, especially the donor, still controversial, we undertook a VLT/X-Shooter campaign over three months in 2023, obtaining high S/N, high resolution spectra that revealed multiple components in both high- and low-ionisation lines. This allows us to track V Sge's principal emitting regions via Doppler tomography, obtaining new insights into high accretion-rate dynamics. In particular, we identify a stationary, double-peaked emission core which we interpret as a circumbinary ring, analogous to SS433. This enables us to derive limits on the system masses. Furthermore, we find very broad emission-line wings whose mean velocity can vary over hundreds of kilometres per second on timescales of decades, yet ``flip'' between states in &lt;1 week. We show that the super-soft X-ray source interpretation is able to account for these and other observational attributes significantly better than the hot binary model, concluding that V Sge could be one of the brightest known Galactic super-soft sources.</description>

      <title>Confined Circumstellar Material as a Dust Formation Site in Type II Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a model for dust formation in Type II supernovae (SNe) interacting with confined circumstellar material (CSM), motivated by recent time-domain surveys that have revealed a substantial fraction of SN progenitors to be surrounded by CSM ejected shortly before core-collapse. We simulate the pre-SN mass eruption and the resulting confined CSM using the open-source code CHIPS, and follow the subsequent evolution of the SN ejecta and its interaction with the CSM. We show that a cold dense shell (CDS) is formed at the radiative shock under a wide range of conditions and later undergoes rapid adiabatic cooling during free expansion, leading to efficient dust condensation. The resulting dust mass ranges from $\sim10^{-3}\,M_\odot$ to $0.1\,M_\odot$, depending on the mass and spatial extent of the CSM. We further calculate the infrared (IR) emission from the newly formed dust and find broad consistency with observations of SN~1998S. Notably, the IR light curve exhibits a rapid rise within $\lesssim10\,{\rm d}$, closely resembling that of kilonovae (KNe). This suggests that dust emission powered by confined CSM interaction may be also discovered in KN searches. Moreover, the high-density environment of the CDS may allow dust grains to grow to larger sizes, enhancing their survivability against destruction by reverse shocks propagating from the interstellar medium at later times.</description>

      <title>The nebular phase of SN 2024ggi: a low-mass progenitor with no signs of interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: SN 2024ggi is a Type II supernova (SN) discovered in the nearby galaxy NGC 3621 (D $\approx6.7\pm0.d$ Mpc) on 2024 April 03.21 UT. Its proximity enabled a detailed investigation of the SN's properties and its progenitor star. This work focuses on the optical evolution of SN 2024ggi at the nebular phase. Aims: We investigate the progenitor properties and possible asymmetries in the ejecta by studying the nebular phase evolution between days 287 and 400 after the explosion. Methods: We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi during the nebular phase, obtained with the Las Campanas and Gemini South Observatories. Four nebular spectra were taken at 287, 288, 360, and 396 days post-explosion, supplemented by late-time $uBVgri$-band photometry spanning $320-400$ days. The analysis of the nebular emission features is performed to probe ejecta asymmetries. Based on the [O I] flux and [O I]/[Ca II] ratio, and comparisons with spectra models from the literature, we arrive to an estimate of the progenitor mass. Additionally, we construct the bolometric light curve from optical photometry and near-infrared data to derive the synthesized nickel mass. Results: Our analysis suggests a progenitor zero-age-main-sequence mass between $12-15 M_\odot$. The late-time bolometric light curve is consistent with a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.05-0.06 M_\odot$. The line profiles exhibit only minor changes over the observed period and suggest a roughly symmetrical ejecta, with a possible clump of oxygen-rich material moving towards the observer. No signatures of circumstellar material interaction are detected up to 400 days after the explosion.</description>

      <title>ABC-SN: Attention Based Classifier for Supernova Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While significant advances have been made in photometric classification ahead of the millions of transient events and hundreds of supernovae (SNe) each night that the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will discover, classifying SNe spectroscopically remains the best way to determine most subtypes of SNe. Traditional spectrum classification tools use template matching techniques (Blondin &amp; Tonry 2007) and require significant human supervision. Two deep learning spectral classifiers, DASH (Muthukrishna et al. 2019) and SNIascore (Fremling et al. 2021) define the state of the art, but SNIascore is a binary classifier devoted to maximizing the purity of the SN Ia-norm sample, while DASH is no longer maintained and the original work suffers from contamination of multi-epoch spectra in the training and test sets. We have explored several neural network architectures in order to create a new automated method for classifying SN subtypes, settling on an attention-based model we call ABC-SN. We benchmark our results against an updated version of DASH, thus providing the community with an up-to-date general purpose SN classifier. Our dataset includes ten different SN subtypes including subtypes of SN Ia, core collapse and interacting SNe. We find that ABC-SN outperforms DASH, and we discuss the possibility that modern SN spectra datasets contain label noise which limit the performance of all classifiers.</description>

      <title>Key Physical Parameters Influencing Fragmentation and Multiplicity in Dense Cores of Orion A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When dense cores in molecular clouds or filamentary structures collapse and form protostars, they may undergo fragmentation and form binary or multiple systems. In this paper, we investigated the key mechanisms influencing fragmentation by comparing the physical conditions of fragmented and unfragmented dense cores (~0.1 pc) in Orion A. Utilizing archival submillimeter continuum data from the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array survey of Class 0 and I protostars at a 0.''1 resolution, we identified 38 dense cores hosting single protostars and 15 cores hosting binary or multiple systems. We measured the dense cores properties with the Herschel dust temperature, Nobeyama 45m N$_2$H$^+$ J=1-0, and JCMT polarization data. Our results reveal that the dense cores hosting binary/multiple systems exhibit significantly higher density and Mach number compared to those hosting single protostars, while there are no correlations between the occurrence of fragmentation and the energy ratios of turbulence and magnetic field to gravity. Our results suggest that the higher density and supersonic turbulence of the dense cores can lead to local collapse and fragmentation to form binary/multiple systems, while the magnetic field has limited influence on fragmentation in the dense cores in Orion A.</description>

      <title>Sulfur oxides tracing streamers and shocks at low mass protostellar disk-envelope interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion shocks are thought to play a crucial role in the early stages of star and planet formation, but their direct observational evidence remains elusive, particularly regarding the molecular tracers of these processes. In this work, we searched for features of accretion shocks by observing the emission of SO and SO$_2$ using ALMA in Band 6 towards nearby Class I protostars. We analyze the SO and SO$_2$ emission from Oph IRS 63, DK Cha, and L1527, which have different disk inclination angles, ranging from nearly face-on to edge-on. SO emission is found to be concentrated in rings at the centrifugal barriers of the infalling envelopes. These rings are projected onto the plane of the sky as ellipses or parallel slabs, depending on the inclination angles. Spiral-like streamers with SO emission are also common, with warm ($T_{\rm ex} &gt; 50$ K) and even hot ($T_{\rm ex} \gtrsim 100$ K) spots or segments of SO$_2$ observed near the centrifugal barriers. Inspired by these findings, we present a model that consistently explains the accretion shock traced by SO and SO$_2$, where the shock occurs primarily in two regions: (1) the centrifugal barriers, and (2) the surface of the disk-like inner envelope outside the centrifugal barrier. The outer envelope gains angular momentum through outflows, causing it to fall onto the midplane at or outside the centrifugal barrier, leading to a disk-like inner envelope that is pressure-confined by the accretion shock and moves in a rotating-and-infalling motion. We classify the streamers into two types--those in the midplane and those off the midplane. These streamers interact with the inner envelopes in different ways, resulting in different patterns of shocked regions. We suggest that the shock-related chemistry at the surfaces of the disk and the disk-like inner envelope warrants further special attention.</description>

      <title>A Flare-related Decimetric Type-IV Radio Burst Induced by the X2 Radiation of Electron Cyclotron Maser Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The radiation mechanism of decimetric wideband and pulsating radio bursts from the Sun (in terms of decimetric type-IV (t-IVdm) burst) and other flaring stars is a long-standing problem. Early investigations were based on the leading-spot hypothesis for the sun and yielded contradictory results. Here, we analyzed the flare-associated t-IVdm burst on 20110924 with medium-strong levels of polarization and from sources near a sunspot. We found that the emission is intermittent and the maximum $T_B$ exceeds 10$^{11}$ K, with well-defined upper and lower frequency cutoffs. The radio sources are left-handed polarized, located above the sunspot with a negative polarity. The sources align well with the sites of the second harmonic of the local electron gyrofrequency. These findings provide essential evidence that the burst is induced by the electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) in the harmonic X mode. We further modeled the transport of downward-streaming energetic electrons along a coronal loop and found most electrons get mirrored within the specific altitude range of 20-100 Mm. This explains why such bursts tend to have well-defined spectral ranges. We also found the ECME-radiating energetic electrons exhibit a shell-like VDF instead of the generally-presumed loss-cone distribution. The study greatly expands the application of ECME in solar radio astronomy and provides solar samples for similar bursts from other flaring stars.</description>

      <title>Properties of neutron stars and strangeness-mixed stars from a pion mean-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of the static neutron stars and strangeness-mixed stars, based on the equations of state derived from a pion mean-field approach. Using the empirical data on the pion-nucleus scattering and bulk properties of nuclear matter, we have already fixed all the parameters in a previous work, where the nucleons and hyperons were shown to be modified in various nuclear medium. In the current work, we first examine the energy and pressure inside a neutron star. We show that the central densities in various neutron stars vary within the range of $(3-4)\rho_0$, where $\rho_0$ is the normal nuclear matter density. The mass-radius relations are obtained and discussed. As the slope parameter for neutron matter increases, the radii of the neutron stars increase with their masses fixed. We also study the strangeness-mixed stars or the hyperon stars using the same sets of the parameters. As the strangeness content of strange matter increases, the binding energy per nucleon is saturated and the corresponding equation of state becomes softened. Consequently, the central densities of the strangeness-mixed stars increase. Assuming that recently observed neutron stars are the strangeness-mixed ones, we find that the central densities increase.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Radii from Laboratory Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our present knowledge of the nuclear equation of state is briefly reviewed in this article intended for a wider readership. Particular emphasis is given to the asymmetric-matter equation of state required for modeling neutron stars, neutron-star mergers, and r-process nucleosynthesis. Recent analyses based on combining information obtained from nuclear theory, heavy-ion collisions and astrophysical observations confine the obtained radii of the canonical 1.4-solar-mass neutron star to values between 12 km and 13 km. The remaining uncertainty is primarily related to missing information in the density interval between nuclear saturation density and about twice that value which, however, is accessible with laboratory experiments.</description>
