      <title>DNATokenizer: A GPU-First Byte-to-Identifier Tokenizer for High-Throughput DNA Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tokenization sits at the boundary between high-throughput genomic input and GPU compute, posing challenges in both algorithm design and system throughput. Overlapping k-mer tokenization can introduce information leakage under masked language modeling (MLM) and may degrade downstream accuracy. Single-nucleotide tokenization avoids leakage and preserves per-base fidelity, but it greatly increases sequence length for attention-based architectures. Non-overlapping k-mers and byte-pair encoding (BPE) provide compression and avoid leakage, at the cost of boundary sensitivity or reduced interpretability. Empirically, the choice of tokenization interacts strongly with model architecture and task requirements. At the system level, however, standard string tokenizers and host-bound vocabulary lookups dominate wall-clock time once inputs reach billions of bases, regardless of the tokenization algorithm. We present DNATok, a high-performance, GPU-first tokenization system that replaces general-purpose string processing with byte lookup table (LUT)-based identifier streaming and an overlapped host-to-device (H2D)/compute pipeline using pinned memory and architectural parallelism. DNATok is vocabulary-agnostic: it accelerates single-nucleotide, non-overlapping k-mer, and BPE tokenization, and integrates as a drop-in systems layer beneath genomic foundation models. DNATok achieves 84-95x higher encoding throughput than optimized Hugging Face baselines and up to 1.9x higher H2D throughput. End-to-end streaming reaches 1.27-1.84e8 tokens/s depending on configuration, effectively removing tokenization as a bottleneck for production-scale training and inference.</description>

      <title>Open World Knowledge Aided Single-Cell Foundation Model with Robust Cross-Modal Cell-Language Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in single-cell multi-omics, particularly RNA-seq, have provided profound insights into cellular heterogeneity and gene regulation. While pre-trained language model (PLM) paradigm based single-cell foundation models have shown promise, they remain constrained by insufficient integration of in-depth individual profiles and neglecting the influence of noise within multi-modal data. To address both issues, we propose an Open-world Language Knowledge-Aided Robust Single-Cell Foundation Model (OKR-CELL). It is built based on a cross-modal Cell-Language pre-training framework, which comprises two key innovations: (1) leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) based workflow with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enriches cell textual descriptions using open-world knowledge; (2) devising a Cross-modal Robust Alignment (CRA) objective that incorporates sample reliability assessment, curriculum learning, and coupled momentum contrastive learning to strengthen the model's resistance to noisy data. After pretraining on 32M cell-text pairs, OKR-CELL obtains cutting-edge results across 6 evaluation tasks. Beyond standard benchmarks such as cell clustering, cell-type annotation, batch-effect correction, and few-shot annotation, the model also demonstrates superior performance in broader multi-modal applications, including zero-shot cell-type annotation and bidirectional cell-text retrieval.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking LLM-based Agents for Single-cell Omics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The surge in multimodal single-cell omics data exposes limitations in traditional, manually defined analysis workflows. AI agents offer a paradigm shift, enabling adaptive planning, executable code generation, traceable decisions, and real-time knowledge fusion. However, the lack of a comprehensive benchmark critically hinders progress. We introduce a novel benchmarking evaluation system to rigorously assess agent capabilities in single-cell omics analysis. This system comprises: a unified platform compatible with diverse agent frameworks and LLMs; multidimensional metrics assessing cognitive program synthesis, collaboration, execution efficiency, bioinformatics knowledge integration, and task completion quality; and 50 diverse real-world single-cell omics analysis tasks spanning multi-omics, species, and sequencing technologies. Our evaluation reveals that Grok-3-beta achieves state-of-the-art performance among tested agent frameworks. Multi-agent frameworks significantly enhance collaboration and execution efficiency over single-agent approaches through specialized role division. Attribution analyses of agent capabilities identify that high-quality code generation is crucial for task success, and self-reflection has the most significant overall impact, followed by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and planning. This work highlights persistent challenges in code generation, long-context handling, and context-aware knowledge retrieval, providing a critical empirical foundation and best practices for developing robust AI agents in computational biology.</description>
