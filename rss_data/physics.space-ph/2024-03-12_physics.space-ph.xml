      <title>Particle Trapping and Acceleration in Turbulent Post-flare Coronal Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of energetic-electron trapping and acceleration in the Kelvin-Helmholtz-induced magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence of post-flare loops in the solar corona. Using the particle-tracing capabilities of MPI-AMRVAC 3.0, we evolve ensembles of test electrons (i.e. without feedback to the underlying MHD) inside the turbulent looptop, using the guiding-center approximation. With the MHD looptop model of Ruan et al. 2018, we investigate the relation between turbulence and particle trapping inside the looptop structure, showing that better-developed turbulent cascades result in more efficient trapping primarily due to mirror effects. We then quantify the electron acceleration in the time-evolving MHD turbulence, and find that ideal-MHD processes inside the looptop can produce nonthermal particle spectra from an initial Maxwellian distribution. Electrons in this turbulence are preferentially accelerated by mirror effects in the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field while remaining confined within small regions of space between magnetic islands. Assuming dominance of Bremsstrahlung radiation mechanisms, we employ the resulting information from accelerated electrons (combined with the MHD background) to construct HXR spectra of the post-flare loop that include nonthermal-particle contributions. Our results pave the way to constructing more realistic simulations of radiative coronal structure for comparison with current and future observations.</description>

      <title>Type IV-like Solar Radio Burst Consisting of a Series of Spikes Observed by PSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar and interplanetary radio bursts can reflect the existence and motion of energetic electrons and are therefore a kind of vital phenomenon in solar activities. The present study reported a solar radio burst (SRB) event observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) in its 8th orbital encounter phase, and it lasted about 20 hours in a frequency range of 0.5-15 MHz, called the type IV-like SRB. This type IV-like SRB consists of a series of numerous spikes with the center-frequency drifting slowly from ~5 MHz to ~1 MHz, and each individual spike appears a much faster frequency drifting and has a narrow frequency range of a few MHz and short duration of a few minutes. Based on the empirical models of the solar atmosphere adopted commonly, combining the in-situ measurement by PSP, we propose that these small-scale spikes were generated by a group of solitary kinetic Alfv\'en waves (SKAWs) in a magnetic loop accompanying coronal mass ejection (CME) and moving outwards, in which the frequency drifting of individual spike is caused by the SKAW's propagation and the center-frequency drifting may be attributed to the motion of the magnetic loop.</description>
