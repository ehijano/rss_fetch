      <title>Phase induced localization transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization phenomenon is an important research field in condensed matter physics. However, due to the complexity and subtlety of disordered syestems, new localization phenomena always emerge unexpectedly. For example, it is generally believed that the phase of the hopping term does not affect the localization properties of the system, so the calculation of the phase is often ignored in the study of localization. Here, we introduce a quasiperiodic model and demonstrate that the phase change of the hopping term can significantly alter the localization properties of the system through detailed numerical simulations such as the inverse participation ratio and multifractal analysis. This phase-induced localization transition provides valuable information for the study of localization physics.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization versus hopping asymmetry in a disordered lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of non-Hermitian photonics, we investigate the interplay between disorder and non-Hermiticity in a one-dimensional Hatano-Nelson lattice. While Anderson localization dictates the wave's evolution in conservative random systems, the introduction of non-Hermiticity tends to force the beam to unidirectionally propagate towards one edge of the potential due to the existence of skin modes. As we show, the antagonism between these effects results in qualitatively distinct phases of wave diffraction, including counter-intuitive characteristics regarding the relationship between the strength of disorder and the wavepacket's velocity.</description>

      <title>Sampling from the Continuous Random Energy Model in Total Variation Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The continuous random energy model (CREM) is a toy model of spin glasses on $\{0,1\}^N$ that, in the limit, exhibits an infinitely hierarchical correlation structure. We give two polynomial-time algorithms to approximately sample from the Gibbs distribution of the CREM in the high-temperature regime, based on a Markov chain and a sequential sampler. The running time depends algebraically on the desired TV distance and failure probability and exponentially in $(1/g')^{O(1)}$, where $g'$ is the gap to a certain inverse temperature threshold; this contrasts with previous results which only attain $o(N)$ accuracy in KL divergence. If the covariance function $A$ of the CREM is concave, the algorithms work up to the critical threshold $\beta_c$, which is the static phase transition point; moreover, for certain $A$, the algorithms work up to the known algorithmic threshold $\beta_G$ proposed in Addario-Berry and Maillard (2020) for non-trivial sampling guarantees. Our result depends on quantitative bounds for the fluctuation of the partition function and a new contiguity result of the ``tilted" CREM obtained from sampling, which is of independent interest. We also show that the spectral gap is exponentially small with high probability, suggesting that the algebraic dependence is unavoidable with a Markov chain approach.</description>

      <title>Encoding arbitrary Ising Hamiltonians on Spatial Photonic Ising Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic Ising Machines constitute an emergent new paradigm of computation, geared towards tackling combinatorial optimization problems that can be reduced to the problem of finding the ground state of an Ising model. Spatial Photonic Ising Machines have proven to be advantageous for simulating fully connected large-scale spin systems. However, fine control of a general interaction matrix $J$ has so far only been accomplished through eigenvalue decomposition methods that either limit the scalability or increase the execution time of the optimization process. We introduce and experimentally validate a SPIM instance that enables direct control over the full interaction matrix, enabling the encoding of Ising Hamiltonians with arbitrary couplings and connectivity. We demonstrate the conformity of the experimentally measured Ising energy with the theoretically expected values and then proceed to solve both the unweighted and weighted graph partitioning problems, showcasing a systematic convergence to an optimal solution via simulated annealing. Our approach greatly expands the applicability of SPIMs for real-world applications without sacrificing any of the inherent advantages of the system, and paves the way to encoding the full range of NP problems that are known to be equivalent to Ising models, on SPIM devices.</description>

      <title>The Self-Organized Criticality Paradigm in Economics &amp; Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ``Self-Organised Criticality'' (SOC) is the mechanism by which complex systems spontaneously settle close to a *critical point*, at the edge between stability and chaos, and characterized by fat-tailed fluctuations and long-memory correlations. Such a scenario may explain why insignificant perturbations can generate large disruptions, through the propagation of ``avalanches'' across the system. In this short review, we discuss how SOC could offer a plausible solution to the excess volatility puzzle in financial markets and the analogue ``small shocks, large business cycle puzzle'' for the economy at large, as initially surmised by Per Bak et al. in 1993. We argue that in general the quest for efficiency and the necessity of *resilience* may be mutually incompatible and require specific policy considerations.</description>

      <title>Pole Analysis of the Inter-Replica Correlation Function in a Two-Replica System as a Binary Mixture: Mean Overlap in the Cluster Glass Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To investigate the cluster glass phase of ultrasoft particles, we examine an annealed two-replica system endowed with an attractive inter-replica field similar to that of a binary symmetric electrolyte. Leveraging this analogy, we conduct pole analysis on the total correlation functions in the two-replica system where the inter-replica field will eventually be switched off. By synthesizing discussions grounded in the pole analysis with a hierarchical view of the free-energy landscape, we derive an analytical form of the mean overlap between two replicas within the mean field approximation of the Gaussian core model. This formula elucidates novel numerical findings observed in the cluster glass phase.</description>

      <title>Operator Growth in Disordered Spin Chains: Indications for the Absence of Many-Body Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the growth of a local operator $A$ in one-dimensional many-body systems with Hamiltonian $H$ by calculating the $k$-fold commutator $[H,[H,[...,[H,A]]]]$. We derive general bounds for the operator norm of this commutator in free and interacting fermionic systems with and without disorder thus directly connecting the {\it operator growth hypothesis} with questions of localization. We show, in particular, that in a localized system the norm does grow at most exponentially and that the contributions of operators to the total norm are exponentially suppressed with their length. We support our general results by considering one specific example, the XXZ chain with random magnetic fields. We solve the operator spreading in the XX case without disorder exactly. For the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models we provide strict upper bounds. We support our results by symbolic calculations of the commutator up to high orders. For the XXX case with random magnetic fields, these symbolic calculations show a growth of the operator norm faster than exponential and consistent with the general bound for an ergodic system. Also, there is no exponential decay of the contribution of operators as function of their length. We conclude that there is no indication for a many-body localization transition. Finally, we also discuss the differences between the interacting and non-interacting cases when trying to perturbatively transform the microscopic to an effective Hamiltonian of local conserved charges by consecutive Schrieffer-Wolff transformations. We find that such an approach is not well-defined in the interacting case because the transformation generates $\sim 4^\ell$ terms connecting sites a distance $\ell$ apart which can overwhelm the exponential decay with $\ell$ of the amplitude of each individual term.</description>

      <title>Unscrambling of single-particle wave functions in systems localized through disorder and monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10725v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In systems undergoing localization-delocalization quantum phase transitions due to disorder or monitoring, there is a crucial need for robust methods capable of distinguishing phases and uncovering their intrinsic properties. In this work, we develop a process of finding a Slater determinant representation of free-fermion wave functions that accurately characterizes localized particles, a procedure we dub "unscrambling". The central idea is to minimize the overlap between envelopes of single-particle wave functions or, equivalently, to maximize the inverse participation ratio of each orbital. This numerically efficient methodology can differentiate between distinct types of wave functions: exponentially localized, power-law localized, and conformal critical, also revealing the underlying physics of these states. The method is readily extendable to systems in higher dimensions. Furthermore, we apply this approach to a more challenging problem involving disordered monitored free fermions in one dimension, where the unscrambling process unveils the presence of a conformal critical phase and a localized area-law quantum Zeno phase. Importantly, our method can also be extended to free fermion systems without particle number conservation, which we demonstrate by estimating the phase diagram of $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric disordered monitored free fermions. Our results unlock the potential of utilizing single-particle wave functions to gain valuable insights into the localization transition properties in systems such as monitored free fermions and disordered models.</description>

      <title>Correlated Noise in Epoch-Based Stochastic Gradient Descent: Implications for Weight Variances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) has become a cornerstone of neural network optimization, yet the noise introduced by SGD is often assumed to be uncorrelated over time, despite the ubiquity of epoch-based training. In this work, we challenge this assumption and investigate the effects of epoch-based noise correlations on the stationary distribution of discrete-time SGD with momentum, limited to a quadratic loss. Our main contributions are twofold: first, we calculate the exact autocorrelation of the noise for training in epochs under the assumption that the noise is independent of small fluctuations in the weight vector, and find that SGD noise is anti-correlated in time. Second, we explore the influence of these anti-correlations on SGD dynamics. We find that for directions with a curvature greater than a hyperparameter-dependent crossover value, the results for uncorrelated noise are recovered. However, for relatively flat directions, the weight variance is significantly reduced, and our variance prediction leads to a considerable reduction in loss fluctuations as compared to the constant weight variance assumption.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum dynamics of observables at eigenstate transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00873v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is an outstanding goal to unveil the key features of quantum dynamics at eigenstate transitions. Focusing on quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians that exhibit localization transitions, we identify physical observables that exhibit scale-invariant critical dynamics at the transition when quenched from the initially localized charge density-wave states. The identification is based on two ingredients: (a) A relationship between the time evolution of observables in a many-body state and the transition probabilities of single-particle states, and (b) scale invariance of transition probabilities, which generalizes the corresponding recent result for survival probabilities [M. Hopjan and L. Vidmar, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 060404 (2023); Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 043301 (2023)]. These properties suggest that the scale-invariant critical dynamics in the quantum-quench dynamics is also exhibited by the observables, which share the common eigenbasis with the Hamiltonian before the quench. Focusing on experimentally relevant observables such as site occupations and the particle imbalance, we numerically demonstrate their critical behavior at the eigenstate transitions in the three-dimensional Anderson model and the one-dimensional Aubry-Andr\'e model model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general class of machine learning algorithms called parametric matrix models. In contrast with most existing machine learning models that imitate the biology of neurons, parametric matrix models use matrix equations that emulate the physics of quantum systems. Similar to how physics problems are usually solved, parametric matrix models learn the governing equations that lead to the desired outputs. Parametric matrix models can be efficiently trained from empirical data, and the equations may use algebraic, differential, or integral relations. While originally designed for scientific computing, we prove that parametric matrix models are universal function approximators that can be applied to general machine learning problems. After introducing the underlying theory, we apply parametric matrix models to a series of different challenges that show their performance for a wide range of problems. For all the challenges tested here, parametric matrix models produce accurate results within an efficient and interpretable computational framework that allows for input feature extrapolation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17563v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models can exhibit what appears to be a sudden ability to solve a new problem as training time, training data, or model size increases, a phenomenon known as emergence. In this paper, we present a framework where each new ability (a skill) is represented as a basis function. We solve a simple multi-linear model in this skill-basis, finding analytic expressions for the emergence of new skills, as well as for scaling laws of the loss with training time, data size, model size, and optimal compute ($C$). We compare our detailed calculations to direct simulations of a two-layer neural network trained on multitask sparse parity, where the tasks in the dataset are distributed according to a power-law. Our simple model captures, using a single fit parameter, the sigmoidal emergence of multiple new skills as training time, data size or model size increases in the neural network.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of emergent cluster states by measurement from symmetry-protected-topological states with large symmetry to subsystem cat state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose {\it measurement-producing hierarchy} emerging among correlated states by sequential subsystem projective measurements. We start from symmetry-protected-topological (SPT) cluster states with a large symmetry and apply sequential subsystem projective measurements to them and find that generalized cluster SPT states with a reduced symmetry appear in the subsystem of the unmeasured sites. That prescription finally produces Greenberger-Home-Zeilinger states with long-range order in the subsystem composed of periodic unmeasured sites of the original lattice. The symmetry-reduction hierarchical structure from a general large symmetric SPT cluster state is clearly captured by the measurement update flow in the efficient algorithm of stabilizer formalism. This approach is useful not only for the analytical search for the measured state but also for numerical simulation with a large system size. We also numerically verify the symmetry-reduction hierarchy by sequential subsystem projective measurements applied to large systems and large symmetric cluster SPT states.</description>

      <title>Protect Measurement-Induced Phase Transition from Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT) is a novel non-equilibrium phase transition characterized by entanglement entropy. The scrambling dynamics induced by random unitary gates can protect information from low-rate measurements. However, common decoherence noises, such as dephasing, are detrimental to the volume law phase, posing a significant challenge for observing MIPT in current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate that incorporating quantum-enhanced operations can effectively protect MIPT from environmental noise. The conditional entanglement entropy is associated with a statistical mechanics model wherein noise and quantum-enhanced operations act as two competing external random fields. Then we show that an average apparatus-environment exchange symmetry ensures the conditional entanglement entropy is a valid probe of entanglement. Furthermore, we provide numerical evidence on a (2+1)-d quantum circuit under dephasing noise, demonstrating that MIPT can indeed be observed with the aid of quantum-enhanced operations. This result not only serves as a concrete example of the power of quantum enhancement in combating noise but also holds experimental relevance, as the protocol is straightforward to implement in practice.</description>
