      <title>Understanding and Tuning Magnetism in van der Waals-type Metal Thiophosphates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, significant progress in two-dimensional (2D) materials has invigorated research in condensed matter and material physics in low dimensions. While traditionally studied in three-dimensional systems, magnetism has now been extended to the 2D realm. Recent breakthroughs in 2D magnetism have captured substantial interest from the scientific community, owing to the stable magnetic order achievable in atomically thin layers of the van der Waals (vdW)-type layered magnetic materials. These advances offer an exciting platform for investigating related phenomena in low dimensions and hold promise for spintronic applications. Consequently, vdW magnetic materials with tunable magnetism have attracted significant attention. Specifically, antiferromagnetic metal thiophosphates MPX3 (M = transition metal, P = phosphorus, X = chalcogen) have been investigated extensively. These materials exhibit long-range magnetic orders spanning from bulk to the 2D limit. The magnetism in MPX3 arises from localized moments associated with transition metal ions, making it tunable via substitutions and intercalations. In this review, we focus on such tuning by providing a comprehensive summary of various metal- and chalcogen-substitution and intercalation studies, along with the mechanism of magnetism modulation, and a perspective on the development of this emergent material family.</description>

      <title>Confinement of quasi-atomic structures in Ti$_2$N and Ti$_3$N$_2$ MXene Electrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal carbides, nitrides, or carbonitrides of early transition metals, better known as MXenes, possess notable structural, electrical, and magnetic properties. Analyzing electronic structures by calculating structural stability, band structure, density of states, Bader charge transfer, and work functions utilizing first principle calculations, we revealed that titanium nitride Mxenes, namely Ti$_2$N and Ti$_3$N$_2$, have excess anionic electrons in their pseudo-atomic structure inside the crystal lattice, making them MXene electrides. Bulk Ti$_3$N$_2$ has competing antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic(FM) configurations with slightly more stable AFM configurations, while the Ti$_2$N MXene is nonmagnetic. Although Ti$_3$N$_2$ favors AFM configurations with hexagonal crystal systems having $6/mmm$ point group symmetry, Ti$_3$N$_2$ does not support altermagnetism. The monolayer of the Ti$_3$N$_2$ MXene is a ferromagnetic electride. These unique properties of having non-nuclear interstitial anionic electrons in the electronic structure of titanium nitride MXene have not yet been reported in the literature. Density functional theory calculations show TiN is neither an electride, MXene, or magnetic.</description>

      <title>Electronic Landscape of Group-5 Transition Metal Ditellurides $M$Te$_2$ ($M$ = V, Nb, Ta): Multiple Crystal Phases with Local Bonds and Flat Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group-5 transition metal ditellurides $M$Te$_2$ ($M$ = V, Nb, Ta) are unique CdI$_2$-type layered materials that exhibit peculiar quasi-one-dimensional intralayer superstructures, known as ribbon-chains and butterfly-like clusters of $M$ atoms. In this review article, we attempt to systematically understand their electronic band structures based on our recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) studies and first-principles calculations. We underscore the role of the localized molecular-like orbital bonds that form the anomalous flat bands in the momentum space, and demonstrate how they influence the Fermi surface anisotropy, phase stabilities of crystal structures, and nontrivial topological properties in some cases. We also elaborate the future prospects for novel quantum phenomena that can be realized in these materials.</description>

      <title>Phonon screening of excitons in atomically thin semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomically thin semiconductors, encompassing both 2D materials and quantum wells, exhibit a pronounced enhancement of excitonic effects due to geometric confinement. Consequently, these materials have become foundational platforms for the exploration and utilization of excitons. Recent ab initio studies have demonstrated that phonons can substantially screen electron-hole interactions in bulk semiconductors and strongly modify the properties of excitons. While excitonic properties of atomically thin semiconductors have been the subject of extensive theoretical investigations, the role of phonon screening on excitons in atomically thin structures remains unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate via ab initio GW-Bethe-Salpeter equation calculations that phonon screening can have a significant impact on optical excitations in atomically thin semiconductors. We further show that the degree of phonon screening can be tuned by structural engineering. We focus on atomically thin GaN quantum wells embedded in AlN and identify specific phonons in the surrounding material, AlN, that dramatically alter the lowest-lying exciton in monolayer GaN via screening. Our studies provide new intuition beyond standard models into the interplay among structural properties, phonon characteristics, and exciton properties in atomically thin semiconductors, and have implications for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Controllable and Fast Growth of High-Quality Atomically Thin and Atomically Flat Bi$_2$O$_2$Se Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a novel and promising 2D material, bismuth oxyselenide (Bi$_2$O$_2$Se) has demonstrated significant potential to overcome existing technical barriers in various electronic device applications, due to its unique physical properties like high symmetry, adjustable electronic structure, ultra-high electron mobility. However, the rapid growth of Bi$_2$O$_2$Se films down to a few atomic layers with precise control remains a significant challenge. In this work, the growth of two-dimensional (2D) Bi$_2$O$_2$Se thin films by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) method is systematically investigated. By controlling temperature, oxygen pressure, laser energy density and laser emission frequency, we successfully prepare atomically thin and flat Bi$_2$O$_2$Se (001) thin films on the (001) surface of SrTiO3. Importantly, we provide a fundamental and unique perspective toward understanding the growth process of atomically thin and flat Bi$_2$O$_2$Se films, and the growth process can be primarily summarized into four steps: i) anisotropic non-spontaneous nucleation preferentially along the step roots; ii) monolayer Bi$_2$O$_2$Se nanosheets expanding across the surrounding area, and eventually covering the entire STO substrate step; iii) vertical growth of Bi$_2$O$_2$Se monolayer in a 2D Frank-van der Merwe (FM) epitaxial growth, and iv) with a layer-by-layer 2D FM growth mode, ultimately producing an atomically flat and epitaxially aligned thin film. Moreover, the combined results of the crystallinity quality, surface morphology and the chemical states manifest the successful PLD-growth of high-quality Bi$_2$O$_2$Se films in a controllable and fast mode.</description>

      <title>Molecular Beam Epitaxy Growth and Doping Modulation of Topological Semimetal NiTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, high-quality thin films of the topological semimetal phase NiTe$_2$ were prepared using molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) technique, confirmed through X-ray diffraction with pronounced Laue oscillations. Electrical transport experiments reveal that thick films have properties similar to bulk materials. By employing co-deposition, we introduced either magnetic or non-magnetic elements during the growth of thinner films, significantly altering their electrical properties. Notably, magnetic element Cr induces long-range ferromagnetic ordering, leading to the observation of significant anomalous Hall effect in NiTe2 thin films. The Hall conductivity remains nearly constant well below the Curie temperature, indicating the correlation with the intrinsic topological nature of the band structure. Theoretical first principles band calculations support the generation of the Weyl semimetal state in the material through magnetic doping. These findings pave the way for exploring more magnetic Weyl semimetal materials and related low-dimensional quantum devices based on topological semimetal materials.</description>

      <title>+SSLIP: Automated Radon-assisted and Rotation-corrected identification of complex HCP slip system activity fields from DIC data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification of crystallographic slip in metals and alloys is crucial to understand and improve their mechanical behavior. Recently, a novel slip system identification framework, termed SSLIP (for Slip System-based Local Identification of Plasticity), was introduced to leap from conventional trace-based identification to automated, point-by-point identification that exploits the full deformation kinematics. Using microstructure-correlated deformation data, SSLIP matches the measured in-plane displacement gradient tensor to the kinematics of the optimal combination of multiple slip system activities, at each DIC datapoint. SSLIP was applied and demonstrated to be successful on virtual and experimental case studies of FCC and BCC metals. However, for more advanced and anisotropic HCP crystal structures the complete identification of all slip systems was found to be more challenging, posing limitations on automation and flexibility. Here, we propose a significant extension to the SSLIP framework with the aim of automated slip system identification of HCP. The main extensions of the SSLIP method, hereinafter referred to as the +SSLIP method, include (i) a pre-selection of slip systems using a Radon transform, (ii) robustness to measured rigid body rotation by simultaneous identification of the local elastic rotation field, (iii) identification of the two best matching slip systems for each data point, and (iv) a procedure to deal with slip systems with in-plane displacement gradient tensors that cannot be discriminated, yielding the full slip system activity maps with all slip systems for each grain. The resulting objective identification method does not rely on, e.g., the Schmid factor to select which slip system is active at each point. We show how slip systems from multiple slip families are successfully identified on virtual and real experiments on a Zn polycrystalline coating.</description>

      <title>Slow Voltage Relaxation of Silicon Nanoparticles with a Chemo-Mechanical Core-Shell Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon presents itself as a high-capacity anode material for lithium-ion batteries with a promising future. The high ability for lithiation comes along with massive volume changes and a problematic voltage hysteresis, causing reduced efficiency, detrimental heat generation, and a complicated state-of-charge estimation. During slow cycling, amorphous silicon nanoparticles show a larger voltage hysteresis than after relaxation periods. Interestingly, the voltage relaxes for at least several days, which has not been physically explained so far. We apply a chemo-mechanical continuum model in a core-shell geometry interpreted as a silicon particle covered by the solid-electrolyte interphase to account for the hysteresis phenomena. The silicon core (de)lithiates during every cycle while the covering shell is chemically inactive. The visco-elastoplastic behavior of the shell explains the voltage hysteresis during cycling and after relaxation. We identify a logarithmic voltage relaxation, which fits with the established Garofalo law for viscosity. Our chemo-mechanical model describes the observed voltage hysteresis phenomena and outperforms the empirical Plett model. In addition to our full model, we present a reduced model to allow for easy voltage profile estimations. The presented results support the mechanical explanation of the silicon voltage hysteresis with a core-shell model and encourage further efforts into the investigation of the silicon anode mechanics.</description>

      <title>PSP-GEN: Stochastic inversion of the Process-Structure-Property chain in materials design through deep, generative probabilistic modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse material design is a cornerstone challenge in materials science, with significant applications across many industries. Traditional approaches that invert the structure-property (SP) linkage to identify microstructures with targeted properties often overlook the feasibility of production processes, leading to microstructures that may not be manufacturable. Achieving both desired properties and a realizable manufacturing procedure necessitates inverting the entire Process-Structure-Property (PSP) chain. However, this task is fraught with challenges, including stochasticity along the whole modeling chain, the high dimensionality of microstructures and process parameters, and the inherent ill-posedness of the inverse problem. This paper proposes a novel framework, named PSP-GEN, for the goal-oriented material design that effectively addresses these challenges by modeling the entire PSP chain with a deep generative model. It employs two sets of continuous, microstructure- and property-aware, latent variables, the first of which provides a lower-dimensional representation that captures the stochastic aspects of microstructure generation, while the second is a direct link to processing parameters. This structured, low-dimensional embedding not only simplifies the handling of high-dimensional microstructure data but also facilitates the application of gradient-based optimization techniques. The effectiveness and efficiency of this method are demonstrated in the inverse design of two-phase materials, where the objective is to design microstructures with target effective permeability. We compare state-of-the-art alternatives in challenging settings involving limited training data, target property regions for which no training data is available, and design tasks where the process parameters and microstructures have high-dimensional representations.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale spin rectifiers for harvesting ambient radiofrequency energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiofrequency harvesting using ambient wireless energy could be used to reduce the carbon footprint of electronic devices. However, ambient radiofrequency energy is weak (less than -20 dBm), and thermodynamic limits and high-frequency parasitic impedance restrict the performance of state-of-the-art radiofrequency rectifiers. Nanoscale spin rectifiers based on magnetic tunnel junctions have recently demonstrated high sensitivity, but suffer from a low a.c.-to-d.c. conversion efficiency (less than 1%). Here, we report a sensitive spin rectifier rectenna that can harvest ambient radiofrequency signals between -62 and -20 dBm. We also develop an on-chip co-planar waveguide-based spin rectifier array with a large zero-bias sensitivity (around 34,500 mV/mW) and high efficiency (7.81%). Self-parametric excitation driven by voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy is a key mechanism that contributes to the performance of the spin-rectifier array. We show that these spin rectifiers can wirelessly power a sensor at a radiofrequency power of -27 dBm.</description>

      <title>Origin of unexpected weak Gilbert damping in the LSMO/Pt bilayer system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the Gilbert damping in La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) and La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$/Pt (LSMO/Pt) heterostructures using first-principles calculations and Wannier interpolation techniques. Our work is motivated by recent experimental observations showing smaller Gilbert damping in LSMO/Pt films compared to their reference single-layer LSMO films, despite expectations of enhanced spin-pumping effects in the former. We analyze the electronic structures and transport behaviors, finding that LSMO thin films have a high spin Hall angle ($|{\theta_{\mathrm{SH}}}|$). However, in LSMO/Pt, the presence of platinum significantly increases longitudinal conductivity, reducing $|\theta_{\mathrm{SH}}|$. Despite the lower $|\theta_{\mathrm{SH}}|$, LSMO/Pt shows a notable anti-damping contribution to Gilbert damping due to a larger spin diffusion length. In contrast, pure LSMO films with large $|\theta_{\mathrm{SH}}|$ exhibit higher damping due to efficient spin-to-charge conversion via a self-induced inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE), as reported in a recent experiment. Finally, this work demonstrates that by fine-tuning the ratio of spin Hall conductivity to longitudinal charge conductivity, it is possible to engineer heterostructures with desired spin-to-charge or charge-to-spin conversion efficiencies even with weaker spin-orbit couplings.</description>

      <title>Displacive Jahn--Teller transition in NaNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Below its Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T_\mathrm{JT}$, NaNiO$_2$ has a monoclinic layered structure consisting of alternating layers of edge-sharing NaO$_6$ and Jahn-Teller-distorted NiO$_6$ octahedra. Above $T_\mathrm{JT}$ where NaNiO$_2$ is rhombohedral, diffraction measurements show the absence of a cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion, accompanied by an increase in the unit cell volume. Using neutron total scattering, solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) experiments as local probes of the structure we find direct evidence for a displacive, as opposed to order-disorder Jahn-Teller transition at $T_\mathrm{JT}$. This is supported by \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. To our knowledge this study is the first to show a displacive Jahn-Teller transition in any material using direct observations with local probe techniques.</description>

      <title>Large Area Near-Field Thermophotovoltaics for Low Temperature Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermophotovoltaics, devices that convert thermal infrared photons to electricity, offer a key pathway for a variety of critical renewable energy technologies including thermal energy storage, waste heat recovery, and direct solar-thermal power generation. However, conventional far-field devices struggle to generate reasonable powers at lower temperatures. Near-field thermophotovoltaics provide a pathway to substantially higher powers by leveraging photon tunneling effects. Here we present a large area near-field thermophotovoltaic device, created with an epitaxial co-fabrication approach, that consists of a self-supported 0.28 cm2 emitter-cell pair with a 150 nm gap. The device generates 1.22 mW at 460 C, a twenty-five-fold increase over the same cell measured in a far-field configuration. Furthermore, the near-field device demonstrates short circuit current densities greater than the far-field photocurrent limit at all the temperatures tested, confirming the role of photon tunneling effects in the performance enhancement. Modeling suggests several practical directions for cell improvements and further increases in power density. These results highlight the promise of near-field thermophotovoltaics, especially for low temperature applications.</description>

      <title>Through-Thickness Modelling of Metal Rolling using Multiple-Scale Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new semi-analytic model of the metal rolling processes is presented and validated against finite element simulations. The model generalizes the classical Slab Method of cold rolling, and for the first time is able to predict the through-thickness stress and strain oscillations present in long-aspect-ratio roll gaps. The model is based on the asymptotic Method of Multiple-Scales, with the systematic assumptions of a long thin roll gap and a comparably small Coulomb friction coefficient. The leading-order solution varies only on the long length scale of the roll gap length $\hat{\ell}$, and matches with Slab Theory. The next-order correction varies on both the long length scale and the short length scale of the workpiece thickness $2\hat{h}_0$, and reveals rapid stress and strain oscillation both in the rolling direction and through-thickness. For this initial derivation, the model assumes a rigid perfectly-plastic material behaviour. Despite these strong assumptions, the model is shown to compare well with finite element simulations using realistic elasticity and hardening material models. These assumptions facilitate the simplest possible model to provide a foundational understanding of the complex through-thickness behaviour observed in the finite element simulations, while requiring an order of only seconds to compute. Matlab code for evaluating the model is provided in the supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Scaling behavior and giant field-enhancement of the thermal conductivity in the honeycomb antiferromagnet BaCo2(AsO4)2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The layered honeycomb material BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$ (BCAO) is of topical interest because its magnetic state is related to that of the Kitaev magnet $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Using thermal transport to probe how magnetic excitations interact with phonons, we have uncovered an unusually large enhancement of the thermal conductivity $\kappa_{xx}$ in an in-plane magnetic field ${\bf H}$. Just above the N\'{e}el temperature $T_{\rm N}$, a field of 13 T increases $\kappa_{xx}$ by a factor ($\sim 211$), much larger than reported previously in any magnetic insulator. Interestingly, $\kappa_{xx}(H,T)$ exhibits a scaling behavior in the entire magnetically disordered region that surrounds the ordered zigzag state.</description>

      <title>Ultra-steep slope cryogenic FETs based on bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic field-effect transistors (FETs) offer great potential for a wide range of applications, the most notable example being classical control electronics for quantum information processors. In the latter context, on-chip FETs with low power consumption are a crucial requirement. This, in turn, requires operating voltages in the millivolt range, which are only achievable in devices with ultra-steep subthreshold slopes. However, in conventional cryogenic metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)FETs based on bulk material, the experimentally achieved inverse subthreshold slopes saturate around a few mV/dec due to disorder and charged defects at the MOS interface. FETs based on two-dimensional materials offer a promising alternative. Here, we show that FETs based on Bernal stacked bilayer graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride and graphite gates exhibit inverse subthreshold slopes of down to 250 ${\mu}$V/dec at 0.1 K, approaching the Boltzmann limit. This result indicates an effective suppression of band tailing in van-der-Waals heterostructures without bulk interfaces, leading to superior device performance at cryogenic temperature.</description>

      <title>Exact average many-body interatomic interaction model for random alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the physical origin of deformation mechanisms in random alloys requires an understanding of their average behavior and, equally important, the role of local fluctuations around the average. Material properties of random alloys can be computed using direct simulations on random configurations but some properties are very difficult to compute, for others it is not even fully understood how to compute them using random sampling, in particular, interaction energies between multiple defects. To that end, we develop an atomistic model that does the averaging on the level of interatomic potentials. Then, the problem of averaging via random sampling is bypassed since computing material properties on random configurations reduces to computing material properties on a single crystal, the average alloy.
  We develop our average model on the class of linear machine-learning interatomic potentials. To that end, using tools from higher-order statistics, we derive an analytic expansion of the average many-body per-atom energy in terms of average tensor products of the feature vectors that scales linearly with the size of an atomic neighborhood. In order to avoid forming higher-order tensors composed of products of feature vectors, we develop an implementation using equivariant tensor network potentials in which the feature vectors are contracted to small-sized tensors before taking the average. We show that our average model predicts the compact screw dislocation core structure in the NbMoTaW medium-entropy alloy, in agreement with density functional theory, as opposed to state-of-the-art average embedded atom method potentials that predict artificial polarized cores. Hence, we anticipate that our model will become useful for understanding mechanistic origins of material properties and for developing predictive models of mechanical properties of random alloys.</description>

      <title>Artificially built Kondo chains with organic radicals on metallic surfaces: new model system of heavy fermion quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heavy fermion quantum criticality is an extremely rich domain of research which represents a framework to understand strange metals as a consequence of a Kondo breakdown transition. Here we provide an experimental realization of such systems in terms of organic radicals on a metallic surface. The ground state of organic radicals is a Kramer's doublet that can be modeled by a spin 1/2 degree of freedom. Using on-surface synthesis and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) tip manipulation, one can controllably engineer and characterize chains of organic radicals on a Au(111) surface. The spatial-resolved differential conductance reveals site-dependent low-energy excitations, which support the picture of emergent many-body Kondo physics. Using quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we show that a Kondo lattice model of spin chains on a metallic surface reproduces accurately the experimental results. This allows us to interpret the experimental results in terms of a heavy fermion metal, below the coherence temperature. We foresee that the tunability of these systems will pave the way to realize quantum simulators of heavy fermion criticality.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the light yield enhancement in polymeric composite scintillators loaded with dense nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast emitting polymeric scintillators are requested in advanced applications where high-speed detectors with large signal-to-noise ratio are needed. However, their low density implies a weak stopping power of high energy radiations, thus a limited light output and sensitivity. To enhance their performances, polymeric scintillators can be loaded with dense nanoparticles (NPs). We investigate the properties of a series of polymeric scintillators by means of photoluminescence and scintillation spectroscopy, comparing standard scintillators with a composite system loaded with dense hafnium dioxide (HfO2) NPs. The nanocomposite shows a scintillation yield enhancement of +100% with unchanged time response. We provide for the first time an interpretation of this effect, pointing out the local effect of NPs in the generation of emissive states upon interaction with the ionizing radiation. The obtained results indicate that coupling of fast conjugated emitters with optically inert dense NPs could allow to surpass the actual limits of pure polymeric scintillators.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-containing Surface Ligands Lead to False Positives for Photofixation of N$_2$ on Metal Oxide Nanocrystals: An Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many ligands commonly used to prepare nanoparticle catalysts with precise nanoscale features contain nitrogen (e.g., oleylamine); here, we found that the use of nitrogen-containing ligands during the synthesis of metal oxide nanoparticle catalysts substantially impacted product analysis during photocatalytic studies. We confirmed these experimental results via hybrid Density Functional Theory computations of the materials' electronic properties to evaluate their viability as photocatalysts for nitrogen reduction. This nitrogen ligand contamination, and subsequent interference in photocatalytic studies, is avoidable through the careful design of synthetic pathways that exclude nitrogen-containing constituents. This result highlights the urgent need for careful evaluation of catalyst synthesis protocols, as contamination by nitrogen-containing ligands may go unnoticed since the presence of nitrogen is often not detected or probed.</description>

Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnet heterostructures have emerged as new platforms to explore exotic magnetic orders and quantum phenomena. Here, we study heterostructures of layered antiferromagnets, CrI3 and CrCl3, with perpendicular and in-plane magnetic anisotropy, respectively. Using magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy, we demonstrate out-of-plane magnetic order in the CrCl3 layer proximal to CrI3, with ferromagnetic interfacial coupling between the two. Such an interlayer exchange field leads to higher critical temperature than that of either CrI3 or CrCl3 alone. We further demonstrate significant electric-field control of the coercivity, attributed to the naturally broken structural inversion symmetry of the heterostructure allowing unprecedented direct coupling between electric field and interfacial magnetism. These findings illustrate the opportunity to explore exotic magnetic phases and engineer spintronic devices in vdW heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.03837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices in van der Waals structures can be used to control the electronic properties of the material and lead to emergent correlated and topological phenomena. Its first demonstration in van der Waals magnets exhibited noncollinear states and domain structures with, however, limited manipulation. Here we report electrically tunable moir\'e magnetism in twisted double bilayers - that is, a bilayer plus a bilayer with a twist angle between them - of layered antiferromagnet CrI3. Using magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy, we observe the coexistence of antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic order with nonzero net magnetization - a hallmark of moir\'e magnetism. Such magnetic state extends over a wide range of twist angles (with transitions at around 0{\deg} and above 20{\deg}) and exhibits a nonmonotonic temperature dependence. We further demonstrate voltage-assisted magnetic switching. The observed nontrivial magnetic states and unprecedented control by twist angle, temperature and electrical gating are supported by the simulated phase diagram of the moir\'e magnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnons are quantized collective spin-wave excitations in magnetically ordered materials. Revealing their interactions among these collective modes is crucial for the understanding of fundamental many-body effects in such systems and the development of high-speed information transport and processing devices based on them. Nevertheless, identifying couplings between individual magnon modes remains a long-standing challenge. Here, we demonstrate spectroscopic fingerprints of anharmonic coupling between distinct magnon modes in an antiferromagnet, as evidenced by coherent photon emission at the sum and difference frequencies of the two modes. This discovery is enabled by driving two magnon modes coherently with a pair of tailored terahertz fields and then disentangling a mixture of nonlinear responses with different origins. Our approach provides a route for generating nonlinear magnon-magnon mixing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Montmorillonite (MMT) is the main mineral component of bentonite, which is currently proposed as a sealing material in deep geological repositories (DGRs) for used nuclear fuel. In the Canadian program, which will utilize copper-cladded used fuel containers, safety analysis considers the effect of copper corrosion, during which Cu$^{2+}$ ions could potentially be adsorbed by the surrounding MMT. In such a scenario, ion exchange between Na$^+$ and Cu$^{2+}$ is expected. In this study, a multiscale approach that combines electronic density functional theory (DFT) and force-field-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations was employed to study the effect of introducing Cu$^{2+}$ ions to MMT. An extension to the ClayFF force field is parametrized and validated using DFT to model how Cu$^{2+}$ interacts with clay systems. MD simulations were performed to calculate the interaction free energies between MMT platelets containing Cu$^{2+}$ ions (Cu-MMT) and compared them to inter-platelet interaction energies in Na-MMT and Ca-MMT. Our calculations suggest Cu-MMT develops swelling pressures between those of Ca-MMT and Na-MMT. Furthermore, our MD simulations suggest that Cu$^{2+}$ has MMT interlayer mobility that is significantly slower than that of Ca$^{2+}$.</description>

Abstract: Electronic devices for information storages and processes can be further optimized by introducing the degree of freedom of anisotropy, which is strongly dependent of their structural symmetry. Herein, a ReSeS monolayer with asymmetrical double-faces are proposed to disclose the anisotropic electronic structure. Meanwhile infrared fingerprint based on the lattice vibration is also adopted to demonstrate the symmetry-breaking-dependent structural transformation. First-principles calculations demonstrate that the geometry deformation will induce the reconstruction of electronic structure. Ulteriorly, both the dynamic properties of carrier and spectroscopic response can be regulated by external strain and displays anisotropic behaviors. Our idea provides threads for designing new regulable optoelectronic devices.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning potentials (MLPs) have become indispensable for conducting accurate large-scale atomistic simulations and for the efficient prediction of crystal structures. Polynomial MLPs, defined by polynomial rotational invariants, have been systematically developed for a wide range of elemental, alloy, and ionic systems. This study introduces a highly efficient and robust methodology for enumerating globally stable and metastable structures utilizing polynomial MLPs. To develop MLPs that are sufficiently robust for structure enumeration, an iterative process involving random structure searches and subsequent updates to the MLPs is employed. This methodology has been systematically applied to elemental systems such as As, Bi, Ga, In, La, P, Sb, Sn, and Te, where numerous local minima present significant competition with the global minimum in terms of energy. The proposed approach facilitates robust global structure searches and structure enumerations by markedly accelerating the search process and expanding the search space.</description>

Abstract: Fundamentally understanding the lattice dynamics and microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites remains elusive, primarily due to their strong anharmonicity and frequent phase transitions. In this work, we comprehensively investigate the thermal transport behavior in cubic hybrid perovskite FAPbI3, integrating first principles-based anharmonic lattice dynamics with a linearized Wigner transport formula. The Temperature Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP) technique allows us to stabilize the negative soft modes, primarily dominated by organic cations, at finite temperatures in cubic FAPbI3. We then predict an ultra-low thermal conductivity of ~0.63 Wm^(-1) K^(-1) in cubic FAPbI3 at 300 K, with a temperature dependence of T^(-0.740), suggesting a good crystalline nature of phonon transport. Notably, the ultra-low thermal conductivity in cubic FAPbI3 is primarily attributed to the [PbI3]1- units, challenging the conventional focus on organic FA+ cations. This shift in focus is due to the presence of Pb(s)-I(p) anti-bonding sates within the [PbI3]1- units. Furthermore, thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 is predominantly governed by the particle-like phonon propagation channel across the entire temperature range of 300-500 K, a result of diminished suppression of low-frequency phonons by FA+ cations and large inter-branch spacings. Finally, our findings underscore that the anharmonic force constants are highly temperature-sensitive, leading to underestimations of thermal conductivity when relying on 0-K anharmonic force constants. Our study not only elucidates the microscopic mechanisms of thermal transport in cubic FAPbI3 but also provides a crucial framework for the discovery, design, and understanding of hybrid organic-inorganic compounds with ultra-low thermal conductivity.</description>

Abstract: In the pursuit of advancing solar energy technologies, this study presents 20 direct and quasi-direct band gap silicon crystalline semiconductors that satisfy the Shockley-Queisser limit, a benchmark for solar cell efficiency. Employing two evolutionary algorithm-based searches, we optimize structures and calculate fitness function using the DFTB method and Gaussian approximation potential. Following the preselection of structures based on energy considerations, we further optimize them using PBEsol DFT. Subsequently, we screen the structures based on their band gap, employing a DFTB method tailored for band gap calculation of silicon crystals. To ensure accurate band gap determination, we employ HSE and GW methods. To validate the structural stability, we employ phonon analysis via linear regression algorithm applied to PBEsol DFT data. Significantly, the structures unveiled in this study are of great importance due to their proven stability from both mechanical and dynamic perspectives. Furthermore, the ductility and low density of certain structures enhance their potential application. We examine the optical properties by studying the imaginary part of the dielectric function by solving the Bethe-Salpeter Equation on top of GW approximation. By calculating the SLME, we achieve an efficiency of 32.7% for Si$_{22}$ at a thickness of 500 nm. Moreover, the study harnesses various machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model for the band gap energy of these silicon structures. Input data for machine learning models are derived from structural MBTR and SOAP descriptors, as well as DFT outputs. Notably, the results reveal that features extracted from DFT outperform the MBTR and SOAP descriptors.</description>

Abstract: The development of novel materials in recent years has been accelerated greatly by the use of computational modelling techniques aimed at elucidating the complex physics controlling microstructure formation in materials, the properties of which control material function. One such technique is the phase field method, a field theoretic approach that couples various thermophysical fields to microscopic order parameter fields that track the phases of microstructure. Phase field models are framed as multiple, non-linear, partial differential equations, which are extremely challenging to compute efficiently. Recent years have seen an explosion of computational algorithms aimed at enhancing the efficiency of phase field simulations. One such technique, adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), dynamically adapts numerical meshes to be highly refined around steep spatial gradients of the PDE fields and coarser where the fields are smooth. This reduces the number of computations per time step significantly, thus reducing the total time of computation. What AMR doesn't do is allow for adaptive time stepping. This work combines AMR with a neural network algorithm that uses a U-Net with a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory (CLSTM) base to accelerate phase field simulations. Our neural network algorithm is described in detail and tested in on simulations of directional solidification of a dilute binary alloy, a paradigm that is highly practical for its relevance to the solidification of alloys.</description>

      <title>Protocols for Obtaining Reliable PDFs from Laboratory x-ray Sources Using PDFgetX3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18177v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explored data acquisition protocols and improved data reduction protocols using PDFgetX3 to obtain reliable data for atomic pair distribution function (PDF) analysis from a laboratory-based Mo x-ray source. A variable counting scheme is described that preferentially counts in the high-angle region of the diffraction pattern. The effects on the resulting PDF are studied by varying the overall count time, the use of Soller slits, and limiting the out-of-plane divergence of the incident beam. The protocols are tested using an amorphous silica and a quartz sample. We also present a modification to the current PDFgetX3 data corrections to take care of sample absorption, which was previously neglected in the use of that program for high-energy synchrotron x-ray data. We show that, despite limitations in the Q-range and flux of laboratory instruments, reasonable data for PDF model fits may be obtained using the best protocols in a few hours of counting.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of large anomalous Hall effect and topological magnetic skyrmions in a Weyl nodal ring ferromagnet Mn5Ge3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological magnetic materials are expected to show multiple transport responses because of their unusual bulk electronic topology in momentum space and topological spin texture in real space. However, such multiple topological properties-hosting materials are rare in nature. In this work, we reveal the coexistence of a large tunable anomalous Hall effect and topological magnetic skyrmions in a Weyl nodal ring ferromagnet Mn5Ge3, by using electrical transport and Lorentz transmission electronic microscope (TEM) measurements. It was found that the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) can reach up to 979.7 S/cm with current along [120] and magnetic field along [001] of the Mn5Ge3 single crystals. Our theoretical calculations reveal that the large AHC is closely related with two Weyl nodal rings in band structure near the Fermi level and is strongly modified by the content of Ge. Moreover, our Lorentz-TEM images and micromagnetic simulation results, together with the sizable topological Hall effect clearly point to the robust formation of magnetic skyrmions over a wide temperature-magnetic field region. These results prove Mn5Ge3 as a rare magnetic topological nodal-line semimetal with great significance to explore novel multiple topological phenomena, which facilitates the development of spintronics.</description>

      <title>Thermal signature of helical molecule: Beyond nearest-neighbor electron hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate, for the first time, the thermal signature of a single-stranded helical molecule that is described beyond usual nearest-neighbor electron hopping, by analyzing electronic specific heat. Depending on the hopping of electrons, two different kinds of helical systems are considered. In one case the hopping is confined within a few neighboring lattice sites which is referred to as short-range hopping helix, while in the other case, electrons can hop in all possible sites making the system a long-range hopping one. These two helices accurately emulate the structures of single-stranded DNA and protein molecules, respectively. Each helix geometry is exposed to a transverse electric field applied perpendicular to the helix axis. The interplay among the helicity, higher-order hopping, and the electric field has significant impact on thermal response. Our comprehensive theoretical analysis reveals that, under low-temperature conditions, the short-range hopping helix exhibits greater sensitivity to temperature compared to the long-range hopping helix system. Conversely, the scenario reverses in the high-temperature limit. The thermal response of the helices can be modified selectively by means of the electric field, and the difference between the specific heats of the two helices gradually decreases with increasing the field strength. The molecular handedness, on the other hand, does not have any appreciable effect on the thermal signature. In addition, we also explore a significant application of electronic specific heat (ESH). Finally, we discuss the results of ESH by considering the spin degree of freedom and in the context of real biological helical systems.</description>

      <title>Entangled Photon Generation through Cooper Pair Recombination in a Noncentrosymmetric Quantum Well</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore theoretically the generation of entangled two-photon pairs by Cooper pair recombination in a noncentrosymmetric [001]-quantum well superconductor, driven by a forward-biased p-n junction with a superconducting layer which exhibits admixture Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. We show that the highest achievable purity of entangled photon pairs emerges within scenarios involving pure singlet Cooper pairs, specifically, the conventional $s$-wave gap function. Our results highlight the importance of minimizing the charge-carrier level concentration and balancing the magnitudes of Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings to achieve entangled states with enhanced purity, which can be realized by reducing the amplitudes of antisymmetric spin-orbit couplings. In addition to purity concerns, to explore the distribution of two-photon states, we compare their population across entangled pairs for potential superconducting pairings.</description>

      <title>Engineered Josephson diode effect in kinked Rashba nanochannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect, reminiscent of the unidirectional charge transport in semiconductor diodes, is characterized by a nonreciprocal, dissipationless flow of Cooper pairs. This remarkable phenomenon arises from the interplay between symmetry constraints and the inherent quantum behavior of superconductors. Here, we explore the geometric control of the diode effect in a kinked nanostrip Josephson junction based on a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEGs) with Rashba spin-orbit interaction. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the diode effect as a function of the kink angle and the out-of-plane magnetic field. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram, showcasing a geometry and field-controlled diode effect. The phase diagram also reveals the presence of an anomalous Josephson effect related to the emergence of trivial zero-energy Andreev bound states, which can evolve into Majorana bound states. Our findings indicate that the exceptional synergy between geometric control of the diode effect and topological phases can be effectively leveraged to design and optimize superconducting devices with tailored transport properties.</description>

      <title>On equivalence of two formulas of orbital magnetic susceptibility for tight-binding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19993v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that two formulas of the orbital magnetic susceptibility, namely, Koshino-Ando's formula and G\'{o}mez-Santos and Stauber's formula, are equivalent for the tight-binding models. The difference between these two formulas can be written in a form containing the surface terms arising from the momentum-space integration, and we show that the surface terms are exactly vanishing although the primitive functions are seemingly non-periodic with respect to the translation by the reciprocal lattice vector.</description>

      <title>Retinomorphic Machine Vision in a Network Laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing prevalence of AI, demand increases for efficient machine learning hardware. Physical systems are sought which combine image feature detection with the essential nonlinearity for tasks such as image classification. Existing physical hardware typically detects features linearly, then employs digital processing for nonlinear activation. Biological vision systems excel at nonlinear image processing. The retina detects features in ganglion cells via lateral inhibition, where cells nonlinearly compete for neuronal firing while supressing neighbouring cells.
  We present a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' machine vision platform using an on-chip semiconductor network laser. The system detects multiple features in parallel via spatially-overlapping lasing modes, with integrated nonlinearity provided by antagonistic gain competition between modes - a photonic analogue of retinal inhibition. Parallel feature-detection enhances efficiency relative to feature-detection schemes which operate sequentially or via multiple device copies, with Si-compatible processing and a compact micron-scale footprint relative to existing mm-scale systems. We report 98.05% accuracy on MNIST-digits and 87.85% on Fashion-MNIST, with strong performance on short training datasets.</description>
