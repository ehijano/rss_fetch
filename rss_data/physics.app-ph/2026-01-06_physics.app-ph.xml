      <title>A Liquid Density Sensor Based On AlN Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transmitter Insensitive to Liquid Viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To overcome the limitations of conventional liquid density sensors, MEMS-based approaches have been developed. However, the viscosity-density coupling effect often compromises accuracy in high-viscosity liquids. Although various decoupling strategies have been proposed, they often suffer from complexity and inefficiency. This study presents an AlN-based PMUT liquid density sensor insensitive to viscosity interference. The sensor employs two identical PMUTs, functioning as transmitter and receiver, respectively. An ultrasonic wave generated by the transmitter is reflected by the liquid surface and detected by the receiver. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that when the excitation frequency remains constant, the amplitude of the received electrical signal exhibits a specific relationship with liquid density, while the viscosity-induced signal amplitude variation becomes negligible. Therefore, after calibrating the PMUT liquid density sensor by fitting the relationship between received signal amplitude and density across 0-100% glycerol solutions, the device can measure densities within this range regardless of liquid type and viscosity. Experimental results show that the sensor can accurately measure the density of the propylene glycol solutions using the glycerol-calibrated fitting formula, with the calculated density error rate between measured propylene glycol solutions using the glycerol-calibrated fitting formula and actual densities remains below 0.125%, demonstrating measurement insensitivity to viscosity differences between the two liquids. The proposed method achieves maximum error rates of less than 2.5% in high-viscosity environments (80%-100% glycerol solutions), which is 20% that of other density measurement methods based on resonant frequency. The developed PMUT liquid density sensor exhibits a measurable density range from 0.789 to 1.261 g/cm3.</description>

      <title>Integrated vortex-assisted electroporation platform with enhanced throughput for genetic delivery to primary cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primary human cells offer the most faithful representation of native human physiology, yet their practical utility is constrained by the difficulty of introducing exogenous genetic material. Electroporation provides a promising non-viral gene delivery approach; however, conventional bulk systems lack the uniformity and integration required for heterogeneous primary cell samples. Here, we present a vortex-assisted electroporation platform integrating size-selective cell trapping with enhanced throughput, parameter optimization across buffer and electrical conditions, and robust delivery of plasmid DNA and in vitro-transcribed mRNA in primary human cells. This integrated platform provides a unified workflow that addresses sample heterogeneity, throughput demands, and delivery efficiency, enabling broader implementation of non-viral gene delivery into primary cells for research and translational applications.</description>

      <title>Edge Truncation Effect Suppression of Ultrawideband Phased Arrays for Radar Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a novel, effective method to suppress the edge truncation effect of ultrawideband tightly coupled dipole linear arrays. To restrain the edge truncation effect within an ultrawideband operating band, a new type of T-shaped metal strip with a resistor is further loaded on the array edges apart from extending the length of the overlapping patches. Besides, the excitation phase of the elements at the array edges is optimized. Full-wave simulation results show that the active standing wave standing ratio of the 2 x 16 tightly coupled dipole linear arrays using the proposed method is significantly optimized to less than 3.5 within a 5:1 [(1.2 to 6) GHz] bandwidth, while scanning up to +/-60{\deg} in the E-plane. The effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally verified by a 2 x 16 linear array prototype.</description>

      <title>Driven Dissipation and Stabilization of a Levitated Rotor with Multi-Day Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of nonlinear mode-crossing dissipation and injection-locking-like stabilization in a milligram-scale diamagnetically levitated quartz cube. By optically driving the cube to rotation rate near 360 RPM, we observe that its angular velocity does not decay smoothly but instead decreases in discrete steps whenever the instantaneous rotation frequency crosses one of several higher-order mechanical modes. We observe rotational dissipation times on the order of a few days. When a weak counteracting radiation-pressure torque is applied, the system unexpectedly stabilizes at a constant rotation rate that persists for about two days, constituting the mechanical analogue of injection locking. Our results reveal a new regime of multimode nonlinear dynamics in low-dissipation levitated solids and establish diamagnetic levitation as a platform for exploring non-Hamiltonian many-mode interactions and mechanically engineered nonlinear attractors and sensors.</description>

      <title>Image Synthesis Using Spintronic Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computational requirements of generative adversarial networks (GANs) exceed the limit of conventional Von Neumann architectures, necessitating energy efficient alternatives such as neuromorphic spintronics. This work presents a hybrid CMOS-spintronic deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) architecture for synthetic image generation. The proposed generative vision model approach follows the standard framework, leveraging generator and discriminators adversarial training with our designed spintronics hardware for deconvolution, convolution, and activation layers of the DCGAN architecture. To enable hardware aware spintronic implementation, the generator's deconvolution layers are restructured as zero padded convolution, allowing seamless integration with a 6-bit skyrmion based synapse in a crossbar, without compromising training performance. Nonlinear activation functions are implemented using a hybrid CMOS domain wall based Rectified linear unit (ReLU) and Leaky ReLU units. Our proposed tunable Leaky ReLU employs domain wall position coded, continuous resistance states and a piecewise uniaxial parabolic anisotropy profile with a parallel MTJ readout, exhibiting energy consumption of 0.192 pJ. Our spintronic DCGAN model demonstrates adaptability across both grayscale and colored datasets, achieving Fr'echet Inception Distances (FID) of 27.5 for the Fashion MNIST and 45.4 for Anime Face datasets, with testing energy (training energy) of 4.9 nJ (14.97~nJ/image) and 24.72 nJ (74.7 nJ/image).</description>

      <title>Fully Coupled Multiphysics Modelling of Fracture Behaviour in Silicon Particles During Lithiation Delithiation Using the Phase Field Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a multiphysics model fully coupling mass transport, deformation, phase field, and fatigue damage was developed to investigate the cracking and fracturing behaviours of Si particles during the single lithiation-delithiation cycle and fatigue damage during multiple cycles. The effects of particle diameter, charge rate, and pre-existing notches on the failure behaviour of Si particles were systematically analysed. The results showed that the increase in charge rate, particle diameter, and pre-existing notch length leads to larger cracking rates and faster fracturing of the particle. Then, a validated contour map of Si particle's fracture behaviours was developed. Additionally, the influence of pre-existing notch length and charge rate on fatigue damage was examined, and it was found that longer pre-existing notch length and larger charge rate can shorten the particle's cyclic life. Finally, to alleviate the particle fracture, nanopores were introduced in the particle, and the influence of porosity on the fracture behaviours was investigated. The results showed that nanopores can reduce expansion, dissipate global tensile stresses and elongate the crack propagation path. The developed computational framework established a predictive relationship between stress diffusion coupling theory and particle-level degradation, guiding future design and manufacturing of failure-resistant Si-based anodes for lithium-ion batteries.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural network surrogate modeling of single particle model for lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-based models play a key role in battery management, yet face challenges in real-time applications due to the high computational cost of solving coupled algebraic-partial differential equations. To accelerate model simulation, this study benchmarks three physics-informed neural network (PINN) architectures for modeling the battery single particle model, including two conventional PINN architectures and a DeepONet-based architecture. Both the accuracy and the generalization of these PINNs have been evaluated and compared under various current conditions. Our results highlight the potential of PINNs in modeling battery physics but also reveal limitations of conventional PINN architectures under highly dynamic current conditions. Among them, the Fourier-enhanced DeepONet achieves superior generalization performance and offers nearly a 10 times speedup compared with numerical solvers. This work provides an example of integrating physics-based models</description>

      <title>Optically Transparent Meta-Grating Embedded in Rear Windshields for Automotive Radar Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radar plays a crucial role in automotive safety by enabling reliable object detection, thereby assisting drivers and, prospectively, serving as one of the primary sensors in autonomous driving. The radar visibility of a road participant depends on its radar cross-section (RCS). While RCS is an inherent property, enhancing it, similar to using reflective vests for optical visibility, can significantly improve radar detection through cooperative target design. However, modern vehicles are not designed for this purpose, and embedded reflectors are not utilized due to the industry's conservative approach and the limited space available on the vehicle's exterior. Rear windshields offer a vast unused area, but they must still serve their primary function and remain transparent. We propose utilizing this area by embedding a reflecting surface that accounts for the interrogation scenario geometry and the angular tilt of the rear windshield, ensuring the wave is retroreflected back to the radar. The surface is realized as an array of thin conductive wires with a periodicity that provides in-phase excitation for the design incidence angle. Given that automotive radars operate in the millimeter-wave regime (77-81 GHz), large-scale surfaces with sub-millimeter manufacturing accuracy are required. This is achieved by imprinting conductive inks, composed of silver nanoparticles and binders, into grooves in the glass. The fabricated 10x10 sq. sm. sample, with around 90% optical transparency, demonstrates an RCS of 8 sq. m., surpassing the typical RCS of a car. Extrapolating this performance to the entire rear window with an embedded meta grating, a typical RCS of 1000 sq. m. can be achieved, thereby enhancing the detectability range by nearly an order of magnitude. Smart windows enable advanced applications in wireless communication, such as automotive scenarios, IoT, and many others.</description>

      <title>Harmonic-Recycling Rectification Based on Novel Compact Dual-Band Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Harmonic generation during radio frequency (RF)-dc conversion causes performance degradation of a microwave rectifying circuit. To suppress and recycle the harmonic power, this letter proposes a novel compact dual-band resonator (DBR) based on a microstrip coupled transmission line. It presents open-circuits at the second and third harmonic frequencies, which effectively block the higher order harmonic for power recycling. The conventional input cascading filters for harmonic rejection can be eliminated, simplifying the circuit topology and reducing loss. Theoretical analyses were carried out and corresponding equations were formulated for the proposed DBR. For validation, two rectifying circuits with/without the DBR operating at 2.2 GHz were fabricated and tested. Using the proposed DBR at 10 dBm RF power, the suppression of the second and third harmonic powers is enhanced by 18.4 and 7.6 dB, respectively. Besides, an improvement of RF-dc power conversion efficiency (PCE) was observed; specifically, PCE reached 73.2% at 10 dBm compared to 71.6% obtained from an equivalent rectifier.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation Analysis Framework of Spiking Neuron Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing targets energy-efficient event-driven information processing by placing artificial spiking-neurons at its core. Artificial neuron devices and circuits have multiple operating modes and produce region-dependent nonlinear dynamics that are not captured by system analysis methods for linear systems, such as transfer functions, Fourier/Laplace transform, Bode diagram, etc. Thus, new tools are needed to evaluate the nonlinear behavior of neurons and to guide the design and optimization of artificial neuron implementations. Here we present a generalized bifurcation analysis framework based on nonlinear dynamical systems theory. A CMOS axon-hillock neuron, memristor neuron, and the FitzHugh-Nagumo biological neuron model are selected for demonstration. We evaluate Hopf bifurcation conditions to define the rest and firing domains in parameter space of the system, and predict the near-onset firing rate. The results are further compared with numerical simulations. The framework standardizes the analysis for various neuron models and physical realizations. It yields practical design and optimization guidelines for artificial neurons for neuromorphic computing systems, including parameter combinations to make a neuron fire/rest and to control the corresponding firing properties, e.g., firing rate and amplitude.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear spin-Wave Doppler effect for flexible tuning of magnonic frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a nonlinear spin-wave Doppler effect, in which the time-dependent motion of a magnetic energy boundary acts as an active frequency modulator, directly converting boundary-induced phase dynamics into instantaneous spectral synthesis for propagating spin-wave modes. In contrast to the conventional linear Doppler effect governed by constant relative velocity, this mechanism enables dynamic phase-to-frequency transduction, generating high-order harmonics, magnonic frequency combs, and coherent chirped sidebands, without requiring nonlinear magnon-magnon coupling or multi-magnon scattering. Micromagnetic simulations on voltage-controlled anisotropy boundaries in ferroelectric/ferromagnetic (FE/FM) heterostructures demonstrate that the comb spacing and spectral topology are determined solely by boundary kinematics, confirming direct Doppler phase coupling between boundary motion and spin-wave propagation. These results establish moving magnetic-energy boundaries as a new class of on-chip spectral synthesizers and define a coherent and energy-efficient framework for flexible tuning of magnonic frequencies, fundamentally distinct from traditional passive scattering or nonlinear multi-magnon mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing gas-filled fiber Raman lines enables access to the molecular fingerprint region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The synthesis of multiple narrow optical spectral lines, precisely and independently tuned across the near- to mid-infrared (IR) region, is a pivotal research area that enables selective and real-time detection of trace gas species within complex gas mixtures. However, existing methods for developing such light sources suffer from limited flexibility and very low pulse energy, particularly in the mid-IR domain. Here, we introduce a new concept based on the gas-filled anti-resonant hollow-core fiber (ARHCF) technology that enables the synthesis of multiple independently tunable spectral lines with high pulse energy of &gt;1 {\mu}J and a few nanoseconds pulse width in the near- and mid-IR region. The number and wavelengths of the generated spectral lines can be dynamically reconfigured. A proof-of-concept laser beam synthesized of two narrow spectral lines at 3.99 {\mu}m and 4.25 {\mu}m wavelengths is demonstrated and combined with photoacoustic (PA) modality for real-time SO2 and CO2 detection. The proposed concept also constitutes a promising way for IR multispectral microscopic imaging.</description>

      <title>Path Integral Solution for Dissipative Generative Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can purely mechanical systems generate intelligent language? We prove that dissipative quantum dynamics with analytically tractable non-local context aggregation produce coherent text generation, while conservation laws cause fundamental failure. Employing Koopman operators with closed-form path integral propagators, we show irreversible computation fundamentally requires both controlled information dissipation and causal context aggregation. Spectral analysis reveals emergent eigenvalue structure, separating into decay modes (forgetting), growth modes (amplification), and neutral modes (preservation) -- the essential ingredients for directed information flow. Hamiltonian constraints force the elimination of these dissipative modes and degrading performance despite unchanged model capacity. This establishes language generation as dissipative quantum field theory, proving mechanical systems acquire intelligence through the combination of dissipation and non-locality, not through conservation.</description>

      <title>Silicon-on-sapphire metasurfaces generate arrays of dark and bright traps for neutral atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrated crystalline silicon-on-sapphire (c-SOS) metasurfaces that convert a Gaussian beam into arrays of complex optical traps, including arrays of optical bottle beams that trap atoms in dark regions interleaved with bright tweezer arrays. The high refractive index and indirect band gap of crystalline silicon makes it possible to design high-resolution near-infrared ($\lambda&gt;700$ nm) metasurfaces that can be manufactured at scale using CMOS-compatible processes. Compared with active components like spatial light modulators (SLMs) that have become widely used to generate trap arrays, metasurfaces provide an indefinitely scalable number of pixels, enabling large arrays of complex traps in a very small form factor, as well as reduced dynamic noise. To design metasurfaces that can generate three-dimensional bottle beams to serve as dark traps, we modified the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm to enforce complex-amplitude profiles at the focal plane of the metasurface and to optimize the uniformity of the traps across the array. We fabricated and measured c-SOS metasurfaces that convert a Gaussian laser beam into arrays of bright traps, dark traps, and interleaved bright/dark traps.</description>

      <title>Ion Clustering Regulated by Extreme Nanoconfinement Enables Mechanosensitive Nanochannels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanosensitive ion nanochannels regulate transport by undergoing conformational changes within nanopores. However, achieving precise control over these conformational states remains a major challenge for both artificial soft or solid pores. Here, we propose an alternative mechanism that modulates the charge carrier density inside nanopores, inspired by transistors in solid-state electronics. This strategy leverages a novel phenomenon of confinement-regulated ion clustering in two-dimensional extremely confined nanochannels, revealed by extensive $\mu$s-scale enhanced-sampling molecular simulations based on an \emph{ab initio}-refined force field and nucleation theory. The resulting \emph{force-ion transistor} enables mechanically gated control of ion transport and provides a conceptual foundation for designing ionic mechanical logic gates. Our findings offer new insights into piezochannel mechanosensing and electromechanical coupling in biosystems beyond conformational signaling, opening pathways to integrate artificial ion channels with neuromorphic devices for processing mechanical stimuli.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Magnetic Milli-Spinner for Robotic Endovascular Intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis, thrombosis, and aneurysms can lead to life-threatening medical events. Conventional catheter- or guidewire-based endovascular diagnostic and therapeutic devices often struggle to navigate through highly tortuous vascular pathways. The recently developed multifunctional magnetic milli-spinner offers a promising wireless solution by integrating a central through-hole and side slits into a cylindrical body with helical fins, enabling rapid and stable navigation in complex vascular environments for clot debulking, targeted drug delivery, and aneurysm treatment. Here, we combine computational fluid dynamics simulations with experimental validation to optimize the milli-spinner's structural design for high-speed untethered navigation and high-efficiency clot debulking in tubular flow environments. By systematically examining the effects of through-hole radius, fin number, fin helical angle, and slit dimension on propulsion performance, the optimized magnetic milli-spinner achieves a swimming speed of 55 cm/s (~175 body lengths per second), far exceeding existing untethered magnetic robots in tubular environments (&lt; 80 body lengths per second). This exceptional speed enables stable upstream operation against strong physiological flows representative of major arteries and veins, establishing the magnetic milli-spinner as a robust untethered navigation platform for operation in high-flow, tortuous vasculature, with potential applications in robotic mechanical thrombectomy, embolectomy, and targeted drug delivery.</description>

      <title>Shuttlecock velocity decay after smash and slice shots in badminton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper reports on the decay in shuttlecock velocity after smash and slice shots performed by elite and international players, based on the analysis of videos captured on a badminton court with high-speed cameras. The trajectories of feather shuttlecocks show an exponential decay in velocity and an exponential increase in time-of-flight with distance, in accordance with the equation of motion of a shuttlecock subjected to high drag. The initial speed, which can exceed 500 km/h, is reduced by half every 3.35 m, depending on the physical parameters of the shuttlecock characterized by a speed index. The videos show that plastic shuttlecocks, which are more resistant than feather shuttlecocks, deform at high speeds. The resulting decay of their drag coefficient with increasing speed makes them unsuitable for high-level play. The study also shows that the spin induced by the slice shots of left-handed players or the reverse slice shots of right-handed players slows the shuttlecock down.</description>

      <title>Sol-Gel-Derived NiO/ZnO Thin Films with Single and Heterostructure Layers for Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NiO/ZnO-based thin films, including single-layer and heterostructure configurations, were synthesized to investigate the influence of stacking order on their electrochemical performance for supercapacitor applications. To improve the relatively low capacitive performance of ZnO compared to NiO, NaCl was introduced as a dopant. All films were deposited using a non-vacuum spin-coating method on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrates, chosen for their excellent electrical conductivity and stability as electrode materials. The surface morphology and structural parameters were examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), respectively. Optical properties were analyzed via UV-Vis spectroscopy, revealing direct band gaps in the range of 3.17-3.31 eV for ZnO and Na-ZnO, and wider gaps up to 3.81 eV for NiO. Electrochemical performance was evaluated using cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in a three-electrode configuration with 1 M KOH as the electrolyte. Among the electrodes, the single-layer NiO film exhibited the highest specific capacitance of 1.391 Fg^{-1}. In contrast, the NiO/ZnO heterostructure demonstrated a synergistic effect, resulting in enhanced charge storage and achieving a maximum specific capacitance of 1.627 Fg^{-1} at a current density of 2.0 mA cm^{-2}. Furthermore, sodium doping significantly improved the capacitance of ZnO. Overall, the results highlight the potential of sol-gel-derived oxide heterostructures and doped thin films as cost-effective and scalable electrode materials for supercapacitors in portable electronics and energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>Ion Temperature Inference from Neutron Counting in Maxwellian Deuterium Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method is presented for inferring the deuterium fuel ion temperature from neutron counts measured with fast liquid scintillators in conditions where the ion velocity distribution is Maxwellian. Local neutron count rates at each scintillator position are combined to estimate total neutron yield from the plasma, where absolute detection efficiency is determined via MCNP neutron scattering simulation based on a 3D model of the experiment structure. This method is particularly advantageous for Magnetized Target Fusion applications as it yields a time-resolved diagnostic and does not require direct line-of-sight to the plasma or collimation of the neutrons. The instrumentation configuration, pulse-shape discrimination and pile-up correction algorithms, detector calibration, and ion temperature calculation method with uncertainty characterization are discussed. An application of the method to General Fusion's Plasma Injector~3 (PI3) spherical tokamak device is demonstrated and the results are compared to an Ion Doppler spectroscopy ion temperature diagnostic.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Deep Learning with Quantum Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of deep neural networks comes at the cost of unsustainable power consumption. While optical neural networks offer an alternative, their capabilities remain constrained by the lack of efficient optical nonlinearities. To address this, we propose an all-optical deep learning architecture by embedding quantum emitters in inverse-designed nanophotonic structures. Due to their saturability, quantum emitters exhibit exceptionally strong nonlinearity compared with conventional materials. Using physics-aware training, we demonstrate that the proposed architecture can solve complex tasks, including nonlinear classification and reinforcement learning, which have not been realized in all-optical neural networks. To enable fair comparison across different platforms, we introduce a framework that quantitatively links nonlinearity to a network's expressive power. Analysis shows that our quantum activation, operating below nW/{\mu}m^2 intensity, reduces the power budget by seven orders of magnitude. System-level estimates show that the optical power required for large language models scales sublinearly with model size, enabling watt-level operation. Our results indicate that quantum nanophotonics provides a route toward sustainable AI inference.</description>

      <title>Two-Qubit Module Based on Phonon-Coupled Ge Hole-Spin Qubits: Design, Fabrication, and Readout at 1-4 K</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a device-level design for a two-qubit module based on phonon-coupled germanium (Ge) hole-spin qubits operating at $1$-$4~\mathrm{K}$. Building on prior work on phonon-engineered Ge qubits and phononic-crystal (PnC) cavities, we specify a lithography-ready layout that integrates two gate-defined hole-spin qubits in a strained Ge quantum well with a GHz PnC defect mode that mediates a coherent phonon-based interaction. We detail the SiGe/Ge heterostructure, PnC cavity design, and a compatible nanofabrication process flow, including the gate stack, membrane patterning and release, and RF/DC wiring. We further develop a readout architecture combining spin-to-charge conversion with RF reflectometry on a proximal charge sensor, supported by a cryogenic RF chain optimized for operation at $1$-$4~\mathrm{K}$. Finally, we outline the cryogenic measurement environment, tuning procedures, and a stepwise benchmarking program targeting single-qubit control, phonon-bandgap suppression of relaxation channels, and resolvable phonon-mediated two-qubit coupling. The resulting module provides a scalable template for medium-range coupling of Ge hole-spin qubits and connects materials and phonon engineering with circuit-level readout, enabling future experimental demonstrations of entangling gates, Bell-state generation, and phonon-enabled quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Photonic Interactions with Semiconducting Barrier Discharges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconducting Barrier Discharges (SeBDs) generate uniform ionization waves in air at atmospheric pressure. In this work, we investigate how externally applied irradiation synchronized with the discharge can mimic photoconductive-type coupling between the plasma and the semiconductor surface. By illuminating the Si-SiO$_2$ interface with nanosecond pulsed irradiation at wavelengths from 532 nm to 1064 nm, and using fast imaging, optical emission spectroscopy, and current-voltage measurements, we demonstrate that the photoexcitation of charge carriers in silicon enhances the plasma emission and increases the reduced electric field, with no detectable change in the electrical energy. The magnitude and thresholds of these responses depend on wavelength. By comparing the SeBD to a MOS photodetector, this behaviour can be explained by the absorption length. This length determines whether carriers are photogenerated inside the depletion region at the SiO$_2$-Si interface, where they are efficiently separated and undergo impact-ionization amplification, or deeper in the silicon bulk where carrier separation is weaker and free-carrier absorption diminishes the quantum efficiency. These results focus on the microscopic processes governing the plasma-semiconductor coupling and demonstrate how the optoelectronic properties of silicon can influence surface ionization waves.</description>

      <title>Sub-doppler trace-gas photoacoustic spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecules are emerging as new benchmark for metrology and fundamental physics research, driving the demand for spectroscopic techniques combining high sensitivity and resolution. Photoacoustic spectroscopy has proven to combine high sensitivity with appealing features like compactness, wavelength-independent and background-free detection. To date, photoacoustic sensing has mostly been focused on high-pressure applied trace-gas analysis, while accessing the low-pressure regime has been considered not compatible with efficient acoustic wave propagation. However, sensing gas samples at low pressure is the key to get access to high-resolution spectroscopy. Here, we demonstrate that sub-Doppler saturation spectroscopy can be performed on low-pressure trace gases in a cavity-enhanced photoacoustic sensor with mW-level mid-infrared radiation. Moreover, we show that the same setup can be operated at higher pressure, enabling trace-gas detection with 5 parts-per-billion sensitivity with a laser power as low as 35 microwatts. This allows to extend the unique advantages of the photoacoustic technique to metrology and fundamental physics and provides the mid-infrared with a cost-effective, flexible tool combining high sensitivity and resolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The built-in potential of p-n junctions plays a pivotal role in charge separation, a fundamental process underlying the photovoltaic effect.However, conventional classical theories of photovoltaic behavior in p-n junctions often neglect its quantitative influence. In this work, we revisit the classical framework and derive an improved analytical expression for photocurrent by incorporating more accurate boundary conditions. Our analysis reveals that the photocurrent comprises two distinct components: the conventional forward photocurrent and a previously unrecognized backward photocurrent, which depends on the built-in potential and the applied voltage. The theoretical analysis predicts that, under specific forward-bias conditions, these two components may partially or completely cancel each other. This prediction was experimentally verified by optical lock-in measurements performed on a commercial silicon solar cell. These findings provide new insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing photovoltaic devices and suggest potential pathways for performance optimization.</description>

      <title>Secondary Species formed from ionic liquid electrospray ion plume impacts with propellant thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The operational lifetime of ionic liquid electrospray propulsion systems is limited by plume-extractor electrode interactions. Over time, propellant accumulation, surface erosion, and electrical shorts degrade the extractor and therefore restrict the total impulse throughput. Characterizing the secondary species generated by plume impacts with deposited ionic liquid is therefore essential to understanding and mitigating these degradation pathways. A surface analysis technique known as Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (TOF-SIMS), in the form of a custom electrospray laboratory diagnostic and an analytical-grade system, yields a comprehensive analysis of secondary ions formed from energetic ion beam impacts with ionic liquid thin-film substrates. Results revealed nearly identical positive secondary ion species for both EMI-BF4 and EMI-Im thin films, whereas EMI-Im produced a more diverse set of negative ions consistent with the greater chemical complexity of its anion. The analytical-grade SIMS spectra revealed many relatively high mass-to-charge ratio secondary ions likely below the detection limit for the laboratory diagnostic, thus shifting the average m/z value to above the monomer mass for most spectra. Finally, optical profilometry analysis reveals an estimated 0.5 nm/min sputter rate for an electrospray ion plume bombarding an ionic liquid thin film.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14359v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of quantum information and computational resources using a tractable model of coupled harmonic oscillators. We precisely characterize the interplay between mutual information, synchronization, and circuit complexity, demonstrating that they serve as complementary yet distinct measures of quantum correlations. Our analysis reveals how coupling strength, detuning, and external magnetic fields modulate these quantities, with synchronization and mutual information exhibiting marked divergence in nonlinear regimes. By employing exact Gaussian methods, we compute the circuit depth required to prepare target states and connect increased fidelity to more regular dynamical behavior. Furthermore, we analyze single-ion transport in a harmonic trap, comparing sudden and adiabatic protocols. We introduce a nonadiabaticity metric to quantify the fidelity-complexity trade-off, showing that smooth control sequences significantly minimize operational errors by suppressing excitations. These results provide a refined understanding of quantum correlations and offer concrete principles for optimizing control strategies in quantum technologies.</description>
