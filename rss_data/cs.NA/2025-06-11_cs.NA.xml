      <title>On Finite Element Methods for Heterogeneous Elliptic Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dealing with variational formulations of second order elliptic problems with discontinuous coefficients, we recall a single field minimization problem of an extended functional presented by Bevilacqua et al (1974), which we associate with the basic idea supporting discontinuous Galerkin finite element methods. We review residual based stabilized mixed methods applied to Darcy flow in homogeneous porous media and extend them to heterogeneous media with an interface of discontinuity. For smooth interfaces, the proposed formulations preserve the continuity of the flux and exactly imposes the constraint between the tangent components of Darcy velocity on the interface. Convergence studies for a heterogeneous and anisotropic porous medium confirm the same rates of convergence predicted for homogeneous problem with smooth solutions.</description>

      <title>A structure preserving H-curl algebraic multigrid method for the eddy current equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new algebraic multigrid method (AMG) is presented for solving the linear systems associated with the eddy current approximation to the Maxwell equations. This AMG method extends an idea proposed by Reitzinger and Schoberl. The main feature of the Reitzinger and Schoberl algorithm (RSAMG) is that it maintains null-space properties of the Curl-Curl operator throughout all levels of the AMG hierarchy. It does this by enforcing a commuting relationship involving grid transfers and the discrete gradient operator. This null-space preservation property is critical to the algorithm's success, however enforcing this commuting relationship is non-trivial except in the special case where one leverages a piece-wise constant nodal interpolation operator. For this reason, mesh independent convergence rates are generally not observed for RSAMG due to its reliance on sub-optimal piece-wise constant interpolation. We present a new AMG algorithm that enforces the same commuting relationship. The main advance is that the new structure preserving H-curl algorithm (SpHcurlAMG) does not rely on piece-wise constant interpolation and can leverage fairly general and more sophisticated nodal interpolation operators. The key idea is to employ energy minimization AMG (EAMG) to construct edge interpolation grid transfers and to enforce the commuting relationship by embedding it as constraints within an EAMG procedure. While it might appear that solving such a constrained energy minimization is costly, we illustrate how this is not the case in our context. Numerical results are then given demonstrating mesh independent convergence over a range of test problems.</description>

      <title>An efficient Fourier spectral algorithm for the Bogoliubov-de Gennes excitation eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient Fourier spectral algorithm for an eigenvalue problem, that is, the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equation arsing from spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) to describe the elementary/collective excitations around the mean-field ground state. The BdG equation is essentially a constrained eigenvalue/eigenfunction system. Firstly, we investigate its analytical properties, including exact eigenpairs, generalized nullspace, and bi-orthogonality of eigenspaces. Secondly, by combining the standard Fourier spectral method for spatial discretization and a stable Gram-Schmidt bi-orthogonal algorithm, we develop a subspace iterative solver for such a large-scale dense eigenvalue problem, and it proves to be numerically stable, efficient, and accurate. Our solver is matrix-free and the operator-function evaluation is accelerated by discrete Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with almost optimal efficiency. Therefore, it is memory-friendly and efficient for large-scale problems. Furthermore, we give a rigorous and detailed numerical analysis on the stability and spectral convergence. Finally, we present extensive numerical results to illustrate the spectral accuracy and efficiency, and investigate the excitation spectrum and Bogoliubov amplitudes around the ground state in 1-3 spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Bi-Orthogonal Structure-Preserving eigensolver for large-scale linear response eigenvalue problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear response eigenvalue problem, which arises from many scientific and engineering fields, is quite challenging numerically for large-scale sparse/dense system, especially when it has zero eigenvalues. Based on a direct sum decomposition of biorthogonal invariant subspaces and the minimization principles in the biorthogonal complement, using the structure of generalized nullspace, we propose a Bi-Orthogonal Structure-Preserving subspace iterative solver, which is stable, efficient, and of excellent parallel scalability. The biorthogonality is of essential importance and created by a modified Gram-Schmidt biorthogonalization (MGS-Biorth) algorithm. We naturally deflate out converged eigenvectors by computing the rest eigenpairs in the biorthogonal complementary subspace without introducing any artificial parameters. When the number of requested eigenpairs is large, we propose a moving mechanism to compute them batch by batch such that the projection matrix size is small and independent of the requested eigenpair number. For large-scale problems, one only needs to provide the matrix-vector product, thus waiving explicit matrix storage. The numerical performance is further improved when the matrix-vector product is implemented using parallel computing. Ample numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the stability, efficiency, and parallel scalability.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gradient descent based variational inference for infinite-dimensional inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces two variational inference approaches for infinite-dimensional inverse problems, developed through gradient descent with a constant learning rate. The proposed methods enable efficient approximate sampling from the target posterior distribution using a constant-rate stochastic gradient descent (cSGD) iteration. Specifically, we introduce a randomization strategy that incorporates stochastic gradient noise, allowing the cSGD iteration to be viewed as a discrete-time process. This transformation establishes key relationships between the covariance operators of the approximate and true posterior distributions, thereby validating cSGD as a variational inference method. We also investigate the regularization properties of the cSGD iteration and provide a theoretical analysis of the discretization error between the approximated posterior mean and the true background function. Building on this framework, we develop a preconditioned version of cSGD to further improve sampling efficiency. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to two practical inverse problems: one governed by a simple smooth equation and the other by the steady-state Darcy flow equation. Numerical results confirm our theoretical findings and compare the sampling performance of the two approaches for solving linear and non-linear inverse problems.</description>

      <title>2N-storage Runge-Kutta methods: c-reflection symmetry and factorization of the Butcher tableau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-storage Runge-Kutta schemes of Williamson's type, so-called 2N-storage schemes, are further examined as a follow-up to the recent work. It is found that the augmented Butcher tableau factorizes into a product of matrices with special properties. Those properties reveal that the 2N-storage methods of the order of global accuracy less than five possess a symmetry, called c-reflection symmetry, i.e. most methods exist in pairs. A transformation that relates the Butcher tableaux of the pairs is found and the fact that the c-reflected method satisfies the same order conditions as the original one is proven. Numerical evidence that validates the analytic results is presented. Branches of solutions for (5,4) methods, first explored by Carpenter and Kennedy, are constructed numerically. Four new (5,4) schemes with coefficients expressed in radicals and one with rational coefficients are examined for illustration. Eight new (6,4) schemes, some of which can be expressed in rationals or radicals, and one (8,4) scheme, are studied to understand the practical implications of the c-reflection symmetry for methods with higher number of stages. In the absence of closed-form analytic solutions for 2N-storage Runge-Kutta methods of order four and above, the general symmetry properties, as well as some specific analytic solutions presented here, may help in development and optimization of 2N-storage schemes.</description>

Abstract: A mathematical model for forecasting of public sentiments via the Mean Field Games theory is proposed. A numerical method is developed. This is a version of the so-called convexification method. Convergence analysis demonstrates the global convergence of this method. Convergence rate is established. Numerical experiments demonstrate both an accurate performance of the convexification technique and some promising features of this approach.</description>

      <title>Structured Variational $D$-Decomposition for Accurate and Stable Low-Rank Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the $D$-decomposition, a non-orthogonal matrix factorization of the form $A \approx P D Q$, where $P \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times k}$, $D \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times k}$, and $Q \in \mathbb{R}^{k \times n}$. The decomposition is defined variationally by minimizing a regularized Frobenius loss, allowing control over rank, sparsity, and conditioning. Unlike algebraic factorizations such as LU or SVD, it is computed by alternating minimization. We establish existence and perturbation stability of the solution and show that each update has complexity $\mathcal{O}(n^2k)$. Benchmarks against truncated SVD, CUR, and nonnegative matrix factorization show improved reconstruction accuracy on MovieLens, MNIST, Olivetti Faces, and gene expression matrices, particularly under sparsity and noise.</description>

      <title>sparseGeoHOPCA: A Geometric Solution to Sparse Higher-Order PCA Without Covariance Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose sparseGeoHOPCA, a novel framework for sparse higher-order principal component analysis (SHOPCA) that introduces a geometric perspective to high-dimensional tensor decomposition. By unfolding the input tensor along each mode and reformulating the resulting subproblems as structured binary linear optimization problems, our method transforms the original nonconvex sparse objective into a tractable geometric form. This eliminates the need for explicit covariance estimation and iterative deflation, enabling significant gains in both computational efficiency and interpretability, particularly in high-dimensional and unbalanced data scenarios. We theoretically establish the equivalence between the geometric subproblems and the original SHOPCA formulation, and derive worst-case approximation error bounds based on classical PCA residuals, providing data-dependent performance guarantees. The proposed algorithm achieves a total computational complexity of $O\left(\sum_{n=1}^{N} (k_n^3 + J_n k_n^2)\right)$, which scales linearly with tensor size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that sparseGeoHOPCA accurately recovers sparse supports in synthetic settings, preserves classification performance under 10$\times$ compression, and achieves high-quality image reconstruction on ImageNet, highlighting its robustness and versatility.</description>

      <title>Normalized Radon Cumulative Distribution Transforms for Invariance and Robustness in Optimal Transport Based Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Radon cumulative distribution transform (R-CDT), is an easy-to-compute feature extractor that facilitates image classification tasks especially in the small data regime. It is closely related to the sliced Wasserstein distance and provably guaranties the linear separability of image classes that emerge from translations or scalings. In many real-world applications, like the recognition of watermarks in filigranology, however, the data is subject to general affine transformations originating from the measurement process. To overcome this issue, we recently introduced the so-called max-normalized R-CDT that only requires elementary operations and guaranties the separability under arbitrary affine transformations. The aim of this paper is to continue our study of the max-normalized R-CDT especially with respect to its robustness against non-affine image deformations. Our sensitivity analysis shows that its separability properties are stable provided the Wasserstein-infinity distance between the samples can be controlled. Since the Wasserstein-infinity distance only allows small local image deformations, we moreover introduce a mean-normalized version of the R-CDT. In this case, robustness relates to the Wasserstein-2 distance and also covers image deformations caused by impulsive noise for instance. Our theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments showing the effectiveness of our novel feature extractors as well as their robustness against local non-affine deformations and impulsive noise.</description>

      <title>Enabling stratified sampling in high dimensions via nonlinear dimensionality reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of propagating the uncertainty from a possibly large number of random inputs through a computationally expensive model. Stratified sampling is a well-known variance reduction strategy, but its application, thus far, has focused on models with a limited number of inputs due to the challenges of creating uniform partitions in high dimensions. To overcome these challenges, we perform stratification with respect to the uniform distribution defined over the unit interval, and then derive the corresponding strata in the original space using nonlinear dimensionality reduction. We show that our approach is effective in high dimensions and can be used to further reduce the variance of multifidelity Monte Carlo estimators.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic error distribution for stochastic Runge--Kutta methods of strong order one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work gives the asymptotic error distribution of the stochastic Runge--Kutta (SRK) method of strong order $1$ applied to Stratonovich-type stochastic differential equations. For dealing with the implicitness introduced in the diffusion term, we provide a framework to derive the asymptotic error distribution of diffusion-implicit or fully implicit numerical methods, which enables us to construct a fully explicit numerical method sharing the same asymptotic error distribution as the SRK method. Further, we show for the multiplicative noise that the limit distribution $U(T)$ satisfies $\mathbf E|U(T)|^2\le e^{L_1T}(1+\eta_1)T^3$ for some $\eta_1$ only depending on the coefficients of the SRK method. Thus, we infer that $\eta_1$ is the key parameter reflecting the growth rate of the mean-square error of the SRK method. Especially, among the SRK methods of strong order $1$, those of weak order $2$ ($\eta_1=0$) share the unified asymptotic error distribution and have the smallest mean-square errors after a long time. This property is also found for the case of additive noise. It seems that we are the first to give the asymptotic error distribution of fully implicit numerical methods for SDEs.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically Consistent Latent Dynamics Identification for Parametric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient thermodynamics-informed latent space dynamics identification (tLaSDI) framework for the reduced-order modeling of parametric nonlinear dynamical systems. This framework integrates autoencoders for dimensionality reduction with newly developed parametric GENERIC formalism-informed neural networks (pGFINNs), which enable efficient learning of parametric latent dynamics while preserving key thermodynamic principles such as free energy conservation and entropy generation across the parameter space. To further enhance model performance, a physics-informed active learning strategy is incorporated, leveraging a greedy, residual-based error indicator to adaptively sample informative training data, outperforming uniform sampling at equivalent computational cost. Numerical experiments on the Burgers' equation and the 1D/1V Vlasov-Poisson equation demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 3,528x speed-up with 1-3% relative errors, and significant reduction in training (50-90%) and inference (57-61%) cost. Moreover, the learned latent space dynamics reveal the underlying thermodynamic behavior of the system, offering valuable insights into the physical-space dynamics.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching Meets PDEs: A Unified Framework for Physics-Constrained Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative machine learning methods, such as diffusion models and flow matching, have shown great potential in modeling complex system behaviors and building efficient surrogate models. However, these methods typically learn the underlying physics implicitly from data. We propose Physics-Based Flow Matching (PBFM), a novel generative framework that explicitly embeds physical constraints, both PDE residuals and algebraic relations, into the flow matching objective. We also introduce temporal unrolling at training time that improves the accuracy of the final, noise-free sample prediction. Our method jointly minimizes the flow matching loss and the physics-based residual loss without requiring hyperparameter tuning of their relative weights. Additionally, we analyze the role of the minimum noise level, $\sigma_{\min}$, in the context of physical constraints and evaluate a stochastic sampling strategy that helps to reduce physical residuals. Through extensive benchmarks on three representative PDE problems, we show that our approach yields up to an $8\times$ more accurate physical residuals compared to FM, while clearly outperforming existing algorithms in terms of distributional accuracy. PBFM thus provides a principled and efficient framework for surrogate modeling, uncertainty quantification, and accelerated simulation in physics and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Numerical stability of force-gradient integrators and their Hessian-free variants in lattice QCD simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the numerical stability of force-gradient integrators and their Hessian-free variants within the molecular dynamics step of the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm in lattice QCD simulations. A linear stability analysis of (Hessian-free) force-gradient integrators is conducted by investigating the harmonic oscillator as a test equation. By performing detailed stability investigations for the entire family of self-adjoint integrators with up to eleven exponentials per time step, we detect promising integrator variants that are providing a good trade-off between accuracy and numerical stability. Simulations for the two-dimensional Schwinger model demonstrate that there are no significant differences in the stability domain of a force-gradient integrator and its Hessian-free counterpart. Furthermore, lattice QCD simulations are conducted to emphasize the significance of numerical stability as a metric for evaluating the computational efficiency of integrators when applied to lattice QCD simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a rigorous analysis of root-exponential convergence of Hermite approximations, including projection and interpolation methods, for functions that are analytic in an infinite strip containing the real axis and satisfy certain restrictions on the asymptotic behavior at infinity within this strip. Asymptotically sharp error bounds in the weighted and maximum norms are derived. The key ingredients of our analysis are some remarkable contour integral representations for the Hermite coefficients and the remainder of Hermite spectral interpolations. Further extensions to Gauss--Hermite quadrature, Hermite spectral differentiations, generalized Hermite spectral approximations and the scaling factor of Hermite approximation are also discussed. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Learning Stochastic Reduced Models from Data: A Nonintrusive Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05724v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A nonintrusive model order reduction method for bilinear stochastic differential equations with additive noise is proposed. A reduced order model (ROM) is designed in order to approximate the statistical properties of high-dimensional systems. The drift and diffusion coefficients of the ROM are inferred from state observations by solving appropriate least-squares problems. The closeness of the ROM obtained by the presented approach to the intrusive ROM obtained by the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method is investigated. Two generalisations of the snapshot-based dominant subspace construction to the stochastic case are presented. Numerical experiments are provided to compare the developed approach to POD.</description>

      <title>Optimal Polynomial Smoothers for Parallel AMG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore polynomial accelerators that are well-suited for parallel computations, specifically as smoothers in Algebraic MultiGrid (AMG) preconditioners. These accelerators address a minimax problem, initially formulated in [Lottes, Numer. Lin. Alg. with Appl. 30(6), 2518 (2023)], aiming to achieve an optimal (or near-optimal) bound for a polynomial-dependent constant involved in the AMG V-cycle error bound, without requiring information about the matrices' spectra. Lottes focuses on Chebyshev polynomials of the 4th-kind and defines the relevant recurrence formulas applicable to a general convergent basic smoother. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficacy of these accelerations for large-scale applications on modern GPU-accelerated supercomputers. Furthermore, we formulate a variant of the aforementioned minimax problem, which naturally leads to solutions relying on Chebyshev polynomials of the 1st-kind as accelerators for a basic smoother. For all the polynomial accelerations, we describe efficient GPU kernels for their application and demonstrate their comparable effectiveness on standard benchmarks at very large scales.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modelling of Mechanotransduction via RhoA Signalling Pathways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive and simulate a mathematical model for mechanotransduction related to the Rho GTPase signalling pathway. The model addresses the bidirectional coupling between signalling processes and cell mechanics. A numerical method based on bulk-surface finite elements is proposed for the approximation of the coupled system of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations, defined inside the cell and on the cell membrane, and the equations of elasticity. Our simulation results illustrate novel emergent features such as the strong dependence of the dynamics on cell shape, a threshold-like response to changes in substrate stiffness, and the fact that coupling mechanics and signalling can lead to the robustness of cell deformation to larger changes in substrate stiffness, ensuring mechanical homeostasis in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical approach for multicontinuum homogenization in high contrast media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01276v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently developed upscaling technique, the multicontinuum homogenization method, has gained significant attention for its effectiveness in modeling complex multiscale systems. This method defines multiple continua based on distinct physical properties and solves a series of constrained cell problems to capture localized information for each continuum. However, solving all these cell problems on very fine grids at every macroscopic point is computationally expensive, which is a common limitation of most homogenization approaches for non-periodic problems. To address this challenge, we propose a hierarchical multicontinuum homogenization framework. The core idea is to define hierarchical macroscopic points and solve the constrained problems on grids of varying resolutions. We assume that the local solutions can be represented as a combination of a linear interpolation of local solutions from preceding levels and an additional correction term. This combination is substituted into the original constrained problems, and the correction term is resolved using finite element (FE) grids of varying sizes, depending on the level of the macropoint. By normalizing the computational cost of fully resolving the local problem to $\mathcal{O}(1)$, we establish that our approach incurs a cost of $\mathcal{O}(L \eta^{(1-L)d})$, highlighting substantial computational savings across hierarchical layers $L$, coarsening factor $\eta$, and spatial dimension $d$. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in media with slowly varying properties, underscoring its potential for efficient multiscale modeling.</description>

      <title>Three dimensional seepage analysis using a polyhedral scaled boundary finite element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a polyhedral scaled boundary finite element method (PSBFEM) for three dimensional seepage analysis. We first derive the scaled boundary formulation for 3D seepage problems, and subsequently incorporate Wachspress shape functions to construct shape functions over arbitrary polygonal elements, thereby establishing the foundation of the proposed polyhedral SBFEM. The method combines the semi-analytical nature of the SBFEM with the geometric flexibility of polyhedral and octree meshes, making it well-suited for complex seepage simulations. The PSBFEM is implemented within the ABAQUS UEL framework to facilitate steady-state, transient, and free-surface seepage analyses. A series of numerical examples are conducted to verify the accuracy, efficiency, and convergence properties of the proposed approach, including benchmark tests and applications with intricate geometries. The results demonstrate that the PSBFEM achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence than conventional FEM, particularly when using hybrid octree meshes with local refinement. This framework provides a robust and efficient computational tool for three-dimensional seepage analysis in geotechnical and hydraulic engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Galerkin Reduced-Order Models for Turbulent Flows with Tensor Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galerkin-based reduced-order models (G-ROMs) offer efficient and accurate approximations for laminar flows but require hundreds to thousands of modes $N$ to capture the complex dynamics of turbulent flows. This makes standard G-ROMs computationally expensive due to the third-order advection tensor contraction, requiring the storage of $N^3$ entries and the computation of $2N^3$ operations per timestep. As a result, such ROMs are impractical for realistic applications like turbulent flow control. In this work, we consider problems that demand large $N$ values for accurate G-ROMs and propose a novel approach that accelerates G-ROMs by utilizing the CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor decomposition to approximate the advection tensor as a sum of $R$ rank-1 tensors. We also leverage the partial skew-symmetry property of the advection tensor and derive two conditions for the CP decomposition to preserve this property. Moreover, we investigate the low-rank structure of the advection tensor using singular value decomposition (SVD) and compare the performance of G-ROMs accelerated by CP (CPD-ROM) and SVD (SVD-ROM). Demonstrated on problems from 2D periodic to 3D turbulent flows, the CPD-ROM achieves at least a $10$-fold speedup and a $16.7$-fold reduction in nonlinear term evaluation costs compared to the standard G-ROM. The skew-symmetry preserving CPD-ROM demonstrates improved stability in both the reproduction and predictive regimes, and enables the use of smaller rank $R$. Singular value analysis reveals a persistent low-rank structure in the $H^1_0$-based advection tensor, and CP decomposition achieves at least an order of magnitude higher compression ratio than SVD.</description>

      <title>Deciphering culprits for cyanobacterial blooms and lake vulnerability in north-temperate lakes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harmful cyanobacterial blooms (CBs) are increasingly prevalent worldwide, posing significant environmental and health concerns. We derive a stoichiometric model describing the population dynamics and toxicity of cyanobacteria in north-temperate freshwater ecosystems. Our model quantifies the hypoxic effects of CBs on fish mortality and evaluates the impact of microcystin-LR (MC-LR) on aquatic macro-invertebrates, phytoplankton, and fish species. Analyzing data from diverse north-temperate lakes with varying physical characteristics, we identify eutrophication as a pivotal catalyst in bloom proliferation. Under predicted warming scenarios coupled with increased eutrophication, peak MC-LR concentrations will surge dramatically, and blooms will occur earlier in the year. We uncover severe bioaccumulation of MC-LR in higher trophic species; the response to CBs among fish at intermediate trophic levels was heterogeneous across lakes. We compare our model against observations from several north-temperate lakes, demonstrating its robustness and applicability. Our insights are critical for informing targeted interventions to mitigate CBs.</description>

      <title>TL;DR: Too Long, Do Re-weighting for Efficient LLM Reasoning Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently achieved remarkable progress by leveraging Reinforcement Learning and extended Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques. However, the challenge of performing efficient language reasoning--especially during inference with extremely long outputs--has drawn increasing attention from the research community. In this work, we propose a dynamic ratio-based training pipeline that does not rely on sophisticated data annotations or interpolation between multiple models. We continuously balance the weights between the model's System-1 and System-2 data to eliminate redundant reasoning processes while preserving the model's reasoning capability. We validate our approach across models on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-14B and on a diverse set of benchmarks with varying difficulty levels. Our method significantly reduces the number of output tokens by nearly 40% while maintaining the accuracy of the reasoning. Our code and data will be available soon.</description>
