      <title>Cavity Plasmon: Enhanced Luminescence Effect on InGaN Light Emitting Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fabricated polygonal nanoholes in the top p-GaN layer of the InGaN/GaN light-emitting diode, followed by the deposition of Au/Al metal thin film within the nanoholes to create metal microcavities, thereby constructing the surface plasmon structure. The findings indicate that with increased current injection, the light output of the LEDs rose by 46%, accompanied by a shift of the gain peak position towards the plasmon resonance energy. The maximum enhancement factor increases to 2.38 as the coupling distance decreases from 60 nm to 30 nm. Interestingly, time-resolved photoluminescence data showed that the spontaneous emission decay time lengthened due to the plasmon coupling, suggesting the presence of a new plasmon coupling mechanism. Finite-Difference Time-Domain simulation results show that the electric field is localized at certain locations around the metal microcavity, generating a new type of shape-sensitive plasmon, named Cavity Plasmon here. This intense localization leads to a longer lifetime and enhances the recombination efficiency of excitons. We discuss several unique properties of the cavity plasmon generated by the polygonal metal microcavity with several specific angular shapes. The results demonstrate that the cavity plasmon generated by the polygonal metal microcavity is a highly promising technique for enhancing the light emission performance of of relevant semiconductor optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Photon State Evolution in Arbitrary Time-Varying Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the instantaneous eigenstate method to study the evolution of quantum states in media with arbitrary time-varying permittivity and permeability. This method leverages the Heisenberg equation to bypass the Schr\"odinger equation, which leads to a complicated infinite set of coupled differential equations. Instead, the method allows the computation of the state evolution by solving only two coupled differential equations. Using this approach, we draw general conclusions about photon statistics in time-varying media. Our findings reveal that the maximum probability of generating a single photon pair from vacuum in such media is $25\%$, while Bell states can be created with a maximum probability of $84\%$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the spectral profile of emitted photons can be precisely controlled through the temporal profiles of permittivity and permeability. These results provide deeper insights into photon state manipulation in time-varying media. Furthermore, the instantaneous eigenstate method opens new opportunities to study state evolution in other systems where the Heisenberg equation offers a more tractable solution than the Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Robust asynchronous optical sampling terahertz spectroscopy using commercially available free-running lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents asynchronous optical sampling (ASOPS) terahertz spectroscopy using commercially available Ti:Sapphire lasers without stabilizing repetition frequency. Our postprocessing algorithm using the multiplied repetition frequency difference as the calibration signal successfully corrected the jitter, thereby allowing broadband (2.5 THz) spectroscopy with a high spectral resolution (82 MHz). The robustness of the jitter correction based on the free-running laser setup and broadband electric circuits was rigorously examined under varying temperatures, thereby demonstrating reliable long-term operations over 60 h. This study expands the applicability of the ASOPS terahertz time-domain spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Optical skyrmion lattices accelerating in free space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generation and propagation of optical skyrmions provide a versatile plalform for topologically nontrivial optical informatics and light-matter interactions, but their acceleration along curved trajectories is to be studied. In this study, we experimentally demonstrate the first accelerating skyrmion lattices conveyed by Airy structured light, characterized by topologically stable skyrmion textures with self-acceleration along parabolic trajectories. We show that the skyrmion unit cell can maintain a Skyrme number $|N_\text{sk}|&gt;0.9$ within a propagation range of $\pm1.22\ z_R$ upon parabolic acceleration. Notably, the meron structure remains $|N_\text{sk}|$ stable within $0.5\pm0.02$ over a significantly extended range of $\pm3.06\ z_R$. Our work provides a new potential carrier for topologically robust information distribution, particle sorting and manipulation.</description>

      <title>Arbitrary control of the flow of light using pseudomagnetic fields in photonic crystals at telecommunication wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In photonics, the idea of controlling light in a similar way that magnetic fields control electrons has always been attractive. It can be realized by synthesizing pseudomagnetic fields (PMFs) in photonic crystals (PhCs). Previous works mainly focus on the Landau levels and the robust transport of the chiral states. More versatile control over light using complex nonuniform PMFs such as the flexible splitting and routing of light has been elusive, which hinders their application in practical photonic integrated circuits. Here we propose an universal and systematic methodology to design nonuniform PMFs and arbitrarily control the flow of light in silicon PhCs at telecommunication wavelengths. As proofs of concept, a low-loss S-bend and a highly efficient 50:50 power splitter based on PMFs are experimentally demonstrated. A high-speed data transmission experiment is performed on these devices to prove their applicability in real communication systems. The proposed method offers a new paradigm for the exploration of fundamental physics and the development of novel nanophotonic devices.</description>

      <title>A class of enhanced physics-informed neural networks for data-driven solitons and parameters discovery to (2+ 1)-dimensional coupled nonlinear Schrodinger systems with variable coefficients: vector dark and anti-dark one- and two-solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates data-driven solutions and parameter discovery to (2+ 1)-dimensional coupled nonlinear Schrodinger equations with variable coefficients (VC-CNLSEs), which describe transverse effects in optical fiber systems under perturbed dispersion and nonlinearity. By setting different forms of perturbation coefficients, we aim to recover the dark and anti-dark one- and two-soliton structures by employing an enhanced physics-based deep neural network algorithm, namely a physics-informed neural network (PINN). The enhanced PINN algorithm leverages the locally adaptive activation function mechanism to improve convergence speed and accuracy. In the lack of data acquisition, the PINN algorithms will enhance the capability of the neural networks by incorporating physical information into the training phase. We demonstrate that applying PINN algorithms to (2+ 1)-dimensional VC-CNLSEs requires distinct distributions of physical information. To address this, we propose a region-specific weighted loss function with the help of residual-based adaptive refinement strategy. In the meantime, we perform data-driven parameter discovery for the model equation, classified into two categories: constant coefficient discovery and variable coefficient discovery. For the former, we aim to predict the cross-phase modulation constant coefficient under varying noise intensities using enhanced PINN with a single neural network. For the latter, we employ a dual-network strategy to predict the dynamic behavior of the dispersion and non-linearity perturbation functions. Our study demonstrates that the proposed framework holds significant potential for studying high-dimensional and complex soliton dynamics in optical fiber systems.</description>

      <title>Photon-recycling dielectric laser accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a photon-recycling dielectric laser accelerator (DLA) system based on silicon photonic device. Our DLA system employs guided electromagnetic waves as a primary energy source, modulated to inject into the electron-light interaction region to accelerate or modulate electron beams and recycled the energy for the next round-trip. Long-distance acceleration takes place as electrons interact with the pre-modulated light field. Our loop recycles post-interaction light field, enabling photons reuse across successive cycles. To optimize the interaction process, we developed an adaptive algorithm to refine waveguide structures, and identified an "optimal waveguide accelerator" with superior performance on our dataset. We find that the optimized DLA loop only requires low-power light injection to sufficiently sustain high acceleration gradients for continuous electron beams. Under optimal electron beam intensity, the system achieves exceptionally high photon utilization, ensuring that nearly all injected light power transferred to electrons. Using spectral analysis, we demonstrate that the optimal waveguide also operates as an electron energy filter, selecting and manipulating phase-matched electrons over a broad energy range, even for quantum electron wavefunction shaping. Our photon-recycling DLA setup is not only suitable for low-energy beam accelerators, but also offers versatility as a beam filter or a narrow energy selection combined with other optical elements, the total setup can be further applied to explore free electron quantum optics engaging with the advancing field of photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Improving signal-to-noise ratios in pump-probe spectroscopy on light-sensitive samples by adapting pulse repetition rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study dynamics in solid materials on femto- and picosecond timescales. In such experiments, a pump pulse induces dynamics inside a sample by impulsive light-matter interaction, resulting in dynamics that can be detected using a time-delayed probe pulse. In addition to the desired dynamics, the initial interaction may also lead to unwanted effects that may result in irreversible changes and even damage. Therefore, the achievable signal strength is often limited by the pumping conditions that a sample can sustain. Here we investigate the optimization of ultrafast photoacoustics in various solid thin films. We perform systematic experiments aimed at maximizing the achievable signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio in a given measurement time while limiting sample damage. By varying pump and probe pulse energies, average pump fluence, and repetition rate, we identify different paths towards optimal SNR depending on material properties. Our results provide a strategy for the design of pump-probe experiments, to optimize achievable SNR for samples in which different damage mechanisms may dominate.</description>

      <title>Design for light-based spherical aberration correction of ultrafast electron microscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that ponderomotive interactions near the electron cross-over can be used for aberration correction in ultrafast electron microscopes. Highly magnified electron shadow images from Si$_3$N$_4$ thin films are utilized to visualize the distortions induced by spherical aberrations. Our simulations of electron-light interactions indicate that spherical aberrations can be compensated resulting in an aberration free angle of \SI{8.1}{mrad}. For achieving the necessary light distribution, we use a gradient descent algorithm to optimize Zernike polynomials and shape the light beam into a modified Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian beam.</description>

      <title>Modulation of nanowire emitter arrays using micro-LED technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scalable excitation platform for nanophotonic emitters using individually addressable micro-LED-on-CMOS arrays is demonstrated for the first time. Heterogeneous integration by transfer-printing of semiconductor nanowires was used for the deterministic assembly of the infrared emitters embedded in polymer optical waveguides with high yield and positional accuracy. Direct optical pumping of these emitters is demonstrated using micro-LED pixels as source, with optical modulation (on-off keying) measured up to 150 MHz. A micro-LED-on-CMOS array of pump sources were employed to demonstrate individual control of multiple waveguide coupled nanowire emitters in parallel, paving the way for future large scale photonic integrated circuit applications.</description>

      <title>Principles and Metrics of Extreme Learning Machines Using a Highly Nonlinear Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical computing offers potential for ultra high-speed and low latency computation by leveraging the intrinsic properties of light. Here, we explore the use of highly nonlinear optical fibers (HNLFs) as platforms for optical computing based on the concept of Extreme Learning Machines. Task-independent evaluations are introduced to the field for the first time and focus on the fundamental metrics of effective dimensionality and consistency, which we experimentally characterize for different nonlinear and dispersive conditions. We show that input power and fiber characteristics significantly influence the dimensionality of the computational system, with longer fibers and higher dispersion producing up to 100 principal components (PCs) at input power levels of 30 mW, where the PC correspond to the linearly independent dimensions of the system. The spectral distribution of the PC's eigenvectors reveals that the high-dimensional dynamics facilitating computing through dimensionality expansion are located within 40~nm of the pump wavelength at 1560~nm, providing general insight for computing with nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation systems. Task-dependent results demonstrate the effectiveness of HNLFs in classifying MNIST dataset images. Using input data compression through PC analysis, we inject MNIST images of various input dimensionality into the system and study the impact of input power upon classification accuracy. At optimized power levels we achieve a classification test accuracy of 88\%, significantly surpassing the baseline of 83.7\% from linear systems. Noteworthy, we find that best performance is not obtained at maximal input power, i.e. maximal system dimensionality, but at more than one order of magnitude lower. The same is confirmed regarding the MNIST image's compression, where accuracy is substantially improved when strongly compressing the image to less than 50 PCs.</description>

      <title>Wafer-scale correlated morphology and optoelectronic properties in GaAs/AlGaAs core-shell nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving uniform nanowire size, density, and alignment across a wafer is challenging, as small variations in growth parameters can impact performance in energy harvesting devices like solar cells and photodetectors. This study demonstrates the in-depth characterization of uniformly grown GaAs/AlGaAs core-shell nanowires on a two-inch Si(111) substrate using Ga-induced self-catalyzed molecular beam epitaxy. By integrating Scanning Electron Microscopy and Time Correlated Single-Photon Counting, we establish a detailed model of structural and optoelectronic properties across wafer and micron scales. While emission intensity varies by up to 35\%, carrier lifetime shows only 9% variation, indicating stable material quality despite structural inhomogeneities. These findings indicate that, for the two-inch GaAs/AlGaAs nanowire wafer, achieving uniform nanowire coverage had a greater impact on consistent optoelectronic properties than variations in material quality, highlighting its significance for scalable III-V semiconductor integration on silicon in advanced optoelectronic devices such as solar cells and photodetectors.</description>

      <title>Incoherent Diffraction Imaging with a Pseudo-Thermal Light Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incoherent Diffraction Imaging - IDI - is a diffraction-based imaging technique that has been recently proposed to exploit the partial coherence of incoherently scattered light to retrieve structural information from the scattering centers. Similar to the stellar intensity interferometry of Hanbury Brown and Twiss, the signal builds up on the second-order spatial correlations of the emitted light. The complex spatial distribution of the target is thereby encoded in the spatial intensity fluctuations of the scattered light. The first experimental realisations of this imaging technique have been realised using the fluorescence excited by an ultra-short X-ray pulse at Free Electron Laser (FEL) facilities. Here, we propose an alternative set-up based on a table-top Pseudo-Thermal Light Source. This set-up allows us to explore IDI under a wide range of physically relevant conditions as well as to benchmark numerical and analytical models currently used to determine the imaging capabilities of this technique.</description>

      <title>Optimized Sampling for Non-Line-of-Sight Imaging Using Modified Fast Fourier Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-line-of-Sight (NLOS) imaging systems collect light at a diffuse relay surface and input this measurement into computational algorithms that output a 3D volumetric reconstruction. These algorithms utilize the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to accelerate the reconstruction process but require both input and output to be sampled spatially with uniform grids. However, the geometry of NLOS imaging inherently results in non-uniform sampling on the relay surface when using multi-pixel detector arrays, even though such arrays significantly reduce acquisition times. Furthermore, using these arrays increases the data rate required for sensor readout, posing challenges for real-world deployment. In this work, we utilize the phasor field framework to demonstrate that existing NLOS imaging setups typically oversample the relay surface spatially, explaining why the measurement can be compressed without significantly sacrificing reconstruction quality. This enables us to utilize the Non-Uniform Fast Fourier Transform (NUFFT) to reconstruct from sparse measurements acquired from irregularly sampled relay surfaces of arbitrary shapes. Furthermore, we utilize the NUFFT to reconstruct at arbitrary locations in the hidden volume, ensuring flexible sampling schemes for both the input and output. Finally, we utilize the Scaled Fast Fourier Transform (SFFT) to reconstruct larger volumes without increasing the number of samples stored in memory. All algorithms introduced in this paper preserve the computational complexity of FFT-based methods, ensuring scalability for practical NLOS imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum undetected optical projection tomography</title>

Abstract: Quantum imaging with undetected photons (QIUP) is an emerging technique that decouples the processes of illuminating an object and projecting its image. The properties of the illuminating and detected light can thus be simultaneously optimised for both contrast on a sample and sensitivity on a camera. Here, we combine QIUP with computed tomography to enable three-dimensional (3D) infrared imaging. The image data is registered with a standard silicon camera at a wavelength of 810 nm, but the extracted 3D images map the sample's absorption at a wavelength of 1550 nm, well beyond the camera's sensitivity. Quantum Undetected Optical Projection Tomography (QUOPT) enables label-free volumetric sensing at difficult to detect wavelengths, such as those that allow molecular imaging contrast, or those within the infrared biological transmission windows.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of cathodoluminescence from photon statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence (CL), the emission of light induced by accelerated free electrons, has been extensively utilized in various applications, such as displays, streak cameras, and high-spatial-resolution analysis of optical material, surpassing the diffraction limit of light. Despite its long history, the photon statistics of CL have only recently been examined, revealing unexpectedly large bunching of photons. Here we find that this peculiar photon bunching contains information of intervening excitation processes before the photon emission, which can be extracted from the photon statistics within each excitation event by a single free electron. Using this approach, we experimentally unveiled the statistical differences of coherent CL involving a single electromagnetic interaction process and incoherent CL involving multiple excitation processes. The developed formulation is universally applicable for particle generation processes in general to investigate the nature of cascade reactions.</description>

      <title>Dilated space-and-wavelength selective crosspoint optical switch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic integrated switches that are both space and wavelength selective are a highly promising technology for data-intensive applications as they benefit from multi-dimensional manipulation of optical signals. However, scaling these switches normally poses stringent challenges such as increased fabrication complexity and control difficulties, due to the growing number of switching elements. In this work, we propose a new type of dilated crosspoint topology, which efficiently handles both space and wavelength selective switching, while reducing the required switching element count by an order of magnitude compared to reported designs. To the best of our knowledge, our design requires the fewest switching elements for an equivalent routing paths number and it fully cancels the first-order in-band crosstalk. We demonstrate such an ultra-compact space-and-wavelength-selective switch (SWSS) at a scale of $4\times 4\times 4\lambda$ on the silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. Experimental results reveal that the switch achieves an insertion loss ranging from 2.3 dB to 8.6 dB and crosstalk levels in between -35.3 dB and -59.7 dB. The add-drop microring-resonators (MRRs) are equipped with micro-heaters, exhibiting a rise and fall time of 46 $\mu$s and 0.33 $\mu$s, respectively. These performance characteristics highlight the switch's ultra-low element count and crosstalk with low insertion loss, making it a promising candidate for advanced data center applications.</description>

      <title>Electron vortex beams for chirality probing at the nanoscale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we propose a method for probing the chirality of nanoscale electromagnetic near fields utilizing the properties of a coherent superposition of free-electron vortex states in electron microscopes. Electron beams optically modulated into vortices carry orbital angular momentum, thanks to which they are sensitive to the spatial phase distribution and topology of the investigated field. The sense of chirality of the studied specimen can be extracted from the spectra of the electron beam with nanoscale precision owing to the short picometer de Broglie wavelength of the electron beam. We present a detailed case study of the interaction of a coherent superposition of electron vortex states and the optical near field of a golden nanosphere illuminated by circularly polarized light as an example, and we examine the chirality sensitivity of electron vortex beams on intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanoantennae.</description>

      <title>Manipulating spectral transitions and photonic transmission in a non-Hermitian optical system through nanoparticle perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, extensive research has been dedicated to the study of parity-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry, which involves the engineered balance of gain and loss in non-Hermitian optics. Complementary to $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, the concept of anti-$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry has emerged as a natural framework for describing the dynamics of open systems with dissipations. In this work, we study spectral transitions and photon transmission in a linear spinning resonator perturbed by nanoparticles. First, we show that by precisely controlling the nanoparticle perturbations, the eigenvalues (or spectra) of a non-Hermitian system satisfying anti-$\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry can transit to that of a quasi-closed Hermitian system. Second, we outline the essential conditions for constructing a quasi-closed system and analyze its dynamic behavior with respect to photon transmission. By adjusting the rotational angular velocity of the spinning resonator and the strength of the nanoparticle perturbations, the quasi-closed system enables a variety of photon distribution behaviors, which may have significant applications in quantum devices. Our findings offer valuable insights for the design of dissipative quantum devices under realistic conditions and for understanding their responses to external perturbations.</description>

      <title>Terabit-class coherent communications enabled by an integrated photonics erbium doped amplifier</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent technologies have revolutionized optical communications, driving the capacity per fiber to multi-terabit per second (Tb/s) in combination with wavelength division multiplexing (WDM). With an ever-increasing deployment density of coherent systems, the demand for highly integrated WDM coherent transceivers has been rising. While tremendous progress has been made on silicon photonics compatible high-speed modulation and photodetection on chip, a solution for monolithically integrable amplifier with high gain and output power remains a challenge. Recently, an erbium doped waveguide amplifier based on ultra-low loss silicon nitride waveguides has demonstrated gain and output power levels potentially suitable for Terabit class coherent communications. Here, we demonstrate a WDM coherent system enabled by this integrated photonic amplification solution. The system uses the waveguide amplifier as a booster amplifier of 16 WDM signals each carrying a net data rate of 1.6 Tb/s, achieving 25.6-Tb/s net capacity over 81-km fiber transmission. Our results highlight a fully integrated solution for highly parallel coherent transceivers including amplification, that has the potential to transform future optical communications.</description>

      <title>Realizing multiband states with ultracold dipolar quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The manipulation of dipolar interactions within ultracold molecular ensembles represents a pivotal advancement in experimental physics, aiming at the emulation of quantum phenomena unattainable through mere contact interactions. Our study uncovers regimes of multiband occupation which allow to probe more realistic, complex long-range interacting lattice models with ultracold dipolar simulators. By mapping out experimentally relevant ranges of potential depths, interaction strengths, particle fillings, and geometric configurations, we calculate the agreement between the state prepared in the quantum simulator and a target lattice state. We do so by separately calculating numerically exact many-body wave functions in the continuum and single- or multiband lattice representations, and building their many-body state overlaps. Our findings reveal that for shallow lattices and stronger interactions above half filling, multiband population increases, resulting in fundamentally different ground states than the ones observed in simple lowest-band descriptions, e.g. striped vs checkerboard states. A wide range of probed parameter regimes in its turn provides a systematic and quantitative blueprint for realizing multiband states with two-dimensional quantum simulators employing ultracold dipolar molecules.</description>

      <title>An inconsistency in the CHSH inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Violation of the CHSH inequality supposedly demonstrates an irreconcilable conflict between quantum mechanics and local, realistic hidden variable theories. We show that the mathematical assumptions underlying the proof of the CHSH inequality are, in fact, incompatible with the physics of the experiments testing such inequality. This implies that we cannot dismiss local realistic hidden variable theories on the basis of currently available experimental data yet. However, we also show that an experimental proof of CHSH inequality is, in principle, possible, but it is unclear how to implement, in practice, such an experiment.</description>
