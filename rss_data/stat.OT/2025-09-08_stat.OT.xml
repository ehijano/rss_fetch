      <title>The Actuary's Final Word on Algorithmic Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Paul Meehl's foundational work "Clinical versus Statistical Prediction," provided early theoretical justification and empirical evidence of the superiority of statistical methods over clinical judgment. Despite a century of empirical evidence supporting Meehl's central thesis, from early parole prediction studies in the 1920s to modern meta-analyses, confusion persists regarding when and why his troubling finding applies. This paper provides a contemporary theoretical justification for Meehl's result. Importantly, Meehl's prediction problems require a small set of possible outcomes and machine-readable data. Second, individual predictions and decisions are evaluated only on average. This formulation leads to a natural analysis from statistical decision theory, which shows that statistical rules are more accurate than clinical intuition almost by definition. Meehl's prediction paradox is an example of metrical determinism, where the rules of evaluation implicitly determine the best procedure. The decision-theoretic analysis of Meehl's problem elucidates the utility of algorithmic systems as decision-support tools, but also reveals their natural shortcomings, inducing expertise erosion, decision fatigue, and the usurpation of discretionary judgment.</description>

      <title>Bridge Modal Identification using Single Moving Sensor under Random Traffic Loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the feasibility of utilizing the response recorded by a single moving sensor to identify the modal parameters of a bridge system under different loading conditions, such as known excitation and unknown random traffic-induced vibrations. The sensor traverses the bridge and captures its dynamic response (acceleration). The natural frequencies and damping ratios are identified using the moving sensor data in the frequency domain. In the case of known inputs, these parameters are then used to obtain the mode shapes, expressed as a linear combination of basic orthonormal polynomials (BOPs), with the coefficients of the BOPs in the linear combinations obtained via optimization. A statistical formulation is proposed to estimate the mode shapes in the case of unknown random traffic-induced vibrations, including the effect of road roughness. It is shown that the absolute value of the mode shapes are proportional to the ensemble standard deviation (SD) of the modal responses. This approach requires the sensor to traverse the bridge multiple times, with the mode shapes identified in both the time domain using variances, and in frequency domain through the evolutionary power spectrum of these responses. The random traffic loading is modeled such that vehicle arrival times follow a Poisson distribution, while the mass and velocity of the vehicles are assumed to follow uniform distributions. To incorporate the effect of road roughness, modeled as a homogeneous random field, a vehicle-bridge-interaction (VBI) model is utilized. Numerical validation under the different loading conditions demonstrates that a single moving sensor can be used to identify the modal parameters quite accurately, with high spatial resolution of the identified mode shapes, offering a cost-effective and efficient alternative for bridge health monitoring.</description>
