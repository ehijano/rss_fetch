      <title>Dielectric Loaded Waveguide Terahertz LINACs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric loaded waveguides (DLWs) driven by multicycle terahertz (THz) pulses hold great promise as compact linear accelerators (LINACs) due to their ability to sustain higher breakdown fields at THz frequencies compared to conventional RF components. Precise control of the THz pulse's phase and group velocities within the DLW can be achieved by adjusting the dimensions of the dielectric tube. Optimization of the DLW parameters has to take various factors into account like initial electron energy, THz pulse energy available, THz pulse width, DLW dimensions, etc. To maximize the final kinetic energy of the accelerated electrons, this study presents a comprehensive analytical/numerical guideline for cylindrical DLW LINACs. Additionally, graphic representations are introduced to visualize optimal designs for varying initial electron and THz pulse energies. The provided guideline figures enable designers to tailor the accelerator to specific requirements, paving the way for potential advancements in THz-driven particle acceleration and offering cost-effective alternatives to conventional RF accelerators for various scientific, industrial, and medical applications.</description>

      <title>Generation of a reflected wave in an inhomogeneous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we present the results of calculation of the electric field distribution in the inhomogeneous media based on the generalized WKB method. In this approach the field is represented as the sum of two components, one of which is associated with the right-travelling WKB solution and the other with the left-travelling WKB solution. It has been shown that the second component is not a left-travelling nonuniform wave. Calculation results showed that the phase distribution of this component has an increasing character, similar to the phase distribution of the right-travelling wave component. Obtained results can be useful during the development of dielectric accelerating waveguides. The obtained results may also indicate the location where a semiclassical particle with energy greater than the barrier height can reflect from a smooth potential barrier.</description>

      <title>Diamond-defect engineering of NV- centers using ion beam irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between ion beam modification techniques in the MeV range and the controlled generation of negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in nitrogen-doped synthetic diamond crystals is explored. An experimental approach employing both light (H+) and heavy (Br+6) ions was followed to assess their respective impacts on the creation of NV- centers, using different ion energies or fluences to generate varying amounts of vacancies. Photoluminescence spectroscopy was applied to characterize NV- and neutral NV0 centers. Initially, no NV centers were detected post-irradiation, despite the presence of substitutional nitrogen and vacancies. However, after annealing at 800C (and in some cases at 900C), most samples exhibited a high density of NV0 and especially NV- centers. This demonstrates that thermal treatment is essential for vacancy-nitrogen recombination and NV- formation, often through electron capture from nearby nitrogen atoms. Notably, we achieved high NV- densities without graphitization, which is essential for preserving the material's properties for quantum applications. This study underscores and quantifies the effectiveness of MeV-range ions in controlling vacancy distributions and highlights their potential for optimizing NV- center formation to enhance the sensitivity of diamond-based quantum magnetic sensors.</description>

      <title>Four-dimensional phase space tomography from one-dimensional measurements of a hadron beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02862v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use one-dimensional measurements to infer the four-dimensional phase space density of an accumulated proton beam in the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) accelerator. The reconstruction was performed by maximizing the distribution's entropy subject to the measurement constraints, and thus represents the most conservative inference from the data. The reconstructed distribution reproduces the measured profiles down to the noise level, and simulations indicate that the problem is reasonably well-constrained. Similar measurements could serve as benchmarks for beam dynamics simulations in the SNS or hadron accelerators.</description>
