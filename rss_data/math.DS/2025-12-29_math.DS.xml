      <title>Ergodic optimization for Gauss's continued fraction map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of ergodic optimization for distance-expanding maps is extended to Gauss's continued fraction map. Since the set of invariant probability measures is not weak$^*$ closed, we establish a characterisation of the closure of this set, and investigate limit-maximizing measures for H\"older continuous functions. Although a Ma\~n\'e cohomology lemma is shown to hold, the typical periodic optimization conjecture is shown to fail, as a consequence of the typical finite optimization property established for a certain class of (rationally maximized) functions. The typical periodic optimization (TPO) property is shown to hold, however, for the class of $\alpha$-H\"older essentially compact functions.</description>

      <title>Local identifiability of a parameter function in a system of differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of local parameter identifiability of a parameter function in a system of ordinary differential equations. Previously, in this problem, the case where the dimensions of a parameter and a solution of a system coincide was considered, and a specific class of systems was identified, for which sufficient conditions for local parametric identifiability were obtained. We extend these results and consider a wider class of systems of differential equations, as well as the case where the dimension of a parameter is less than or equal to the dimension of a solution of a system. In both cases, sufficient conditions are derived for the local identifiability of a parameter function based on observations of a solution at a finite number of points.</description>

      <title>Existence of spectral submanifolds in time delay systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral submanifolds (SSMs) are invariant manifolds of a dynamical system, defined by the property of being tangent to a spectral subspace of the linearized dynamics at a steady state. We show existence, along with certain desirable properties such as smoothness, attractivity and conditional uniqueness, of SSMs associated to a large class of spectral subspaces in time delay systems. Building on these results, we generalize the criteria for existence of inertial manifolds -- defined as globally exponentially attracting Lipschitz invariant manifolds of finite dimension -- and show that they need not have dimension equal to that of the physical configuration, in contrast to previous accounts. We then demonstrate the applicability of these results on a few simple examples.</description>

      <title>A Frobenius-Optimal Projection for Enforcing Linear Conservation in Learned Dynamical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of restoring linear conservation laws in data-driven linear dynamical models. Given a learned operator $\widehat{A}$ and a full-rank constraint matrix $C$ encoding one or more invariants, we show that the matrix closest to $\widehat{A}$ in the Frobenius norm and satisfying $C^\top A = 0$ is the orthogonal projection $A^\star = \widehat{A} - C(C^\top C)^{-1}C^\top \widehat{A}$. This correction is uniquely defined, low rank and fully determined by the violation $C^\top \widehat{A}$. In the single-invariant case it reduces to a rank-one update. We prove that $A^\star$ enforces exact conservation while minimally perturbing the dynamics, and we verify these properties numerically on a Markov-type example. The projection provides an elementary and general mechanism for embedding exact invariants into any learned linear model.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Averaging on Dynamic Graphs with Selective Neighborhood Contraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a discrete-time consensus model in which agents iteratively update their states through interactions on a dynamic social network. At each step, a single agent is selected asynchronously and averages the values of its current neighbors. A distinctive feature of our model is that an agent's neighborhood may contract following an update, while non-selected agents may add or remove neighbors independently. This creates a time-varying communication structure with endogenous contraction. We show that under mild assumptions--specifically, that the evolving graph is connected infinitely often--the system reaches consensus almost surely. Our results extend classical consensus theory on time-varying graphs and asynchronous updates by introducing selective neighborhood contraction, offering new insights into agreement dynamics in evolving social systems.</description>

      <title>Benign Nonconvexity of Synchronization Landscape Induced by Graph Skeletons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the homogeneous Kuramoto model on a graph and study the geometry of its associated nonconvex energy landscape. This problem admits a dual interpretation. On the one hand, it can be viewed as a geometric optimization problem, seeking configurations of phases that minimize the energy function $E(\boldsymbol{\theta}):=-\sum_{1\leq i,j\neq n}A_{ij}\cos(\theta_i-\theta_j)$. On the other hand, the same function serves as the potential governing the dynamics of the classical homogeneous Kuramoto model. A central question is to identify which graphs induce a benign energy landscape, in the sense that every second-order stationary point is a global minimizer, corresponding to the fully synchronized state. In this case, the graph is said to be globally synchronizing. Most existing results establish global synchronization by relating a given graph to the complete graph, which is known to be globally synchronizing, and by showing that graphs sufficiently close to it inherit this property. In contrast, we uncover a fundamentally different mechanism: global synchronization, despite being a collective phenomenon, unfolds on these graphs through a sequential process of local synchronization that propagates along their structural skeletons. Our approach is based on a detailed analysis of the phasor geometry at second-order stationary points of the nonconvex energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Finite Groups of Random Walks in the Quarter Plane and Periodic $4$-bar Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve two long standing open problems, one from probability theory formulated by Malyshev in 1970 and another one from a crossroad of geometry and dynamics, going back to Darboux in 1879. The Malyshev problem is of finding effective, explicit necessary and sufficient conditions in the closed form to characterize all random walks in the quarter plane with a finite group of the random walk of order $2n$, for all $n\ge 2$, in the generic case where the underlining biquadratic is an elliptic curve. Until now, the results were known only for $n=2, 3, 4$ and were obtained using ad-hoc methods developed separately for each of the three cases. We provide a method that solves the problem for all $n$ and in a unified way. We also consider situations with singular biquadratics. Further, we establish a new two-way relationship between \emph{diagonal} random walks in the quarter plane and $4$-bar links. We describe all $n$-periodic Darboux transformations for $4$-bar link problems for all $n\ge 2$, thus completely solving the Darboux problem, that he solved for $n=2$. We introduce \emph{$k$ semi-periodicity} as a novel and natural type of periodicity of the Darboux transformations, where after $k$ iterations of the Darboux transformation, a polygonal configuration maps to a congruent one, but of opposite orientation. By introducing new objects, \emph{the secondary $(2-2)$-correspondence} and the related \emph{secondary cubic} of the centrally-symmetric biquadratics, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for $k$-semi-periodicity for $4$-bar links for all $k\ge 2$ in an explicit closed form.</description>

      <title>On some aspects of local thermodynamical formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2007, Ye \&amp; Zhang introduced a version of local topological entropy. Since their entropy function is, as we show under mild conditions, constant for topologically transitive dynamical systems, we propose to adjust the notion in a way that does not neglect the initial transient part of an orbit. We investigate the properties of this ``transient'' version, which we call translocal entropy, and compute it in terms of Lyapunov exponents for various dynamical systems. We also investigate how this adjustment affects measure-theoretic local (Brin-Katok) entropy and local pressure functions, generalizing some partial variation principles of Ma \&amp; Wen.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Weighted Contact Networks: Spectral Reduction and Global Stability in a Markovian SIR Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new network-based SIR epidemic model in which transmission is modulated by a curvature-weighted contact matrix that encodes structural and geometric features of the underlying graph. The formulation encompasses both adjacency-driven and Markovian mixing, allowing heterogeneous interactions to be shaped by curvature-sensitive topological properties. We prove that the basic reproduction number satisfies \[ R_0=\frac{\beta}{\gamma}\lambda_{\max}(M), \] where $M$ is the curvature-weighted transmission operator. Using Perron--Frobenius theory together with linear and nonlinear Lyapunov functionals, we establish: (i) global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium when $R_0&lt;1$, and (ii) existence and global asymptotic stability of a unique endemic equilibrium when $R_0&gt;1$. Our results show that curvature acts as a geometric regularizer of connectivity, lowering spectral radii, raising effective epidemic thresholds, and organizing the long-term dynamics through monotone contraction toward the endemic state. This framework generalizes classical network epidemiology by integrating geometric information directly into transmission operators, providing a rigorous foundation for epidemic dynamics on structurally heterogeneous networks.</description>

      <title>Mixing for dynamical systems driven by stationary noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the problem of long-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions for classes of ODEs and PDEs, perturbed by stationary noises. The latter are not assumed to be $\delta$-correlated in time, so that the evolution in question is not necessarily Markovian. We first prove an abstract result which imply the mixing for random dynamical systems satisfying appropriate dissipativity and controllability conditions. It is applicable to a large class of evolution equations, and we illustrate it on the examples of a chain of anharmonic oscillators coupled to heat reservoirs, the 2d Navier-Stokes system, and a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Our results also apply to the general theory of random processes on the 1d lattice and allow one to get for them results related to Dobrushin's theorems on reconstructing processes via their conditional distributions. The proof is based on an iterative construction with quadratic convergence. It uses the method of Kantorovich functional, introduced in [KPS02, Kuk02, Kuk06] in the context of randomly forced PDEs, and some ideas suggested in [Shi15, KNS20] to prove mixing with the help of controllability properties of an associated system</description>
