      <title>A p-value for Process Tracing and other N=1 Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a method for calculating \(p\)-values when testing causal theories about a single case, for instance when conducting process tracing. As in Fisher's (1935) original design, our \(p\)-value indicates how frequently one would find the same or more favorable evidence while entertaining a rival theory (the null) for the sake of argument. We use an urn model to represent the null distribution and calibrate it to privilege false negative errors and reduce false positive errors. We also present an approach to sensitivity analysis and for representing the evidentiary weight of different observations. Our test suits any type of evidence, such as data from interviews and archives, observed in any combination. We apply our hypothesis test in two studies: a process tracing classic about the cause of the cholera outburst in Soho (Snow 1855) and a recent process tracing based explanation of the cause of a welfare policy shift in Uruguay (Rossel, Antia, and Manzi 2023).</description>

      <title>Novel Fuzzy Centrality Measures in Vague Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social network analysis (SNA) helps us understand the relationships and interactions between individuals, groups, organizations, or other social entities. In the literature, ties are generally considered binary or weighted based on their strength. Nonetheless, when the actors are individuals, these relationships are often imprecise, and identifying them with simple scalars leads to information loss. Indeed, social relationships are often vague in real life, and although previous research has proposed the use of fuzzy networks, these are typically characterized by crisp ties. The use of weighted links does not align with the original philosophy of fuzzy logic, which instead aims to preserve the vagueness inherent in human language and real life. For this reason, this paper proposes a generalization of the so-called Fuzzy Social Network Analysis (FSNA) to the context of imprecise relationships among actors. Dealing with imprecise ties and introducing fuzziness in the definition of relationships requires an extension of social network analysis, defining ties as fuzzy numbers instead of crisp values and extending classical centrality indices to fuzzy centrality indexes. The article presents the theory and application of real data collected through a fascinating mouse-tracking technique to study the fuzzy relationships in a collaboration network among the members of a university department.</description>
