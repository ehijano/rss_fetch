      <title>What you say or how you say it? Predicting Conflict Outcomes in Real and LLM-Generated Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When conflicts escalate, is it due to what is said or how it is said? In the conflict literature, two theoretical approaches take opposing views: one focuses on the content of the disagreement, while the other focuses on how it is expressed. This paper aims to integrate these two perspectives through a computational analysis of 191 communication features -- 128 related to expression and 63 to content. We analyze 1,200 GPT-4 simulated conversations and 12,630 real-world discussions from Reddit. We find that expression features more reliably predict destructive conflict outcomes across both settings, although the most important features differ. In the Reddit data, conversational dynamics such as turn-taking and conversational equality are highly predictive, but they are not predictive in simulated conversations. These results may suggest a possible limitation in simulating social interactions with language models, and we discuss the implications for our findings on building social computing systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient Network Embedding by Approximate Equitable Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural network embedding is a crucial step in enabling effective downstream tasks for complex systems that aims to project a network into a lower-dimensional space while preserving similarities among nodes. We introduce a simple and efficient embedding technique based on approximate variants of equitable partitions. The approximation consists in introducing a user-tunable tolerance parameter relaxing the otherwise strict condition for exact equitable partitions that can be hardly found in real-world networks. We exploit a relationship between equitable partitions and equivalence relations for Markov chains and ordinary differential equations to develop a partition refinement algorithm for computing an approximate equitable partition in polynomial time. We compare our method against state-of-the-art embedding techniques on benchmark networks. We report comparable -- when not superior -- performance for visualization, classification, and regression tasks at a cost between one and three orders of magnitude smaller using a prototype implementation, enabling the embedding of large-scale networks which could not be efficiently handled by most of the competing techniques.</description>

      <title>ES-KT-24: A Multimodal Knowledge Tracing Benchmark Dataset with Educational Game Playing Video and Synthetic Text Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces ES-KT-24, a novel multimodal Knowledge Tracing (KT) dataset for intelligent tutoring systems in educational game contexts. Although KT is crucial in adaptive learning, existing datasets often lack game-based and multimodal elements. ES-KT-24 addresses these limitations by incorporating educational game-playing videos, synthetically generated question text, and detailed game logs. The dataset covers Mathematics, English, Indonesian, and Malaysian subjects, emphasizing diversity and including non-English content. The synthetic text component, generated using a large language model, encompasses 28 distinct knowledge concepts and 182 questions, featuring 15,032 users and 7,782,928 interactions. Our benchmark experiments demonstrate the dataset's utility for KT research by comparing Deep learning-based KT models with Language Model-based Knowledge Tracing (LKT) approaches. Notably, LKT models showed slightly higher performance than traditional DKT models, highlighting the potential of language model-based approaches in this field. Furthermore, ES-KT-24 has the potential to significantly advance research in multimodal KT models and learning analytics. By integrating game-playing videos and detailed game logs, this dataset offers a unique approach to dissecting student learning patterns through advanced data analysis and machine-learning techniques. It has the potential to unearth new insights into the learning process and inspire further exploration in the field.</description>

      <title>Flexible Diffusion Scopes with Parameterized Laplacian for Heterophilic Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to capture long-range and global topology information is limited by the scope of conventional graph Laplacian, leading to unsatisfactory performance on some datasets, particularly on heterophilic graphs. To address this limitation, we propose a new class of parameterized Laplacian matrices, which provably offers more flexibility in controlling the diffusion distance between nodes than the conventional graph Laplacian, allowing long-range information to be adaptively captured through diffusion on graph. Specifically, we first prove that the diffusion distance and spectral distance on graph have an order-preserving relationship. With this result, we demonstrate that the parameterized Laplacian can accelerate the diffusion of long-range information, and the parameters in the Laplacian enable flexibility of the diffusion scopes. Based on the theoretical results, we propose topology-guided rewiring mechanism to capture helpful long-range neighborhood information for heterophilic graphs. With this mechanism and the new Laplacian, we propose two GNNs with flexible diffusion scopes: namely the Parameterized Diffusion based Graph Convolutional Networks (PD-GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (PD-GAT). Synthetic experiments reveal the high correlations between the parameters of the new Laplacian and the performance of parameterized GNNs under various graph homophily levels, which verifies that our new proposed GNNs indeed have the ability to adjust the parameters to adaptively capture the global information for different levels of heterophilic graphs. They also outperform the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on 6 out of 7 real-world benchmark datasets, which further confirms their superiority.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Fraud Detection: Integrating Reinforcement Learning into Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial fraud refers to the act of obtaining financial benefits through dishonest means. Such behavior not only disrupts the order of the financial market but also harms economic and social development and breeds other illegal and criminal activities. With the popularization of the internet and online payment methods, many fraudulent activities and money laundering behaviors in life have shifted from offline to online, posing a great challenge to regulatory authorities. How to efficiently detect these financial fraud activities has become an urgent issue that needs to be resolved. Graph neural networks are a type of deep learning model that can utilize the interactive relationships within graph structures, and they have been widely applied in the field of fraud detection. However, there are still some issues. First, fraudulent activities only account for a very small part of transaction transfers, leading to an inevitable problem of label imbalance in fraud detection. At the same time, fraudsters often disguise their behavior, which can have a negative impact on the final prediction results. In addition, existing research has overlooked the importance of balancing neighbor information and central node information. For example, when the central node has too many neighbors, the features of the central node itself are often neglected. Finally, fraud activities and patterns are constantly changing over time, so considering the dynamic evolution of graph edge relationships is also very important.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Graph Pooling Based on Minimum Description Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph pooling is an essential part of deep graph representation learning. We introduce MapEqPool, a principled pooling operator that takes the inherent hierarchical structure of real-world graphs into account. MapEqPool builds on the map equation, an information-theoretic objective function for community detection based on the minimum description length principle which naturally implements Occam's razor and balances between model complexity and fit. We demonstrate MapEqPool's competitive performance with an empirical comparison against various baselines across standard graph classification datasets.</description>

      <title>Hyperedge Modeling in Hypergraph Neural Networks by using Densest Overlapping Subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs tackle the limitations of traditional graphs by introducing {\em hyperedges}. While graph edges connect only two nodes, hyperedges connect an arbitrary number of nodes along their edges. Also, the underlying message-passing mechanisms in Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are in the form of vertex-hyperedge-vertex, which let HGNNs capture and utilize richer and more complex structural information than traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). More recently, the idea of overlapping subgraphs has emerged. These subgraphs can capture more information about subgroups of vertices without limiting one vertex belonging to just one group, allowing vertices to belong to multiple groups or subgraphs. In addition, one of the most important problems in graph clustering is to find densest overlapping subgraphs (DOS). In this paper, we propose a solution to the DOS problem via Agglomerative Greedy Enumeration (DOSAGE) algorithm as a novel approach to enhance the process of generating the densest overlapping subgraphs and, hence, a robust construction of the hypergraphs. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that the DOSAGE algorithm significantly outperforms the HGNNs and six other methods on the node classification task.</description>

      <title>Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization-Aware Network Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent representations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as graphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE extracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its polarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the SGAAEs' capability to successfully infer node memberships over the different underlying latent structures while extracting competing communities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the network. Additionally, we introduce the 2-level network polarization problem and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across four real-world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.</description>

      <title>Leadership and Engagement Dynamics in Legislative Twitter Networks: Statistical Analysis and Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we analyze the interaction network on Twitter among members of the 117th U.S. Congress to assess the visibility of political leaders and explore how systemic properties and node attributes influence the formation of legislative connections. We employ descriptive social network statistical methods, the exponential random graph model (ERGM), and the stochastic block model (SBM) to evaluate the relative impact of network systemic properties, as well as institutional and personal traits, on the generation of online relationships among legislators. Our findings reveal that legislative networks on social media platforms like Twitter tend to reinforce the leadership of dominant political actors rather than diminishing their influence. However, we identify that these leadership roles can manifest in various forms. Additionally, we highlight that online connections within legislative networks are influenced by both the systemic properties of the network and institutional characteristics.</description>

      <title>Beyond Uniform Reverse Sampling: A Hybrid Sampling Technique for Misinformation Prevention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:1901.05149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online misinformation has been considered as one of the top global risks as it may cause serious consequences such as economic damages and public panic. The misinformation prevention problem aims at generating a positive cascade with appropriate seed nodes in order to compete against the misinformation. In this paper, we study the misinformation prevention problem under the prominent independent cascade model. Due to the #P-hardness in computing influence, the core problem is to design effective sampling methods to estimate the function value. The main contribution of this paper is a novel sampling method. Different from the classic reverse sampling technique which treats all nodes equally and samples the node uniformly, the proposed method proceeds with a hybrid sampling process which is able to attach high weights to the users who are prone to be affected by the misinformation. Consequently, the new sampling method is more powerful in generating effective samples used for computing seed nodes for the positive cascade. Based on the new hybrid sample technique, we design an algorithm offering a $(1-1/e-\epsilon)$-approximation. We experimentally evaluate the proposed method on extensive datasets and show that it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions.</description>

      <title>Triadic Temporal Exponential Random Graph Models (TTERGM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal exponential random graph models (TERGM) are powerful statistical models that can be used to infer the temporal pattern of edge formation and elimination in complex networks (e.g., social networks). TERGMs can also be used in a generative capacity to predict longitudinal time series data in these evolving graphs. However, parameter estimation within this framework fails to capture many real-world properties of social networks, including: triadic relationships, small world characteristics, and social learning theories which could be used to constrain the probabilistic estimation of dyadic covariates. Here, we propose triadic temporal exponential random graph models (TTERGM) to fill this void, which includes these hierarchical network relationships within the graph model. We represent social network learning theory as an additional probability distribution that optimizes Markov chains in the graph vector space. The new parameters are then approximated via Monte Carlo maximum likelihood estimation. We show that our TTERGM model achieves improved fidelity and more accurate predictions compared to several benchmark methods on GitHub network data.</description>

      <title>Polarized Speech on Online Platforms in the American Political Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15556v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using language models, we analyze approximately 2.5 billion comments from Reddit and Twitter across 1.7 million accounts spanning 2007 to 2023 to study the prevalence and evolution of polarized rhetoric in American political discourse. Our findings show rising outgroup polarization on both platforms, with each new cohort of users displaying higher polarization than the last, and a small fraction of users contributing disproportionately to negative polarization. Polarization varies consistently by topic: right-leaning users are twice as likely to use polarized rhetoric around immigration, while left-leaning users are more polarized on healthcare. On Twitter, U.S. politicians on the left have been consistently more polarized than everyday users, but in the past four years, politicians on the right have experienced the sharpest rise in polarization, surpassing journalists, media, and everyday users. Today, politicians, the group listened to the most for their political rhetoric, are far more polarized than everyday users. On Reddit, a few communities dominate polarized discussions, with the rise and eventual ban of r/TheDonald significantly shaping polarization trends on the right. Our large-scale analysis reveals previously unknown patterns of polarization across groups and topics on two major social media platforms.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Attacks for Black-box Social Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07127v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of online social networks has facilitated the evolution of social recommender systems, which incorporate social relations to enhance users' decision-making process. With the great success of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in learning node representations, GNN-based social recommendations have been widely studied to model user-item interactions and user-user social relations simultaneously. Despite their great successes, recent studies have shown that these advanced recommender systems are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, in which attackers can inject well-designed fake user profiles to disrupt recommendation performances. While most existing studies mainly focus on argeted attacks to promote target items on vanilla recommender systems, untargeted attacks to degrade the overall prediction performance are less explored on social recommendations under a black-box scenario. To perform untargeted attacks on social recommender systems, attackers can construct malicious social relationships for fake users to enhance the attack performance. However, the coordination of social relations and item profiles is challenging for attacking black-box social recommendations. To address this limitation, we first conduct several preliminary studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-community connections and cold-start items in degrading recommendations performance. Specifically, we propose a novel framework MultiAttack based on multi-agent reinforcement learning to coordinate the generation of cold-start item profiles and cross-community social relations for conducting untargeted attacks on black-box social recommendations. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed attacking framework under the black-box setting.</description>

      <title>A Proposal for a FAIR Management of 3D Data in Cultural Heritage: The Aldrovandi Digital Twin Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we analyse 3D models of cultural heritage with the aim of answering three main questions: what processes can be put in place to create a FAIR-by-design digital twin of a temporary exhibition? What are the main challenges in applying FAIR principles to 3D data in cultural heritage studies and how are they different from other types of data (e.g. images) from a data management perspective? We begin with a comprehensive literature review touching on: FAIR principles applied to cultural heritage data; representation models; both Object Provenance Information (OPI) and Metadata Record Provenance Information (MRPI), respectively meant as, on the one hand, the detailed history and origin of an object, and - on the other hand - the detailed history and origin of the metadata itself, which describes the primary object (whether physical or digital); 3D models as cultural heritage research data and their creation, selection, publication, archival and preservation. We then describe the process of creating the Aldrovandi Digital Twin, by collecting, storing and modelling data about cultural heritage objects and processes. We detail the many steps from the acquisition of the Digital Cultural Heritage Objects (DCHO), through to the upload of the optimised DCHO onto a web-based framework (ATON), with a focus on open technologies and standards for interoperability and preservation. Using the FAIR Principles for Heritage Library, Archive and Museum Collections as a framework, we look in detail at how the Digital Twin implements FAIR principles at the object and metadata level. We then describe the main challenges we encountered and we summarise what seem to be the peculiarities of 3D cultural heritage data and the possible directions for further research in this field.</description>
