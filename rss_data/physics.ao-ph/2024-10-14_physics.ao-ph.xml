      <title>IceDiff: High Resolution and High-Quality Sea Ice Forecasting with Generative Diffusion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variation of Arctic sea ice has significant impacts on polar ecosystems, transporting routes, coastal communities, and global climate. Tracing the change of sea ice at a finer scale is paramount for both operational applications and scientific studies. Recent pan-Arctic sea ice forecasting methods that leverage advances in artificial intelligence has made promising progress over numerical models. However, forecasting sea ice at higher resolutions is still under-explored. To bridge the gap, we propose a two-staged deep learning framework, IceDiff, to forecast sea ice concentration at finer scales. IceDiff first leverages an independently trained vision transformer to generate coarse yet superior forecasting over previous methods at a regular 25km x 25km grid. This high-quality sea ice forecasting can be utilized as reliable guidance for the next stage. Subsequently, an unconditional diffusion model pre-trained on sea ice concentration maps is utilized for sampling down-scaled sea ice forecasting via a zero-shot guided sampling strategy and a patch-based method. For the first time, IceDiff demonstrates sea ice forecasting with the 6.25km x 6.25km resolution. IceDiff extends the boundary of existing sea ice forecasting models and more importantly, its capability to generate high-resolution sea ice concentration data is vital for pragmatic usages and research.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of an AI-based climate model through the lens of a heatwave storyline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-based weather and climate models are emerging as accurate and computationally efficient tools. Beyond weather forecasting, they also show promises to accelerate storyline analysis. Here we rigorously evaluate the ability of NeuralGCM to simulate an extreme heatwave against a traditional physics-based climate model. NeuralGCM can accurately reproduce the targeted event and generate stable and realistic mid-century projections. However, the absence of land feedbacks in NeuralGCM underestimates the projected warming amplitude.</description>

      <title>Differential reflectivity columns and hail -- linking C-band radar-based estimated column characteristics to crowdsourced hail observations in Switzerland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential reflectivity columns (ZDRC) have been shown to provide information about a storm's updraft intensity and size. The updraft's characteristics, in turn, influence a severe storm's propensity to produce hail and the size of said hail. Consequently, there is the potential to use ZDRC for the detection and sizing of hail. In this observational study, we investigate the characteristics of ZDRC (volume, height, area, maximum ZDR within) automatically detected on an operational C-band radar network in Switzerland and relate them to hail on the ground using 173'000 crowdsourced hail reports collected over a period of 3.5 years.
  We implement an adapted version of an established ZDRC detection algorithm on a 3D composite of ZDR data derived from five Swiss weather radars. The composite, in combination with the dense network of radars located on differing altitudes up to 3000 m.a.s.l, helps to counteract the effects of the complex topography of the study region. The alpine region presents visibility and data quality challenges, which are especially crucial for measuring ZDRC. Our analysis finds ZDRC present in most hail-producing storms, with higher frequencies in storms producing severe hail. Further, when looking at lifetime maximum values, we find significant differences in various ZDRC characteristics between hail-producing and non-hail-producing storms. We also attempt to determine thresholds to differentiate between storm types. The temporal evolution of the ZDRC proves challenging to investigate due to their intermittent nature. Nevertheless, the peak values of the ZDRC characteristics are most often measured 5-10 minutes before the first hail reports on the ground, highlighting the potential for ZDRC to be used in warning applications.</description>

      <title>Topographic forcing of submesoscale instability in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subpolar frontal zones are characterized by energetic storms, intense seasonal cycles, and close connectivity with surrounding continental shelf topography. At the same time, predicting the ocean state depends on appropriate partition of resolved and parameterized dynamics, the latter of which requires understanding the dynamical processes generating diffusivity throughout the water column. While submesoscale frontal instabilities are shown to produce turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) and mixing in the surface boundary layer (SBL) of the global ocean, their development in complex dynamical regimes (e.g., elevated preexisting turbulence, large ageostrophic shear, or in proximity to topographic boundaries) is less understood. This study investigates the development of submesoscale instabilities, i.e. symmetric instability (SI) and centrifugal instability (CI), near topographic boundaries using a hindcast model of the Drake Passage and Scotia Sea region. The model suggests subsurface SI and CI are widespread along the northern continental margins of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) due to topographic shearing of the anticyclonic side of Polar Front jets. Forced instabilities may facilitate persistent mixing along Namuncur\'a - Burwood Bank, as well as in other southern (northern) hemisphere currents with low potential vorticity and a seamount or sloping topography on the left- (right-) downstream side.</description>

      <title>Compressing high-resolution data through latent representation encoding for downscaling large-scale AI weather forecast model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in weather research has been driven by the ability to learn from large, high-dimensional datasets. However, this progress also poses significant challenges, particularly regarding the substantial costs associated with processing extensive data and the limitations of computational resources. Inspired by the Neural Image Compression (NIC) task in computer vision, this study seeks to compress weather data to address these challenges and enhance the efficiency of downstream applications. Specifically, we propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework tailored for compressing high-resolution datasets, specifically the High Resolution China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (HRCLDAS) with a spatial resolution of 1 km. Our framework successfully reduced the storage size of 3 years of HRCLDAS data from 8.61 TB to just 204 GB, while preserving essential information. In addition, we demonstrated the utility of the compressed data through a downscaling task, where the model trained on the compressed dataset achieved accuracy comparable to that of the model trained on the original data. These results highlight the effectiveness and potential of the compressed data for future weather research.</description>

      <title>X-Raying Neutral Density Disturbances in the Mesosphere and Lower Thermosphere induced by the 2022 Hunga-Tonga Volcano Eruption-Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present X-ray observations of the upper atmospheric density disturbance caused by the explosive eruption of the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai (HTHH) volcano on 15 January 2022. From 14 January to 16 January, the Chinese X-ray astronomy satellite, Insight-HXMT, was observing the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A. The X-ray data obtained during Earth's atmospheric occultations allowed us to measure neutral densities in the altitude range of ~90-150 km. The density profiles above 110 km altitude obtained before the major eruption are in reasonable agreement with expectations by both GAIA and NRLMSIS 2.0 models. In contrast, after the HTHH eruption, a severe density depletion was found up to ~1,000 km away from the epicenter, and a relatively weak depletion extending up to ~7,000 km for over 8 hr after the eruption. In addition, density profiles showed wavy structures with a typical length scale of either ~20 km (vertical) or ~1,000 km (horizontal). This may be caused by Lamb waves or gravity waves triggered by the volcanic eruption.</description>

      <title>The Second Law of Thermodynamics, Life and Earth's Planetary Machinery Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Life is a planetary feature that depends on its environment, but it has also strongly shaped the physical conditions on Earth, having created conditions highly suitable for a productive biosphere. Clearly, the second law of thermodynamics must apply to these dynamics as well, but how? What insights can we gain by placing life and its effects on planetary functioning in the context of the second law? In Kleidon (2010), I described a thermodynamic Earth system perspective by placing the functioning of the Earth system in terms of the second law. The Earth system is represented by a planetary hierarchy of energy transformations that are driven predominantly by incoming solar radiation, these transformations are constrained by the second law, but they are also modified by the feedbacks from various dissipative activities. It was then hypothesised that life evolves its dissipative activity to the limits imposed by this hierarchy and evolves feedbacks aimed at pushing these limits to higher levels of dissipative activity. Here I provide an update of this perspective. I first review applications to climate and global climate change to demonstrate its success in predicting magnitudes of physical processes, particularly regarding temperatures, heat redistribution and hydrological cycling. I then focus on the limits to dissipative activity of the biosphere. It would seem that the limitations by thermodynamics act indirectly by imposing limitations associated with transport and material exchange. I substantiate this interpretation and discuss the broader implications for habitability, the emergence and evolution of life, and the contemporary biosphere.</description>

      <title>YanTian: An Application Platform for AI Global Weather Forecasting Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04539v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To promote the practical application of AI Global Weather Forecasting Models (AIGWFM), we have developed an adaptable application platform named 'YanTian'. This platform enhances existing open-source AIGWFM with a suite of capability-enhancing modules and is constructed by a "loosely coupled" plug-in architecture. The goal of 'YanTian' is to address the limitations of current open-source AIGWFM in operational application, including improving local forecast accuracy, providing spatial high-resolution forecasts, increasing density of forecast intervals, and generating diverse products with the provision of AIGC capabilities. 'YianTian' also provides a simple, visualized user interface, allowing meteorologists easily access both basic and extended capabilities of the platform by simply configuring the platform UI. Users do not need to possess the complex artificial intelligence knowledge and the coding techniques. Additionally, 'YianTian' can be deployed on a PC with GPUs. We hope 'YianTian' can facilitate the operational widespread adoption of AIGWFMs.</description>

      <title>Immersion freezing in particle-based aerosol-cloud microphysics: a probabilistic perspective on singular and time-dependent models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cloud droplets containing ice-nucleating particles (INPs) may freeze at temperatures above the homogeneous freezing threshold temperature. This process, referred to as immersion freezing, is one of the modulators of aerosol-cloud interactions in the Earth's atmosphere. In modeling studies, immersion freezing is often described using either so-called "singular" or "time-dependent" parameterizations. Here, we juxtapose both approaches and discuss them in the context of probabilistic particle-based cloud microphysics modeling. First, using a box model, we contrast how both parameterizations respond to different idealized ambient cooling rate profiles and quantify the impact of the polydispersity of the immersed surface spectrum on the frozen fraction evolution. Second, using a prescribed-flow two-dimensional cloud model, we illustrate the implications of applying the singular model in simulations with flow regimes relevant to ambient cloud conditions rather than to the cloud-chamber experiments on which these parameterizations are built upon. We discuss the critical role of the attribute-space sampling strategy for particle-based model simulations in modeling heterogeneous ice nucleation which is contingent on the presence of relatively sparse immersed INPs. The key takeaways include: (i) The singular approach, constituting a time-integrated form of a more general time-dependent approach, is only applicable under a limited range of ambient cooling rates. (ii) The time-dependent approach, especially when based on water-activity, is suitable for integration with particle-based model components of detailed aerosol composition and collisional growth/breakup. (iii) A flow-coupled aerosol-budget-resolving simulation shows the benefits and challenges of modeling cloud condensation nuclei activation and immersion freezing on insoluble ice nuclei with super-particle methods.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Tornadic Supercell Thunderstorms on the Atmospheric Muon Flux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19311v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tornadoes are severe weather phenomena characterized by a violently rotating column of air connecting the ground to a parent storm. Within the United States, hundreds of tornadoes occur every year. Despite this, the dynamics of tornado formation and propagation are not particularly well understood, in part due to the challenge of instrumentation: many existing instruments for measuring atmospheric properties are in-situ detectors, making deployment in or near an active or developing tornado difficult. Here, we combine local atmospheric and cosmic ray air shower simulation to explore the potential for remote measurement of the pressure field within tornado-producing supercell thunderstorms by examining directional variations of the atmospheric muon flux.</description>

      <title>How far are today's time-series models from real-world weather forecasting applications?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of Time-Series Forecasting (TSF) techniques is often hindered by the lack of comprehensive datasets. This is particularly problematic for time-series weather forecasting, where commonly used datasets suffer from significant limitations such as small size, limited temporal coverage, and sparse spatial distribution. These constraints severely impede the optimization and evaluation of TSF models, resulting in benchmarks that are not representative of real-world applications, such as operational weather forecasting. In this work, we introduce the WEATHER-5K dataset, a comprehensive collection of observational weather data that better reflects real-world scenarios. As a result, it enables a better training of models and a more accurate assessment of the real-world forecasting capabilities of TSF models, pushing them closer to in-situ applications. Through extensive benchmarking against operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, we provide researchers with a clear assessment of the gap between academic TSF models and real-world weather forecasting applications. This highlights the significant performance disparity between TSF and NWP models by analyzing performance across detailed weather variables, extreme weather event prediction, and model complexity comparison. Finally, we summarise the result into recommendations to the users and highlight potential areas required to facilitate further TSF research. The dataset and benchmark implementation are available at: https://github.com/taohan10200/WEATHER-5K.</description>

      <title>Discrete element method model of soot aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soot is a component of atmospheric aerosols that affects climate by scattering and absorbing the sunlight. Soot particles are fractal aggregates composed of elemental carbon. In the atmosphere, the aggregates acquire coatings by condensation and coagulation, resulting in significant compaction of the aggregates that changes the direct climate forcing of soot. Currently, no models exist to rigorously describe the process of soot restructuring, reducing prediction accuracy of atmospheric aerosol models. We develop a discrete element method contact model to simulate restructuring of fractal soot aggregates, represented as assemblies of spheres joined by cohesion and by sintered necks. The model is parametrized based on atomic force spectroscopy data and is used to simulate soot restructuring, showing that the fraction of necks in aggregates determines the restructuring pathway. Aggregates with fewer necks undergo local compaction, while aggregates with nearly-full necking prefer global compaction. Additionally, full compaction occurs within tens of nanoseconds, orders of magnitude faster than the time scale of soot aging through condensation. An important implication is that in atmospheric soot aggregates, the rate of condensation determines how many necks are fractured simultaneously, affecting the restructuring pathway, e.g., producing highly compact, thinly-coated soot as observed in recent studies.</description>
