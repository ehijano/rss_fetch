      <title>A Fluorescent Ratiometric Potassium Sensor Based on IPG4-Silica Microparticles for Selective Detection and Fluorescence Imaging of Potassium Cations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potassium cations play many important roles in living organisms, especially in electro-physiology, since they are involved in neurotransmission and muscle contractions. We report the synthesis of a ratiometric fluorescent microsensor for potassium (K+) detection, based on the fluorescent probe ION potassium green 4. Potassium-sensitive fluorescent microparticles were obtained by using silica as core material. We obtained silica-based microsensors with a size in the micrometer range, spherical shape, good monodispersity, optimal selectivity and a sensitivity range between 0 to 40 mM. The microsensors also proved to be non-toxic in cell cultures as well as suitable for fluorescent imaging, offering new possibilities for non-invasive optical detection, quantification and in situ monitoring of K+ variations in cell culture systems.</description>

      <title>Holistic structure of neural pathways underlies brain perceptual rivalry: A physical perspective of auditory stream segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the brain perceptual functions as emerging from complex neural connections, rather than only the behavior of specific neural groups, is increasingly recognized today. Taking the auditory stream segregation, a classical issue in the field of perceptual behaviors, as an example, we demonstrate its emergence from the topological structure of neural pathways, by constructing a holistic neural circuit model based solely on existing neurophysiological data. Combining quantification of deterministic neural dynamics, potential landscape and probability flux, this model accurately reproduces the nonequilibrium phase transition process from integrated stream to completely segregated streams. The mean duration time (MDT) of the auditory perceptions from the simulation accords with the reported experimental results, and its inverse Gaussian distribution is suggested to complement the original Gamma or Lognormal distributions of the MDT. Further, using average probability flux and entropy production rate, we reveal the dynamical and thermodynamical origins, and the cost of the auditory phase transition process, highlighting the role of time irreversibility and detailed balance breaking as bridges between theory and neurophysiological experiment. Moreover, we propose a fundamental principle for attentional modulation and successfully apply this theoretical framework to an attention-modulated system. Finally, two psychoacoustic experiments are conducted to validate the constructed model and the proposed attention mechanism. Our results highlight that the neural basis of a perceptual and cognitive behavior is not limited to a localized brain neural region, but has a holistic and systematic origin.</description>

      <title>Scale-free flocking and giant fluctuations in epithelial active solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collective motion of epithelial cells is a fundamental biological process which plays a significant role in embryogenesis, wound healing and tumor metastasis. While it has been broadly investigated for over a decade both in vivo and in vitro, large scale coherent flocking phases remain underexplored and have so far been mostly described as fluid. In this work, we report a mode of large-scale collective motion for different epithelial cell types in vitro with distinctive new features. By tracking individual cells, we show that cells move over long time scales coherently not as a fluid, but as a polar elastic solid with negligible cell rearrangements. Our analysis reveals that this solid flocking phase exhibits signatures of long-range polar order, unprecedented in cellular systems, such as scale-free correlations, anomalously large density fluctuations, and shear waves. Based on a general theory of active polar solids, we argue that these features result from massless Goldstone modes, which, in contrast to polar fluids where they are generic, require the decoupling of global rotations of the polarity and in-plane elastic deformations in polar solids. We theoretically show and consistently observe in experiments that the fluctuations of elastic deformations diverge for large system size in such polar active solid phases, leading eventually to rupture and thus potentially loss of tissue integrity at large scales.</description>

      <title>Critical transitions in pancreatic islets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calcium signals in pancreatic beta-cells collectives show a sharp transition from uncorrelated to correlated state resembling a phase transition as the slowly increasing glucose concentration crosses the tipping point. However, the exact nature or the order of this phase transition is not well understood. Using confocal microscopy to record the collective calcium activation of beta-cells in an intact islet under changing glucose concentration in increasing and then decreasing way, we first show that in addition to the sharp transition, the coordinated calcium response exhibits a hysteresis indicating a critical, first order transition. A network model of beta-cells combining link selection and coordination mechanisms capture the observed hysteresis loop and the critical nature of the transition. Our results point towards the understanding the role of islets as tipping elements in the pancreas that interconnected by perfusion, diffusion and innervation cause the tipping dynamics and abrupt insulin release.</description>

      <title>Tipping points in fitness landscape of heterogeneous populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predicting fitness of biologically-active populations, communities or systems in fluctuating environments is a long-standing challenge. Phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedging strategy, two key evolutionary traits living systems harness to optimize fitness in dynamic environments, have been widely reported yet how interplays therein could mediate fitness landscapes of heterogeneous populations remain unknown. Leveraging the financial asset pricing model, here we provide a dynamical framework for fitness of heterogeneous populations, underpinned by the interrelations between sub-populations exhibiting phenotypic plasticity and bet-hedgeding. Our framework, independent of the definition of fitness, employs a nonlinear difference equation to present fitness dynamics, and capture the emergence of tipping points, marking the onset of critical state transitions which lead to catastrophic shifts. This study identifies limits on the selective advantage conferred by bet-hedging through reduction in the temporal variance of fitness, with far-reaching ramifications on our current understanding of hedging-mediated fitness enhancement of a population. The lower bound of the effective fitness variance is set by a maximum number of bet-hedgers, beyond which the fitness landscape approaches critical transition, as confirmed by critical slowing down in the vicinity of tipping points. We estimate the scaling law for the critical slowing down numerically and derive the characteristic recovery time for heterogeneous populations. Taken together, our work provides a generic theoretical framework to quantify fitness dynamics and predict critical transitions in heterogeneous populations. The results can be extended further to model fitness landscapes of natural and synthetic multi-species consortia exposed to environmental fluctuations mimicking climatic shifts and immunopathological settings.</description>

      <title>Designing complex behaviours using signal-passing allosteric self-assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Allosteric effects, where interactions at one part of a complex affect interactions at another part, offer a high degree of control in multi-species processes. These interactions play a crucial role in many natural biological contexts and have also been utilised in artificial nanotechnology systems. Leveraging allosteric principles in synthetic systems holds great potential for designing materials and systems that can autonomously adapt, reconfigure or replicate. In this work, using a simple allosteric model, we design systems to exhibit four different complex behaviours: shape-shifting, fibre growth, sorting and self-replication. As well as showing the design of each behaviour we also calculate and measure key length and time scales, in order to verify that the systems evolve according to the pathways we have developed. Our findings demonstrate that with minimal interaction rules, allosteric systems can be engineered to achieve sophisticated emergent behaviours, opening new avenues for the design of responsive and adaptive materials.</description>

      <title>Selective excitation of work-generating cycles in nonreciprocal living solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent nonreciprocity in active matter drives the formation of self-organized states that transcend the behaviors of equilibrium systems. Integrating experiments, theory and simulations, we demonstrate that active solids composed of living starfish embryos spontaneously transition between stable fluctuating and oscillatory steady states. The nonequilibrium steady states arise from two distinct chiral symmetry breaking mechanisms at the microscopic scale: the spinning of individual embryos resulting in a macroscopic odd elastic response, and the precession of their rotation axis, leading to active gyroelasticity. In the oscillatory state, we observe long-wavelength optical vibrational modes that can be excited through mechanical perturbations. Strikingly, these excitable nonreciprocal solids exhibit nonequilibrium work generation without cycling protocols, due to coupled vibrational modes. Our work introduces a novel class of tunable nonequilibrium processes, offering a framework for designing and controlling soft robotic swarms and adaptive active materials, while opening new possibilities for harnessing nonreciprocal interactions in engineered systems.</description>

      <title>Advanced simulations with PLUMED: OPES and Machine Learning Collective Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological processes occur on time scales longer than those accessible to molecular dynamics simulations. Identifying collective variables (CVs) and introducing an external potential to accelerate them is a popular approach to address this problem. In particular, $\texttt{PLUMED}$ is a community-developed library that implements several methods for CV-based enhanced sampling. This chapter discusses two recent developments that have gained popularity in recent years. The first is the On-the-fly Probability Enhanced Sampling (OPES) method as a biasing scheme. This provides a unified approach to enhanced sampling able to cover many different scenarios: from free energy convergence to the discovery of metastable states, from rate calculation to generalized ensemble simulation. The second development concerns the use of machine learning (ML) approaches to determine CVs by learning the relevant variables directly from simulation data. The construction of these variables is facilitated by the $\texttt{mlcolvar}$ library, which allows them to be optimized in Python and then used to enhance sampling thanks to a native interface inside $\texttt{PLUMED}$. For each of these methods, in addition to a brief introduction, we provide guidelines, practical suggestions and point to examples from the literature to facilitate their use in the study of the process of interest.</description>

      <title>Local stress in cylindrically curved lipid membrane: insights into local versus global lateral fluidity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lipid membranes, fundamental to cellular function, undergo various mechanical deformations. Accurate modeling of these processes necessitates a thorough understanding of membrane elasticity. The lateral shear modulus, a critical parameter describing membrane resistance to lateral stresses, remains elusive due to the membrane's fluid nature. Two contrasting hypotheses, local fluidity and global fluidity, have been proposed. While the former suggests a zero local lateral shear modulus anywhere within lipid monolayers, the latter posits that only the integral of this modulus over the monolayer thickness vanishes. These differing models lead to distinct estimations of other elastic moduli and affect the modeling of biological processes, such as membrane fusion/fission and membrane-mediated interactions. Notably, they predict distinct local stress distributions in cylindrically curved membranes. The local fluidity model proposes isotropic local lateral stress, whereas the global fluidity model predicts anisotropy due to anisotropic local lateral stretching of lipid monolayers. Using molecular dynamics simulations, this study directly investigates these models by analyzing local stress in a cylindrically curved membrane. The results conclusively demonstrate the existence of a static local lateral shear stress and anisotropy in local lateral stress within the monolayers of the cylindrical membrane, strongly supporting the global fluidity model. These findings have significant implications for the calculation of surface elastic moduli and offer novel insights into the fundamental principles governing lipid membrane elasticity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08605v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry offers an alternative tool to detect paramagnetic centers in cells with a favorable combination of magnetic sensitivity and spatial resolution. Here, we employ NV magnetic relaxometry to detect cytochrome C (Cyt-C) nanoclusters. Cyt-C is a water-soluble protein that plays a vital role in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. Under ambient conditions, the heme group in Cyt-C remains in the Fe3+ state, which is paramagnetic. We vary the concentration of Cyt-C from 6 to 54 uM and observe a reduction of the NV spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) from 1.2 ms to 150 us, which is attributed to the spin noise originating from the Fe3+ spins. NV T1 imaging of Cyt-C drop-casted on a nanostructured diamond chip allows us to detect the relaxation rates from the adsorbed Fe3+ within Cyt-C.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04839v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How life started on Earth is an unsolved mystery. There are various hypotheses for the location ranging from outer space to the seafloor, subseafloor or potentially deeper. Here, we applied extensive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to study chemical reactions between NH$_3$, H$_2$O, H$_2$, and CO at pressures (P) and temperatures (T) approximating the conditions of Earth's upper mantle (i.e. 10-13 GPa, 1000-1400 K). Contrary to the previous assumptions that larger organic molecules might readily disintegrate in aqueous solutions at extreme P-T conditions, we found that many organic compounds formed without any catalysts and persisted in C-H-O-N fluids under these extreme conditions, including glycine, ribose, urea, and uracil-like molecules. Particularly, our free energy calculations showed that the C-N bond is thermodynamically stable at 10 GPa and 1400 K. Moreover, while the pyranose (six-membered-ring) form of ribose is more stable than the furanose (five-membered-ring) form at ambient conditions, we observed the predominant formation of the five-membered-ring form of ribose at extreme conditions, which is consistent with the exclusive incorporation of $\beta$-D-ribofuranose in RNA. We have uncovered a previously unexplored pathway through which the crucial biomolecules could be abiotically synthesized from geofluids in the deep interior of Earth and other planets and these formed biomolecules could potentially contribute to the early stage of the emergency of life.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical study of multi-commodity transport in a noisy, nonlinear network. The nonlinearity determines the dynamics of the edge capacities, which can be amplified or suppressed depending on the local current flowing across an edge. We consider network self-organization for three different nonlinear functions: For all three we identify parameter regimes where noise leads to self-organization into more robust topologies, that are not found by the sole noiseless dynamics. Moreover, the interplay between noise and specific functional behavior of the nonlinearity gives rise to different features, such as (i) continuous or discontinuous responses to the demand strength and (ii) either single or multi-stable solutions. Our study shows the crucial role of the activation function on noise-assisted phenomena.</description>
