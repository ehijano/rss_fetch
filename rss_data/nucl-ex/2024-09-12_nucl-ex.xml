      <title>Groomed Event Shapes at HERA and the sPHENIX TPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis summarizes the work of the author in two directions, both aimed at the study of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The first topic presented is a measurement of groomed event shapes using archived data collected by the H1 experiment at HERA. The data analysis methods and physics implications of the results are discussed, with the goal of improving the theoretical description of the hadronic final state in electron-hadron collisions before the construction of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). The second topic concerns the sPHENIX experiment, which is now installed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). The sPHENIX physics program and apparatus will be discussed, along with a description of each of the subdetectors. Special attention will be dedicated to the operating principles, design, and construction of the time projection chamber (TPC).</description>

      <title>Bottom quark energy loss and hadronization with B$^+$ and B$^0_\mathrm{s}$ nuclear modification factors using pp and \PbPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production cross sections of B$^0_\mathrm{s}$ and B$^+$ mesons are reported in proton-proton (pp) collisions recorded by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC with a center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 302 pb$^{-1}$. The cross sections are based on measurements of the B$^0_\mathrm{s}$ $\to$ J/$\psi(\mu^+\mu^-)\phi$(1020)(K$^+$K$^-$) and B$^+$ $\to$ J/$\psi(\mu^+\mu^-)$K$^+$ decay channels. Results are presented in the transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) range 7-50 GeV/$c$ and the rapidity interval $\lvert y \rvert$ $\lt$ 2.4 for the B mesons. The measured $p_\mathrm{T}$-differential cross sections of B$^+$ and B$^0_\mathrm{s}$ in pp collisions are well described by fixed-order plus next-to-leading logarithm perturbative quantum chromodynamics calculations. Using previous PbPb collision measurements at the same nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy, the nuclear modification factors, $R_\mathrm{AA}$, of the B mesons are determined. For $p_\mathrm{T}$ $\lt$ 10 GeV/$c$, both mesons are found to be suppressed in PbPb collisions (with $R_\mathrm{AA}$ values significantly below unity), with less suppression observed for the B$^0_\mathrm{s}$ mesons. In this $p_\mathrm{T}$ range, the $R_\mathrm{AA}$ values for the B$^+$ mesons are consistent with those for inclusive charged hadrons and D$^0$ mesons. Below 10 GeV/$c$, both B$^+$ and B$^0_\mathrm{s}$s are found to be less suppressed than either inclusive charged hadrons or D$^0$ mesons, with the B$^0_\mathrm{s}$ $R_\mathrm{AA}$ value consistent with unity. The $R_\mathrm{AA}$ values found for the B$^+$ and B$^0_\mathrm{s}$ are compared to theoretical calculations, providing constraints on the mechanism of bottom quark energy loss and hadronization in the quark-gluon plasma, the hot and dense matter created in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>$^{61}$Cr as a Doorway to the N = 40 Island of Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports on the measurement of the ground-state spin and nuclear magnetic dipole moment of $^{61}$Cr. The radioactive ion beam was produced at the CERN-ISOLDE facility and was probed using high-resolution resonance ionization laser spectroscopy with the CRIS apparatus. The present ground-state spin measurement $I = \frac{1}{2}$, differing from the previously adopted $I =(\frac{5}{2})$, has significant consequences on the interpretation of existing beta decay data and nuclear structure in the region. The structure and shape of $^{61}$Cr is interpreted with state-of-the-art Large-Scale Shell Model and Discrete-Non-Orthogonal Shell Model calculations. From the measured magnetic dipole moment $\mu(^{61}$Cr$)=+0.539(7)~\mu_N$ and the theoretical findings, its configuration is understood to be driven by 2 particle - 2 hole neutron excitations with an unpaired $1p_{1/2}$ neutron. This establishes the western border of the $N=40$ Island Of Inversion (IoI), characterized by 4 particle - 4 hole neutron components. We discuss the shape evolution along the Cr isotopic chain as a quantum phase transition at the entrance of the $N=40$ IoI.</description>

      <title>Alpha decay law of excited nuclei and its role in stellar decay rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\alpha$ decay is one of the prominent decay modes in the nucleosynthesis of heavy and super-heavy elements synthesized at temperatures of the order of Giga Kelvin. To facilitate the investigation of the role played by the $\alpha$ decay half-lives of thermally excited nuclei in nucleosynthesis calculations, an empirical formula based on a model for the $\alpha$ decay of nuclei in their ground and excited states to daughter nuclei in their ground or excited states is presented. Constants appearing in the analytical expression for the $\alpha$ decay half-life obtained within the model are treated as adjustable parameters and fitted to experimental data on 342 $\alpha$ decays in the range of 82 $\le Z_p \le$ 94, to obtain an excitation energy-dependent decay law. Under the assumption that thermal equilibrium has been reached between nuclear states, temperature ($T$)-dependent half-lives, $t_{1/2}(T)$, for several of the experimentally studied $\alpha$ emitters with 65 $\le Z_p \le$ 94 are presented using available data on the half-lives of excited nuclei. Though the general trend is a decrease in $t_{1/2}(T)$ at elevated temperatures, exceptional cases with increased half-lives are found in the case of some isomeric states. A list of such isomers provided in this work motivates future work involving considerations of their thermal equilibration and role in shaping kilonova light curves.</description>

      <title>Baryon stopping and charge deposition in heavy-ion collisions due to gluon saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute baryon and electric charge deposition in high-energy heavy-ion collisions using the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) Effective Field Theory, where at leading order charge is deposited through multiple scatterings of valence quarks with a saturated gluon target. A simplified phenomenological formula is derived to describe charge deposition, from which the parametrical dependence with collisional energy and geometry can be extracted. We present an approximate analytical prediction of the so-called baryon stopping parameter $\alpha_B$, which shows excellent agreement with the state-of-the art extractions of $\alpha_B$ from experimental data. These results are further validated using the McDIPPER framework, by computing charge deposition at midrapidity across a range of collision energies ($\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}= 62.4 - 5020$ GeV).</description>

      <title>Azimuthal modulations and extraction of generalized parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Azimuthal modulations are crucial for the phenomenological extraction and separation of various generalized parton distributions. We provide a new choice of frame and corresponding formalism to describe the azimuthal distributions, based on the separation of physics occurring at different momentum scales. We demonstrate that this new description is not only well-suited for experimental analysis, but also advantageous in separating contributions from different subprocesses to the same physical cross section.</description>

      <title>Neutron skin and its effects in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron skin is an exotic phenomena in unstable nuclei. The various effects in nuclear reactions caused by the neutron skin and also its relation with the properties of nuclear structure are reviewed in this article. Based on numerous studies with theoretical models, strong correlations have been found between the neutron skin thickness and neutron removal cross section, neutron/proton yield ratio, t/\ch{^3He} yield ratio, neutron-proton momentum difference, isoscaling parameter, photon production, reaction cross sections for neutron induced reactions, charge-changing cross sections difference of mirror nuclei, astrophysical $S$-factor, and other quantities in nuclear reactions induced by neutron-rich nuclei. Moreover, the relationships between neutron skin thickness and some properties of nuclear structure, such as $\alpha$-cluster formation, $\alpha$ decay, nuclear surface, nuclear temperature, and proton radii difference of mirror nuclei, have also been investigated. It also has been shown that the neutron skin plays a crucial role in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Experimentally, an unstable nucleus with neutron skin can be generated by radioactive nuclear beam facilities, and the thickness of neutron skin could be extracted by measuring the sensitive probes, which further helps giving stringent constraints on the equation of state of asymmetric nuclear matter and properties of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Effects of Cluster Transfer-Induced Breakups on $^{12}$C Fragmentation in Hadron Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capability of standard Geant4 PhysicsLists to address the fragmentation of $^{12}$C$-^{12}$C was assessed through a comparative analysis with experimental cross sections reported by Divay et al. and Dudouet et al. The standard PhysicsLists were found to be inadequate in explaining the fragmentation systematics. To address this limitation, the breakup component of fragmentation was systematically integrated into the standard PhysicsList, which successfully replicated the differential and double differential cross sections for $\alpha$ production. This breakup component was modeled using fresco CDCC-CRC calculations. This novel physics process was then incorporated into the Geant4 framework, facilitating the calculation of dose distributions in water and tissue. The application of this method demonstrated a precise reproduction of the dose deposited at the Bragg peak region, corroborating the experimental data from Liedner et al., thereby enhancing the accurate visibility of dose tailing.</description>
