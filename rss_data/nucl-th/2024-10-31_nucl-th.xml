      <title>Is $^{102}$Sb particle-bound or a proton emitter?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One-proton emission from the $^{102}$Sb nucleus is discussed, assuming an inert $^{100}$Sn core and the valence proton and neutron. There are experimentally measured bound states in the $^{100}$Sn-neutron system, whereas no particle-bound $^{100}$Sn-proton state has been observed. With time-dependent three-body calculations, the $1^+$ ground state of $^{102}$Sb is suggested as a possible proton emitter. This conclusion is reached by assuming a weakening effect on the proton-neutron ($pn$) interaction with respect to a bare deuteron. An analogous phenomenon is necessary to reproduce the empirical binding energies of $^{42}$Sc and $^{18}$F. Continuous shift from the unbound to bound regions by changing the $pn$-interaction strength is demonstrated. The lower limit of lifetime is evaluated as $\tau \gtrsim 4.4 \times 10^{-18}$ seconds in the no-$pn$-interaction limit. However, the actual lifetime is expected as longer with a finite $pn$ interaction. Observation of a resonant state in $^{102}$Sb and its decay would provide a benchmark of the $pn$-pairing correlation.</description>

      <title>Pauli energy contribution to nucleus-nucleus interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation delves into understanding how the Pauli exclusion principle influences the bare potential between atomic nuclei through the application of advanced theoretical methodologies. Specifically, the application of the novel Frozen-Hartree-Fock (DCFHF) technique is employed. The resulting potentials demonstrate a noticeable repulsion at short distances, attributed to the effects of the Pauli exclusion principle. To account for dynamic phenomena, such as nucleon transfer processes, the density-constrained time-dependent Hartree-Fock (DC-TDHF) method is utilized. This approach integrates isovector contributions into the potential, shedding light on their influence on fusion reactions. Notably, the inclusion of isovector effects leads to a reduction or enhancement in the inner part of the potential, suggesting a nuanced role of transfer in the fusion process.</description>

      <title>A two-body femtoscopy approach to the proton-deuteron correlation function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proton-deuteron correlation function measured by the ALICE collaboration in high multiplicity p+p collisions shows a momentum dependence which is in contradiction with the predictions of the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz formalism of the two-body interaction. This result motivated a more sophisticated three-body description in terms of a composed deuteron. Encouraged by the good description of other deuteron observables in the context of heavy-ion collisions we revisit this correlation function under the two-body approximation not relying on the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshitz approximation, but using the solution of the Schr\"odinger equation incorporating both strong and Coulomb interactions. The two-body description provides a reasonable agreement to ALICE data for natural values of the source size. Interpreting the previously assumed attractive character of the $(L,S)=(0,3/2)$ channel of the $pd$ interaction into a more-likely repulsion, the results agree better not only with the ALICE measurements but also with recent STAR data in Au+Au collisions.</description>

      <title>Non-Parametric Multi-Messenger Constraints on the Equation of State of Cold Dense Nuclear Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize the now substantial amount of astrophysical observations of neutron stars (NSs), along with perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations at high density, to directly constrain the NS Equation of State (EoS). To this end, we construct non-parametric EoS priors by using Gaussian processes trained on 75 EoSs, which includes models with either hadrons, hyperons or quarks at high densities. We create a prior using the full EoS sample (model-agnostic), and one prior for each EoS family to test model discrimination. These are then utilized in a Bayesian updating scheme by first performing a complete analysis of the binary NS merger event GW170817 with minimal assumptions, and sequentially adding information from X-ray and radio NS observations, along with pQCD calculations. Besides providing standard constraints, such as the pressure at twice nuclear saturation density $p(2\rho_\text{sat})=4.3^{+0.6}_{-0.6}\,\times 10^{34}\text{dyne/cm}^{2}$, at $95\%$ confidence level, for the model agnostic prior, our methodology also allows the constraining of EoS properties such as phase transitions and differentiation among quark, hyperonic or hadronic models.</description>

      <title>Hadronization in small and large systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results on particle production in hadronic collisions at the LHC, from proton-proton (pp) to nucleus-nucleus (AA), challenge the traditional paradigm of hadronization as a universal late-time process which can be factorized from the partonic description of the rest of the event. If the violation of this description in nuclear collisions has been accepted for long -- with several hadronic observables finding a natural interpretation assuming some form of recombination of partons from a deconfined medium -- this same occurrence came as a surprise in proton-proton collisions. Actually, strong indications that hadronization cannot be simply described by universal fragmentation fractions/functions were already found in fixed-target experiments, but limited to specific kinematic regions close to the beam rapidity, so that a complete change of paradigm did not look necessary. Here we show that a wide set of observables finds a natural interpretation assuming that in all high-energy hadronic collisions, from pp to AA, a deconfined medium is formed, acting as a reservoir in which a parton can undergo local color neutralization (LCN) through recombination with an opposite color charge. Hadronization, belonging to the non-perturbative domain of QCD, will always, inevitably, require some amount of educated modelling. However, some commong features to the various proposed model in the literature can be identified, which look necessary in order to describe the most recent data. Here we decide to focus on heavy-flavor (HF) production, since in this case the origin of at least one of the consituent quarks of the final hadron is well known and attributed to an initial hard partonic process.</description>

      <title>Electric, Magnetic and Quadrupole Form Factors and Charge Radii of Vector Mesons: From Light to Heavy Sector in a Contact Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed survey of electric, magnetic and quadrupole form factors of light and heavy spin-1 vector mesons. It complements our analogous analysis of the electromagnetic form factors of pseudoscalar and scalar mesons reported earlier. Our formalism is based upon the Schwinger-Dyson equations treatment of a vector $\times$ vector contact interaction and the Bethe-Salpeter equation description of relativistic two-body bound states. We compute the form factors, associated moments and charge radii, comparing these quantities to earlier theoretical studies and experimental results if and when possible. We also investigate the quark-mass dependence of the charge radii and find the anticipated hierarchy such that it decreases with increasing dressed quark masses. In addition, our analysis shows that the magnetic moment is independent of the mass of the light and heavy mesons. Our results agree with most measurements reported earlier, finding a negative quadrupole moment, implying the charge distribution is oblate.</description>

      <title>Mode analysis of Nambu-Goldstone modes in U(1) charged first-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a mode analysis of a general U(1)-charged first-order relativistic hydrodynamics within the framework of the effective field theory of dissipative fluids in a Minkowski background. The most general quadratic action for collective excitations around hydrodynamic solutions -- specifically, the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) modes associated with the symmetry-breaking pattern induced by external fields -- is derived. It is found that the hydrodynamical frame invariants write the first-order dispersion relations in the low energy limit. In thermodynamical viscous fluids realized by integrating out fast modes, unitarity and local KMS symmetry for its underlying UV theory are guaranteed. Then, we find that first-order hydrodynamics are stable if the null energy condition is satisfied. As the NG modes nonlinearly realize the diffeomorphism symmetries, our mode analysis is valid in any coordinate systems, including Lorentz-transformed references. We also comment on the causal structure for the diffusive modes based on the retarded Green functions for the stochastic NG mode.</description>

      <title>A generalized picture of colour decoherence in dense QCD media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the calculation of the soft gluon emission probability off a colour-singlet $q\bar q$ system that evolves in a quark-gluon plasma. The $q\bar q$ antenna is created in the presence of a medium and then emits a soft gluon outside. The gluon emission probability is modified with respect to the vacuum baseline due to interactions with the medium during the formation of the antenna and its propagation. Previous studies disregarded the former effect and found that the medium modification to the interference pattern of the antenna was controlled by the so-called critical angle $\theta_c$, that exclusively depends on medium properties. We find that accounting for medium interactions during the antenna formation enhances the total rate of emissions off the $q\bar q$ antenna. Interestingly, it also promotes the notion of a critical angle to a dynamic quantity, denoted $\tilde\theta_c$, that depends on both the medium and the antenna properties and is thus different for every splitting. As a consequence, depending on the region of parameter space, colour decoherence can either be delayed or accelerated with respect to previous estimates.</description>

      <title>Constraining the p{\Lambda} interaction from a combined analysis of scattering data and correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work provides the first combined analysis of low-energy p$\Lambda$ scattering, considering both cross section and correlation data. The obtained results establish the most stringent constraints to date on the two-body p$\Lambda$ interaction, pointing to a weaker attraction than so far accepted. The best set of scattering lengths for the spin singlet and triplet are found to range from $f_0, f_1 = (2.1, 1.56)$ to $(3.34, 1.18)~$fm. With a chiral NY potential fine-tuned to those scattering parameters, the in-medium properties of the $\Lambda$ are explored and a potential depth of $U_\Lambda= -36.3\pm 1.3 \mathrm{(stat)}^{+2.5}_{-6.2}\mathrm{(syst)}$ MeV is found at nuclear matter saturation density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13042v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present a novel analytic framework for $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory in the four-dimensional continuum. Background and effective field theory techniques are used to include non-perturbative contributions from cubic and quartic interactions. This approach is inspired by Savvidy who claims first-order contributions from quartic interactions stabilize IR divergence found at one-loop order, making possible IR finite Yang-Mills calculations. I assess the validity of this claim and discuss the implications of my findings.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium Semiclassical Transport in Quark-Gluon Plasma: Factorization and Quantum Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.02408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.02408v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quarkonium transport in the quark-gluon plasma by using the potential nonrelativistic QCD (pNRQCD) effective field theory and the framework of open quantum systems. We argue that the coupling between quarkonium and the thermal bath is weak using separation of scales, so the initial density matrix of the total system factorizes and the time evolution of the subsystem is Markovian. We derive the semiclassical Boltzmann equation for quarkonium by applying a Wigner transform to the Lindblad equation and carrying out a semiclassical expansion. We resum relevant interactions to all orders in the coupling constant at leading power of the nonrelativistic and multipole expansions. The derivation is valid for both weakly coupled and strongly coupled quark-gluon plasmas. We find reaction rates in the transport equation factorize into a quarkonium dipole transition function and a chromoelectric gluon distribution function. For the differential reaction rate, the definition of the momentum dependent chromoelectric gluon distribution function involves staple-shaped Wilson lines. For the inclusive reaction rate, the Wilson lines collapse into a straight line along the real time axis and the distribution becomes momentum independent. The relation between the two Wilson lines is analogous to the relation between the Wilson lines appearing in the gluon parton distribution function (PDF) and the gluon transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF). The centrality dependence of the quarkonium nuclear modification factor measured by experiments probes the momentum independent distribution while the transverse momentum dependence and measurements of the azimuthal angular anisotropy may be able to probe the momentum dependent one. We discuss one way to indirectly constrain the quarkonium in-medium real potential by using the factorization formula and lattice calculations. The leading quantum correction to the semiclassical transport equation of quarkonium is also worked out. The study can be easily generalized to quarkonium transport in cold nuclear matter, which is relevant for quarkonium production in eA collisions in the future Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider resurgence for the nonconformal Bjorken flow with Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein statistics on the extended relaxation-time approximation. We firstly consider full formal transseries expanded around the equilibrium and then construct the resurgent relation by looking to the structure of Borel transformed ODEs. We form a conjecture of the resurgent relation based on the considerations that Stokes constants constituting of the resurgent relation originate only from singularities of dissipative variables on the Borel plane and that the other variables such as temperature and chemical potential become Borel nonsummable through nonlinear terms with the dissipative variables. We numerically check the conjecture for fundamental variables by explicitly evaluating values of the dominant Stokes constant depending on initial conditions and a particle mass. We also make comments on some issues related to transseries structure and resurgence such as the case of broken $U(1)$ symmetry, the massless case, generalized relaxation-time, and attractor solution.</description>

      <title>Two-detector flavor sensitivity to ultra-high-energy cosmic neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic neutrinos, with energies above 100 PeV, could be finally discovered in the near future. Measuring their flavor composition would reveal information about their production and propagation, but new techniques are needed for UHE neutrino telescopes to have the capabilities to do it. We address this by proposing a new way to measure the UHE neutrino flavor composition that does not rely on individual telescopes having flavor-identification capabilities. We manufacture flavor sensitivity from the joint detection by one telescope sensitive to all flavors -- the radio array of IceCube-Gen2 -- and one mostly sensitive to $\nu_\tau$ -- GRAND. From this limited flavor sensitivity, predominantly to $\nu_\tau$, and even under conservative choices of neutrino flux and detector size, we extract important insight. For astrophysics, we forecast meaningful constraints on the neutrino production mechanism; for fundamental physics, vastly improved constraints on Lorentz-invariance violation. These are the first measurement forecasts of the UHE $\nu_\tau$ content.</description>

      <title>Unleashing the Power of EFT in Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutrino physics is advancing into a precision era with the construction of new experiments, particularly in the few GeV energy range. Within this energy range, neutrinos exhibit diverse interactions with nucleons and nuclei. This study delves in particular into neutrino--nucleus quasi-elastic cross sections, taking into account both standard and, for the first time, non-standard interactions, all within the framework of effective field theory (EFT). The main uncertainties in these cross sections stem from uncertainties in the nucleon-level form factors, and from the approximations necessary to solve the nuclear many-body problem. We explore how these uncertainties influence the potential of neutrino experiments to probe new physics introduced by left-handed, right-handed, scalar, pseudoscalar, and tensor interactions. For some of these interactions the cross section is enhanced, making long-baseline experiments an excellent place to search for them. Our results, including tabulated cross sections for all interaction types and all neutrino flavors, can serve as the foundation for such searches.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium Polarization in Medium from Open Quantum Systems and Chromomagnetic Correlators</title>

Abstract: We study the spin-dependent in-medium dynamics of quarkonia by using the potential nonrelativistic QCD (pNRQCD) and the open quantum system framework. We consider the pNRQCD Lagrangian valid up to the order $\frac{r}{M^0}=r$ and $\frac{r^0}{M}=\frac{1}{M}$ in the double power counting. By considering the Markovian condition and applying the Wigner transformation upon the diagonal spin components of the quarkonium density matrix with the semiclassical expansion, we systematically derive the Boltzmann transport equation for quarkonia with polarization dependence in the quantum optical limit. Unlike the spin-independent collision terms governed by certain chromoelectric field correlators, new gauge invariant correlators of chromomagnetic fields determine the recombination and dissociation terms with polarization dependence at the order we are working. We also derive a Lindblad equation describing the in-medium transitions between spin-singlet and spin-triplet heavy quark-antiquark pairs in the quantum Brownian motion limit. The Lindblad equation is governed by new transport coefficients defined in terms of the chromomagnetic field correlators. Our formalism is generic and valid for both weakly coupled and strongly coupled quark gluon plasmas. It can be further applied to study spin alignment of vector quarkonia in heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Event-Shape Methods in Search for the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Relativistic Heavy Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is a phenomenon in which electric charge is separated by a strong magnetic field from local domains of chirality imbalance and parity violation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The CME-sensitive observable, charge-dependent three-point azimuthal correlator $\Delta\gamma$, is contaminated by a major physics background proportional to the particle's elliptic anisotropy $v_2$. Event-shape engineering (ESE) binning events in dynamical fluctuations of $v_2$ and event-shape selection (ESS) binning events in statistical fluctuations of $v_2$ are two methods to search for the CME by projecting $\Delta\gamma$ to the $v_2=0$ intercept. We conduct a systematic study of these two methods using physics models as well as toy model simulations. It is observed that the ESE method requires significantly more statistics than the ESS method to achieve the same statistical precision of the intercept. It is found that the intercept from the ESS method depends on the details of the event content, such as the mixtures of background contributing sources, and thus is not a clean measure of the CME.</description>
