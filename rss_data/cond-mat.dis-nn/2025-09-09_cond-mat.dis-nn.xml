      <title>Unifying Anderson transitions and topological amplification in non-Hermitian chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems with non-reciprocal hopping may display the non-Hermitian skin effect, where states under open boundary conditions localize exponentially at one edge of the system. This localization has been linked to spectral winding and topological gain, forming a bulk-boundary correspondence akin to the one relating edge modes to bulk topological invariants in topological insulators and superconductors. In this work, we establish a bulk-boundary correspondence for disordered Hatano-Nelson models. We relate the localization of states to spectral winding using the Lyapunov exponent and the Thouless formula. We identify two kinds of phase transitions and relate them to transport properties. Our framework is relevant to a broad class of 1D non-Hermitian models, opening new directions for disorder-resilient transport and quantum-enhanced sensing in photonic, optomechanical, and superconducting platforms.</description>

      <title>Theory of Localized States in Quasiperiodic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of localized states in quasiperiodic lattices has been extensively studied for decades, but still lacks an comprehensive theoretical framework. Recently, we developed a incommensurate energy band (IEB) theory, which extends the concept of energy bands to quasiperiodic systems lacking translational symmetry, thereby achieving a breakthrough in elucidating extended states. Here, we demonstrate that, due to the inherent duality between momentum and real space, the IEB theory also offers a comprehensive framework for elucidating localized states. Specifically, via a so-called spiral (module) mapping, the energy spectrum of localized states can be represented as a function defined on a compact circular manifold-akin to the Brillouin zone-whose form resembles conventional energy bands. These localized state energy bands (LSEBs) fully characterize all the properties of the localized states. Moreover, we show that quasiperiodic systems with mobility edges exhibit a unique hybrid band structure: the IEB for extended states (momentum space) and LSEB for localized states (real space), separated by mobility edges. Our theory thus establishes a comprehensive framework for analyzing the localized states in quasiperiodic lattices.</description>

      <title>Driven dynamics of localization phase transition in the Aubry-Andr\'{e} model with initial gapless extended states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the driven dynamics of localization phase transitions have garnered growing interest. However, studies so far have mainly considered initial localized states, whose driven dynamics follow the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). In this study, we investigate the driven dynamics of the localization phase transition in the Aubry-Andr\'e (AA) model starting from a gapless extended state, which violates the adiabatic-impulse scenario of KZM. By linearly driving the quasiperiodic potential strength across the critical point, we numerically simulate the driven dynamics and analyze the scaling behavior of both the inverse participation ratio ($\mathcal{I}$) and the dynamic deviation from the instantaneous ground state energy $(\mathcal{D})$. We demonstrate that the driven dynamics starting from initially extended states satisfies the criterion for the applicability of KZM and its extension, finite-time scaling (FTS). The scaling functions governing the driven dynamics of both $\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathcal{D}$ have been derived based on FTS and numerically validated. We found that the scaling functions exhibit significant differences at large $R$ and small $R$, and also differ considerably from the scaling functions when the initial state is localized, highlighting the crucial role of initial state behavior. The established scaling laws remain robust across a wide range of system sizes and driving rates, providing testable predictions for experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Yet another exponential Hopfield model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a new variation of the so-called {\em exponential Hopfield model}, a recently introduced family of associative neural networks with unprecedented storage capacity. Our construction is based on a cost function defined through exponentials of standard quadratic loss functions, which naturally favors configurations corresponding to perfect recall. Despite not being a mean-field system, the model admits a tractable mathematical analysis of its dynamics and retrieval properties that agree with those for the original exponential model introduced by Ramsauer and coworkers. By means of a signal-to-noise approach, we demonstrate that stored patterns remain stable fixed points of the zero-temperature dynamics up to an exponentially large number of patterns in the system size. We further quantify the basins of attraction of the retrieved memories, showing that while enlarging their radius reduces the overall load, the storage capacity nonetheless retains its exponential scaling. An independent derivation within the perfect recall regime confirms these results and provides an estimate of the relevant prefactors. Our findings thus complement and extend previous studies on exponential Hopfield networks, establishing that even under robustness constraints these models preserve their exceptional storage capabilities. Beyond their theoretical interest, such networks point towards principled mechanisms for massively scalable associative memory, with potential implications for both neuroscience-inspired computation and high-capacity machine learning architectures.</description>

      <title>A topological approach to the Cahn-Hilliard equation and hyperuniform fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniform structures are disordered, correlated systems in which density fluctuations are suppressed at large scales. Such a property generalizes the concept of order in patterns and is relevant across diverse physical systems. We present a numerical characterization of hyperuniform scalar fields that leverages persistent homology. Topological features across different lengths are represented in persistence diagrams, while similarities or differences between patterns are quantified through Wasserstein distances between these diagrams. We apply this framework to numerical solutions of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, a canonical model for generating hyperuniform scalar fields. We validate the approach against known features of the Cahn-Hilliard equation, including its scaling properties, convergence to the sharp interface limit, and self-similarity of the solutions. We then generalize the approach by studying Gaussian random fields exhibiting different degrees and classes of hyperuniformity, showing how the proposed approach can be exploited to reconstruct global properties from local topological information. Overall, we show how hyperuniform characteristics systematically correlate with distributions of topological features in disordered correlated fields. We expect this analysis to be applicable to a wide range of scalar fields, particularly those involving interfaces and free boundaries.</description>

      <title>Ground state energies of multipartite $p$-spin models -- partially lifted RDT view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider ground state energies (GSE) of multipartite $p$-spin models. Relying on partially lifted random duality theory (pl RDT) concepts we introduce an analytical mechanism that produces easy to compute lower and upper GSE bounds for \emph{any} spin sets. We uncover that these bounds actually match in case of fully spherical sets thereby providing optimal GSE values for spherical multipartite pure $p$-spin models. Numerical evidence further suggests that our upper and lower bounds may match even in the Ising scenarios. As such developments are rather intriguing, we formulate several questions regarding the connection between our bounds matching generality on the one side and the spin sets structures on the other.</description>

      <title>Persistent Charge and Spin Currents in a Ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate persistent charge and spin currents in a ferromagnetic Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping, where non-reciprocal hopping generates a synthetic magnetic flux and drives a non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. The system supports both real and imaginary persistent currents, with ferromagnetic spin splitting enabling all three spin-current components, dictated by the orientation of magnetic moments. The currents are computed using the current operator method within a biorthogonal basis. In parallel, the complex band structure is analyzed to uncover the spectral characteristics. We emphasize how the currents evolve across different topological regimes, and how they are influenced by chemical potential, ferromagnetic ordering, finite size, and disorder. Strikingly, disorder can even amplify spin currents, opening powerful new routes for manipulating spin transport in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Thermal Fluctuation Driven Structural Relaxation in Undeformed Glasses: Unraveling the Evolution of Mechanical Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glasses are mechanically rigid, still undergo structural relaxation which changes their properties and affects potential technological applications. Understanding the underlying physical processes is a problem of broad theoretical and practical interest. We investigate intermittent structural relaxation events or ``avalanches'' occurring inside glassy regime. Contrary to the more well-known avalanches due to shear, here they are induced by thermal fluctuations in undeformed glass. By analyzing changes in structural, mechanical, dynamical, topological and vibrational properties of the system, we provide a multi-faceted characterization of avalanches. Overall we find that the system softens due to avalanches. Further, we develop a formalism to extract local measures of non-Affine displacement and tensorial strain for thermal amorphous solids in absence of any external deformation. Our analysis highlights a key difference between two types of driving: while the shear deformation response is dominated by volume preserving deviatoric strain, changes in local density must be considered to model response of undeformed glass under thermal noise. The observations suggest the idea of Generalized Strain Transformation Zones (GSTZ), where coupled shear and volume-changing deformations govern thermally-mediated plasticity. Our work paves the way for a unified description of elasto-plastic response of (athermal) mechanically deformed and thermally driven undeformed glasses.</description>

      <title>Dissipation-Enhanced Localization in a Disorder-Free $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model, as the simplest realization of a lattice gauge theory, exhibits rich and unconventional physics. One of its most remarkable features is disorder-free localization, where localization emerges not from explicit quenched disorder but from static background $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges, leading to persistent memory of the initial state. In this work, we investigate the dissipative dynamics of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge model by coupling it to a Markovian environment. We find that quantum dissipation can enhance localization: memory of the initial state is retained more robustly under dissipative evolution than under unitary dynamics. This dissipation-induced enhancement of localization persists across a variety of initial states, indicating that the effect is not limited to fine-tuned configurations. Our results demonstrate that dissipation, often associated with decoherence and thermalization, can in fact serve as a powerful tool for stabilizing non-ergodic behavior in gauge-constrained quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale photonic neuron with biological signal processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational hardware designed to mimic biological neural networks holds the promise to resolve the drastically growing global energy demand of artificial intelligence. A wide variety of hardware concepts have been proposed, and among these, photonic approaches offer immense strengths in terms of power efficiency, speed and synaptic connectivity. However, existing solutions have large circuit footprints limiting scaling potential and they miss key biological functions, like inhibition. We demonstrate an artificial nano-optoelectronic neuron with a circuit footprint size reduced by at least a factor of 100 compared to existing technologies and operating powers in the picowatt regime. The neuron can deterministically receive both exciting and inhibiting signals that can be summed and treated with a non-linear function. It demonstrates several biological relevant responses and memory timescales, as well as weighting of input channels. The neuron is compatible with commercial silicon technology, operates at multiple wavelengths and can be used for both computing and optical sensing. This work paves the way for two important research paths: photonic neuromorphic computing with nanosized footprints and low power consumption, and adaptive optical sensing, using the same architecture as a compact, modular front end</description>

      <title>Ultrafast electronic coherence from slow phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light offers a route to engineer new phases of matter far from equilibrium, including transient states suggestive of superconducting, charge-ordered, and excitonic ordering behavior. Yet it remains unclear how optical excitation can dynamically produce long-range phase coherence-a defining feature of true order such as superconductivity-rather than merely enhancing local pairing. Here we show that impulsively driven low-frequency phonons enhance long-range electronic correlations in a low-dimensional metal. Through numerically exact simulations, we demonstrate that slow phonons suppress dynamical disorder, enabling buildup of coherence and enhancement of charge (and pairing) orders. These findings provide direct evidence that light can mediate enhancement of long-range order and suggest that future experimental strategies-such as the design of selective excitations of narrow phonon distributions to limit dephasing-may offer viable routes to design and stabilize transient superconducting states.</description>

      <title>Universal activated aging and weak ergodicity breaking in spin and structural glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00338v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glasses possess complex energy landscapes and exhibit non-equilibrium aging dynamics. Here, we propose a generalized trap model for activated aging based on a key static property of the energy landscape: the distribution of energy barriers. Our theory predicts that, upon cooling, weak ergodicity breaking (WEB) in quenching dynamics occurs prior to strong ergodicity breaking in equilibrium dynamics. Furthermore, the theory indicates that the characteristic size of activation clusters can be deduced from the logarithmic decay of the time-correlation function. We rigorously test the model's assumptions and predictions using the simplest spin glass model - the random energy model. The predicted aging behavior is also universally observed in paradigmatic structural glasses, including the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA) model and amorphous silica. Remarkably, applying our framework to the WCA model allows us to extract a static length from the non equilibrium dynamics, extending its observable growth range from a mere factor of 2-3 to a full order of magnitude and providing supportive evidence for the random first-order transition scenario. Finally, we propose a unified ergodic-WEB phase diagram for aging dynamics in general glassy systems.</description>

      <title>Compensation between the parameters of the Jonschers's Universal Relaxation Law in disordered materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18515v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experimental results for a huge number of different materials published during the past fifty years confirm the validity of the Jonscher's Universal Dielectric Response Law. Accordingly,the ac conductivity is a fractional power of frequency. Otemperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, spectra recorded at different temperatures evidence for a proportionality between the logarithm of the pre-exponential factor to the fractional exponent, as well. The dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac conductivity are three state variables, which describe the electric and dielectric properties. These constitute a unique relation by merging the Dielectric Response Law and the Ghosh - Pan Scaling Rule, respectively. A partial differentiation chain theorem combined with the temperature dependencies of the dc conductivity, pre-exponential factor and fractional exponent of the ac response, establishes a compensation rule between the parameters of the Universal Dielectric Response Law. The compatibility of the present theorynwth published experimental data is discussed.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic expansion for the mutual-information rate in the realm of limited statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neurons in sensory systems encode stimulus information into their stochastic spiking response. The mutual information has been extensively applied to these systems to quantify the neurons' capacity of transmitting such information. Yet, while for discrete stimuli, like flashed images or single tones, its computation is straightforward, for dynamical stimuli it is necessary to compute a (mutual) information rate (MIR), therefore integrating over the multiple temporal correlations which characterize sensory systems. Previous methods are based on extensive sampling of the neuronal response, require large amounts of data and are therefore prone to biases and inaccuracy. Here, we develop Moba-MIRA (moment-based mutual-information-rate approximation), a computational method to estimate the mutual information rate. To derive Moba-MIRA, we use Feynman diagrams to expand the mutual information to arbitrary order in the correlations around the corresponding value for the empirical spike count distributions of single bins. As a result, only the empirical estimation of the pairwise correlations between time bins and the single-bin entropies are required, without the need for the whole joint probability distributions. We tested Moba-MIRA on synthetic data generated with generalized linear models, and showed that it requires only a few tens of stimulus repetitions to provide an accurate estimate of the information rate. Finally, we applied it to ex-vivo electrophysiological recordings of rats retina, obtaining rates ranging between 5 to 20 bits per second, consistent with earlier estimates.</description>

Abstract: Collectives are often able to process information in a distributed fashion, surpassing each individual member's processing capacity. In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual spider monkey core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. Sets of individuals with complementary overlaps are identified, showing a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions, and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Extended Yard Sale model of wealth distribution on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random networks</title>

Abstract: Excessive wealth concentration can undermine economic and social development. Random Asset Exchange (RAE) models provide valuable tools to investigate this phenomenon. Assuming that economic systems may operate optimally near the critical point of a continuous phase transition, the Extended Yard Sale (EYS) model introduced by Boghosian et al.~[Physica A 476, 15 (2017)] offers a compelling framework. This model captures the interplay between wealth redistribution and accumulation, exhibiting a continuous phase transition marked by a broad wealth distribution at criticality, separating a condensed phase -- where a microscopic fraction of agents holds a macroscopic share of total wealth -- from a distributed phase with a light-tailed wealth distribution. While the original EYS model assumes fully connected interactions, this work introduces and studies a networked variant where agents interact over Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random networks. The analysis combines Monte Carlo simulations with Quenched Mean Field and Mean Field approximations, exploring a variety of interaction and taxation schemes. A scaling analysis shows that, although the networked model also undergoes a continuous phase transition, it leads to local wealth condensation rather than the global condensation found in the fully connected case. These results deepen our understanding of wealth dynamics in structured populations and may help inform the development of more effective economic and social policies.</description>
