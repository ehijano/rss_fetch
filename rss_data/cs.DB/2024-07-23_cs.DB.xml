      <title>Escalation of Commitment: A Case Study of the United States Census Bureau Efforts to Implement Differential Privacy for the 2020 Decennial Census</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2017, the United States Census Bureau announced that because of high disclosure risk in the methodology (data swapping) used to produce tabular data for the 2010 census, a different protection mechanism based on differential privacy would be used for the 2020 census. While there have been many studies evaluating the result of this change, there has been no rigorous examination of disclosure risk claims resulting from the released 2010 tabular data. In this study we perform such an evaluation. We show that the procedures used to evaluate disclosure risk are unreliable and resulted in inflated disclosure risk. Demonstration data products released using the new procedure were also shown to have poor utility. However, since the Census Bureau had already committed to a different procedure, they had no option except to escalate their commitment. The result of such escalation is that the 2020 tabular data release offers neither privacy nor accuracy.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Subgraph Matching via Cost-Model-based Vertex Dominance Embeddings (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many real-world applications such as social network analysis, knowledge graph discovery, biological network analytics, and so on, graph data management has become increasingly important and has drawn much attention from the database community. While many graphs (e.g., Twitter, Wikipedia, etc.) are usually involving over time, it is of great importance to study the dynamic subgraph matching (DSM) problem, a fundamental yet challenging graph operator, which continuously monitors subgraph matching results over dynamic graphs with a stream of edge updates. To efficiently tackle the DSM problem, we carefully design a novel vertex dominance embedding approach, which effectively encodes vertex labels that can be incrementally maintained upon graph updates. Inspire by low pruning power for high-degree vertices, we propose a new degree grouping technique over basic subgraph patterns in different degree groups (i.e., groups of star substructures), and devise degree-aware star substructure synopses (DAS^3) to effectively facilitate our designed vertex dominance and range pruning strategies. We develop efficient algorithms to incrementally maintain dynamic graphs and answer DSM queries. Through extensive experiments, we confirm the efficiency of our proposed approaches over both real and synthetic graphs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Temporal Understanding in LLMs for Semi-structured Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal reasoning over tabular data presents substantial challenges for large language models (LLMs), as evidenced by recent research. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of temporal datasets to pinpoint the specific limitations of LLMs. Our investigation leads to enhancements in TempTabQA, a dataset specifically designed for tabular temporal question answering. We provide critical insights for improving LLM performance in temporal reasoning tasks with tabular data. Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach, C.L.E.A.R to strengthen LLM capabilities in this domain. Our findings demonstrate that our method significantly improves evidence-based reasoning across various models. Additionally, our experimental results reveal that indirect supervision with auxiliary data substantially boosts model performance in these tasks. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of LLMs' temporal reasoning abilities over tabular data and promotes advancements in their application across diverse fields.</description>
