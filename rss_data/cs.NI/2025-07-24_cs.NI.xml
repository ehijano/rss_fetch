      <title>Frame-Based Zero-Shot Semantic Channel Equalization for AI-Native Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In future AI-native wireless networks, the presence of mismatches between the latent spaces of independently designed and trained deep neural network (DNN) encoders may impede mutual understanding due to the emergence of semantic channel noise. This undermines the receiver's ability to interpret transmitted representations, thereby reducing overall system performance. To address this issue, we propose the Parseval Frame Equalizer (PFE), a zero-shot, frame-based semantic channel equalizer that aligns latent spaces of heterogeneous encoders without requiring system retraining. PFE enables dynamic signal compression and expansion, mitigating semantic noise while preserving performance on downstream tasks. Building on this capability, we introduce a dynamic optimization strategy that coordinates communication, computation, and learning resources to balance energy consumption, end-to-end (E2E) latency, and task performance in multi-agent semantic communication scenarios. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of our approach in maintaining semantic consistency and meeting long-term constraints on latency and accuracy under diverse and time-varying network conditions.</description>

      <title>ARCADE: A RAN Diagnosis Methodology in a Hybrid AI Environment for 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) plays a key role in developing 6G networks. While current specifications already include Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF) as a network element responsible for providing information about the core, a more comprehensive approach will be needed to enable automation of network segments that are not yet fully explored in the context of 5G. In this paper, we present Automated Radio Coverage Anomalies Detection and Evaluation (ARCADE), a methodology for identifying and diagnosing anomalies in the cellular access network. Furthermore, we demonstrate how a hybrid architecture of network analytics functions in the evolution toward 6G can enhance the application of AI in a broader network context, using ARCADE as a practical example of this approach.</description>

      <title>Talk with the Things: Integrating LLMs into IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Internet of Things (IoT) networks open new opportunities for building intelligent, responsive, and user-friendly systems. This work presents an edge-centric framework that integrates LLMs into IoT architectures to enable natural language-based control, context-aware decision-making, and enhanced automation. The proposed modular and lightweight Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based LLMs are deployed on edge computing devices connected to IoT gateways, enabling local processing of user commands and sensor data for reduced latency, improved privacy, and enhanced inference quality. We validate the framework through a smart home prototype using LLaMA 3 and Gemma 2B models for controlling smart devices. Experimental results highlight the trade-offs between model accuracy and inference time with respect to models size. At last, we also discuss the potential applications that can use LLM-based IoT systems, and a few key challenges associated with such systems.</description>

      <title>Enabling Scalability in Asynchronous and Bidirectional Communication in LPWAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LPWANs have become ubiquitous due to their ability to connect sensors over large geographic areas in a single hop. It is, however, very challenging to achieve massive scalability in LPWANs, where numerous sensors can transmit data efficiently and with low latency, which emerging IoT and CPS applications may require. In this paper, we address the above challenges by significantly advancing an LPWAN technology called SNOW. SNOW exploits distributed orthogonal frequency division multiplexing, D-OFDM, subcarriers to enable parallel reception of data to a BS from multiple asynchronous sensors, each using a different subcarrier. In this paper, we achieve massive scalability in SNOW by enabling the BS to decode concurrent data from numerous asynchronous sensors on the same subcarrier while parallelly decoding from other subcarriers as well. Additionally, we enable numerous asynchronous sensors to receive distinct data from the BS on the same subcarrier while other sensors also receive data parallelly on other subcarriers. To do this, we develop a set of Gold code-based pseudorandom noise or PN sequences that are mutually non-interfering within and across the subcarriers. Each sensor uses its PN sequence from the set for encoding or decoding data on its subcarriers, enabling massive concurrency. Our evaluation results demonstrate that we can achieve approximately 9x more scalability in SNOW while being timely in data collection at the BS and energy efficient at the sensors. This may enable emerging IoT and CPS applications requiring tens of thousands of sensors with longer battery life and making data-driven, time-sensitive decisions.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Velocity-Adaptive Scheme: Joint Fair Access and Age of Information Optimization in Vehicular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the fair access problem and the Age of Information (AoI) under 5G New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Mode 2 in vehicular networks. Specifically, vehicles follow Mode 2 to communicate with Roadside Units (RSUs) to obtain accurate data for driving assistance.Nevertheless, vehicles often have different velocity when they are moving in adjacent lanes, leading to difference in RSU dwelltime and communication duration. This results in unfair access to network resources, potentially influencing driving safety. To ensure the freshness of received data, the AoI should be analyzed. Mode 2 introduces a novel preemption mechanism, necessitating simultaneous optimization of fair access and AoI to guarantee timely and relevant data delivery. We propose a joint optimization framework for vehicular network, defining a fairness index and employing Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS) to model AoI under preemption mechanism. By adaptively adjusting the selection window of Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) in Mode 2, we address the optimization of fairness and AoI. We apply a large language model (LLM)-Based Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decomposition (MOEA/D) to solve this problem. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme in balancing fair access and minimizing AoI.</description>

      <title>Improving Wi-Fi 8 Latency with Coordinated Spatial Reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IEEE 802.11 networks continuously adapt to meet the stringent requirements of emerging applications like cloud gaming, eXtended Reality (XR), and video streaming services, which require high throughput, low latency, and high reliability. To address these challenges, Coordinated Spatial Reuse (Co-SR) can potentially contribute to optimizing spectrum resource utilization. This mechanism is expected to enable simultaneous transmissions, thereby boosting spectral efficiency in dense environments and increasing the overall network performance. In this paper, we shed light on the performance of Co-SR for Wi-Fi 8 networks. For that, we propose an implementation of Co-SR aligned with ongoing Wi-Fi 8 standardization efforts. The evaluation is done on a Wi-Fi simulator, which allows us to study the performance of the proposed Co-SR mechanisms in relevant scenarios. The results obtained in a Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) consisting of four APs show delay reduction with Co-SR ranging from 31% to 95% when compared to Distributed Coordination Function (DCF).</description>

      <title>On the Role of Age and Semantics of Information in Remote Estimation of Markov Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the semantics-aware remote estimation of a finite-state Markov chain. We employ the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator and aim to devise a transmission policy to optimize estimation performance subject to a transmission frequency constraint. We leverage two metrics, namely the Age of Consecutive Error (AoCE) and the Age of Information (AoI), to quantify, respectively, the significance of estimation error at the transmitter and the predictability of outdated information at the receiver. The optimal transmission problem is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) with unbounded costs. We show the existence of an optimal simple mixture policy, which randomly selects between two deterministic switching policies with a fixed probability. Notably, each switching policy triggers a transmission only when the AoCE exceeds a threshold value that depends on both the AoI and the instantaneous estimation error. We further derive sufficient conditions under which the switching policy reduces to a simple threshold policy; that is, it admits identical thresholds for all estimation errors. Leveraging these results, we develop an efficient structure-aware algorithm, Insec-SPI, that computes the optimal policy with reduced computation overhead. Our results demonstrate that incorporating both AoI and AoCE yields significantly improved estimation quality compared to using either metric alone.</description>

      <title>IEEE 802.11be Wi-Fi 7: Feature Summary and Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As emerging applications demand increasingly higher throughput, IEEE standard 802.11be -- Extremely High Throughput (EHT), also known as Wi-Fi 7, was published on July 22, 2025. It can be used to meet the demand for the throughput of 4K/8K videos up to tens of Gbps and low-latency video applications such as virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). Wi-Fi 7 not only scales Wi-Fi 6 with doubled bandwidth, but also supports real-time applications, which brings revolutionary changes to Wi-Fi. In this article, we start by introducing the main objectives and timeline of Wi-Fi 7 and then list the latest key techniques which promote the performance improvement of Wi-Fi 7. Finally, we validate the most critical objectives of Wi-Fi 7 -- the potential up to 30 Gbps throughput and lower latency. System-level simulation results suggest that by combining the new techniques, Wi-Fi 7 achieves 30 Gbps throughput and lower latency than Wi-Fi 6.</description>

      <title>UAV Communications: Impact of Obstacles on Channel Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17934v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have been utilized as effective platforms for carrying Wi-Fi Access Points (APs) and cellular Base Stations (BSs), enabling low-cost, agile, and flexible wireless networks with high Quality of Service (QoS). The next generation of wireless communications will rely on increasingly higher frequencies, which are easily obstructed by obstacles. One of the most critical concepts yet to be fully addressed is positioning the UAV at optimal coordinates while accounting for obstacles. To ensure a line of sight (LoS) between UAVs and user equipment (UE), improve QoS, and establish reliable wireless links with maximum coverage, obstacles must be integrated into the proposed placement algorithms. This paper introduces a simulation-based measurement approach for characterizing an air-to-ground (AG) channel in a simple scenario. By considering obstacles, we present a novel perspective on channel characterization. The results, in terms of throughput, packet delivery, packet loss, and delay, are compared using the proposed positioning approach.</description>

      <title>Latent Space Alignment for AI-Native MIMO Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communications focus on prioritizing the understanding of the meaning behind transmitted data and ensuring the successful completion of tasks that motivate the exchange of information. However, when devices rely on different languages, logic, or internal representations, semantic mismatches may occur, potentially hindering mutual understanding. This paper introduces a novel approach to addressing latent space misalignment in semantic communications, exploiting multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. Specifically, our method learns a MIMO precoder/decoder pair that jointly performs latent space compression and semantic channel equalization, mitigating both semantic mismatches and physical channel impairments. We explore two solutions: (i) a linear model, optimized by solving a biconvex optimization problem via the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM); (ii) a neural network-based model, which learns semantic MIMO precoder/decoder under transmission power budget and complexity constraints. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in a goal-oriented semantic communication scenario, illustrating the main trade-offs between accuracy, communication burden, and complexity of the solutions.</description>
