      <title>Shallow Angle Inverse Compton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse Compton Scattering at shallow angles can be used to tune the spectrum and increase the brightness of the emitted radiation. Here, we report on the demonstration of emission of visible light by a 4.7 MeV $e$-beam crossing a 780 nm laser at 5.8$^{\rm o}$ angle. Angular and spectral measurements of the radiation are in agreement with analytical and numerical predictions. We observe a characteristic dependence on the incoming polarization, not present in conventional head-on scattering, with suppression of the emission for $p$-polarization at condition equivalent to relativistic Brewster reflection.</description>

      <title>First demonstration of coherent radiation imaging for bunch-by-bunch longitudinal compression monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Longitudinal bunch profile monitoring is a crucial diagnostic requirement in most accelerator facilities. This is particularly true in modern free-electron lasers and novel acceleration schemes, where bunch lengths are often &lt;100 fs and standard instrumentation is invasive or lacks the required resolution. This paper proposes a new monitoring method in this challenging parameter space. Initial proof of principle results for relative compression monitoring via broadband imaging of coherent THz radiation are presented. The technique can utilize more conventional intensity monitoring or novel spatial distribution variation. Both techniques have been demonstrated using both invasive and non-invasive coherent radiation sources. These results pave the way for a future non-invasive longitudinal bunch profile monitor.</description>

      <title>Design of a High-Average-Power Ferroelectric Phase Shifter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes performance of a voltage controlled phase shifter designed for a high average power and a high figure of merit. The device is a reflection-type, resonant phase shifter that utilizes ferroelectric capacitors and impedance matching to the port impedance. With state-of-the-art ferroelectric materials, the device achieves a high Figure of Merit of nearly a thousand degrees phase shift per dB insertion loss at 800 MHz, along with sub-microsecond response. This phase shifter is capable of handling average power up to a megawatt. Its application is expected to enhance the electrical efficiency of particle accelerators, reducing both capital and operating costs.</description>

      <title>Averaged dynamics of ultra-relativisitc charged particles beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.4184</link>
      <description>arXiv:1206.4184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this thesis, we consider the suitability of using the charged cold fluid model in the description of ultra-relativistic beams. The method that we have used is the following. Firstly, the necessary notions of kinetic theory and differential geometry of second order differential equations are explained. Then an averaging procedure is applied to a connection associated with the Lorentz force equation. The result of this averaging is an affine connection on the space-time manifold. The corresponding geodesic equation defines the averaged Lorentz force equation. We prove that for ultra-relativistic beams described by narrow distribution functions, the solutions of both equations are similar. This fact justifies the replacement of the Lorentz force equation by the simpler {\it averaged Lorentz force equation}. After this, for each of these models we associate the corresponding kinetic model, which are based on the Vlasov equation and {\it averaged Vlasov equation} respectively. The averaged Vlasov equation is simpler than the original Vlasov equation. This fact allows us to prove that the differential operation defining the averaged charged cold fluid equation is controlled by the {\it diameter of the distribution function}, by powers of the {\it energy of the beam} and by the time of evolution $t$. We show that the Vlasov equation and the averaged Vlasov equation have similar solutions, when the initial conditions are the same. Finally, as an application of the {\it averaged Lorentz force equation} we re-derive the beam dynamics formalism used in accelerator physics from the Jacobi equation of the averaged Lorentz force equation.</description>
