      <title>Four types of phase transitions in interacting boson (meson) matter at high temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of the interacting system of relativistic particles and antiparticles in the presence of a Bose-Einstein condensate was investigated within the framework of the mean-field model. It is assumed that the total isospin (charge) density is conserved. We show that, depending on the strength of the interaction, a bosonic particle-antiparticle system exhibits four types of phase transitions to the condensate phase. Three types correspond to the second-order phase transition, while one is a first-order phase transition.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theories: from curved space to flat space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to map kinetic theories for spinning particles in curved space to flat space through choice of inertial frame that eliminate forces acting on momentum and spin, thus putting the idea of mimicking off-equilibrium state by metric perturbation to equilibrium state on firm ground. The equivalence has been shown for hydrodynamic and elastic regimes. In the latter case, we predict spin polarization induced by time-variation of strain in elastic matter.</description>

      <title>Nucleon-Quark Diquark-exchange Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note the nucleon-quark diquark-exchange interaction is derived using the Feynman-propagator for axial-vector diquark (D) exchange. The Feynman diquark propagator is derived and the result is a (-)-sign difference w.r.t. quark-antiquark exchange. This is due to the (-)-sign for a closed fermion loop, present in for example vector and axial-vector quark-antiquark exchange, but absent in the case of D-exchange. The calculations in these notes follow closely those for vacuum polarisation in the literature. Taking into account that the diquark D is a color $\left{\bar{3}_c\right\}$-state giving a factor +2. The result is an effective axial-vector diquark propagator. Application to $QN \rightarrow NQ$ gives a repulsive potential, which has been used in mixed nuclear-quark matter calculation.</description>

      <title>Spin polarization from nucleon-nucleon scatterings in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism of generating spin polarization in heavy-ion collisions dominated by nucleon degree of freedom. By incorporating the spin change in nucleon-nucleon scatterings based on the phase shift data together with the constraint of rigorous angular momentum conservation and Pauli blocking, we illustrate through a Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck transport model that appreciable spin polarization (about $1 \sim 2\%$) can be generated in intermediate-energy heavy-ion collisions. This mechanism, together with the nuclear spin-orbit potential, may help to understand the spin polarization in few-GeV heavy-ion collisions dominated by nucleon degree of freedom.</description>

      <title>Exploring hadronic rescattering effects on resonance productions in pp and p-Pb collisions with PYTHIA8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, the quark-gluon plasma is created, and as the medium cools down, the system transitions into a hadronic phase. While such interactions are well established for large systems, such as Pb-Pb collisions, their relevance in smaller collision systems remains unclear. Consequently, hadronic interactions during the hadronic phase are studied in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}=5.02$ TeV with the PYTHIA8 event generator. The interaction is studied via the yield ratios between resonances and stable particles with similar quark contents, which are obtained as a function of transverse momentum ($p_{\rm{T}}$) using $\mathrm{\rho(770)^0}$, $\mathrm{K^*(892)^0}$, and $\mathrm{\phi(1020)}$ mesons and their stable particles, $\mathrm{\pi^\pm}$ and $\mathrm{K^\pm}$ at midrapidity ($|y|&lt;0.5$). Yield ratios are calculated in five multiplicity classes for pp and six for p-Pb collisions, using the 60-100\% multiplicity class in pp as a reference. Although rescattering leads to stronger suppression at low $p_{\rm{T}} &lt; 2$ GeV/$c$, a visible suppression remains even when rescattering is turned off. To isolate the rescattering effect, double ratios between the rescattering on and off configurations are obtained. These are then integrated in the full $p_{\rm{T}}$ range ($0&lt;p_{\rm{T}}&lt;6.0$ GeV/$c$) and in the low-$p_{\rm{T}}$ region ($0&lt;p_{\rm{T}}&lt;0.8$ GeV/$c$), where rescattering effects are most pronounced. The normalized double ratios show a decreasing trend with increasing multiplicity, independent of the collision system. The lower limit of the hadronic phase lifetimes extracted in low-$p_{\rm{T}}$ region increases with multiplicity in both systems, but with a notable discrepancy between pp and p-Pb collisions.</description>

      <title>Impact of magnetic field-driven anisotropies on the equation of state probed in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary neutron star mergers can produce extreme magnetic fields, some of which can lead to strong magnetar-like remnants. While strong magnetic fields have been shown to affect the dynamics of outflows and angular momentum transport in the remnant, they can also crucially alter the properties of nuclear matter probed in the merger. In this work, we provide a first assessment of the latter, determining the strength of the pressure anisotropy caused by Landau level quantization and the anomalous magnetic moment. To this end, we perform the first numerical relativity simulation with a magnetic polarization tensor and a magnetic-field-dependent equation of state using a new algorithm we present here, which also incorporates a mean-field dynamo model to control the magnetic field strength present in the merger remnant. Our results show that -- in the most optimistic case -- corrections to the anisotropy can be in excess of $10\%$, and are potentially largest in the outer layers of the remnant. This work paves the way for a systematic investigation of these effects.</description>

      <title>Universal Effective Charges in the $sd$ and $fp$ Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 247-keV state in $^{54}$Sc, populated in the $\beta$ decay of $^{54}$Ca, is reported here as a nanosecond isomer with a half-life of 26.0(22) ns. The state is interpreted as the $1^+$ member of the $\pi f_{7/2}\otimes\nu f_{5/2}$ spin-coupled multiplet, which decays to the $3^+,\pi f_{7/2} \otimes \nu p_{1/2}$ ground state. The new half-life corresponds to a pure $E2$ transition with a strength of 1.93(16) W.u., providing the most precise, unambiguous $B(E2)$ value in the neutron-rich $fp$ region to date for a nucleus with valence protons above $Z=20$. Notably, it is roughly four times larger than the $B(E2; 1/2^{-} \rightarrow 5/2^{-})$ value in $^{55}$Ca. The results, as compared to semi-empirical and ab initio shell-model calculations, indicate (1) a weak $N=34$ sub-shell gap relative to $N = 32$, (2) a large $E2$ enhancement in Sc as compared to Ca due to $1p-1h$ proton excitations across $Z=28$, and (3) empirical effective proton and neutron charges, $e_\pi$ = 1.30(8)$e$ and $e_\nu$ = 0.452(7)$e$, respectively, that are in contrast to reports of $e_\pi \approx 1.1-1.15e$ and $e_\nu \approx 0.6-0.8e$ for $fp$-shell nuclei near $N = Z$. We demonstrate that these reports are erroneous and that, in fact, a universal set of effective charges can be used across the $sd$ and $fp$ shells.</description>

      <title>The nature of the $P_c$ states from compositeness criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on a coupled-channel approach, we investigate the structures of four $P_c$ states through compositeness criteria. Towards a more precise description of the states, we have obtained refined fit results of the LHCb data on the $J/\psi p$ invariant mass distribution of the $\Lambda_b^0\to J/\psi p K^-$ decay. Allowing for the fact that each of the four $P_c$ states couples strongly to a nearby $S$-wave channel, three criteria on the compositeness/elementariness are adopted in this study: the pole-counting rule, the spectral density function, and the Gamow wave function. Compositeness information is extracted from the scattering amplitudes and the pole parameters (pole positions and residues), without any preconceived assumptions on the nature of the $P_c$ states. Consistently within the framework of all the three methods, it has been found that the $P_c(4312)\,1/2^-$ is mainly composed by $\bar{D}\Sigma_c$, $P_c(4380)\,3/2^-$ by $\bar{D}\Sigma_c^*$, while the $P_c(4440)\,1/2^-$ and $P_c(4457)\,3/2^-$ states are both turn out as composite states of $\bar{D}^*\Sigma_c$. The upper limits of the values of their elementariness are estimated to be rather small. This paper provides an additional confirmation of the molecular interpretation for the $P_c$ states in the literature.</description>

      <title>Eigenstates in coupled-channel scattering amplitude and their effects on spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In general, discrete eigenstates such as resonances are represented by poles of the scattering amplitude, analytically continued to the complex energy plane. In multi-channel scattering, however, the Riemann surface becomes more complicated, leading to the emergence of various types of poles with distinct characteristics. In this study, we investigate the relationship between poles located on different Riemann sheets and analyze how they influence the observable spectra. In particular, we clarify the effect of the decay channel on the pole trajectory, where an $s$-wave bound state evolves into a resonance via a virtual state. It is shown that the quasibound state pole below the threshold does not continuously connected to the resonance pole above the threshold, and a kind of interchange of poles occurs. As a concrete example, we consider several models based on the chiral unitary approach that describe meson-baryon scattering amplitudes involving the $\Xi(1620)$ and $\Xi(1690)$ resonances. We examine their impact on the $\pi\Xi$ invariant mass distributions in the $\Xi_{c} \to \pi\pi\Xi$ decay, discussing how the pole structure manifests itself in experimental observables.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson effects in an interacting hadron gas in the presence of an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The universality of electric charge as a quantum number allows thermoelectric properties to manifest across diverse systems, starting from a hot quantum chromodynamics matter in heavy-ion collisions at a high energy scale to semiconductors in condensed matter systems at a low energy scale. In this work, we explore the emergence of magneto-transport phenomena, specifically the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson effects, in a hot and dense hadronic medium produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider energies. These phenomena arise due to the combined influence of temperature gradients and non-zero baryon chemical potential, particularly in the presence of an external magnetic field. Using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation within the relaxation time approximation, we analyze the behavior of the hadronic medium considering different frameworks of hadron resonance gas models. The presence of external magnetic fields breaks the isotropy of the thermoelectric transport coefficient matrix, giving rise to new components of the Thomson coefficient, namely, magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients. For the first time, we estimate the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients, which originate from the temperature dependence of the magneto-Seebeck coefficient and Nernst coefficient, respectively, in hadron gas under the influence of a magnetic field. Our findings provide a novel perspective on the higher-order thermoelectric properties of the hot and dense hadronic medium in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

Abstract: In the paper, the off-shell electromagnetic pion form factors in the Bethe-Salpeter formalism are considered. The separable kernel of the first rank quark-antiquark interaction is used to solve the equation analytically.The semi-off-shell pion form factors \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \), which are related to each other by the Ward-Takahashi identity, are calculated. The obtained off-shell form factors as well as static properties of the pion are compared with the results of other authors.</description>

      <title>Excited States from ADAPT-VQE convergence path in Many-Body Problems: application to nuclear pairing problem and $H_4$ molecule dissociation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum computing algorithm is proposed to obtain low-lying excited states in many-body interacting systems. The approximate eigenstates are obtained by using a quantum space diagonalization method in a subspace of states selected from the convergence path of the ADAPT-VQE (adaptive derivative-assembled pseudo-Trotter Ansatz variational quantum eigensolver) towards the ground state of the many-body problem. This method is shown to be accurate with only a small overhead in terms of quantum resources required to get the ground state. We also show that the quantum algorithm might be used to facilitate the convergence of the ADAPT-VQE method itself. Successful applications of the technique are made to like-particle pairing as well as neutron-proton pairing. Finally, the $H_4$ molecule's dissociation also illustrates the technique, demonstrating its accuracy and versatility.</description>

      <title>Meson-baryon scattering lengths without annihilation diagrams to order $p^4$ in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the threshold $T$ matrices of the meson and baryon processes that have no annihilation diagrams: $\pi^{+}\Sigma^{+}$, $\pi^{+}\Xi^0$, $K^+p$, $K^+n$, and $\bar{K}^0\Xi^0$ to the fourth order in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. By performing least squares and Bayesian fits to the non-physical lattice QCD data, we determine the low-energy constants through both perturbative and non-perturbative iterative methods. By using these low-energy constants, we obtain the physical scattering lengths in these fits. The values of the scattering lengths tend to be convergent at the fourth order in the perturbative method. The scattering lengths for the five channels, obtained by taking the median values from four different fitting approaches, are $a_{\pi^+\Sigma^+}=-0.16\pm 0.07\,\text{fm}$, $a_{\pi^+\Xi^0}=-0.04\pm0.04\,\text{fm}$, $a_{K^+p}=-0.41\pm 0.11\,\text{fm}$, $a_{K^+n}=-0.19\pm 0.10\,\text{fm}$, and $a_{\bar{K}^0\Xi^0}=-0.30\pm 0.07\,\text{fm}$, where the uncertainties are conservatively estimated by taking the maximum deviation between the median and extreme values of the statistical errors.</description>

      <title>Triple-$\alpha$ reaction rates below $T_9=3$ by a non-adiabatic three-body model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03600v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The triple-$\alpha$ reaction from the ternary continuum states at off-resonant energies, $\alpha+\alpha+\alpha\rightarrow^{12}$C, remains an open question. This direct process is scrutinized using a non-adiabatic Faddeev hyperspherical harmonics $R$-matrix expansion method, and the derived reaction rates are discussed. After reviewing the model, the resultant photo-disintegration of $^{12}$C($2^+_1\rightarrow 0^+$) is shown to be much smaller than the values predicted by the adiabatic models for $0.15 \le E \le 0.35$ MeV. Despite the large difference, the derived reaction rates are illustrated to be concordant with the current evaluated rates for $0.08 \le T_9 \le 3$. The difference below $E=0.20$ MeV can be seen in the rates for $T_9 \le 0.07$. In comparison with the calculations, the rates are found to be reduced by a factor of 10$^{-4}$ at $T_9=0.05$, because of an accurate description for $^8$Be break-up. Uncertainties of the rates are also estimated by examining the sensitivity to the 3$\alpha$ potentials. By introducing three-body $S$-factors and a resonant term, the present rates are expressed in an analytic form, and they are provided in a tabular form for astrophysical applications. To update the evaluated rates, non-resonant sequential process between $\alpha+^8$Be could be removed. The astrophysical impact is not expected to be large, although the rates are reduced around $T_9=0.05$.</description>

      <title>Photon Emission from Nucleon-Nucleon Bremsstrahlung in Fermi-energy Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16865v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emission of direct (hard and thermal) photons from nucleon-nucleon Bremsstrahlung in heavy-ion collisions at Fermi energies is analyzed. We utilize a photon emission rate based on a quantum-field-theoretical model together with nucleon distribution functions extracted from a coarse-graining method of transport model simulations. The latter accounts for off-equilibrium effects during the early stages of nuclear collisions primarily occurring in the beam direction while the transverse-momentum distributions are amenable to a thermal description. With this setup, we quantify the contributions from first-chance nucleon-nucleon collisions and the subsequent transition to a thermal source to the photon energy spectrum measured from Ca-Ca collisions at 35 A$\cdot$MeV bombarding energy. We find that most of the hard photons are produced in the initial stages of heavy-ion collisions from primordial collisions where nucleons move with the initial collective nuclear motion while the emission from the later stages plays a sub-dominant role. We compare our calculations to experimental measurements of a differential photon-energy spectrum from a collision system of similar size and beam energy, thereby including acceptance cuts as applied in the detectors.</description>

      <title>Energy-Energy Correlator for jet production in $pp$ and $pA$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter, we study the collinear limit of the Energy-Energy Correlator (EEC) in single-inclusive jet production in proton-proton ($pp$) and proton-nucleus ($pA$) collisions. We introduce a non-perturbative model that allows us to describe the EEC in the entire angular region of the current experiments. Our results for $pp$ collisions show excellent agreement with CMS and ALICE data over a wide range of jet transverse momenta. For $pA$ collisions, we include modifications from the nuclear medium, and our predictions align well with the trends observed in recent ALICE measurements.</description>

      <title>Chirally motivated $\pi\Sigma$-$\bar{K}N$ model in a finite volume</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the chirally motivated $\pi\Sigma - \bar{K}N$ coupled channels model to the cubic finite volume and use it to calculate the stationary energy spectrum that appears in a nice agreement with the spectrum obtained in the lattice QCD simulations by the BaSc collaboration. Several other comparisons with the BaSc results are made, in particular relating their pole positions of the meson-baryon scattering matrix to the two-pole picture of $\Lambda(1405)$ generated by our chiral model in the infinite volume.</description>

      <title>Gluon mass scale through the Schwinger mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has long been argued that the action of the Schwinger mechanism in the gauge sector of Quantum Chromodynamics leads to the generation of a gluon mass scale. Within this scenario, the analytic structure of the fundamental vertices is modified by the creation of scalar colored excitations with vanishing mass. In the limit of zero momentum transfer, these terms act as massless poles, providing the required conditions for the infrared stabilization of the gluon propagator, and producing a characteristic displacement to the associated Ward identities. In this article we offer an extensive overview of the salient notions and techniques underlying this dynamical picture. We place particular emphasis on recent developments related to the exact renormalization of the mass, the nonlinear nature of the pole equation, and the key role played by the Fredholm alternative theorem.</description>

      <title>Generative adversarial neural networks for simulating neutrino interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to simulate neutrino scattering events as an alternative to the standard Monte Carlo generator approach. Generative adversarial neural network (GAN) models are developed to simulate charged current neutrino-carbon collisions in the few-GeV energy range. We consider a simplified framework to generate muon kinematic variables, specifically its energy and scattering angle. GAN models are trained on simulation data from \nuwro{} Monte Carlo event generator. Two GAN models have been obtained: one simulating quasielastic neutrino-nucleus scatterings and another simulating all interactions at given neutrino energy. The models work for neutrino energy ranging from 300 MeV to 10 GeV. The performance of both models has been assessed using two statistical metrics. It is shown that both GAN models successfully reproduce the distribution of muon kinematics.</description>

      <title>Worldvolume fermion as baryon with homogeneous instantons in holographic $\mathrm{QCD}_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (ArXiv version) We investigate holographically the effective theory of the worldvolume fermion on the flavor branes in the D3/D7 model with homogeneously smeared D(-1)-branes. As a top-down approach in gauge-gravity duality, the D(-1)-branes are instantons and violate the CP symmetry in the dual theory. In the confined geometry, we introduce a baryon vertex as a D5-brane wrapped on $S^{5}$, then identify the fermionic fluxes produced by the $N_{c}$ open strings on the D7-brane as a baryonic operator. Afterwards, we study the spectrum and the holographic correlation function of the baryonic fermion on the D7-branes. Remarkably, the fermionic spectrum is in agreement with the dispersion curves obtained from the confined correlation function, and the mass ratio of the lowest baryon and meson in our model is close to the associated experimental data. Moreover, the effective interaction terms of the holographic baryon and meson are derived and all the coupling constants take order of $N_{c}^{1/2}$ agreeing with the evaluation from the large $N_{c}$ field theory. In the deconfined geometry, the holographic correlation function is also evaluated numerically while the fermion on D7-brane is identified to plasmino instead of baryon. The dispersion curves from the deconfined correlation function basically covers the results from the hard thermal loop approximation and may imply the instanton-induced interaction with spin. Overall, this work constructs a holographic theory about baryonic fermion and mesonic boson with instantons or CP violation.</description>

      <title>Phase Boundary of Nuclear Matter in Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear matter with a strong magnetic field is prevalent inside neutron stars and heavy-ion collisions. In a sufficiently large magnetic field the ground state is either a chiral soliton lattice (CSL), an array of solitons of the neutral pion field, or a domain-wall Skyrmion phase in which Skyrmions emerge inside the chiral solitons. In the region of large chemical potential and a magnetic field lower than its critical value for CSL, a Skyrmion crystal is expected to take up the ground state based on the chiral perturbation theory at the next leading order. We determine the phase boundary between such a Skyrmion crystal and the QCD vacuum. There was a conjecture that a magnetic field deforms the Skyrmion into a pancake shape whose boundary is a superconducting ring of charged pions. In contrast, through the exact Skyrmion solution, we find that the pancake conjecture holds approximately in a strong magnetic field, but fails for a weak one. We also validate that a Skyrmion would shrink to null without the Skyrme term, although Derrick's scaling law is modified by a background magnetic field, and the stability at the leading order is not ruled out in theory.</description>
