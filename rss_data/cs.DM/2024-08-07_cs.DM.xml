      <title>Solving QUBO on the Loihi 2 Neuromorphic Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we describe an algorithm for solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems on the Intel Loihi 2 neuromorphic processor. The solver is based on a hardware-aware fine-grained parallel simulated annealing algorithm developed for Intel's neuromorphic research chip Loihi 2. Preliminary results show that our approach can generate feasible solutions in as little as 1 ms and up to 37x more energy efficient compared to two baseline solvers running on a CPU. These advantages could be especially relevant for size-, weight-, and power-constrained edge computing applications.</description>

      <title>On shortest products for nonnegative matrix mortality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite set of matrices with integer entries, the matrix mortality problem asks if there exists a product of these matrices equal to the zero matrix. We consider a special case of this problem where all entries of the matrices are nonnegative. This case is equivalent to the NFA mortality problem, which, given an NFA, asks for a word $w$ such that the image of every state under $w$ is the empty set. The size of the alphabet of the NFA is then equal to the number of matrices in the set. We study the length of shortest such words depending on the size of the alphabet. We show that for an NFA with $n$ states this length can be at least $2^n - 1$ for an alphabet of size $n$, $2^{(n - 4)/2}$ for an alphabet of size $3$ and $2^{(n - 2)/3}$ for an alphabet of size $2$. We also discuss further open problems related to mortality of NFAs and DFAs.</description>

      <title>A connection between the boomerang uniformity and the extended differential in odd characteristic and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper makes the first bridge between the classical differential/boomerang uniformity and the newly introduced $c$-differential uniformity. We show that the boomerang uniformity of an odd APN function is given by the maximum of the entries (except for the first row/column) of the function's $(-1)$-Difference Distribution Table. In fact, the boomerang uniformity of an odd permutation APN function equals its $(-1)$-differential uniformity. We next apply this result to easily compute the boomerang uniformity of several odd APN functions. In the second part we give two classes of differentially low-uniform functions obtained by modifying the inverse function. The first class of permutations (CCZ-inequivalent to the inverse) over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^n}$ ($p$, an odd prime) is obtained from the composition of the inverse function with an order-$3$ cycle permutation, with differential uniformity $3$ if $p=3$ and $n$ is odd; $5$ if $p=13$ and $n$ is even; and $4$ otherwise. The second class is a family of binomials and we show that their differential uniformity equals~$4$. We next complete the open case of $p=3$ in the investigation started by G\" olo\u glu and McGuire (2014), for $p\geq 5$, and continued by K\"olsch (2021), for $p=2$, $n\geq 5$, on the characterization of $L_1(X^{p^n-2})+L_2(X)$ (with linearized $L_1,L_2$) being a permutation polynomial. Finally, we extend to odd characteristic a result of Charpin and Kyureghyan (2010) providing an upper bound for the differential uniformity of the function and its switched version via a trace function.</description>

      <title>Some Property of an Ultrafilter and Graph parameters on Connectivity System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An ultrafilter is a maximal filter on a set, playing a crucial role in set theory and topology for rigorously handling limits, convergence, and compactness. A connectivity system is defined as a pair (X, f), where X is a finite set and f is a symmetric submodular function. Understanding the duality in these parameters helps to elucidate the relationship between different decompositions and measures of a graph's complexity. In this paper, we delve into ultrafilters on connectivity systems, applying Tukey's Lemma to these systems. Additionally, we explore prefilters, ultra-prefilters, and subbases within the context of connectivity systems. Furthermore, we introduce and investigate new parameters related to width, length, and depth.</description>
