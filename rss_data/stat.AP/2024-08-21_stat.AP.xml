      <title>Multi-time small-area estimation of oil and gas production capacity by Bayesian multilevel modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach for estimating well-level oil and gas production capacities across multiple time periods within small geographic areas. Focusing on basins, which are economically significant drilling regions, we model the latent production capacity of wells using small-area estimation techniques. Our model accounts for well-level variations within these basins, incorporating factors such as lateral length, water usage, and sand usage. A key aspect of our methodology is the use of the Maidenhead Coordinate System to define small areas, enabling detailed regional analysis. The model was developed and validated using data from the Eagle Ford region, covering the years 2014 to 2019, and demonstrates strong predictive performance, particularly in handling small sample sizes. We expand the model to accommodate temporal dynamics by introducing time-effect parameters, allowing for the analysis of production trends over time. Additionally, we explore the impact of technological advancements by modeling water-sand intensity as a proxy for production efficiency. Our findings suggest that Bayesian multilevel modeling provides robust and flexible tools for understanding and predicting oil and gas production at a granular level, offering valuable insights for energy production forecasting and resource management.</description>

      <title>Examinees' Rapid-Guessing Patterns in Computerized Adaptive Testing for Interim Assessment: From Hierarchical Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interim assessment is frequently administered via computerized adaptive testing (CAT), offering direct support to teaching and learning. This study attempted to fill a vital knowledge gap about the nuanced landscape of examinees' rapid-guessing patterns in CAT in the interim assessment context. We analyzed a sample of 146,519 examinees in Grades 1-8 who participated in a widely used CAT, using hierarchical clustering, a robust data science methodology for uncovering insights in data. We found that examinees' rapid-guessing patterns varied across item positions, content domains, chronological grades, examinee clusters, and examinees' overall rapid-guessing level on the test, suggesting a nuanced interplay between testing features and examinees' behavior. Our study contributes to the literature on rapid guessing in CATs for interim assessment, offering a comprehensive and nuanced pattern analysis and demonstrating the application of hierarchical clustering to process data analysis in testing.</description>

      <title>Locally Adaptive Random Walk Stochastic Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel Bayesian framework for estimating time-varying volatility by extending the Random Walk Stochastic Volatility (RWSV) model with a new Dynamic Shrinkage Process (DSP) in (log) variances. Unlike classical Stochastic Volatility or GARCH-type models with restrictive parametric stationarity assumptions, our proposed Adaptive Stochastic Volatility (ASV) model provides smooth yet dynamically adaptive estimates of evolving volatility and its uncertainty (vol of vol). We derive the theoretical properties of the proposed global-local shrinkage prior. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that ASV exhibits remarkable misspecification resilience with low prediction error across various data generating scenarios in simulation. Furthermore, ASV's capacity to yield locally smooth and interpretable estimates facilitates a clearer understanding of underlying patterns and trends in volatility. Additionally, we propose and illustrate an extension for Bayesian Trend Filtering simultaneously in both mean and variance. Finally, we show that this attribute makes ASV a robust tool applicable across a wide range of disciplines, including in finance, environmental science, epidemiology, and medicine, among others.</description>

      <title>Climate Change in Austria: Precipitation and Dry Spells over 50 years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a spatio-temporal generalised additive model (GAM) to study if precipitation patterns have changed between two 10-year time periods in the last 50 years in Austria. In particular, we model three scenarios: monthly mean and monthly maximum precipitation as well as the maximum length of a dry spell per month with a gamma, blended generalised extreme value and negative binomial distribution, respectively, over the periods 1973-1982 and 2013-2022. In order to model the spatial dependencies in the data more realistically, we intend to take the mountainous landscape of Austria into account. Therefore, we have chosen a non-stationary version of the Mat\'ern covariance function, which accounts for elevation differences, as a spatial argument of the latent field in the GAM. The temporal part of the latent field is captured by an AR(1) process. We use the stochastic partial differential equation approach in combination with integrated nested Laplace approximation to perform inference computationally efficient. The model outputs are visualised and support existing climate change studies in the Alpine region obtained with, for example, projections from regional climate models.</description>

      <title>Optical ISAC: Fundamental Performance Limits and Transceiver Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper characterizes the optimal capacity-distortion (C-D) tradeoff in an optical point-to-point (P2P) system with single-input single-output for communication and single-input multiple-output for sensing (SISO-SIMO-C/S) within an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework. We introduce practical, asymptotically optimal maximum a posteriori (MAP) and maximum likelihood estimators (MLE) for target distance, addressing nonlinear measurement-to-state relationships and non-conjugate priors. Our results show these estimators converge to the Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (BCRB) as sensing antennas increase. We also demonstrate that the achievable rate-CRB (AR-CRB) serves as an outer bound (OB) for the optimal C-D region. To optimize input distribution across the Pareto boundary of the C-D region, we propose two algorithms: an iterative Blahut-Arimoto algorithm (BAA)-type method and a memory-efficient closed-form (CF) approach, including a CF optimal distribution for high optical signal-to-noise ratio (O-SNR) conditions. Additionally, we extend and modify the Deterministic-Random Tradeoff (DRT) to this optical ISAC context.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Nonparametric Risk Assessment in Developmental Toxicity Studies with Ordinal Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a nonparametric Bayesian modeling framework for clustered ordinal responses in developmental toxicity studies, which typically exhibit extensive heterogeneity. The primary focus of these studies is to examine the dose-response relationship, which is depicted by the (conditional) probability of an endpoint across the dose (toxin) levels. Standard parametric approaches, limited in terms of the response distribution and/or the dose-response relationship, hinder reliable uncertainty quantification in this context. We propose nonparametric mixture models that are built from dose-dependent stick-breaking process priors, leveraging the continuation-ratio logits representation of the multinomial distribution to formulate the mixture kernel. We further elaborate the modeling approach, amplifying the mixture models with an overdispersed kernel which offers enhanced control of variability. We conduct a simulation study to demonstrate the benefits of both the discrete nonparametric mixing structure and the overdispersed kernel in delivering coherent uncertainty quantification. Further illustration is provided with different forms of risk assessment, using data from a toxicity experiment on the effects of ethylene glycol.</description>

      <title>A Regression-Based Approach to the CO2 Airborne Fraction: Enhancing Statistical Precision and Tackling Zero Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01053v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global fraction of anthropogenically emitted carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) that stays in the atmosphere, the CO$_2$ airborne fraction, has been fluctuating around a constant value over the period 1959 to 2022. The consensus estimate of the airborne fraction is around $44\%$; the remaining $56\%$ is absorbed by the oceanic and terrestrials biospheres. In this study, we show that the conventional estimator of the airborne fraction, based on a ratio of changes in atmospheric CO$_2$ concentrations and CO$_2$ emissions, suffers from a number of statistical deficiencies, such as non-existence of moments and a non-Gaussian limiting distribution. We propose an alternative regression-based estimator of the airborne fraction that does not suffer from these deficiencies. We show that the regression-based estimator has a Gaussian limiting distribution and reduces estimation uncertainty substantially. Our empirical analysis leads to an estimate of the airborne fraction over 1959--2022 of $47.0\%$ ($\pm 1.1\%$; $1 \sigma$), implying a higher, and better constrained, estimate than the current consensus. Using climate model output, we show that a regression-based approach provides sensible estimates of the airborne fraction, also in future scenarios where emissions are at or near zero.</description>

      <title>How to identify earth pressures on in-service tunnel linings: Insights from Bayesian inversion to address non-uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying earth pressures on in-service transportation tunnel linings is essential for their health monitoring and performance prediction, particularly in structures that exhibit poor performance. Due to the high costs associated with pressure gauges, pressure inversion based on easily observed structural responses, such as deformations, is preferred. A significant challenge lies in the non-uniqueness of inversion results, where various pressures can yield similar structural responses. Existing approaches often overlook detailed discussions on this critical issue. In addressing this gap, this study introduces a Bayesian approach. The proposed statistical framework effectively quantifies the uncertainty induced by non-uniqueness. Further analysis identifies the uniform component in distributed pressures as the primary source of non-uniqueness. Insights into mitigation strategies are provided, including increasing the quantity of deformation data or incorporating an observation of internal normal force within the tunnel lining -- the latter proving to be notably more effective. A practical application in a numerical case study demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach. In addition, our investigation recommends maintaining deformation measurement accuracy within the range of [-1, 1] mm to ensure satisfactory outcomes. Finally, deficiencies and potential future extensions of this approach are discussed.</description>

      <title>Ab initio uncertainty quantification in scattering analysis of microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02468v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating parameters from data is a fundamental problem in physics, customarily done by minimizing a loss function between a model and observed statistics. In scattering-based analysis, researchers often employ their domain expertise to select a specific range of wavevectors for analysis, a choice that can vary depending on the specific case. We introduce another paradigm that defines a probabilistic generative model from the beginning of data processing and propagates the uncertainty for parameter estimation, termed ab initio uncertainty quantification (AIUQ). As an illustrative example, we demonstrate this approach with differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) that extracts dynamical information through Fourier analysis at a selected range of wavevectors. We first show that DDM is equivalent to fitting a temporal variogram in the reciprocal space using a latent factor model as the generative model. Then we derive the maximum marginal likelihood estimator, which optimally weighs information at all wavevectors, therefore eliminating the need to select the range of wavevectors. Furthermore, we substantially reduce the computational cost by utilizing the generalized Schur algorithm for Toeplitz covariances without approximation. Simulated studies validate that AIUQ significantly improves estimation accuracy and enables model selection with automated analysis. The utility of AIUQ is also demonstrated by three distinct sets of experiments: first in an isotropic Newtonian fluid, pushing limits of optically dense systems compared to multiple particle tracking; next in a system undergoing a sol-gel transition, automating the determination of gelling points and critical exponent; and lastly, in discerning anisotropic diffusive behavior of colloids in a liquid crystal. These outcomes collectively underscore AIUQ's versatility to capture system dynamics in an efficient and automated manner.</description>

      <title>Counterfactual Slopes and Their Applications in Social Stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses two prominent theses in social stratification research, the great equalizer thesis and Mare's (1980) school transition thesis. Both theses are premised on a descriptive regularity: the association between socioeconomic background and an outcome variable changes when conditioning on an intermediate treatment. However, if the descriptive regularity is driven by differential selection into treatment, then the two theses do not have substantive interpretations. We propose a set of novel counterfactual slope estimands, which capture the two theses under the hypothetical scenario where differential selection into treatment is eliminated. Thus, we use the counterfactual slopes to construct selection-free tests for the two theses. Compared with the existing literature, we are the first to explicitly provide nonparametric and causal estimands, which enable us to conduct more principled analysis. We are also the first to develop flexible, efficient, and robust estimators for the two theses based on efficient influence functions. We apply our framework to a nationally representative dataset in the United States and re-evaluate the two theses. Findings from our selection-free tests show that the descriptive regularity is sometimes misleading for substantive interpretations.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Generalizable TBI Phenotypes Using Multivariate Time-Series Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) presents a broad spectrum of clinical presentations and outcomes due to its inherent heterogeneity, leading to diverse recovery trajectories and varied therapeutic responses. While many studies have delved into TBI phenotyping for distinct patient populations, identifying TBI phenotypes that consistently generalize across various settings and populations remains a critical research gap. Our research addresses this by employing multivariate time-series clustering to unveil TBI's dynamic intricates. Utilizing a self-supervised learning-based approach to clustering multivariate time-Series data with missing values (SLAC-Time), we analyzed both the research-centric TRACK-TBI and the real-world MIMIC-IV datasets. Remarkably, the optimal hyperparameters of SLAC-Time and the ideal number of clusters remained consistent across these datasets, underscoring SLAC-Time's stability across heterogeneous datasets. Our analysis revealed three generalizable TBI phenotypes ({\alpha}, \b{eta}, and {\gamma}), each exhibiting distinct non-temporal features during emergency department visits, and temporal feature profiles throughout ICU stays. Specifically, phenotype {\alpha} represents mild TBI with a remarkably consistent clinical presentation. In contrast, phenotype \b{eta} signifies severe TBI with diverse clinical manifestations, and phenotype {\gamma} represents a moderate TBI profile in terms of severity and clinical diversity. Age is a significant determinant of TBI outcomes, with older cohorts recording higher mortality rates. Importantly, while certain features varied by age, the core characteristics of TBI manifestations tied to each phenotype remain consistent across diverse populations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale streaming data are common in modern machine learning applications and have led to the development of online learning algorithms. Many fields, such as supply chain management, weather and meteorology, energy markets, and finance, have pivoted towards using probabilistic forecasts, which yields the need not only for accurate learning of the expected value but also for learning the conditional heteroskedasticity and conditional distribution moments. Against this backdrop, we present a methodology for online estimation of regularized, linear distributional models. The proposed algorithm is based on a combination of recent developments for the online estimation of LASSO models and the well-known GAMLSS framework. We provide a case study on day-ahead electricity price forecasting, in which we show the competitive performance of the incremental estimation combined with strongly reduced computational effort. Our algorithms are implemented in a computationally efficient Python package.</description>

      <title>Combining BART and Principal Stratification to estimate the effect of intermediate on primary outcomes with application to estimating the effect of family planning on employment in sub-Saharan Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03777v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is interest in learning about the causal effect of family planning (FP) on empowerment related outcomes. Experimental data related to this question are available from trials in which FP programs increase access to FP. While program assignment is unconfounded, FP uptake and subsequent empowerment may share common causes. We use principal stratification to estimate the causal effect of an intermediate FP outcome on a primary outcome of interest, among women affected by a FP program. Within strata defined by the potential reaction to the program, FP uptake is unconfounded. To minimize the need for parametric assumptions, we propose to use Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) for modeling stratum membership and outcomes of interest. We refer to the combined approach as Prince BART. We evaluate Prince BART through a simulation study and use it to assess the causal effect of modern contraceptive use on employment in six cities in Nigeria, based on quasi-experimental data from a FP program trial during the first half of the 2010s. We show that findings differ between Prince BART and alternative modeling approaches based on parametric assumptions.</description>
