      <title>Secure Estimation of Battery Voltage Under Sensor Attacks: A Self-Learning Koopman Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud-based battery management system (BMS) requires accurate terminal voltage measurement data to ensure optimal and safe charging of Lithium-ion batteries. Unfortunately, an adversary can corrupt the battery terminal voltage data as it passes from the local-BMS to the cloud-BMS through the communication network, with the objective of under- or over-charging the battery. To ensure accurate terminal voltage data under such malicious sensor attacks, this paper investigates a Koopman-based secure terminal voltage estimation scheme using a two-stage error-compensated self-learning feedback. During the first stage of error correction, the potential Koopman prediction error is estimated to compensate for the error accumulation due to the linear approximation of Koopman operator. The second stage of error compensation aims to recover the error amassing from the higher-order dynamics of the Lithium-ion batteries missed by the self-learning strategy. Specifically, we have proposed two different methods for this second stage error compensation. First, an interpretable empirical correction strategy has been obtained using the open circuit voltage to state-of-charge mapping for the battery. Second, a Gaussian process regression-based data-driven method has been explored. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed secure estimator using both empirical and data-driven corrections.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning Assisted XgBoost For Adaptable Cyberattack Detection In Battery Packs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal charging of electric vehicle (EVs) depends heavily on reliable sensor measurements from the battery pack to the cloud-controller of the smart charging station. However, an adversary could corrupt the voltage sensor data during transmission, potentially causing local to wide-scale disruptions. Therefore, it is essential to detect sensor cyberattacks in real-time to ensure secure EV charging, and the developed algorithms must be readily adaptable to variations, including pack configurations. To tackle these challenges, we propose adaptable fine-tuning of an XgBoost-based cell-level model using limited pack-level data to use for voltage prediction and residual generation. We used battery cell and pack data from high-fidelity charging experiments in PyBaMM and `liionpack' package to train and test the detection algorithm. The algorithm's performance has been evaluated for two large-format battery packs under sensor swapping and replay attacks. The simulation results also highlight the adaptability and efficacy of our proposed detection algorithm.</description>

      <title>Spectrum Sharing in STAR-RIS-assisted UAV with NOMA for Cognitive Radio Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an emerging technology, the simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) can improve the spectrum efficiency (SE) of primary users (PUs) and secondary users (SUs) in cognitive radio (CR) networks by mitigating the interference of the incident signals. The STAR-RIS-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can fully cover the dynamic environment through high mobility and fast deployment. According to the dynamic air-to-ground channels, the STAR-RIS-assisted UAV may face a challenge configuring their elements' coefficients (i.e., reflecting and transmitting the amplitude and phases). Hence, to meet the requirements of dynamic channel determination with the SE approach, this paper proposes the sum rate maximization of both PUs and SUs through non-orthogonal multiple access in CR network to jointly optimize the trajectory and transmission-reflection beamforming design of the STAR-RIS-assisted UAV, and power allocation. Since the non-convex joint optimization problem includes coupled optimization variables, we develop an alternative optimization algorithm. Simulation results study the impact of: 1) the significant parameters, 2) the performance of different intelligence surface modes and STAR-RIS operating protocols, 3) the joint trajectory and beamforming design with fixed and mobile users, and 4) STAR-RIS capabilities such as mitigating the interference, and how variations in the roles of elements dynamically.</description>

      <title>Vehicle Dynamics Control for Simultaneous Optimization of Tire Emissions and Performance in EVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Electric Vehicles (EVs) have seen widespread public adoption. While EVs produce zero tailpipe emissions, they contribute to an increase in another type of vehicular emission: tire emissions. Battery-operated EVs are generally heavier than their combustion-engine counterparts and require greater acceleration forces, which their high-torque electric motors provide. This combination of increased weight and traction forces leads to higher tire emissions, which possess various adverse health and environmental effects. Here, we propose a control solution with promising results in mitigating tire wear in all-wheel-drive EVs. The idea is to utilize different tire profiles on each drive axis: a low-wear, low-traction axis and a high-wear, high-traction axis. Derived from detailed mathematical analyses, we propose a simple control scheme to counteract the performance difference from using the low-traction tires. The proposed control mechanism then distributes torque optimally between the two axes, maximizing usage from the low-wear axis and simultaneously maintaining stability and performance by leveraging high-traction tires. Through detailed numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the developed model significantly reduces tire emissions and maintains vehicle drivability and performance.</description>

      <title>Virtual Contraction Approach to Decentralized Adaptive Stabilization of Nonlinear Time-Delayed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we utilize a diagonally dominant structure for the decentralized stabilization of unknown nonlinear time-delayed networks. Generalizing the idea of virtual contraction analysis to time-delayed systems, we demonstrate that nonlinear time-delayed networks can be stabilized by diagonal high-gains if the input matrices possess certain generalized (column/row) diagonally dominant properties. To achieve stabilization of unknown networks, we further propose a distributed adaptive tuning rule for each individual gain function, ensuring that all closed-loop trajectories converge to the origin. The effectiveness of the proposed decentralized adaptive control is verified in a case study on epidemic spreading control in SIS networks with transmission delays.</description>

      <title>Offset-free Nonlinear MPC with Koopman-based Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we design offset-free nonlinear Model Predictive Control (MPC) for surrogate models based on Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD). The model used for prediction in MPC is augmented with a disturbance term, that is estimated by an observer. If the full information about the equilibrium of the real system is not available, a reference calculator is introduced in the algorithm to compute the MPC state and input references. The control algorithm guarantees offset-free tracking of the controlled output under the assumption that the modeling errors are asymptotically constant. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is showcased with numerical simulations for two popular benchmark systems: the van-der-Pol oscillator and the four-tanks process.</description>

      <title>A Linear Push-Pull Average Consensus Algorithm for Delay-Prone Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the average consensus problem of multi-agent systems for possibly unbalanced and delay-prone networks with directional information flow. We propose a linear distributed algorithm (referred to as RPPAC) that handles asynchronous updates and time-varying heterogeneous information delays. Our proposed distributed algorithm utilizes a surplus-consensus mechanism and information regarding the number of incoming and outgoing links to guarantee state averaging, despite the imbalanced and delayed information flow in directional networks. The convergence of the RPPAC algorithm is examined using key properties of the backward product of time-varying matrices that correspond to different snapshots of the directional augmented network.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization with Gradient Tracking over Heterogeneous Delay-Prone Directed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10964v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the distributed optimization problem over unidirectional networks with possibly time-invariant heterogeneous bounded transmission delays. In particular, we propose a modified version of the Accelerated Distributed Directed OPTimization (ADD-OPT) algorithm, herein called Robustified ADD-OPT (R-ADD-OPT), which is able to solve the distributed optimization problem, even when the communication links suffer from heterogeneous but bounded transmission delays. We show that if the gradient step-size of the R-ADD-OPT algorithm is within a certain range, which also depends on the maximum time delay in the network, then the nodes are guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution of the distributed optimization problem. The range of the gradient step-size that guarantees convergence can be computed a priori based on the maximum time delay in the network.</description>

      <title>Steering Feedback in Dynamic Driving Simulators: Road-Induced and Non-Road-Induced Harshness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steering feedback plays a substantial role in the validity of driving simulators for the virtual development of modern vehicles. Established objective steering characteristics typically assess the feedback behavior in the frequency range of up to 30 Hz while factors such as steering wheel and vehicle body vibrations at higher frequencies are mainly approached as comfort issues. This work investigates the influence of steering wheel and vehicle body excitations in the frequency range between 30 and 100 Hz on the subjective evaluation of steering feedback in a dynamic driving simulator. A controlled subject study with 42 participants was performed to compare a reference vehicle with an electrical power steering system to four variants of its virtual representation on a dynamic driving simulator. The effects of road-induced excitations were investigated by comparing a semi-empirical and a physics-based tire model, while the influence of non-road-induced excitations was investigated by implementing engine and wheel orders. The simulator variants were evaluated in comparison to the reference vehicle during closed-loop driving on a country road in a single-blind within-subjects design. The subjective evaluation focused on the perception of road feedback compared to the reference vehicle. The statistical analysis of subjective results shows that there is a strong effect of non-road-induced steering and vehicle body excitations, while the effect of road-induced excitations is considerably less pronounced.</description>

      <title>A mixed-integer framework for analyzing neural network-based controllers for piecewise affine systems with bounded disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for representing the closed-loop dynamics of piecewise affine (PWA) systems with bounded additive disturbances and neural network-based controllers as mixed-integer (MI) linear constraints. We show that such representations enable the computation of robustly positively invariant (RPI) sets for the specified system class by solving MI linear programs. These RPI sets can subsequently be used to certify stability and constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, the approach allows to handle non-linear systems based on suitable PWA approximations and corresponding error bounds, which can be interpreted as the bounded disturbances from above.</description>

      <title>Robust MPC for Uncertain Linear Systems -- Combining Model Adaptation and Iterative Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11261v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a robust adaptive learning Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for linear systems with parametric uncertainties and additive disturbances performing iterative tasks. The approach iteratively refines the parameter estimates using set membership estimation. Performance enhancement over iterations is achieved by learning the terminal cost from data. Safety is enforced using a terminal set, which is also learned iteratively. The proposed method guarantees recursive feasibility, constraint satisfaction, and a robust bound on the closed-loop cost. Numerical simulations on a mass-spring-damper system demonstrate improved computational efficiency and control performance compared to an existing robust adaptive MPC approach.</description>

      <title>Balancing hydrogen delivery in national energy systems: impact of the temporal flexibility of hydrogen delivery on export prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen is expected to play a key role in the energy transition. Analyses exploring the price of hydrogen usually calculate average or marginal production costs regardless of the time of delivery. A key factor that affects the price of hydrogen is the balancing costs, which we define as the expense of ensuring a steady schedule of hydrogen delivery. We explore the effect of delivering hydrogen to the export ports at different schedules, ranging from fully flexible to moderately stable with a daily and weekly buffer, to fully stable. We quantify the rise in hydrogen price with strict balancing constraint in three countries: Brazil, Morocco and Turkey, and three export volumes: 10, 50 and 200 TWh. The price difference between the flexible and stable schedules was found to reach a maximum of 36% in Brazil, 47% in Morocco and 18% in Turkey across the different export volumes.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis of State Space Models for Scrap Composition Estimation in EAF and BOF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops and analyzes linear and nonlinear state space models for estimating the elemental composition of scrap steel used in steelmaking, with applications to Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) and Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) processes. The models incorporate mass balance equations and are fitted using a modified Kalman filter for linear cases and the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) for nonlinear cases. Using Cu and Cr as representative elements, we assess the sensitivity of model predictions to measurement noise in key process variables, including steel mass, steel composition, scrap input mass, slag mass, and iron oxide fraction in slag. Results show that the models are robust to moderate noise levels in most variables, particularly when errors are below $10\%$. However, accuracy significantly deteriorates with noise in slag mass estimation. These findings highlight the practical feasibility and limitations of applying state space models for real-time scrap composition estimation in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks for on-chip Model Predictive Control: a Method to Build Optimized Training Datasets and its application to Type-1 Diabetes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training Neural Networks (NNs) to behave as Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithms is an effective way to implement them in constrained embedded devices. By collecting large amounts of input-output data, where inputs represent system states and outputs are MPC-generated control actions, NNs can be trained to replicate MPC behavior at a fraction of the computational cost. However, although the composition of the training data critically influences the final NN accuracy, methods for systematically optimizing it remain underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Optimally-Sampled Datasets (OSDs) as ideal training sets and present an efficient algorithm for generating them. An OSD is a parametrized subset of all the available data that (i) preserves existing MPC information up to a certain numerical resolution, (ii) avoids duplicate or near-duplicate states, and (iii) becomes saturated or complete. We demonstrate the effectiveness of OSDs by training NNs to replicate the University of Virginia's MPC algorithm for automated insulin delivery in Type-1 Diabetes, achieving a four-fold improvement in final accuracy. Notably, two OSD-trained NNs received regulatory clearance for clinical testing as the first NN-based control algorithm for direct human insulin dosing. This methodology opens new pathways for implementing advanced optimizations on resource-constrained embedded platforms, potentially revolutionizing how complex algorithms are deployed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for central pattern generator design that leverages the intrinsic rebound excitability of neurons in combination with winner-takes-all computation. Our approach unifies decision-making and rhythmic pattern generation within a simple yet powerful network architecture that employs all-to-all inhibitory connections enhanced by designable excitatory interactions. This design offers significant advantages regarding ease of implementation, adaptability, and robustness. We demonstrate its efficacy through a ring oscillator model, which exhibits adaptive phase and frequency modulation, making the framework particularly promising for applications in neuromorphic systems and robotics.</description>

      <title>eXplainable AI for data driven control: an inverse optimal control approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of black-box data-driven controllers is a key challenge in modern control design. In this work, we propose an eXplainable AI (XAI) methodology based on Inverse Optimal Control (IOC) to obtain local explanations for the behavior of a controller operating around a given region. Specifically, we extract the weights assigned to tracking errors and control effort in the implicit cost function that a black-box controller is optimizing, offering a more transparent and interpretable representation of the controller's underlying objectives. This approach presents connections with well-established XAI techniques, such as Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) since it is still based on a local approximation of the control policy. However, rather being limited to a standard sensitivity analysis, the explanation provided by our method relies on the solution of an inverse Linear Quadratic (LQ) problem, offering a structured and more control-relevant perspective. Numerical examples demonstrate that the inferred cost function consistently provides a deeper understanding of the controller's decision-making process, shedding light on otherwise counterintuitive or unexpected phenomena.</description>

      <title>Exploring Generative AI Techniques in Government: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The swift progress of Generative Artificial intelligence (GenAI), notably Large Language Models (LLMs), is reshaping the digital landscape. Recognizing this transformative potential, the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) launched a pilot initiative to explore the integration of GenAI techniques into its daily operation for performance excellence, where 22 projects were launched in May 2024. Within these projects, this paper presents the development of the intelligent agent Pubbie as a case study, targeting the automation of performance measurement, data management and insight reporting at the NRC. Cutting-edge techniques are explored, including LLM orchestration and semantic embedding via RoBERTa, while strategic fine-tuning and few-shot learning approaches are incorporated to infuse domain knowledge at an affordable cost. The user-friendly interface of Pubbie allows general government users to input queries in natural language and easily upload or download files with a simple button click, greatly reducing manual efforts and accessibility barriers.</description>

      <title>HyRRT-Connect: Bidirectional Motion Planning for Hybrid Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a bidirectional rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) algorithm to solve the motion planning problem for hybrid systems. The proposed algorithm, called HyRRT-Connect, propagates in both forward and backward directions in hybrid time until an overlap between the forward and backward propagation results is detected. Then, HyRRT-Connect constructs a motion plan through the reversal and concatenation of functions defined on hybrid time domains, ensuring that the motion plan satisfies the given hybrid dynamics. To address the potential discontinuity along the flow caused by tolerating some distance between the forward and backward partial motion plans, we reconstruct the backward partial motion plan by a forward-in-hybrid-time simulation from the final state of the forward partial motion plan. effectively eliminating the discontinuity. The proposed algorithm is applied to an actuated bouncing ball system and a walking robot example to highlight its computational improvement.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Synaptogenesis Implemented on a Nanomagnetic Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The human brain functions very differently from artificial neural networks (ANN) and possesses unique features that are absent in ANN. An important one among them is "adaptive synaptogenesis" that modifies synaptic weights when needed to avoid catastrophic forgetting and promote lifelong learning. The key aspect of this algorithm is supervised Hebbian learning, where weight modifications in the neocortex driven by temporal coincidence are further accepted or vetoed by an added control mechanism from the hippocampus during the training cycle, to make distant synaptic connections highly sparse and strategic. In this work, we discuss various algorithmic aspects of adaptive synaptogenesis tailored to edge computing, demonstrate its function using simulations, and design nanomagnetic hardware accelerators for specific functions of synaptogenesis.</description>

      <title>$\pi$-MPPI: A Projection-based Model Predictive Path Integral Scheme for Smooth Optimal Control of Fixed-Wing Aerial Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10962v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) is a popular sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm for nonlinear systems. It optimizes trajectories by sampling control sequences and averaging them. However, a key issue with MPPI is the non-smoothness of the optimal control sequence, leading to oscillations in systems like fixed-wing aerial vehicles (FWVs). Existing solutions use post-hoc smoothing, which fails to bound control derivatives. This paper introduces a new approach: we add a projection filter $\pi$ to minimally correct control samples, ensuring bounds on control magnitude and higher-order derivatives. The filtered samples are then averaged using MPPI, leading to our $\pi$-MPPI approach. We minimize computational overhead by using a neural accelerated custom optimizer for the projection filter. $\pi$-MPPI offers a simple way to achieve arbitrary smoothness in control sequences. While we focus on FWVs, this projection filter can be integrated into any MPPI pipeline. Applied to FWVs, $\pi$-MPPI is easier to tune than the baseline, resulting in smoother, more robust performance.</description>

      <title>Neural Control Barrier Functions from Physics Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As autonomous systems become increasingly prevalent in daily life, ensuring their safety is paramount. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have emerged as an effective tool for guaranteeing safety; however, manually designing them for specific applications remains a significant challenge. With the advent of deep learning techniques, recent research has explored synthesizing CBFs using neural networks-commonly referred to as neural CBFs. This paper introduces a novel class of neural CBFs that leverages a physics-inspired neural network framework by incorporating Zubov's Partial Differential Equation (PDE) within the context of safety. This approach provides a scalable methodology for synthesizing neural CBFs applicable to high-dimensional systems. Furthermore, by utilizing reciprocal CBFs instead of zeroing CBFs, the proposed framework allows for the specification of flexible, user-defined safe regions. To validate the effectiveness of the approach, we present case studies on three different systems: an inverted pendulum, autonomous ground navigation, and aerial navigation in obstacle-laden environments.</description>

      <title>A Multi-UAV Formation Obstacle Avoidance Method Combined Improved Simulated Annealing and Adaptive Artificial Potential Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional Artificial Potential Field (APF) method exhibits limitations in its force distribution: excessive attraction when UAVs are far from the target may cause collisions with obstacles, while insufficient attraction near the goal often results in failure to reach the target. Furthermore, APF is highly susceptible to local minima, compromising motion reliability in complex environments. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel hybrid obstacle avoidance algorithm-Deflected Simulated Annealing-Adaptive Artificial Potential Field (DSA-AAPF)-which combines an improved simulated annealing mechanism with an enhanced APF model. The proposed approach integrates a Leader-Follower distributed formation strategy with the APF framework, where the resultant force formulation is redefined to smooth UAV trajectories. An adaptive gravitational gain function is introduced to dynamically adjust UAV velocity based on environmental context, and a fast-converging controller ensures accurate and efficient convergence to the target. Moreover, a directional deflection mechanism is embedded within the simulated annealing process, enabling UAVs to escape local minima caused by semi-enclosed obstacles through continuous rotational motion. The simulation results, covering formation reconfiguration, complex obstacle avoidance, and entrapment escape, demonstrate the feasibility, robustness, and superiority of the proposed DSA-AAPF algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Review of Traffic Wave Suppression Strategies: Variable Speed Limit vs. Jam-Absorption Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main form of freeway traffic congestion is the familiar stop-and-go wave, characterized by wide moving jams that propagate indefinitely upstream provided enough traffic demand. They cause severe, long-lasting adverse effects, such as reduced traffic efficiency, increased driving risks, and higher vehicle emissions. This underscores the crucial importance of artificial intervention in the propagation of stop-and-go waves. Over the past two decades, two prominent strategies for stop-and-go wave suppression have emerged: variable speed limit (VSL) and jam-absorption driving (JAD). Although they share similar research motivations, objectives, and theoretical foundations, the development of these strategies has remained relatively disconnected. To synthesize fragmented advances and drive the field forward, this paper first provides a comprehensive review of the achievements in the stop-and-go wave suppression-oriented VSL and JAD, respectively. It then focuses on bridging the two areas and identifying research opportunities from the following perspectives: fundamental diagrams, traffic dynamics modeling, traffic state estimation and prediction, stochasticity, scenarios for strategy validation, and field tests and practical deployment. We expect that through this review, one area can effectively address its limitations by identifying and leveraging the strengths of the other, thus promoting the overall research goal of freeway stop-and-go wave suppression.</description>

      <title>HeatSense: Intelligent Thermal Anomaly Detection for Securing NoC-Enabled MPSoCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-Processor System-on-Chips (MPSoCs) are highly vulnerable to thermal attacks that manipulate dynamic thermal management systems. To counter this, we propose an adaptive real-time monitoring mechanism that detects abnormal thermal patterns in chip tiles. Our design space exploration helped identify key thermal features for an efficient anomaly detection module to be implemented at routers of network-enabled MPSoCs. To minimize hardware overhead, we employ weighted moving average (WMA) calculations and bit-shift operations, ensuring a lightweight yet effective implementation. By defining a spectrum of abnormal behaviors, our system successfully detects and mitigates malicious temperature fluctuations, reducing severe cases from 3.00{\deg}C to 1.9{\deg}C. The anomaly detection module achieves up to 82% of accuracy in detecting thermal attacks, which is only 10-15% less than top-performing machine learning (ML) models like Random Forest. However, our approach reduces hardware usage by up to 75% for logic resources and 100% for specialized resources, making it significantly more efficient than ML-based solutions. This method provides a practical, low-cost solution for resource-constrained environments, ensuring resilience against thermal attacks while maintaining system performance.</description>

Abstract: The paper is a follow-up of the recently introduced kernel-based framework to identify nonlinear input-output systems regularized by desirable input-output incremental properties. Assuming that the system has fading memory, we propose to learn the functional that maps the past input to the present output rather than the operator mapping input trajectories to output trajectories. While retaining the benefits of the previously proposed framework, this modification simplifies the selection of the kernel, enforces causality, and enables temporal simulation.</description>

      <title>Steering Feedback in Dynamic Driving Simulators: The Influence of Steering Wheel Vibration and Vehicle Motion Frequency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The validity of the subjective evaluation of steering feedback in driving simulators is crucial for modern vehicle development. Although there are established objective steering characteristics for the assessment of both stationary and dynamic feedback behaviour, factors such as steering wheel vibrations and vehicle body motion, particularly in high-frequency ranges, present challenges in simulator fidelity. This work investigates the influence of steering wheel vibration and vehicle body motion frequency content on the subjective evaluation of steering feedback during closed-loop driving in a dynamic driving simulator. A controlled subject study with 30 participants consisting of a back-to-back comparison of a reference vehicle with an electrical power steering system and three variants of its virtual representation on a dynamic driving simulator was performed. Subjective evaluation focused on the representation of road feedback in comparison to the reference vehicle. The statistical analysis of subjective results show that there is a significant influence of the frequency content of both steering wheel torque and vehicle motion on the subjective evaluation of steering feedback in a dynamic driving simulator. The results suggest an influence of frequency content on the subjective evaluation quality of steering feedback characteristics that are not associated with the dynamic feedback behaviour in the context of established performance indicators.</description>

      <title>Balancing Forecast Accuracy and Switching Costs in Online Optimization of Energy Management Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03368v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the integration of forecasting and optimization in energy management systems, with a focus on the role of switching costs -- penalties incurred from frequent operational adjustments. We develop a theoretical and empirical framework to examine how forecast accuracy and stability interact with switching costs in online decision-making settings. Our analysis spans both deterministic and stochastic optimization approaches, using point and probabilistic forecasts. A novel metric for measuring temporal consistency in probabilistic forecasts is introduced, and the framework is validated in a real-world battery scheduling case based on the CityLearn 2022 challenge. Results show that switching costs significantly alter the trade-off between forecast accuracy and stability, and that more stable forecasts can reduce the performance loss due to switching. Contrary to common practice, the findings suggest that, under non-negligible switching costs, longer commitment periods may lead to better overall outcomes. These insights have practical implications for the design of intelligent, forecast-aware energy management systems.</description>

      <title>A Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm for Sampling Jeffreys Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inference and estimation are fundamental aspects of statistics, system identification and machine learning. For most inference problems, prior knowledge is available on the system to be modeled, and Bayesian analysis is a natural framework to impose such prior information in the form of a prior distribution. However, in many situations, coming out with a fully specified prior distribution is not easy, as prior knowledge might be too vague, so practitioners prefer to use a prior distribution that is as `ignorant' or `uninformative' as possible, in the sense of not imposing subjective beliefs, while still supporting reliable statistical analysis. Jeffreys prior is an appealing uninformative prior because it offers two important benefits: (i) it is invariant under any re-parameterization of the model, (ii) it encodes the intrinsic geometric structure of the parameter space through the Fisher information matrix, which in turn enhances the diversity of parameter samples. Despite these benefits, drawing samples from Jeffreys prior is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a general sampling scheme using the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm that enables sampling of parameter values from Jeffreys prior, and provide numerical illustrations of our approach through several examples.</description>

      <title>A moving horizon estimator for aquifer thermal energy storages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aquifer thermal energy storages (ATES) represent groundwater saturated aquifers that store thermal energy in the form of heated or cooled groundwater. Combining two ATES, one can harness excess thermal energy from summer (heat) and winter (cold) to support the building's heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) technology. In general, a dynamic operation of ATES throughout the year is beneficial to avoid using fossil fuel-based HVAC technology and maximize the ``green use'' of ATES. Model predictive control (MPC) with an appropriate system model may become a crucial control approach for ATES systems. Consequently, the MPC model should reflect spatial temperature profiles around ATES' boreholes to predict extracted groundwater temperatures accurately. However, meaningful predictions require the estimation of the current state of the system, as measurements are usually only at the borehole of the ATES. In control, this is often realized by model-based observers. Still, observing the state of an ATES system is non-trivial, since the model is typically hybrid. We show how to exploit the specific structure of the hybrid ATES model and design an easy-to-solve moving horizon estimator based on a quadratic program.</description>

      <title>Optimal Intraday Power Trading for Single-Price Balancing Markets: An Adaptive Risk-Averse Strategy using Mixture Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient markets are characterised by profit-driven participants continuously refining their positions towards the latest insights. Margins for profit generation are generally small, shaping a difficult landscape for automated trading strategies. This paper introduces a novel intraday power trading strategy tailored for single-price balancing markets. The strategy relies on a strategically devised mixture model to forecast future system imbalance prices and is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with decision-dependent distributions to address two primary challenges: (i) the impact of trading positions on the system imbalance price and (ii) the uncertainty inherent in the model. The first challenge is tackled by adjusting the model to account for price changes after taking a position. For the second challenge, a coherent risk measure is added to the cost function to take additional uncertainties into account. This paper introduces a methodology to select the tuning parameter of this risk measure adaptively by continuously quantifying the performance of the strategy on a window of recently observed data. The strategy is validated with a simulation on the Belgian electricity market using real-time market data. The adaptive tuning approach leads to higher absolute profits, while also reducing the number of trades.</description>

      <title>CurricuLLM: Automatic Task Curricula Design for Learning Complex Robot Skills using Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Curriculum learning is a training mechanism in reinforcement learning (RL) that facilitates the achievement of complex policies by progressively increasing the task difficulty during training. However, designing effective curricula for a specific task often requires extensive domain knowledge and human intervention, which limits its applicability across various domains. Our core idea is that large language models (LLMs), with their extensive training on diverse language data and ability to encapsulate world knowledge, present significant potential for efficiently breaking down tasks and decomposing skills across various robotics environments. Additionally, the demonstrated success of LLMs in translating natural language into executable code for RL agents strengthens their role in generating task curricula. In this work, we propose CurricuLLM, which leverages the high-level planning and programming capabilities of LLMs for curriculum design, thereby enhancing the efficient learning of complex target tasks. CurricuLLM consists of: (Step 1) Generating sequence of subtasks that aid target task learning in natural language form, (Step 2) Translating natural language description of subtasks in executable task code, including the reward code and goal distribution code, and (Step 3) Evaluating trained policies based on trajectory rollout and subtask description. We evaluate CurricuLLM in various robotics simulation environments, ranging from manipulation, navigation, and locomotion, to show that CurricuLLM can aid learning complex robot control tasks. In addition, we validate humanoid locomotion policy learned through CurricuLLM in real-world. Project website is https://iconlab.negarmehr.com/CurricuLLM/</description>

      <title>Large problems are not necessarily hard: A case study on distributed NMPC paying off</title>

Abstract: A key motivation in the development of Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) is to accelerate centralized Model Predictive Control (MPC) for large-scale systems. DMPC has the prospect of scaling well by parallelizing computations among subsystems. However, communication delays may deteriorate the performance of decentralized optimization, if excessively many iterations are required per control step. Moreover, centralized solvers often exhibit faster asymptotic convergence rates and, by parallelizing costly linear algebra operations, they can also benefit from modern multicore computing architectures. On this canvas, we study the computational performance of cooperative DMPC for linear and nonlinear systems. To this end, we apply a tailored decentralized real-time iteration scheme to frequency control for power systems. DMPC scales well for the considered linear and nonlinear benchmarks, as the iteration number does not depend on the number of subsystems. Comparisons with multi-threaded centralized solvers demonstrate competitive performance of the proposed decentralized optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>An AI-driven multimodal smart home platform for continuous monitoring and intelligent assistance in post-stroke patients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19000v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At-home rehabilitation for post-stroke patients presents significant challenges, as continuous, personalized care is often limited outside clinical settings. Additionally, the absence of comprehensive solutions addressing diverse monitoring and assistance needs in home environments complicates recovery efforts. Here, we present a multimodal smart home platform designed for continuous, at-home rehabilitation of post-stroke patients, integrating wearable sensing, ambient monitoring, and adaptive automation. A plantar pressure insole equipped with a machine learning pipeline classifies users into motor recovery stages with up to 94% accuracy, enabling quantitative tracking of walking patterns. A head-mounted eye-tracking module supports cognitive assessments and hands-free control of household devices, while ambient sensors ensure sub-second response times for interaction. These data streams are fused locally via a hierarchical Internet of Things (IoT) architecture, protecting privacy and minimizing latency. An embedded large language model (LLM) agent, Auto-Care, continuously interprets multimodal data to provide real-time interventions-issuing personalized reminders, adjusting environmental conditions, and notifying caregivers. Implemented in a post-stroke context, this integrated smart home platform increases overall user satisfaction by an average of 115% (p&lt;0.01) compared to traditional home environment. Beyond stroke, the system offers a scalable framework for patient-centered, long-term care in broader neurorehabilitation and aging-in-place applications.</description>

      <title>SHIELD: Secure Host-Independent Extensible Logging for Tamper-Proof Detection and Real-Time Mitigation of Ransomware Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ransomware's escalating sophistication necessitates tamper-resistant, off-host detection solutions that capture deep disk activity beyond the reach of a compromised operating system while overcoming evasion and obfuscation techniques. To address this, we introduce SHIELD: a metric acquisition framework leveraging low-level filesystem monitoring and Network Block Device (NBD) technology to provide off-host, tamper-proof measurements for continuous observation of disk activity exhibited by software executing on a target device. We employ Shield within a detection architecture leveraging deep filesystem features along with simplified metrics aggregated based on frequency of disk actions, making the metrics impervious to obfuscation while avoiding reliance on vulnerable host-based logs. We evaluate the efficacy of these metrics through extensive experiments with both binary (benign vs. malicious behavior) and multiclass (ransomware strain identification) classifiers and confirm that our metrics yield high accuracy across diverse threat profiles, including intermittent or partial encryption. In a proof-of-concept deployment, we demonstrate real-time mitigation using models trained on these metrics by halting malicious disk operations after ransomware detection with minimum file loss and memory corruption. We also show that hardware-only features collected independently of OS or network stack retain high detection effectiveness, verifying feasibility of embedding the proposed pipeline in a SATA controller ASIC or FPGA for next-generation, disk-centric defenses that combine filesystem insight with inherent off-host isolation.</description>

      <title>The Pitfalls of Imitation Learning when Actions are Continuous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a discrete-time, continuous state-and-action control system. We show that, even if the dynamics satisfy a control-theoretic property called exponentially stability (i.e. the effects of perturbations decay exponentially quickly), and the expert is smooth and deterministic, any smooth, deterministic imitator policy necessarily suffers error on execution that is exponentially larger, as a function of problem horizon, than the error under the distribution of expert training data. Our negative result applies to any algorithm which learns solely from expert data, including both behavior cloning and offline-RL algorithms, unless the algorithm produces highly "improper" imitator policies--those which are non-smooth, non-Markovian, or which exhibit highly state-dependent stochasticity--or unless the expert trajectory distribution is sufficiently "spread." We provide experimental evidence of the benefits of these more complex policy parameterizations, explicating the benefits of today's popular policy parameterizations in robot learning (e.g. action-chunking and Diffusion Policies). We also establish a host of complementary negative and positive results for imitation in control systems.</description>
