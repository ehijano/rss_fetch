      <title>A Novel NPT Thermodynamic Integration Scheme to Derive Rigorous Gibbs Free Energies for Crystalline Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic Integration (TI) is the state-of-the-art computational technique for accurate Gibbs free energy predictions of solids. Conventional TI schemes start from an NVT harmonic reference and require three successive corrections to recover the Gibbs free energy of the real crystal in the NPT ensemble. However, the NVT-to-NPT correction neglects full cell flexibility. Here, we present a rigorous (and only) two-step TI scheme that operates entirely in the NPT ensemble, eliminating the need for the approximate NVT-to-NPT step. The key methodological advancement is the novel NPT reference that explicitly accounts for full cell fluctuations. The new approach is compared with the conventional one via two complementary case studies. For ice polymorphs, having simple cell-shape distributions, the new approach reproduces conventional TI results with excellent agreement. For CsPbI3, whose black phase exhibits complex cell-shape behavior, we demonstrate that our novel method provides more accurate Gibbs free energy differences than the conventional one. Moreover, the proposed framework maintains comparable computational cost while offering a simplified workflow. Overall, the new NPT TI scheme provides rigorous and direct Gibbs free energy calculations for solids.</description>

      <title>Stochastic tensor contraction for quantum chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many computational methods in ab initio quantum chemistry are formulated in terms of high-order tensor contractions, whose cost determines the size of system that can be studied. We introduce stochastic tensor contraction to perform such operations with greatly reduced cost, and present its application to the gold-standard quantum chemistry method, coupled cluster theory with up to perturbative triples. For total energy errors more stringent than chemical accuracy, we reduce the computational scaling to that of mean-field theory, while starting to approach the mean-field absolute cost, thereby challenging the existing cost-to-accuracy landscape. Benchmarks against state-of-the-art local correlation approximations further show that we achieve an order-of-magnitude improvement in both total computation time and error, with significantly reduced sensitivity to system dimensionality and electron delocalization. We conclude that stochastic tensor contraction is a powerful computational primitive to accelerate a wide range of quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Heat Sink Efficiency in MOSFETs using Physics Informed Neural Networks: A Systematic Study on Coolant Velocity Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a methodology using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to determine the required velocity of a coolant, given inlet and outlet temperatures for a given heat flux in a multilayered metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). MOSFETs are integral components of Power Electronic Building Blocks (PEBBs) and experiences the majority of the thermal load. Effective cooling of MOSFETs is therefore essential to prevent overheating and potential burnout. Determining the required velocity for the purpose of effective cooling is of importance but is an ill-posed inverse problem and difficult to solve using traditional methods. MOSFET consists of multiple layers with different thermal conductivities, including aluminum, pyrolytic graphite sheets (PGS), and stainless steel pipes containing flowing water. We propose an algorithm that employs sequential training of the MOSFET layers in PINNs. Mathematically, the sequential training method decouples the optimization of each layer by treating the parameters of other layers as constants during its training phase. This reduces the dimensionality of the optimization landscape, making it easier to find the global minimum for each layer's parameters and avoid poor local minima. Convergence of the PINNs solution to the analytical solution is theoretically analyzed. Finally we show the prediction of our proposed methodology to be in good agreement with experimental results.</description>

      <title>trainsum -- A Python package for quantics tensor trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present trainsum, a versatile Python package for doing computations with multidimensional quantics tensor trains: https://github.com/fh-igd-iet/trainsum. Using the Array API standard together with opt_einsum, trainsum allows the effortless approximation of tensors or functions by tensor trains independent of their shape or dimensionality. Once approximated, our package can perform normal arithmetic operations with quantics tensor trains, including addition, Einstein summations and element-wise transformations. It can be therefore used for generic computations with applications in simulation, data compression, machine learning and data analysis.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Barriers from Computational Complexity: Matrix-Product-State Approach to Satisfiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We approach the 3-SAT satisfiability problem with the quantum-inspired method of imaginary time propagation (ITP) applied to matrix product states (MPS) on a classical computer. This ansatz is fundamentally limited by a quantum entanglement barrier that emerges in imaginary time, reflecting the exponential hardness expected for this NP-complete problem. Strikingly, we argue based on careful analysis of the structure imprinted onto the MPS by the 3-SAT instances that this barrier arises from classical computational complexity. To reveal this connection, we elucidate with stochastic models the specific relationship between the classical hardness of the $\sharp$P $\supseteq$ NP-complete counting problem $\sharp$3-SAT and the entanglement properties of the quantum state. Our findings illuminate the limitations of this quantum-inspired approach and demonstrate how purely classical computational complexity can manifest in quantum entanglement. Furthermore, we present estimates of the non-stabilizerness required by the protocol, finding a similar resource barrier. Specifically, the necessary amount of non-Clifford operations scales superlinearly in system size, thus implying extensive resource requirements of ITP on different architectures such as Clifford circuits or gate-based quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Combining Quasiparticle Self-Consistent $GW$ and Machine-Learned DFT+$U$ in Search of Half-Metallic Heuslers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Half-metallic Heusler compounds are of significant interest for spintronics. For device fabrication, compounds that can be epitaxially grown on III-V semiconductors are particularly attractive. We present a first-principles investigation of four Co-based and two Ni-based Heusler compounds that are lattice-matched to InAs. The results of density functional theory (DFT) using semi-local and hybrid functionals are compared to quasiparticle self-consistent $GW$ (QPGW). We also consider DFT with machine-learned Hubbard $U$ corrections [npj Computational Materials 6, 180 (2020)] with a new Bayesian optimization (BO) objective function to determine the $U$ values that yield the closest agreement with the QPGW band structure and magnetic moments. We find that DFT+U(BO) can adequately reproduce the key QPGW features in most cases. Our results reveal a strong method dependence of the degree of spin polarization at the Fermi level and, in some cases, even the dominant spin channel (majority or minority). Of the materials studied here, Co$_2$TiSn and Co$_2$ZrAl are the most likely to be half-metals, and Co$_2$MnIn is likely to be a near-half-metal.</description>

      <title>Lost in Projection? Gaussian Filtering Recovers Hidden Conformational States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To interpret molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, it is common practice to reduce the dimensionality of the molecular coordinates to a low-dimensional collective variable $x$. Projecting the high-dimensional MD data onto $x$ yields a free energy landscape $\Delta G(x)$, which highlights low-energy regions corresponding to conformational states. The accurate definition of these states, however, is often impeded by projection artifacts, resulting in artificially shortened state lifetimes or even the complete disappearance of states from the analysis. As demonstrated for a two-dimensional toy model, Gaussian low-pass filtering of the high-dimensional MD coordinates can restore the underlying free energy landscape, allowing to recover previously hidden states. When applied to an all-atom folding trajectory of HP35, the number of microstates increases by an order of magnitude, which leads to metastable states that are long-lived and much better defined structurally, even compared to dynamically cored state trajectories.</description>

      <title>HINORA II: Testing the Existence of the Council of Giants in {\Lambda}CDM simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of the galaxy ring known as the Council of Giants (CoG) highlights the need to explain such structures in the Local Universe. In the first paper of this series we presented HINORA - a code to locate (ring-like) structures in 3D point sets - and used it to identify the CoG in the most complete observations of the Local Volume. Here, in Part II, we apply the same method to cosmological simulations to quantify the possible existence of such objects in the LCDM model of structure formation. We analyze DM-only simulations with random and constrained initial conditions, selecting regions that reproduce the properties of the Local Group and Volume, respectively. In order to use the same selection criteria as previsouly done for observations, we relate K-band luminosities to halo masses through semi-empirical relations. After confirming that the selected regions from the simulations match the observed mass function and density of the Local Universe, we use HINORA to search for ring-like structures in them. We find that the existence of CoGs in LCDM simulations is a rather unusual phenomenon. The observed CoG represents an anomaly of more than 2.7 sigma from what is expected in the distribution of massive galaxies in LCDM. These results hint that the CoG could either be a rare chance configuration or the imprint of physical processes at intermediate scales that standard DM-only simulations fail to capture.</description>

      <title>A Modular Multi-Document Framework for Scientific Visualization and Simulation in Java</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of a modular multi-document interface (MDI) framework for scientific visualization and simulation in the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) ecosystem. The framework emphasizes architectural separation between visualization layers, simulation engines, and optional hardware-accelerated 3D rendering. 3D functionality is isolated into a separate module to prevent unnecessary dependency coupling in 2D-only applications. We describe the core abstractions, threading model, simulation integration strategy, and dependency isolation approach. A case study involving a real-time 3D gas expansion simulation integrated with synchronized 2D entropy plotting demonstrates architectural cohesion. The framework is publicly available via Maven Central and targets long-lived scientific and engineering desktop applications.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Delta Tracking Schemes Using a Track-Length Estimator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Monte Carlo radiation transport calculations, Woodcock-delta tracking is a common alternative to the more popular surface tracking technique. In this work we introduce a delta-tracking algorithm that tallies fluxes to a structured rectilinear mesh using the track-length estimator. This development also enables hybrid surface-delta tracking algorithms, because the track-length tally can be used everywhere for scalar flux estimation regardless of which tracking algorithm is employed. We use this tallying technique to develop a novel hybrid-in-energy method. We also implement a hybrid-in-material method, like what is implemented in Serpent2. We demonstrate that these delta tracking algorithms can be used in conjunction with continuously moving surfaces. We compare these methods showing figures of merit on four time-dependent problems (multi-group and continuous energy) solved with CPU- and GPU-based computers. Our implementation of delta tracking with a track length tally modestly improves figures of merit compared to standard delta tracking with a collision estimator and surface tracking with a track length estimator (1.5X 2.5X) for a problem with significant void regions. For both multi-group and continuous energy pressurized water reactor benchmarks, standard delta tracking with a collision estimator performs best. Hybrid-in-energy methods show significant improvements (7X-11X) for a continuous energy reactor benchmark problem.</description>

      <title>Essential difference between 2D and 3D from the perspective of real-space renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05891v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that area laws of quantum-information concepts indicate limitations of block transformations as well-behaved real-space renormalization group (RG) maps, which in turn guides the design of better RG schemes. Mutual-information area laws imply the difficulty of Kadanoff's block-spin method in two dimensions (2D) or higher due to the growth of short-scale correlations among the spins on the boundary of a block. A leap to the tensor-network RG, in hindsight, follows the guidance of mutual information and is efficient in 2D, thanks to its mixture of quantum and classical perspectives and the saturation of entanglement entropy in 2D. In three dimensions (3D), however, entanglement grows according to the area law, posing a threat to 3D block-tensor map as an apt RG transformation. As a numerical evidence, we show that estimations of 3D Ising critical exponents fail to improve by retaining more couplings. As a guidance to proceed, a tensor-network toy model is proposed to capture the 3D entanglement-entropy area law.</description>

      <title>Solid-State Dewetting of Polycrystalline Thin Films: a Phase Field Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10811v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid-state dewetting is the process by which thin solid films break up and retract on a substrate, forming nanostructures. While dewetting of single-crystalline films is understood as a surface-energy-driven process mediated by surface diffusion, polycrystalline films exhibit additional complexity due to the presence of grain boundaries. Most theoretical and computational studies have focused on single-crystalline dewetting. Here, we present the application of the grandpotential multi-phase-field model to the dewetting of thin polycrystalline films in three dimensions, reproducing the key phenomenology of this process. By considering isotropic interface/surface energy, we illustrate its consistency with predictions based on energetic arguments and the morphological evolution towards equilibrium. We also provide novel analytical criteria for the onset of three-dimensional dewetting, serving as fundamental theoretical benchmarks, and highlight the critical role of triple junctions. Moreover, we unveil the dewetting behavior of polycrystalline patches, extending the scenarios of their single-crystalline counterparts.</description>

      <title>A Bottom-Up Field-Theoretic Framework via Hierarchical Coarse-Graining: Generalized Mode Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20025v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiscale simulations facilitate the efficient exploration of large spatiotemporal scales in chemical and physical systems, yet particle-based simulations become prohibitively expensive at time and length scales beyond the molecular level. Field-theoretic simulations offer an attractive alternative, but most existing formulations rely on top-down approximations and are not systematically connected to atomistic interactions. Here, we present a hierarchical bottom-up framework for constructing auxiliary field representations of molecular liquids directly from microscopic models. We introduce a hierarchical coarse-graining framework that constructs field-theoretic models directly from atomistic liquids. The method first maps atomistic interactions to coarse-grained center-of-mass potentials and regularizes short-range divergences through a perturbative expansion in reciprocal space. Building on the auxiliary field formulation developed in polymer field-theoretic simulations, we then generalize the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation to arbitrary pair potentials by separating positive and negative Fourier modes and introducing two auxiliary fields. The resulting generalized mode theory extends bottom-up field-theoretic modeling beyond positive-definite kernels and is compatible with existing field-theoretic sampling strategies. By combining formal derivations with numerical regularization and mode-truncation procedures, this work provides the theoretical foundation for scalable, bottom-up field-theoretic simulations of molecular systems.</description>

Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and are often history dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization histories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimensional projection defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using a gradient-enhanced Gaussian Process with the inverse multiquadric kernel, whose posterior variance contours delineate data-supported regions from extrapolated ones. A rotated coordinate frame decomposes the RMSD plane into reaction progress and orthogonal distance. We show the utility of the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, where a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements, along with the ratification of the visualization for more complex reactions, a Grignard rearrangement, and a conrotatory bicyclobutane ring opening.</description>
