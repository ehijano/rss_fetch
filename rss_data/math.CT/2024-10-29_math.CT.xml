      <title>Completing hearts of triangulated categories via weight-exact localizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a weight-exact localization pi of a well generated triangulated category C along with the embedding of the hearts of adjacent t-structures coming from the functor right adjoint to pi. We prove that the functors relating the corresponding four hearts are completely determined by the heart Hw of the weight structure on C along with the set of Hw-morphisms that we invert via pi; it also suffices to know the corresponding embedding of the hearts of t-structures. Our results generalize the description of non-commutative localizations of rings in terms of weight-exact localizations given in an earlier paper of the first author. That paper was essentially devoted to weight-exact localizations by compactly generated subcategories, whereas in the current text we focus on "more complicated" localizations.
  We recall that two types of localizations of the sort we are interested in were studied by several authors. They took C=D(R-mod); the heart of the first t-structure was equivalent to R-mod, and the second heart was equivalent to the exact abelian category $U_{contra}\subset R-mod$ of U-contramodules (corresponding to a set of Proj R-mod-morphisms U related either to a homological ring epimorphism $u:R\to UU$ or to an ideal of I of R). The functor $R-mod\to U_{contra}$ induced by pi is a certain completion one. Consequently, the hearts of the corresponding weight structures are equivalent to Proj R-mod and to the subcategory of projective objects of U_{contra}, respectively. Moreover, the connecting functors between these categories are isomorphic to ones coming from any weight structure class-generated by a single compact object whose endomorphism ring is R^{op}; in particular, one can take R=Z and C=SH and re-prove some important statements due to Bousfield.</description>

      <title>On the chain rule in Goodwillie calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a generalization of the Arone-Ching chain rule for Goodwillie derivatives by showing that for any pair of reduced finitary functors $F \colon \mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{E}$ and $G \colon \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ between differentiable $\infty$-categories, there is an equivalence $\partial_*(FG) \simeq \partial_*F \circ_{\partial_*{\mathrm{id}_{\mathcal{D}}}} \partial_*G$. This confirms a conjecture of Lurie. The proof of this theorem consists of two parts, which are of independent interest. We first show that the Goodwillie derivatives can be refined to a lax functor $\partial_* \colon \mathrm{Diff} \to \mathrm{Pr}^{\mathrm{Sym}}_{\mathrm{St}}$ from the $(\infty, 2)$-category of differentiable $\infty$-categories and reduced finitary functors to a certain $(\infty, 2)$-category of generalized symmetric sequences. Such a lax structure on the Goodwillie derivatives was long believed to exist, but has not been constructed prior to this work. We then finish the proof by studying the interaction of this lax functor with Koszul duality. In order to do so, we establish a new universal property of the bar-cobar adjunction.</description>

      <title>A categorical approach to inverse semigroups, \'etale groupoids, and their C*-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a category of inverse semigroup actions and a category of \'etale groupoids. We show that there are three functors which send inverse semigroups to their spectral actions, inverse semigroup actions to their transformation groupoids, and \'etale groupoids to their groupoid C*-algebras, respectively. The composition of these functors is naturally equivalent to the already known functor which sends inverse semigroups to their C*-algebras. This result is a categorical version of the theorem by Paterson which states that the inverse semigroup C*-algebras coincide the groupoid C*-algebras of the universal groupoids. We also construct a functor from the category of \'etale groupoids to the category of inverse semigroup actions sending \'etale groupoids to their slice actions, and show that this functor is right adjoint to the functor sending inverse semigroup actions to their transformation groupoids.</description>

      <title>Homotopy reflectivity is equivalent to the weak Vop\v{e}nka principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Homotopical localizations with respect to (possibly proper) classes of maps are known to exist assuming the validity of a large-cardinal axiom from set theory called Vop\v{e}nka's principle. In this article, we prove that each of the following statements is equivalent to an axiom of lower consistency strength than Vop\v{e}nka's principle, known as weak Vop\v{e}nka's principle: (a) Localization with respect to any class of maps exists in the homotopy category of simplicial sets; (b) Localization with respect to any class of maps exists in the homotopy category of spectra; (c) Localization with respect to any class of morphisms exists in any presentable $\infty$-category; (d) Every full subcategory closed under products and fibres in a triangulated category with locally presentable models is reflective. Our results are established using Wilson's 2020 solution to a long-standing open problem concerning the relative consistency of weak Vop\v{e}nka's principle within the large-cardinal hierarchy.</description>

      <title>String diagrams for Strictification and Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.11738v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whereas string diagrams for strict monoidal categories are well understood, and have found application in several fields of Computer Science, graphical formalisms for non-strict monoidal categories are far less studied. In this paper, we provide a presentation by generators and relations of string diagrams for non-strict monoidal categories, and show how this construction can handle applications in domains such as digital circuits and programming languages. We prove the correctness of our construction, which yields a novel proof of Mac Lane's strictness theorem. This in turn leads to an elementary graphical proof of Mac Lane's coherence theorem, and in particular allows for the inductive construction of the canonical isomorphisms in a monoidal category.</description>

      <title>Eilenberg-Moore categories and quiver representations of monads and comonads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider representations of quivers taking values in monads or comonads over a Grothendieck category $\mathcal C$. We treat these as scheme like objects whose ``structure sheaf'' consists of monads or comonads. By using systems of adjoint functors between Eilenberg-Moore categories, we obtain a categorical framework of modules over monad quivers, and of comodules over comonad quivers. Our main objective is to give conditions for these to be Grothendieck categories, which play the role of noncommutative spaces. As with usual ringed spaces, we have to study two kinds of module categories over a monad quiver. The first behaves like a sheaf of modules over a ringed space. The second consists of modules that are cartesian, which resemble quasi-coherent sheaves. We also obtain an extension of the classical quasi-coherator construction to modules over a monad quiver with values in Eilenberg-Moore categories. We establish similar results for comodules over a comonad quiver. One of our key steps is finding a modulus like bound for an endofunctor $U:\mathcal C\longrightarrow \mathcal C$ in terms of $\kappa(G)$, where $G$ is a generator for $\mathcal C$ and $\kappa(G)$ is a cardinal such that $G$ is $\kappa(G)$-presentable. Another feature of our paper is that we study modules over a monad quiver in two different orientations, which we refer to as ``cis-modules'' and ``trans-modules.'' We conclude with rational pairings of a monad quiver with a comonad quiver, which relate comodules over a comonad quiver to coreflective subcategories of modules over monad quivers.</description>

      <title>Yoneda lemma and representation theorem for double categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study (vertically) normal lax double functors valued in the weak double category $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{at}$ of small categories, functors, profunctors and natural transformations, which we refer to as lax double presheaves. We show that for the theory of double categories they play a similar role as 2-functors valued in $\mathrm{Cat}$ for 2-categories. We first introduce representable lax double presheaves and establish a Yoneda lemma. Then we build a Grothendieck construction which gives a 2-equivalence between lax double presheaves and discrete double fibrations over a fixed double category. Finally, we prove a representation theorem showing that a lax double presheaf is represented by an object if and only if its Grothendieck construction has a double terminal object.</description>

      <title>On a fibrational construction for optics, lenses, and Dialectica categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16388v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Categories of lenses/optics and Dialectica categories are both comprised of bidirectional morphisms of basically the same form. In this work we show how they can be considered a special case of an overarching fibrational construction, generalizing Hofstra's construction of Dialectica fibrations and Spivak's construction of generalized lenses. This construction turns a tower of Grothendieck fibrations into another tower of fibrations by iteratively twisting each of the components, using the opposite fibration construction.</description>
