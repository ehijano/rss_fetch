      <title>Designing an Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models in Astronomy Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are shifting how scientific research is done. It is imperative to understand how researchers interact with these models and how scientific sub-communities like astronomy might benefit from them. However, there is currently no standard for evaluating the use of LLMs in astronomy. Therefore, we present the experimental design for an evaluation study on how astronomy researchers interact with LLMs. We deploy a Slack chatbot that can answer queries from users via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); these responses are grounded in astronomy papers from arXiv. We record and anonymize user questions and chatbot answers, user upvotes and downvotes to LLM responses, user feedback to the LLM, and retrieved documents and similarity scores with the query. Our data collection method will enable future dynamic evaluations of LLM tools for astronomy.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a Longwave HgCdTe GeoSnap Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New longwave HgCdTe detectors are critical to upcoming plans for ground-based infrared astronomy. These detectors, with fast-readouts and deep well-depths, will be key components of extremely large telescope instruments and therefore must be well understood prior to deployment. We analyze one such HgCdTe detector, a Teledyne Imaging Sensors GeoSnap, at the University of Michigan. We find that the properties of the GeoSnap are consistent with expectations from analysis of past devices. The GeoSnap has a well-depth of 2.75 million electrons per pixel, a read noise of 360 e-/pix, and a dark current of 330,000 e-/s/pix at 45 K. The device experiences 1/f noise which can be mitigated relative to half-well shot noise with modest frequency image differencing. The GeoSnap's quantum efficiency is calculated to be 79.7 +- 8.3 % at 10.6 microns. Although the GeoSnap's bad pixel fraction, on the order of 3%, is consistent with other GeoSnap devices, close to a third of the bad pixels in this detector are clustered in a series of 31 "leopard" spots spread across the detector plane. We report these properties and identify additional analyses that will be performed on future GeoSnap detectors.</description>

      <title>GRAVITY for MATISSE -- Improving the MATISSE performance with the GRAVITY fringe tracker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: MATISSE, the mid-infrared spectro-imaging instrument of VLTI, was designed to deliver its advertised performance when paired with an external second generation fringe tracker. Science observation started in 2019, demonstrating imaging capabilities and faint science target observations. Now, The GRAVITY fringe tracker stabilizes the MATISSE fringes which allows using all spectroscopic modes and improves sensitivity and data accuracy. Aims: We present how the MATISSE and GRAVITY instruments were adapted to make the GRAVITY fringe tracker work with MATISSE, under the umbrella of the aptly-named GRA4MAT project, led by ESO in collaboration with the two instrument consortia. Methods: We detail the software modifications needed to implement an acquisition and observing sequence specific to GRA4MAT, including simultaneous fringe tracking and chopping and a narrow off-axis capability inspired by the galactic center and exoplanet capability of GRAVITY. We explain the modified data collection and reduction processes. We show how we leveraged the recent fringe tracker upgrade to implement features specific to its use with MATISSE, e.g. fringe jumps mitigation with an improved group delay control and simultaneous fringe tracking and chopping with a new state machine. Results: We successfully demonstrate significant improvements to the MATISSE instrument. Observations can now be performed at higher spectral resolutions of up to $R\sim3300$ and across the full LM bands at once. Long detector integration times, made possible with stabilized fringes, have improved the LM-bands sensitivity by a factor of 10. Low flux biases in coherently-reduced N-band data have been eliminated. The L-band transfer function is now higher and more stable. We finally illustrate the scientific potential of GRA4MAT with a preview of the first exoplanet observation made by MATISSE on $\beta$ Pictoris b.</description>

      <title>HST SHEL: Enabling Comparative Exoplanetology with HST/STIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been our most prolific tool to study exoplanet atmospheres. As the age of JWST begins, there is a wealth of HST archival data that is useful to strengthen our inferences from JWST. Notably, HST/STIS and its 0.3-1 $\mu$m wavelength coverage extends past JWST's 0.6 $\mu$m wavelength cutoff and holds an abundance of potential information: alkali (Na, K) and molecular (TiO, VO) species opacities, aerosol information, and the presence of stellar contamination. However, time series observations with HST suffer from significant instrumental systematics and can be highly dependent on choices made during the transit fitting process. This makes comparing transmission spectra of planets with different data reduction methodologies challenging, as it is difficult to discern if an observed trend is caused by differences in data reduction or underlying physical processes. Here, we present the Sculpting Hubble's Exoplanet Legacy (SHEL) program, which aims to build a consistent data reduction and light curve analysis methodology and associated database of transmission spectra from archival HST observations. In this paper, we present the SHEL analysis framework for HST/STIS and its low-resolution spectroscopy modes, G430L and G750L. We apply our methodology to four notable hot Jupiters: WASP-39 b, WASP-121 b, WASP-69 b, and WASP-17 b, and use these examples to discuss nuances behind analysis with HST/STIS. Our results for WASP-39 b, WASP-121 b, and WASP-17 b are consistent with past publications, but our analysis of WASP-69 b differs and shows evidence of either a strong scattering slope or stellar contamination. The data reduction pipeline and tutorials are available on Github.</description>

      <title>Class-Based Time Series Data Augmentation to Mitigate Extreme Class Imbalance for Solar Flare Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series data plays a crucial role across various domains, making it valuable for decision-making and predictive modeling. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have shown promise in this regard, yet their performance hinges on data quality and quantity, often constrained by data scarcity and class imbalance, particularly for rare events like solar flares. Data augmentation techniques offer a potential solution to address these challenges, yet their effectiveness on multivariate time series datasets remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation method for time series data named Mean Gaussian Noise (MGN). We investigate the performance of MGN compared to eight existing basic data augmentation methods on a multivariate time series dataset for solar flare prediction, SWAN-SF, using a ML algorithm for time series data, TimeSeriesSVC. The results demonstrate the efficacy of MGN and highlight its potential for improving classification performance in scenarios with extremely imbalanced data. Our time complexity analysis shows that MGN also has a competitive computational cost compared to the investigated alternative methods.</description>

      <title>Identifying and Fitting Eclipse Maps of Exoplanets with Cross-Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eclipse mapping uses the shape of the eclipse of an exoplanet to measure its two-dimensional structure. Light curves are mostly composed of longitudinal information, with the latitudinal information only contained in the brief ingress and egress of the eclipse. This imbalance can lead to a spuriously confident map, where the longitudinal structure is constrained by out-of-eclipse data and the latitudinal structure is wrongly determined by the priors on the map. We present a new method to address this issue. The method tests for the presence of an eclipse mapping signal by using k-fold cross-validation to compare the performance of a simple mapping model to the null hypothesis of a uniform disk. If a signal is found, the method fits a map with more degrees of freedom, optimising its information content. The information content is varied by penalising the model likelihood by a factor proportional to the spatial entropy of the map, optimised by cross-validation. We demonstrate this method for simulated datasets then apply it to three observational datasets. The method identifies an eclipse mapping signal for JWST MIRI/LRS observations of WASP-43b but does not identify a signal for JWST NIRISS/SOSS observations of WASP-18b or Spitzer Space Telescope observations of HD 189733b. It is possible to fit eclipse maps to these datasets, but we suggest that these maps are overfitting the eclipse shape. We fit a new map with more spatial freedom to the WASP-43b dataset and show a flatter east-west structure than previously derived.</description>

      <title>A Needle in a Cosmic Haystack: A Review of FRB Search Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ephemeral Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) must be powered by some of the most energetic processes in the Universe. That makes them highly interesting in their own right and as precise probes for estimating cosmological parameters. This field thus poses a unique challenge: FRBs must be detected promptly and immediately localised and studied based only on that single millisecond-duration flash. The problem is that the burst occurrence is highly unpredictable and that their distance strongly suppresses their brightness. Since the discovery of FRBs in single-dish archival data in 2007, detection software has evolved tremendously. Pipelines now detect bursts in real-time within a matter of seconds, operate on interferometers, buffer high-time and frequency resolution data, and issue real-time alerts to other observatories for rapid multi-wavelength follow-up. In this paper, we review the components that comprise a FRB search software pipeline, we discuss the proven techniques that were adopted from pulsar searches, we highlight newer, more efficient techniques for detecting FRBs, and we conclude by discussing the proposed novel future methodologies that may power the search for FRBs in the era of big data astronomy.</description>

      <title>Log-Normal Waiting Time Widths Characterize Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many astronomical phenomena, including Fast Radio Bursts and Soft Gamma Repeaters, consist of brief, separated, seemingly aperiodic events. The intervals between these events vary randomly, but there are epochs of greater activity, with shorter mean intervals, and of lesser activity, with longer mean intervals. This variability can be quantified by a single dimensionless parameter, the width of a log-normal fit to the distribution of waiting times between events. If the distribution of event strengths is a power law, as is often the case, this parameter is independent of the detection threshold and is a robust measure of the intrinsic variability of the waiting times and of the underlying dynamics.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Disentangling for Spectroscopic Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A suite of spectroscopic surveys is producing vast sets of stellar spectra with the goal of advancing stellar physics and Galactic evolution by determining their basic physical properties. A substantial fraction of these stars are in binary systems, but almost all large-survey modeling pipelines treat them as single stars. For sets of multi-epoch spectra, spectral disentangling is a powerful technique to recover or constrain the individual components' spectra of a multiple system. So far, this approach has focused on small samples or individual objects, usually with high resolution ($R \gtrsim 10.000$) spectra and many epochs ($\gtrsim 8$). Here, we present a disentangling implementation that accounts for several aspects of few-epoch spectra from large surveys: that vast sample sizes require automatic determination of starting guesses; that some of the most extensive spectroscopic surveys have a resolution of only $\approx 2,000$; that few epochs preclude unique orbit fitting; that one needs effective regularisation of the disentangled solution to ensure resulting spectra are smooth. We describe the implementation of this code and show with simulated spectra how well spectral recovery can work for hot and cool stars at $R \approx 2000$. Moreover, we verify the code on two established binary systems, the ``Unicorn'' and ``Giraffe''. This code can serve to explore new regimes in survey disentangling in search of massive stars with massive dark companions, e.g. the $\gtrsim 200,000$ hot stars of the SDSS-V survey.</description>

      <title>Time-delay interferometry with onboard optical delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-delay interferometry (TDI) is a data processing technique for space-based gravitational-wave detectors to create laser-noise-free equal-optical-path-length interferometers virtually on the ground. It relies on the interspacecraft signal propagation delays, which are delivered by intersatellite ranging monitors. Also delays due to onboard signal propagation and processing have a nonnegligible impact on the TDI combinations. However, these onboard delays were only partially considered in previous TDI-related research; onboard optical path lengths have been neglected so far. In this paper, we study onboard optical path lengths in TDI. We derive analytical models for their coupling to the second-generation TDI Michelson combinations and verify these models numerically. Furthermore, we derive a compensation scheme for onboard optical path lengths in TDI and validate its performance via numerical simulations.</description>
