      <title>Auslander-type conditions and weakly Gorenstein algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be an Artin algebra. Under certain Auslander-type conditions, we give some equivalent characterizations of (weakly) Gorenstein algebras in terms of the properties of Gorenstein projective modules and modules satisfying Auslander-type conditions. As applications, we provide some support for several homological conjectures. In particular, we prove that if $R$ is left quasi Auslander, then $R$ is Gorenstein if and only if it is (left and) right weakly Gorenstein; and that if $R$ satisfies the Auslander condition, then $R$ is Gorenstein if and only if it is left or right weakly Gorenstein. This is a reduction of an Auslander--Reiten's conjecture, which states that $R$ is Gorenstein if $R$ satisfies the Auslander condition.</description>

Abstract: We give the definition of a dg-division algebra, that is a concept of a differential graded algebra which may serve as an analogue of a division algebra. Using this concept, we study their dg-modules, give examples when they occur and study their relation to dg-simple algebras.</description>

      <title>On finite-dimensional homogeneous Lie algebras of derivations of polynomial rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite set of homogeneous locally nilpotent derivations of the algebra of polynomials in several variables, a finite dimensionality criterion for the Lie algebra generated by these derivations is known. Also the structure of the corresponding finite-dimensional Lie algebras is described in previous works. In this paper, we obtain a finite dimensionality criterion for a Lie algebra generated by a finite set of homogeneous derivations, each of which is not locally nilpotent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper determines the structure of the automorphism group of the monoid \((\mathbb{Z}/p^e \mathbb{Z}, \cdot)\) and the group of units \((U_{p^e}, \cdot)\). We prove that the automorphism group of \((\mathbb{Z}/p^e \mathbb{Z}, \cdot)\) is isomorphic to a canonical semidirect product of \(U_{p^{e-1}}\) and \(\Aut(U_{p^e}, \cdot)\), except when \(p^e = 8\), where it is isomorphic to the Klein group.
  Additionally, for \(e \geq 5\), the automorphism group of \((U_{2^e}, \cdot)\) is the direct product of \(\mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z}\) with the central product of a dihedral group of order 8 and the cyclic group \(\mathbb{Z}/2^{e-3}\mathbb{Z}\).

      <title>Locally noetherian quiver representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that a quiver is left noetherian if and only if the category of quiver representations in any locally noetherian abelian category is again locally noetherian. Here, locally noetherian means that any object is the directed union of its noetherian subobjects. For a quiver to be left noetherian means that the left ideals of paths starting at any fixed vertex satisfy the ascending chain condition. The proof generalises to representations of any small category that admits a Gr\"obner enrichment.</description>

      <title>Maximal Ideals in Functions Rings with a Countable Pointfree Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the subring $\mathcal{R}_cL$ of continuous real-valued functions defined on a frame $L$, comprising functions with a countable pointfree image. We present some useful properties of $\mathcal{R}_cL$. We establish that both $\mathcal{R}_cL$ and its bounded part, $\mathcal{R}_c^*L$, are clean rings for any frame $L$. We show that, for any completely regular frame $L$, the $z_c$-ideals of $\mathcal{R}_cL$ are contractions of the $z$-ideals of $\mathcal{R}L$. This leads to the conclusion that maximal ideals (or prime $z_c$-ideals) of $\mathcal{R}_cL$ correspond precisely to the contractions of those of $\mathcal{R}L$. We introduce the ${\bf O}_c$- and ${\bf M}_c$-ideals of $\mathcal{R}_cL$. By using ${\bf M}_c$-ideals, we characterize the maximal ideals of $\mathcal{R}_cL$, drawing an analogy with the Gelfand-Kolmogoroff theorem for the maximal ideals of $C_c(X)$. We demonstrate that fixed maximal ideals of $\mathcal{R}_cL$ have a one-to-one correspondence with the points of $L$ in the case where $L$ is a zero-dimensional frame. We describe the maximal ideals of $\mathcal{R}_c^*L$, leading to a one-to-one correspondence between these ideals and the points of $\beta L$, the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of $L$, when $L$ is a strongly zero-dimensional frame. Finally, we establish that $\beta_0L$, the Banaschewski compactification of a zero-dimensional $L$, is isomorphic to the frames of the structure spaces of $\mathcal{R}_cL$, $\mathcal{R}_c(\beta_0L)$, and $\mathcal{R}(\beta_0L)$.</description>

      <title>On the growth and integral (co)homology of free regular star-monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The free regular $\star$-monoid of rank $r$ is the freest $r$-generated regular monoid $\mathbf{F}_r^\star$ in which every element $m$ has a distinguished pseudo-inverse $m^\star$ satisfying $mm^\star m = m$ and $(m^\star)^\star = m$. We study the growth rate of the monogenic regular $\star$-monoid $\mathbf{F}_1^\star$, and prove that this growth rate is intermediate. In particular, we deduce that $\mathbf{F}_r^\star$ is not rational or automatic for any $r \geq 1$, yielding the analogue of a result of Cutting &amp; Solomon for free inverse monoids. Next, for all ranks $r \geq 1$ we determine the integral homology groups $H_\ast(\mathbf{F}_r^\star, \mathbb{Z})$, and by constructing a collapsing scheme prove that they vanish in dimension $3$ and above. As a corollary, we deduce that the free regular $\star$-monoid $\mathbf{F}_r^\star$ of rank $r \geq 1$ does not have the homological finiteness property $\operatorname{FP}_2$, yielding the analogue of a result of Gray &amp; Steinberg for free inverse monoids.</description>

      <title>Rota-Baxter operators, differential operators, pre- and Novikov structures on groups and Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rota-Baxter operators on various structures have found important applications in diverse areas, from renormalization of quantum field theory to Yang-Baxter equations. Relative Rota-Baxter operators on Lie algebras are closely related to pre-Lie algebras and post-Lie algebras. Some of their group counterparts have been introduced to study post-groups, skew left braces and set-theoretic solutions of Yang-Baxter equations, but searching suitable notions of relative Rota-Baxter operators on groups with weight zero and pre-groups has been challenging and has been the focus of recent studies, by provisionally imposing an abelian condition.
  Arising from the works of Balinsky-Novikov and Gelfand-Dorfman, Novikov algebras and their constructions from differential commutative algebras have led to broad applications. Finding their suitable counterparts for groups and Lie algebras has also attracted quite much recent attention.
  This paper uses one-sided-inverse pairs of maps to give a perturbative approach to a general notion of relative Rota-Baxter operators and differential operators on a group and a Lie algebra with limit-weight. With the extra condition of limit-abelianess on the group or Lie algebra, we give an interpretation of relative Rota-Baxter and differential operators with weight zero. These operators motivate us to define pre-groups and Novikov groups respectively as the induced structures. The tangent maps of these operators are shown to give Rota-Baxter and differential operators with weight zero on Lie algebras. The tangent spaces of the pre-Lie and Novikov Lie groups are pre-Lie algebras and Novikov Lie algebras, fulfilling the expected property. Furthermore, limit-weight relative Rota-Baxter operators on groups give rise to skew left braces and then set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study the space $C(\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{F}_q))$ of complex invariant functions on $\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$, through a Hopf algebra viewpoint. First, we consider a variant notion of Zelevinsky's PSH algebra defined over the real numbers $\mathbb{R}$. In particular, we show that two specific $\mathbb{R}$-lattices inside the complex Hopf algebra $\bigoplus_nC(\mathfrak{gl}_n(\mathbb{F}_q))$ are real PSH algebras, and that they do not descend to $\mathbb{Z}$. Then, among consequences, we prove that e</description>

      <title>Congruences of maximum regular subsemigroups of variants of finite full transformation semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $T_X$ be the full transformation monoid over a finite set $X$, and fix some $a\in T_X$ of rank $r$. The variant $T_X^a$ has underlying set $T_X$, and operation $f\star g=fag$. We study the congruences of the subsemigroup $P=Reg(T_X^a)$ consisting of all regular elements of $T_X^a$, and the lattice $Cong(P)$ of all such congruences. Our main structure theorem ultimately decomposes $Cong(P)$ as a specific subdirect product of $Cong(T_r)$ and the full equivalence relation lattices of certain combinatorial systems of subsets and partitions. We use this to give an explicit classification of the congruences themselves, and we also give a formula for the height of the lattice.</description>

      <title>Lattice theory of torsion classes: Beyond $\tau$-tilting theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01785</link>
      <description>arXiv:1711.01785v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to establish a lattice theoretical framework to study the partially ordered set $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} A$ of torsion classes over a finite-dimensional algebra $A$. We show that $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} A$ is a complete lattice which enjoys very strong properties, as bialgebraicity and complete semidistributivity. Thus its Hasse quiver carries the important part of its structure, and we introduce the brick labelling of its Hasse quiver and use it to study lattice congruences of $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} A$. In particular, we give a representation-theoretical interpretation of the so-called forcing order, and we prove that $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} A$ is completely congruence uniform. When $I$ is a two-sided ideal of $A$, $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} (A/I)$ is a lattice quotient of $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} A$ which is called an algebraic quotient, and the corresponding lattice congruence is called an algebraic congruence. The second part of this paper consists in studying algebraic congruences. We characterize the arrows of the Hasse quiver of $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} A$ that are contracted by an algebraic congruence in terms of the brick labelling. In the third part, we study in detail the case of preprojective algebras $\Pi$, for which $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} \Pi$ is the Weyl group endowed with the weak order. In particular, we give a new, more representation theoretical proof of the isomorphism between $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} k Q$ and the Cambrian lattice when $Q$ is a Dynkin quiver. We also prove that, in type $A$, the algebraic quotients of $\operatorname{\mathsf{tors}} \Pi$ are exactly its Hasse-regular lattice quotients.</description>

      <title>Gelfand-Tsetlin modules in the Coulomb context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.05415v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper gives a new perspective on the theory of principal Galois orders, as developed by Futorny, Ovsienko, Hartwig, and others. Every principal Galois order can be written as $eFe$ for any idempotent $e$ in an algebra $F$, which we call a flag Galois order; and in most important cases we can assume that these algebras are Morita equivalent. These algebras have the property that the completed algebra controlling the fiber over a maximal ideal has the same form as a subalgebra in a skew group ring, which gives a new perspective to a number of results about these algebras.
  We also discuss how this approach relates to the study of Coulomb branches in the sense of Braverman-Finkelberg-Nakajima, which are particularly beautiful examples of principal Galois orders. These include most of the interesting examples of principal Galois orders, such as $U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$. In this case, all the objects discussed have a geometric interpretation, which endows the category of Gelfand-Tsetlin modules with a graded lift and allows us to interpret the classes of simple Gelfand-Tsetlin modules in terms of dual canonical bases for the Grothendieck group. In particular, we classify the Gelfand-Tsetlin modules over $U(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ and relate their characters to a generalization of Leclerc's shuffle expansion for dual canonical basis vectors.
  Finally, as an application, we disprove a conjecture of Mazorchuk, showing that the fiber over a maximal ideal of the Gelfand-Tsetlin subalgebra appearing in a finite-dimensional representation has an infinite-dimensional module in its fiber for $n\geq 6$.</description>

Abstract: Zhang twists are a common tool for deforming graded algebras over a field in a way that preserves important ring-theoretic properties. We generalize Zhang twists to the setting of closed monoidal categories equipped with their self-enriched structure. Along the way, we prove several key results about algebraic structures in closed monoidal categories missing from the literature. We use these to ultimately prove Morita-type results, showcasing when graded algebras with equivalent categories of graded modules can be related by Zhang twists.</description>

Abstract: Given a noncommutative Hamiltonian space $A$, we show that the conjecture ``{\it quantization commutes with reduction}'' holds on $A$. We also construct a semi-product algebra $A \rtimes \mG^A$, equivariant sheaves on the representation space are related to left $A \rtimes \mG^A$-modules. In the quiver setting, via the quantum and classical trace maps, we establish the explicit correspondence between quantizations on a preprojective algebra and those on a quiver variety.</description>

Abstract: As a result of impressive research arXiv:2106.07231, D. Garc\'{\i}a-Lucas, \'{A}. del R\'{i}o and L. Margolis defined an infinite series of non-isomorphic $2$-groups $G$ and $H$, whose group algebras $\mathbb{F}G$ and $\mathbb{F}H$ over the field $\mathbb{F}=\mathbb{F}_2$ are isomorphic, solving negatively the long-standing Modular Isomorphism Problem (MIP). In this note we give a different perspective on their examples and show that they are special cases of a more general construction. We also show that this type of construction for $p&gt;2$ does not provide a similar counterexample to the MIP.</description>
