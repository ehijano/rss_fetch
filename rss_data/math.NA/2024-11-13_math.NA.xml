      <title>Multiple scales analysis of a nonlinear timestepping instability in simulations of solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The susceptibility of timestepping algorithms to numerical instabilities is an important consideration when simulating partial differential equations (PDEs). Here we identify and analyze a pernicious numerical instability arising in pseudospectral simulations of nonlinear wave propagation resulting in finite-time blow-up. The blow-up time scale is independent of the spatial resolution and spectral basis but sensitive to the timestepping scheme and the timestep size. The instability appears in multi-step and multi-stage implicit-explicit (IMEX) timestepping schemes of different orders of accuracy and has been found to manifest in simulations of soliton solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and traveling wave solutions of a nonlinear generalized Klein-Gordon equation. Focusing on the case of KdV solitons, we show that modal predictions from linear stability theory are unable to explain the instability because the spurious growth from linear dispersion is small and nonlinear sources of error growth converge too slowly in the limit of small timestep size. We then develop a novel multi-scale asymptotic framework that captures the slow, nonlinear accumulation of timestepping errors. The framework allows the solution to vary with respect to multiple time scales related to the timestep size and thus recovers the instability as a function of a slow time scale dictated by the order of accuracy of the timestepping scheme. We show that this approach correctly describes our simulations of solitons by making accurate predictions of the blow-up time scale and transient features of the instability. Our work demonstrates that studies of long-time simulations of nonlinear waves should exercise caution when validating their timestepping schemes.</description>

      <title>Parallelisation of partial differential equations via representation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A little utilised but fundamental fact is that if one discretises a partial differential equation using a symmetry-adapted basis corresponding to so-called irreducible representations, the basic building blocks in representational theory, then the resulting linear system can be completely decoupled into smaller independent linear systems. That is, representation theory can be used to trivially parallelise the numerical solution of partial differential equations. This beautiful theory is introduced via a crash course in representation theory aimed at its practical utilisation, its connection with decomposing expansions in polynomials into different symmetry classes, and give examples of solving Schr\"odinger's equation on simple symmetric geometries like squares and cubes where there is as much as four-fold increase in the number of independent linear systems, each of a significantly smaller dimension than results from standard bases.</description>

      <title>Impact of Numerical Fluxes on High Order Semidiscrete WENO-DeC Finite Volume Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical flux determines the performance of numerical methods for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs). In this work, we compare a selection of 8 numerical fluxes in the framework of nonlinear semidiscrete finite volume (FV) schemes, based on Weighted Essentially Non-Oscillatory (WENO) spatial reconstruction and Deferred Correction (DeC) time discretization. The methodology is implemented and systematically assessed for order of accuracy in space and time up to seven. The numerical fluxes selected in the present study represent the two existing classes of fluxes, namely centred and upwind. Centred fluxes do not explicitly use wave propagation information, while, upwind fluxes do so from the solution of the Riemann problem via a wave model containing $A$ waves. Upwind fluxes include two subclasses: complete and incomplete fluxes. For complete upwind fluxes, $A=E$, where $E$ is the number of characteristic fields in the exact problem. For incomplete upwind ones, $A&lt;E$. Our study is conducted for the one- and two-dimensional Euler equations, for which we consider the following numerical fluxes: Lax-Friedrichs (LxF), First-Order Centred (FORCE), Rusanov (Rus), Harten-Lax-van Leer (HLL), Central-Upwind (CU), Low-Dissipation Central-Upwind (LDCU), HLLC, and the flux computed through the exact Riemann solver (Ex.RS). We find that the numerical flux has an effect on the performance of the methods. The magnitude of the effect depends on the type of numerical flux and on the order of accuracy of the scheme. It also depends on the type of problem; that is, whether the solution is smooth or discontinuous, whether discontinuities are linear or nonlinear, whether linear discontinuities are fast- or slowly-moving, and whether the solution is evolved for short or long time.</description>

      <title>On properties and numerical computation of critical points of eigencurves of bivariate matrix pencils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate critical points of eigencurves of bivariate matrix pencils $A+\lambda B +\mu C$. Points $(\lambda,\mu)$ for which $\det(A+\lambda B+\mu C)=0$ form algebraic curves in $\mathbb C^2$ and we focus on points where $\mu'(\lambda)=0$. Such points are referred to as zero-group-velocity (ZGV) points, following terminology from engineering applications. We provide a general theory for the ZGV points and show that they form a subset (with equality in the generic case) of the 2D points $(\lambda_0,\mu_0)$, where $\lambda_0$ is a multiple eigenvalue of the pencil $(A+\mu_0 C)+\lambda B$, or, equivalently, there exist nonzero $x$ and $y$ such that $(A+\lambda_0 B+\mu_0 C)x=0$, $y^H(A+\lambda_0 B+\mu_0 C)=0$, and $y^HBx=0$.
  We introduce three numerical methods for computing 2D and ZGV points. The first method calculates all 2D (ZGV) points from the eigenvalues of a related singular two-parameter eigenvalue problem. The second method employs a projected regular two-parameter eigenvalue problem to compute either all eigenvalues or only a subset of eigenvalues close to a given target. The third approach is a locally convergent Gauss--Newton-type method that computes a single 2D point from an inital approximation, the later can be provided for all 2D points via the method of fixed relative distance by Jarlebring, Kvaal, and Michiels. In our numerical examples we use these methods to compute 2D-eigenvalues, solve double eigenvalue problems, determine ZGV points of a parameter-dependent quadratic eigenvalue problem, evaluate the distance to instability of a stable matrix, and find critical points of eigencurves of a two-parameter Sturm-Liouville problem.</description>

      <title>Application of MUSIC algorithm in real-world microwave imaging of unknown anomalies from scattering matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we consider MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC)-type algorithm for a non-iterative microwave imaging of small and arbitrary shaped extended anomalies located in a homogeneous media from scattering matrix whose elements are scattering parameters measured at dipole antennas. In order to explain the feasibility of MUSIC in microwave imaging, we investigate mathematical structure of MUSIC by establishing a relationship with an infinite series of Bessel function of integer order and antennas setting. This is based on the representation formula of scattering parameters in the presence of small anomalies and the application of Born approximation. Simulation results using real-data at $f=925$MHz of angular frequency are exhibited to show the feasibility of designed algorithm and to support investigated structure of imaging function.</description>

      <title>Goal oriented optimal design of infinite-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems using quadratic approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider goal-oriented optimal design of experiments for infinite-dimensional Bayesian linear inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). Specifically, we seek sensor placements that minimize the posterior variance of a prediction or goal quantity of interest. The goal quantity is assumed to be a nonlinear functional of the inversion parameter. We propose a goal-oriented optimal experimental design (OED) approach that uses a quadratic approximation of the goal-functional to define a goal-oriented design criterion. The proposed criterion, which we call the Gq-optimality criterion, is obtained by integrating the posterior variance of the quadratic approximation over the set of likely data. Under the assumption of Gaussian prior and noise models, we derive a closed-form expression for this criterion. To guide development of discretization invariant computational methods, the derivations are performed in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space setting. Subsequently, we propose efficient and accurate computational methods for computing the Gq-optimality criterion. A greedy approach is used to obtain Gq-optimal sensor placements. We illustrate the proposed approach for two model inverse problems governed by PDEs. Our numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. In particular, the proposed approach outperforms non-goal-oriented (A-optimal) and linearization-based (c-optimal) approaches.</description>

      <title>Rate of convergence for numerical $\alpha$-dissipative solutions of the Hunter-Saxton equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that $\alpha$-dissipative solutions to the Cauchy problem of the Hunter-Saxton equation, where $\alpha \in W^{1, \infty}(\mathbb{R}, [0, 1))$, can be computed numerically with order $\mathcal{O}(\Delta x^{{1}/{8}}+\Delta x^{{\beta}/{4}})$ in $L^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})$, provided there exist constants $C &gt; 0$ and $\beta \in (0, 1]$ such that the initial spatial derivative $\bar{u}_{x}$ satisfies $\|\bar{u}_x(\cdot + h) - \bar{u}_x(\cdot)\|_2 \leq Ch^{\beta}$ for all $h \in (0, 2]$. The derived convergence rate is exemplified by a number of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Explicit symmetric low-regularity integrators for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical approximation of low-regularity solutions to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation is notoriously difficult and even more so if structure-preserving schemes are sought. Recent works have been successful in establishing symmetric low-regularity integrators for this equation. However, so far, all prior symmetric low-regularity algorithms are fully implicit, and therefore require the solution of a nonlinear equation at each time step, leading to significant numerical cost in the iteration. In this work, we introduce the first fully explicit (multi-step) symmetric low-regularity integrators for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. We demonstrate the construction of an entire class of such schemes which notably can be used to symmetrise (in explicit form) a large amount of existing low-regularity integrators. We provide rigorous convergence analysis of our schemes and numerical examples demonstrating both the favourable structure preservation properties obtained with our novel schemes, and the significant reduction in computational cost over implicit methods.</description>

      <title>Filtered finite difference methods for nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations in semiclassical scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces filtered finite difference methods for numerically solving a dispersive evolution equation with solutions that are highly oscillatory in both space and time. We consider a semiclassically scaled nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with highly oscillatory initial data in the form of a modulated plane wave. The proposed methods do not need to resolve high-frequency oscillations in both space and time by prohibitively fine grids as would be required by standard finite difference methods. The approach taken here modifies traditional finite difference methods by incorporating appropriate filters. Specifically, we propose the filtered leapfrog and filtered Crank--Nicolson methods, both of which achieve second-order accuracy with time steps and mesh sizes that are not restricted in magnitude by the small semiclassical parameter. Furthermore, the filtered Crank--Nicolson method conserves both the discrete mass and a discrete energy. Numerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes face two primary challenges: constructing models for large datasets and selecting the optimal model. This master's thesis tackles these challenges in the low-dimensional case. We examine recent convergence results to identify models with optimal convergence rates and pinpoint essential parameters. Utilizing this model, we propose a Samplet-based approach to efficiently construct and train the Gaussian Processes, reducing the cubic computational complexity to a log-linear scale. This method facilitates optimal regression while maintaining efficient performance.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of counting solutions of stationary nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) when the PDE is known to admit more than one solution. We suggest tackling the problem via a sampling-based approach. We test our proposed methodology on the McKean-Vlasov PDE, more precisely on the problem of determining the number of stationary solutions of the McKean-Vlasov (or porous medium) equation.</description>

      <title>ADMM for Structured Fractional Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of structured fractional minimization problems, where the numerator includes a differentiable function, a simple nonconvex nonsmooth function, a concave nonsmooth function, and a convex nonsmooth function composed with a linear operator, while the denominator is a continuous function that is either weakly convex or has a weakly convex square root. These problems are widespread and span numerous essential applications in machine learning and data science. Existing methods are mainly based on subgradient methods and smoothing proximal gradient methods, which may suffer from slow convergence and numerical stability issues. In this paper, we introduce {\sf FADMM}, the first Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers tailored for this class of problems. {\sf FADMM} decouples the original problem into linearized proximal subproblems, featuring two variants: one using Dinkelbach's parametric method ({\sf FADMM-D}) and the other using the quadratic transform method ({\sf FADMM-Q}). By introducing a novel Lyapunov function, we establish that {\sf FADMM} converges to $\epsilon$-approximate critical points of the problem within an oracle complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon^{3})$. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world data for sparse Fisher discriminant analysis, robust Sharpe ratio minimization, and robust sparse recovery demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

      <title>Thermodynamic consistency and structure-preservation in summation by parts methods for the moist compressible Euler equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moist thermodynamics is a fundamental driver of atmospheric dynamics across all scales, making accurate modeling of these processes essential for reliable weather forecasts and climate change projections. However, atmospheric models often make a variety of inconsistent approximations in representing moist thermodynamics. These inconsistencies can introduce spurious sources and sinks of energy, potentially compromising the integrity of the models.
  Here, we present a thermodynamically consistent and structure preserving formulation of the moist compressible Euler equations. When discretised with a summation by parts method, our spatial discretisation conserves: mass, water, entropy, and energy. These properties are achieved by discretising a skew symmetric form of the moist compressible Euler equations, using entropy as a prognostic variable, and the summation-by-parts property of discrete derivative operators. Additionally, we derive a discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method with energy and tracer variance stable numerical fluxes, and experimentally verify our theoretical results through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>A preconditioned second-order convex splitting algorithm with a difference of varying convex functions and line search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a preconditioned convex splitting algorithm enhanced with line search techniques for nonconvex optimization problems. The algorithm utilizes second-order backward differentiation formulas (BDF) for the implicit and linear components and the Adams-Bashforth scheme for the nonlinear and explicit parts of the gradient flow in variational functions. The proposed algorithm, resembling a generalized difference-of-convex-function approach, involves a changing set of convex functions in each iteration. It integrates the Armijo line search strategy to improve performance. The study also discusses classical preconditioners such as symmetric Gauss-Seidel, Jacobi, and Richardson within this context. The global convergence of the algorithm is established through the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz properties, ensuring convergence within a finite number of preconditioned iterations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed second-order convex splitting with line search over conventional difference-of-convex-function algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Dielectric elastomers are increasingly studied for their potential in soft robotics, actuators, and haptic devices. Under time-dependent loading, they dissipate energy via viscous deformation and friction in electric polarization. However, most constitutive models and finite element (FE) implementations consider only mechanical dissipation because mechanical relaxation times are much larger than electric ones. Accounting for electric dissipation is crucial when dealing with alternating electric fields. Ghosh et al. (2021) proposed a fully coupled three-dimensional constitutive model for isotropic, incompressible dielectric elastomers. We critically investigate their numerical scheme for solving the initial boundary value problem (IBVP) describing the time-dependent behavior. We find that their fifth-order explicit Runge-Kutta time discretization may require excessively small or unphysical time steps for realistic simulations due to the stark contrast in mechanical and electric relaxation times. To address this, we present a stable implicit time-integration algorithm that overcomes these constraints. We implement this algorithm with a conforming FE discretization to solve the IBVP and present the mixed-FE formulation implemented in FEniCSx. We demonstrate that the scheme is robust, accurate, and capable of handling finite deformations, incompressibility, and general time-dependent loading. Finally, we validate our code against experimental data for VHB 4910 under complex time-dependent electromechanical loading, as studied by Hossain et al. (2015).</description>

      <title>A complex-projected Rayleigh quotient iteration for targeting interior eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02847v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new Projected Rayleigh Quotient Iteration aimed at improving the convergence behaviour of classic Rayleigh Quotient iteration (RQI) by incorporating approximate information about the target eigenvector at each step. While classic RQI exhibits local cubic convergence for Hermitian matrices, its global behaviour can be unpredictable, whereby it may converge to an eigenvalue far away from the target, even when started with accurate initial conditions. This problem is exacerbated when the eigenvalues are closely spaced. The key idea of the new algorithm is at each step to add a complex-valued projection to the original matrix (that depends on the current eigenvector approximation), such that the unwanted eigenvalues are lifted into the complex plane while the target stays close to the real line, thereby increasing the spacing between the target eigenvalue and the rest of the spectrum. Making better use of the eigenvector approximation leads to more robust convergence behaviour and the new method converges reliably to the correct target eigenpair for a significantly wider range of initial vectors than does classic RQI. We prove that the method converges locally cubically and we present several numerical examples demonstrating the improved global convergence behaviour. In particular, we apply it to compute eigenvalues in a band-gap spectrum of a Sturm-Liouville operator used to model photonic crystal fibres, where the target and unwanted eigenvalues are closely spaced. The examples show that the new method converges to the desired eigenpair even when the eigenvalue spacing is very small, often succeeding when classic RQI fails.</description>

      <title>A Power Method for Computing Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The singular value decomposition (SVD) allows to put a matrix as a product of three matrices: a matrix with the left singular vectors, a matrix with the positive-valued singular values and a matrix with the right singular vectors. There are two main approaches allowing to get the SVD result: the classical method and the randomized method. The analysis of the classical approach leads to accurate singular values. The randomized approach is especially used for high dimensional matrix and is based on the approximation accuracy without computing necessary all singular values. In this paper, the SVD computation is formalized as an optimization problem and a use of the gradient search algorithm. That results in a power method allowing to get all or the first largest singular values and their associated right vectors. In this iterative search, the accuracy on the singular values and the associated vector matrix depends on the user settings. Two applications of the SVD are the principal component analysis and the autoencoder used in the neural network models.</description>

      <title>Variational derivation and compatible discretizations of the Maxwell-GLM system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel variational derivation of the Maxwell-GLM system, which augments the original vacuum Maxwell equations via a generalized Lagrangian multiplier approach (GLM) by adding two supplementary acoustic subsystems and which was originally introduced by Munz et al. for purely numerical purposes in order to treat the divergence constraints of the magnetic and the electric field in the vacuum Maxwell equations within general-purpose and non-structure-preserving numerical schemes for hyperbolic PDE. Among the many mathematically interesting features of the model are: i) its symmetric hyperbolicity, ii) the extra conservation law for the total energy density and, most importantly, iii) the very peculiar combination of the basic differential operators, since both, curl-curl and div-grad combinations are mixed within this kind of system. A similar mixture of Maxwell-type and acoustic-type subsystems has recently been also forwarded by Buchman et al. in the context of a reformulation of the Einstein field equations of general relativity in terms of tetrads. This motivates our interest in this class of PDE, since the system is by itself very interesting from a mathematical point of view and can therefore serve as useful prototype system for the development of new structure-preserving numerical methods. Up to now, to the best of our knowledge, there exists neither a rigorous variational derivation of this class of hyperbolic PDE systems, nor do exactly energy-conserving and asymptotic-preserving schemes exist for them. The objectives of this paper are to derive the Maxwell-GLM system from an underlying variational principle, show its consistency with Hamiltonian mechanics and special relativity, extend it to the general nonlinear case and to develop new exactly energy-conserving and asymptotic-preserving finite volume schemes for its discretization.</description>

      <title>A dual-pairing summation-by-parts finite difference framework for nonlinear conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robust and stable high order numerical methods for solving partial differential equations are attractive because they are efficient on modern and next generation hardware architectures. However, the design of provably stable numerical methods for nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws pose a significant challenge. We present the dual-pairing (DP) and upwind summation-by-parts (SBP) finite difference (FD) framework for accurate and robust numerical approximations of nonlinear conservation laws. The framework has an inbuilt "limiter" whose goal is to detect and effectively resolve regions where the solution is poorly resolved and/or discontinuities are found. The DP SBP FD operators are a dual-pair of backward and forward FD stencils, which together preserve the SBP property. In addition, the DP SBP FD operators are designed to be upwind, that is they come with some innate dissipation everywhere, as opposed to traditional SBP and collocated discontinuous Galerkin spectral element methods which can only induce dissipation through numerical fluxes acting at element interfaces. We combine the DP SBP operators together with skew-symmetric and upwind flux splitting of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. Our semi-discrete approximation is provably entropy-stable for arbitrary nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws. The framework is high order accurate, provably entropy-stable, convergent, and avoids several pitfalls of current state-of-the-art high order methods. We give specific examples using the in-viscid Burger's equation, nonlinear shallow water equations and compressible Euler equations of gas dynamics. Numerical experiments are presented to verify accuracy and demonstrate the robustness of our numerical framework.</description>

      <title>A Block Coordinate Descent Method for Nonsmooth Composite Optimization under Orthogonality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.03641v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonsmooth composite optimization with orthogonality constraints is crucial in statistical learning and data science, but it presents challenges due to its nonsmooth objective and computationally expensive, non-convex constraints. In this paper, we propose a new approach called \textbf{OBCD}, which leverages Block Coordinate Descent (BCD) to address these challenges. \textbf{OBCD} is a feasible method with a small computational footprint. In each iteration, it updates $k$ rows of the solution matrix, where $k \geq 2$, while globally solving a small nonsmooth optimization problem under orthogonality constraints. We prove that \textbf{OBCD} converges to block-$k$ stationary points, which offer stronger optimality than standard critical points. Notably, \textbf{OBCD} is the first greedy descent method with monotonicity for this problem class. Under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz (KL) inequality, we establish strong limit-point convergence. We also extend \textbf{OBCD} with breakpoint searching methods for subproblem solving and greedy strategies for working set selection. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach across various tasks.</description>

      <title>Signal reconstruction using determinantal sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09437v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the approximation of a square-integrable function from a finite number of evaluations on a random set of nodes according to a well-chosen distribution. This is particularly relevant when the function is assumed to belong to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This work proposes to combine several natural finite-dimensional approximations based two possible probability distributions of nodes. These distributions are related to determinantal point processes, and use the kernel of the RKHS to favor RKHS-adapted regularity in the random design. While previous work on determinantal sampling relied on the RKHS norm, we prove mean-square guarantees in $L^2$ norm. We show that determinantal point processes and mixtures thereof can yield fast convergence rates. Our results also shed light on how the rate changes as more smoothness is assumed, a phenomenon known as superconvergence. Besides, determinantal sampling generalizes i.i.d. sampling from the Christoffel function which is standard in the literature. More importantly, determinantal sampling guarantees the so-called instance optimality property for a smaller number of function evaluations than i.i.d. sampling.</description>

      <title>A comparison of different approaches to compute surface tension contribution in incompressible two-phase flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04670v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a quantitative assessment of different strategies to compute the contribution due to surface tension in incompressible two-phase flows using a conservative level set (CLS) method. More specifically, we compare classical approaches, such as the direct computation of the curvature from the level set or the Laplace-Beltrami operator, with an evolution equation for the mean curvature recently proposed in literature. We consider the test case of a static bubble, for which an exact solution for the pressure jump across the interface is available, and the test case of an oscillating bubble, showing pros and cons of the different approaches.</description>

      <title>Deterministic particle method for nonlinear nonlocal scalar balance equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a deterministic particle scheme to solve a scalar balance equation with nonlocal interaction and nonlinear mobility used to model congested dynamics. The main novelty with respect to "Radici-Stra [SIAM J. Math. Anal. 55.3 (2023)]" is the presence of a source term; this causes the solutions to no longer be probability measures, thus requiring a suitable adaptation of the numerical scheme and of the estimates leading to compactness.</description>
