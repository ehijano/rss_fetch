      <title>Dispersion Interaction Between Thin Conducting Cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ground state and excited state resonance dipole-dipole interaction energy between two elongated conducting molecules are explored. We review the current status for ground state interactions. This interaction is found to be of a much longer range than in the case when the molecules are pointlike and nonconducting. These are well known results found earlier by Davies, Ninham, and Richmond, and later, using a different formalism, by Rubio and co-workers. We show how the theory can be extended to excited state interactions. A characteristic property following from our calculation is that the interaction energy dependence with separation ($R$) goes like $f(R)/R^2$ both for resonance and for the van der Waals case in the long range limit. In some limits $f(R)$ has a logarithmic dependency and in others it takes constant values. We predict an unusual slow decay rate for the energy transfer between conducting molecules.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion blinking from the conical phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the transition between skyrmionic and non-topological states has been widely explored as a bit operation for information transport and storage in spintronic devices, the ultrafast dynamics of such transitions remains challenging to observe and understand. Here, we utilize spin-dynamics simulations and harmonic transition state theory (HTST) to provide an in-depth analysis of the nucleation of skyrmionic states in helimagnets. We reveal a persistent blinking (creation-annihilation) phenomenon of these topological states under specific conditions near the phase boundary between skyrmion and conical states. Through a minimum-energy path analysis, we elucidate that this blinking behavior is favored by the formation of chiral bobber (CB) surface states and that the collapse of CBs differs from that of skyrmions in thin films due to their different oscillation modes. We further employ HTST to estimate the typical blinking time as a function of the applied magnetic field and temperature. Finally, we illustrate the practical use of skyrmion blinking for controlled probabilistic computing, exemplified by a skyrmion-based random-number generator.</description>

      <title>Topological linear response of hyperbolic Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a connection between the electromagnetic Hall response and band topological invariants in hyperbolic Chern insulators by deriving a hyperbolic analog of the Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-den Nijs (TKNN) formula. By generalizing the Kubo formula to hyperbolic lattices, we show that the Hall conductivity is quantized to $-e^2C_{ij}/h$, where $C_{ij}$ is the first Chern number. Through a flux-threading argument, we provide an interpretation of the Chern number as a topological invariant in hyperbolic band theory. We demonstrate that, although it receives contributions from both Abelian and non-Abelian Bloch states, the Chern number can be calculated solely from Abelian states, resulting in a tremendous simplification of the topological band theory. Finally, we verify our results numerically by computing various Chern numbers in the hyperbolic Haldane model.</description>

      <title>Detection of Quantized Vortices using Fourth Sound Attenuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superfluid helium confined to nanofluidic systems is emerging as an important system for studies of two-dimensional turbulence and as the basis for novel quantum technologies. In fully enclosed nanofluidic geometries only the fourth sound can propagate, which we show can be used for probing quantized vortices pinned in well-defined slab geometry. We show that similarly to well-established second sound attenuation, fourth sound attenuation can be used to infer the number of quantized vortices in a unit area. We experimentally verify fourth sound attenuation as a probe of vortex line density by injecting a known number of quantized vortices into a nanofluidic slab using a rotating cryostat.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of buoyancy induced arrest of viscous coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effect of buoyant forces on viscous coarsening is studied numerically. It is shown that at any time buoyant forces induce a vertical flow that scales like the Stokes velocity. This does no induce any noticeable change in the morphology of the coarsening microstructure under a value of the characteristic length of the pattern. Above this threshold the pattern evolves toward a quasi two D pattern and coarsening stops. The characteristic length is shown to scale like $\sqrt{\gamma/(g \Delta\rho)}$ where $\gamma$ is he surface tension and $\Delta\rho$ the mass dnsiy difference between the phases.</description>

      <title>Bang-bang preparation of quantum many-body ground states in two dimensions: optimization of the algorithm with a two-dimensional tensor network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09158v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A bang-bang (BB) algorithm prepares the ground state of a two-dimensional (2D) quantum many-body Hamiltonian $H=H_1+H_2$ by evolving an initial product state alternating between $H_1$ and $H_2$. We use the neighborhood tensor update to simulate the BB evolution with an infinite pair-entangled projected state (iPEPS). The alternating sequence is optimized with the final energy as a cost function. The energy is calculated with the tangent space methods for the sake of their stability.
  The method is benchmarked in the 2D transverse field quantum Ising model near its quantum critical point against a ground state obtained by variational optimization of the iPEPS. The optimal BB sequence differs non-perturbatively from a sequence simulating quantum annealing or adiabatic preparation (AP) of the ground state. The optimal BB energy converges with the number of bangs much faster than the optimal AP energy.</description>

      <title>Manipulating the Relaxation Time of Boundary-Dissipative Systems through Bond Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxation time plays a crucial role in describing the relaxation processes of quantum systems. We study the effect of a type of bond dissipation on the relaxation time of boundary dissipative systems and find that it can change the scaling of the relaxation time $T_c\sim L^{z}$ from $z=3$ to a value significantly less than $3$. We further reveal that the reason such bond dissipation can significantly reduce the relaxation time is that it can selectively target specific states. For Anderson localized systems, the scaling behavior of the relaxation time changes from an exponential form to a power-law form as the system size varies. This is because the bond dissipation we consider can not only select specific states but also disrupt the localization properties. Our work reveals that in open systems, one type of dissipation can be used to regulate the effects produced by another type of dissipation.</description>
