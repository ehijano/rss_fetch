      <title>Hall transport in the topological non-Hermitian checkerboard lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The checkerboard lattice is a two-dimensional non-trivial structure usually seen as a planar version of the pyrochlore lattice. This geometry supports a two-band insulating electronic system with Chern topology induced by a complex hoppping parameter. Inspired by the recent advances in the topology of non-Hermitian systems, in this work we study a non-Hermitian version of the topological checkerboard lattice. The complex band structure and Berry curvature are calculated. In the insulating phase, the Chern number is the same as in the Hermitian version, but the Hall conductivity is no longer quantized. The dependence of the Hall conductivity with the non-Hermitian parameters is investigated. The non-Hermiticity can be seen as a result of dissipation caused by coupling the system to the environment, so this study casts light on the topology of open systems in condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Photon counting statistics in Gaussian bosonic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistics of transmitted photons in microwave cavities play a foundational role in microwave quantum optics and its technological applications. By utilizing quantum mechanical phase-space methods, we here develop a general theory of the photon counting statistics in Gaussian bosonic networks consisting of driven cavities with beamsplitter interactions and two-mode-squeezing. The dynamics of the network can be captured by a Lyapunov equation for the covariance matrix of the cavity fields, which generalizes to a Riccati equation, when counting fields are included. By solving the Riccati equation, we obtain the statistics of emitted and absorbed photons as well as the time-dependent correlations encoded in waiting time distributions and second-order coherence functions. To illustrate our theoretical framework, we first apply it to a simple linear network consisting of two coupled cavities, for which we evaluate the photon cross-correlations and discuss connections between the photon emission statistics and the entanglement between the cavities. We then consider a bosonic circulator consisting of three coupled cavities, for which we investigate how a synthetic flux may affect the direction of the photon flow, similarly to recent experiments. Our general framework paves the way for systematic investigations of the photon counting statistics in Gaussian bosonic networks.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation and Analysis of Low-Energy Magnons with Raman Spectroscopy in Atomically Thin NiPS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnets have rapidly emerged as a fertile playground for novel fundamental physics and exciting applications. Despite the impressive developments over the past few years, technical limitations pose a severe challenge to many other potential breakthroughs. High on the list is the lack of suitable experimental tools for studying spin dynamics on atomically thin samples. Here, Raman scattering techniques are employed to observe directly the low-lying magnon (~1 meV) even in bilayer NiPS3. The unique advantage is that it offers excellent energy resolutions far better on low-energy sides than most inelastic neutron spectrometers can offer. More importantly, with appropriate theoretical analysis, the polarization dependence of the Raman scattering by those low-lying magnons also provides otherwise hidden information on the dominant spin-exchange scattering paths for different magnons. By comparing with high-resolution inelastic neutron scattering data, these low-energy Raman modes are confirmed to be indeed of magnon origin. Because of the different scattering mechanisms involved in inelastic neutron and Raman scattering, this new information is fundamental in pinning down the final spin Hamiltonian. This work demonstrates the capability of Raman spectroscopy to probe the genuine two-dimensional spin dynamics in atomically-thin vdW magnets, which can provide novel insights that are obscured in bulk spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Strain-tunable magnetic and magnonic states in Ni-dihalide monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monolayer NiI$_2$ garners large research interest due to its multiferroic behavior stemming from the interplay between its non-collinear magnetic order and the spin-orbit coupling. This prompts an investigation into the stability of the magnetic order in NiI$_2$ and similar materials under external stimuli. In this work, we report the effect of biaxial and uniaxial strain on the magnetic ground state, the critical temperature, and the magnonic properties of the NiX$_2$ (X = I, Br, Cl) monolayers. For all three materials, we reveal intricate strain-dependent phase diagrams, including ferromagnetic, helimagnetic, and skyrmionic phases. Moreover, we discuss the necessity of considering the biquadratic exchange interaction in the latter analysis. We reveal that the biquadratic exchange significantly alters both the magnetic ground state and the critical temperature of the magnetic order, and we demonstrate that its importance becomes even more explicit when monolayer Ni-dihalides are strained. Finally, we calculate the magnonic dispersion for the predicted magnetic states, showing that the skyrmionic phase functions as a magnonic crystal, and demonstrate the presence of strain-tunable soft magnon modes at finite wavevectors in the helimagnetic phase.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Order Parameters in Spin Space Groups: Methodology and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a systematic approach to construct superconducting order parameters based on the spin space group. Compared to magnetic space groups where spatial and spin rotation of elements are completely locked, the superconducting channels and the forms of basis functions in spin space groups can be different. Furthermore, we utilize the obtained basis functions to construct the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and show the possible superconducting ground states. By virtue of those results, we discuss the application of our theory to realistic systems. Our work provides a rigorous description of superconducting gap functions in the case of spin space group, and enables further study of the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of memristive devices offers a promising avenue for efficient and scalable analog computing, particularly for linear algebra operations essential in various scientific and engineering applications. This paper investigates the potential of memristive crossbars in implementing matrix inversion algorithms. We explore both static and dynamic approaches, emphasizing the advantages of analog and in-memory computing for matrix operations beyond multiplication. Our results demonstrate that memristive arrays can significantly reduce computational complexity and power consumption compared to traditional digital methods for certain matrix tasks. Furthermore, we address the challenges of device variability, precision, and scalability, providing insights into the practical implementation of these algorithms.</description>

      <title>Detecting winding and Chern numbers in topological matter using spectral function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to directly probe bulk topological quantum numbers in topological matter by measuring the momentum-space single-particle spectral function (SPSF). Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can detect SPSF and is often used to determine the bulk band structure of quantum materials. Here, we show that while one part of the momentum-space SPSF gives band structure, it also contains the knowledge of winding and Chern numbers of various topological materials. For this, we derive SPSF in three different models of topological systems, such as the Kitaev model of topological superconductors, the long-range Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and the Qi-Wu-Zhang model and explain how to extract the winding or Chern numbers in different topological phases from the SPSF. Such information from SPSF seems experimentally accessible due to the recent advancement of ARPES and scanning tunneling spectroscopy techniques.</description>

      <title>Manifestation of Luttinger liquid effects in a hybrid metal-semiconductor double-quantum dot device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the transport properties of a hybrid nanodevice comprised of two large metallic islands incorporated in a two-dimensional electron gas. The high-tunability of the conducting channels electrically connecting two islands to the leads allows us to treat the setup as a realization of a multi-channel two-site charge Kondo (2SCK) model. It is shown that the leading temperature dependence of the conductance in the 2SCK circuit satisfies the conductance scaling of a single-impurity problem in a Luttinger liquid, whose interaction parameter is fully determined by the number of conducting channels in the device. We demonstrate that the finite weak backscattering in all conducting channels features the appearance of the subleading temperature dependencies in linear conductance. At the special critical point, we predict an equivalency between the 2SCK nanodevice and a single-site two-channel charge Kondo problem, where one Kondo channel is implemented by a non-interacting electron gas and the second Kondo channel is attributed to the Luttinger liquid.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field dependence of the atomic and electronic structure of monovalent metallic nanocontacts unveiled in transport experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure Au and Ag atomic-size contacts in magnetic fields, from zero field to 20 T. We find a magnetic field induced torque which leads to atomic binding at shorter distances than at zero field. Furthermore, the conductance drops below $G_0$ at high magnetic fields by about 15\% in Au. We calculate the conduction through nanosized Au contacts containing residual $O_2$ molecules attached to the contact region and find a spin polarized current when $O_2$ is located at the atomic contact. We discuss the role of spin-orbit coupling in the magnetic properties of $O_2$ attached to Au.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Two-dimensional Weyl Fermions in Air-Stable Monolayer PtTe$_{1.75}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weyl semimetals represent a distinct category of topological materials wherein the low-energy excitations appear as the long-sought Weyl fermions. Exotic transport and optical properties are expected because of the chiral anomaly and linear energy-momentum dispersion. While three-dimensional Weyl semimetals have been successfully realized, the quest for their two-dimensional (2D) counterparts is ongoing. Here, we report the realization of 2D Weyl fermions in monolayer PtTe$_{1.75}$, which has strong spin-orbit coupling and lacks inversion symmetry, by combined angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, scanning tunneling microscopy, second harmonic generation, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, and first-principles calculations. The giant Rashba splitting and band inversion lead to the emergence of three pairs of critical Weyl cones. Moreover, monolayer PtTe$_{1.75}$ exhibits excellent chemical stability in ambient conditions, which is critical for future device applications. The discovery of 2D Weyl fermions in monolayer PtTe$_{1.75}$ opens up new possibilities for designing and fabricating novel spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Electric dipole spin resonance with linear and cubic spin-orbit interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the electric dipole spin resonance (EDSR) with using the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) in GaAs and Ge based quantum dots formed in a quantum well. We use Schrieffer-Wolff transformation and rotating frame to derive the effective Hamiltonian of EDSR. We treat the couplings of the orbital motion with the environment with Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation. We found that the cubic SOI makes the Rabi frequency non-linear with the applied microwave amplitude. At the same time, the fidelity of the spin manipulations becomes worse since the residual spin-orbital couplings induces spin relaxation.</description>

      <title>In Situ Growth of Copper Channels within CuCl and PVDF Composite for Durable WORM Device Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study details the creation of a Write Once-Read Many (WORM) memory device utilizing cuprous chloride (CuCl) and poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (PVDF-HFP) polymers. Employing an in-plane configuration, a deliberate 1:10 ratio of CuCl to PVDF-HFP has been selected. This ratio aims to establish an in-situ copper channel within the device. The electrical response exhibits consistent memory retention over an extended duration. The WORM characteristics are attributed to the development of multiple conducting filaments or a highly conductive percolative path created by Cu ions within the polymer matrix. The UV-Vis study also reinforces the obtained results. Additionally, the memristor undergoes specific poling and cooling conditions. The fabrication approach employed in this research yields a distinctive type of Resistive Switching Device (RSD). Once the device is activated, it maintains its state even after the applied field is reduced. This specialized device holds potential applications in Compact Disc-Recordable (CD-R), Digital Versatile Disc-Recordable (DVD-R), Blu-ray Disc Recordable (BD-R), and Write Once USB Drives.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral electromechanical imaging at the nanoscale: Dynamical backaction, dissipation and quantum fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a new scanning nanomechanical noise microscopy platform enabling to both heat and acquire the fluctuations of mechanical nanostructures with nanometric resolution. We use this platform to image the thermally activated nanomechanical dynamics of a model system consisting of a $40\,\mathrm{nm}$ diameter single-defect nanowire, while scanning a localized heat source across its surface. We develop a thermal backaction model, which we use to demonstrate a close connection between the structure of the nanowire, its thermal response, its dissipation and its fluctuations. We notably show that the defect behaves as a single fluctuation hub, whose e-beam excitation yields a far off-equilibrium vibrational state, largely dominated by the quantum fluctuations of the heating source. Our platform is of interest for future quantitative investigation of fundamental nanoscale dynamical phenomena, and appears as a new playground for investigating quantum thermodynamics in the strongly dissipative regime and at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Second Order Spin Current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, nonlinear Hall effect has attracted great attention with three different terms contributed by Drude effect, Berry curvature dipole and Berry connection polarizability. In this work, we theoretically predict an intrinsic second order spin current induced by spin-dependent Berry curvature polarizability based on time-independent perturbation theory. And we show other two second order spin conductivities contributed by the group velocity and spin-dependent Berry curvature dipole. A two-dimensional Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupled system is studied as an example, and the value of intrinsic spin conductivity exhibits a maximum at zero chemical potential $\mu$ and decreases rapidly with increasing $\mu$; while the extrinsic contribution remains unchanged in the region of $\mu \geqslant 0$. Thus, the dependence of spin conductivity on chemical potential is expected to distinguish the extrinsic and intrinsic contributions experimentally. Our calculation provides a theoretical basis for understanding the nonlinear spin transport.</description>

      <title>Origin of Robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Phases in Stacked Hermitian Systems: Non-Hermitian Level Repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators, which possess a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase, have attracted great attention for two decades. It is generally believed that when an even number of layers of the quantum spin Hall insulators are stacked, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase becomes unstable due to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ nature. While several researchers report counterexamples of the instability, there is no systematic understanding. In this work, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase is robust against the stacking if it has an additional chiral symmetry, in terms of the level repulsion in the corresponding non-Hermitian system. We demonstrate this by mapping a one-dimensional class DIII superconductor with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology to the corresponding non-Hermitian system in AII$^\dagger$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topology.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effects under nonlinearity of eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Band structures of metamaterials described by a nonlinear eigenvalue problem are beyond the existing topological band theory. In this paper, we analyze non-Hermitian topology under the nonlinearity of eigenvalues. Specifically, we elucidate that such nonlinear systems may exhibit exceptional points and non-Hermitian skin effects which are unique non-Hermitian topological phenomena. The robustness of these non-Hermitian phenomena is clarified by introducing the topological invariants under nonlinearity which reproduce the existing ones in linear systems. Furthermore, our analysis elucidates that exceptional points may emerge even for systems without an internal degree of freedom where the equation is single component. These nonlinearity-induced exceptional points are observed in mechanical metamaterials, e.g., the Kapitza pendulum.</description>

      <title>Strained topological insulator spin-orbit torque random access memory (STI-SOTRAM) bit cell for energy-efficient Processing in Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel design of a strained topological insulator spin-orbit torque random access memory (STI-SOTRAM) bit cell comprising a piezoelectric/magnet (gating)/topological insulator (TI)/magnet (storage) heterostructure that leverages the TI's high charge-to-spin conversion efficiency coupled with the piezo-induced strain-based gating mechanism for low-power in-memory computing. The piezo-induced strain effectively modulates the conductivity of the topological surface state (TSS) by altering the gating magnet's magnetization from out-to-in-plane, facilitating the storage magnet's spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching. Through comprehensive coupled stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) simulations, we explore the device dynamics, anisotropy-stress phase space for switching, and write conditions and demonstrate a significant reduction in energy dissipation compared to conventional heavy metal (HM)-based SOT switching. Additionally, we project the energy consumption for in-memory Boolean operations (AND and OR). Our findings suggest the promise of the STI-SOTRAM for low-power, high-performance edge computing.</description>

      <title>Local analysis of a single impurity on a graphene Josephson Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the local effects of a single short-range impurity on the electron system of a short ballistic graphene Josephson Junction. Within the Dirac-Bogoliubov-De Gennes approach, we systematically analyze the local density states, whose subgap energy dependence enables us to distinguish between elastic and inelastic scattering processes and identify the magnetic nature of the impurity. Furthermore, we observe that the spatial dependence of the local density of states is a sensitive probe of the microscopic processes resulting in subgap impurity-induced bound states. The Fourier analysis evidences the wavevectors related to the momenta of the high transmissive channels in ballistic graphene.</description>

      <title>Thermal Effects on Damping Determination of Perpendicular MRAM Devices by Spin-Torque Ferromagnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report device level damping measurements using spin-torque driven ferromagnetic resonance on perpendicular magnetic random-access memory (MRAM) cells. It is shown that thermal agitation enhances the apparent damping for cells smaller than about 55 nm. The effect is fundamental and does not reflect a true damping increase. In addition to the thermal effect, it is still found that device level damping is higher than film level damping and increases with decreasing cell size. This is attributed to edge damage caused by device patterning.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic Dielectric Response due to Domain Wall Motion in Ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BaTiO$_3$ (BTO) is a prototypical perovskite ferroelectric, whose dielectric permittivity and loss spectra -- which are strongly temperature and frequency dependent -- include contributions from inhomogeneous polarization patterns, with polar domain walls (DWs) being the most common types. In order to elucidate how DWs influence dielectric response, we utilized a continuum approach based on the Landau-Ginzburg theory to model field-dependent properties of polydomain tetragonal phase of BTO near room temperature and above. A system with 180$^\circ$ DWs was evaluated as a case study, with both position-resolved and volume-averaged dielectric susceptibility and loss computed at different temperatures for a range of applied field frequencies and amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that cooperative dipole fluctuations in the vicinity of the DW provide a large (extrinsic) contribution to the system dielectric response relative to the intrinsic contribution stemming from within the domain. Dynamics of the DW profile fluctuations under applied field can be represented by a combination of breathing and sliding vibrational motions, with each exhibiting distinct dependence on the field frequency and amplitude. The implications of this behavior are important for understanding and improving control of coupled functional properties in ferroelectric materials, including their dielectric, electromechanical, and electrooptical responses. Furthermore, this investigation provides a computational benchmark for future studies and can be readily extended to other topological polarization patterns in ferroelectrics.</description>

      <title>Giant strain-induced spin splitting effect in MnTe, a $g$-wave altermagnetic semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hexagonal MnTe is an altermagnetic semiconductor with $g$-wave symmetry of spin polarization in momentum space. In the nonrelativistic limit, this symmetry mandates that electric current flowing in any crystallographic direction is unpolarized. However, it is shown that elastic strain is effective in inducing the spin splitting effect in MnTe. For this analysis, a spin-orbit-coupled $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian for the valence band maximum at the A point is derived and fitted to eigenvalues calculated from first principles. The spin splitting angle is calculated using the Boltzmann approach in the relaxation-time approximation. The spin splitting gauge factor exceeds 20 near the valence band maximum. Thus, with suitable substrate engineering, MnTe can be used as an efficient source and detector of spin current in spintronic devices. Proper inclusion of the Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling is crucial for the correct description of the transport properties of MnTe.</description>

      <title>Building spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chains with diaza-nanographenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and engineering the coupling of spins in nanomaterials is of central importance for designing novel devices. Graphene nanostructures with {\pi}-magnetism offer a chemically tunable platform to explore quantum magnetic interactions. However, realizing spin chains bearing controlled odd-even effects with suitable nanographene systems is challenging. Here, we demonstrate the successful on-surface synthesis of spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chains with parity-dependent magnetization based on antiaromatic diaza-hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (diaza-HBC) units. Using distinct synthetic strategies, two types of spin chains with different terminals were synthesized, both exhibiting a robust odd-even effect on the spin coupling along the chain. Combined investigations using scanning tunneling microscopy, non-contact atomic force microscopy, density functional theory calculations, and quantum spin models confirmed the structures of the diaza-HBC chains and revealed their magnetic properties, which has an S = 1/2 spin per unit through electron donation from the diaza-HBC core to the Au(111) substrate. Gapped excitations were observed in even-numbered chains, while enhanced Kondo resonance emerged in odd-numbered units of odd-numbered chains due to the redistribution of the unpaired spin along the chain. Our findings provide an effective strategy to construct nanographene spin chains and unveil the odd-even effect in their magnetic properties, offering potential applications in nanoscale spintronics.</description>

      <title>Double-side Integration of the Fluorinated Self-Assembling Monolayers for Enhanced Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traps and structural defects at the hole and electron transport interfaces of the microcrystalline absorber limits the efficiency and long-term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to accumulation of the ionic clusters, non-radiative recombination and electrochemical corrosion. Surface engineering using self-assembled monolayers (SAM) was considered as an effective strategy for modification of charge-collection junctions. In this work, we demonstrate the first report about complex integration of a SAM for double-side passivation in p-i-n PSCs. Integrating the novel 5-(4-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)amino]phenyl)thiophene-2-carboxylic acid (FTPATC) as a fluorinated SAM at the hole-transport interface reduced potential barriers and lattice stresses in the absorber. At the electron-transport side, FTPATC interacted with the A-site cations of the perovskite molecule (Cs, formamidinium), inducing a dipole for defect compensation. Using the passivation approach with fluorinated SAM demonstrated benefits in the gain of the output performance up to 22.2%. The key-advantage of double-side passivation was confirmed by the enhanced stability under continuous light-soaking (1-sun equivalent, 65 C, ISOS-L-2), maintaining 88% of the initial performance over 1680 hours and thermal stabilization under harsh heating at 90 C.</description>

Abstract: Effective axion fields in condensed matter and photonics are manifested as $\mathcal{P}$- and $\mathcal{T}$-odd contributions to the electromagnetic response. Here, we show that the phenomena previously attributed to the effective axion fields have two distinct physical origins. One of them corresponds to the standard axion electrodynamics, while another provides its dual-symmetric version having the same symmetry and featuring similar but distinguishable optical properties. We present an example system described by the dual-symmetric modification of axion electrodynamics, derive the key predictions and pinpoint experimentally observable distinctions between the two versions of axion-type response.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Radiation Hardness of InAs/GaAs Quantum Dot Lasers for Space Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor lasers have great potential for space laser communication. However, excessive radiation in space can cause laser failure. Quantum dot (QD) lasers are more resistant to radiation compared to quantum well (QW) and bulk lasers due to better carrier confinement and a smaller active region. Therefore, it is crucial to find the most radiation-tolerant QD structures and compare the radiation tolerance of QD and QW structures at different radiation fluences where the QDs can show their advantages in the best way. Proton and 60Co {\gamma}-ray radiation tests were conducted on different InAs/GaAs QD and InGaAs/GaAs QW materials and devices. The results show that the QD samples were more radiation-tolerant than QW samples within a certain fluence range, and more radiation-tolerant QD structures were identified. Dislocations were found near the QWs but not the QDs after 1 x 1011 cm-2 radiation. Defects were created in all samples after 7 x 1013 cm-2 proton radiation. Additionally, 60Co {\gamma}-rays radiation tests ranging from 10 to 12000 Gy were conducted, and all the samples exhibited good tolerance to total radiation dose effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum materials with stacking van der Waals (vdW) layers that can host non-trivial band structure topology and magnetism have shown many interesting properties. Here using high-throughput density functional theory calculations, we design and predict tetragonal vdW-layered quantum materials in the MPd$_5$I$_2$ structure (M=Ga, In and 3d transition metals). Our study shows that besides the known AlPd$_5$I$_2$, the -MPd$_5$- structural motif of three-layer slabs separated by two I layers can host a variety of metal elements giving arise to topological interesting features and highly tunable magnetic properties in both bulk and single layer 2D structures. Among them, TiPd$_5$I$_2$ and InPd$_5$I$_2$ host a pair of Dirac points and a likely strong topological insulator state for the band manifolds just above and below the top valence band, respectively, with their single layers possibly hosting quantum spin Hall states. CrPd$_5$I$_2$ is a ferromagnet with a large out-of-plane magneto-anisotropy energy, desirable for rare-earth-free permanent magnets.</description>

      <title>Tunable viscous layers in Corbino geometry using density junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In sufficiently clean materials where electron-electron interactions are strong compared to momentum-relaxing scattering processes, electron transport resembles the flow of a viscous fluid. We study hydrodynamic electron transport across density interfaces (n-n junctions) in a 2DEG in the Corbino geometry. From numerical simulations in COMSOL using realistic parameters, we show that we can produce tunable viscous layers at the density interface by varying the density ratio of charge carriers. We quantitatively explain this observation with simple analytic expressions together with boundary conditions at the interface. We also show signatures of these viscous layers in the magnetoresistance. Breaking down viscous and ohmic contributions, we find that when outer radial region of the Corbino has higher charge density compared to the inner region, the viscous layers at the interface serve to suppress the magneto-resistance produced by momentum-relaxing scattering. Conversely, the magneto-resistance is enhanced when the inner region has higher density than the outer. Our results add to the repertoire of techniques for engineering viscous electron flows, which hold a promise for applications in future electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Mapping a 50-spin-qubit network through correlated sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spins associated to optically accessible solid-state defects have emerged as a versatile platform for exploring quantum simulation, quantum sensing and quantum communication. Pioneering experiments have shown the sensing, imaging, and control of multiple nuclear spins surrounding a single electron-spin defect. However, the accessible size of these spin networks has been constrained by the spectral resolution of current methods. Here, we map a network of 50 coupled spins through high-resolution correlated sensing schemes, using a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. We develop concatenated double-resonance sequences that identify spin-chains through the network. These chains reveal the characteristic spin frequencies and their interconnections with high spectral resolution, and can be fused together to map out the network. Our results provide new opportunities for quantum simulations by increasing the number of available spin qubits. Additionally, our methods might find applications in nano-scale imaging of complex spin systems external to the host crystal.</description>
