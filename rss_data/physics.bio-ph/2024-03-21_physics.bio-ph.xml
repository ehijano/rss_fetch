      <title>A Machine Learning Approach for Multiscale Modeling of the Facet Capsular Ligament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new neural network architecture that strictly enforces constitutive constraints such as polyconvexity, frame-indifference, zero strain energy with zero deformations, and the symmetry of the stress and material stiffness. Additionally, we show that for this neural network, the accuracy is significantly improved by using a Sobolev minimization strategy that includes derivative terms. Using our network and Sobolev minimization, we obtain a NMSE of 0.15% for the energy, 0.815% averaged across the components of the stress, and 5.4% averaged across the components of the stiffness. This machine learned constitutive model was deployed in a finite element simulation of a facet capsular ligament. The displacement fields and stress-strain curves where compared to a multiscale simulation that required running on a GPU based supercomputer. At 70% strain, the model using the neural network had less than 10% relative error in the mean stress value.</description>

      <title>Link Node: A Method to Characterize the Chain Topology of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that intrinsically disordered proteins (IDP) are highly dynamic, which is related to their functionality in various biological processes. However, the characterization of the intricate structures of IDP has been a challenge. Here, we analyze the chain topology of IDPs to characterize their conformations, in combination with molecular dynamics simulation (MD). We systematically compute the Gauss Linking Number ($GLN$) between segments in IDP, and show that the resulting GLN Map can effectively depict an unconventional structure -- physical link, i.e., the entanglement between two segments. The crossing points of physical links are further identified and denoted as Link Nodes. We show that the probability distribution of Link Nodes is highly heterogeneous and there are certain residues that largely affect the chain topology of IDP. Moreover, the structural fluctuations of the vicinity of these residues are largely suppressed, i.e., Link Node provides useful information about the topological constraint imposed on the residues during the conformation fluctuations of IDP. We further reveal that the evolution of the chain topology is considerably slow (with a timescale of hundreds of nanoseconds), which is distinct from the flipping of residue contact.</description>

      <title>Hybrid deep learning and physics-based neural network for programmable illumination computational microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relying on either deep models or physical models are two mainstream approaches for solving inverse sample reconstruction problems in programmable illumination computational microscopy. Solutions based on physical models possess strong generalization capabilities while struggling with global optimization of inverse problems due to a lack of insufficient physical constraints. In contrast, deep learning methods have strong problem-solving abilities, but their generalization ability is often questioned because of the unclear physical principles. Besides, conventional deep models are difficult to apply to some specific scenes because of the difficulty in acquiring high-quality training data and their limited capacity to generalize across different scenarios. In this paper, to combine the advantages of deep models and physical models together, we propose a hybrid framework consisting of three sub-neural networks (two deep learning networks and one physics-based network). We first obtain a result with rich semantic information through a light deep learning neural network and then use it as the initial value of the physical network to make its output comply with physical process constraints. These two results are then used as the input of a fusion deep learning neural work which utilizes the paired features between the reconstruction results of two different models to further enhance imaging quality. The final result integrates the advantages of both deep models and physical models and can quickly solve the computational reconstruction inverse problem in programmable illumination computational microscopy and achieve better results. We verified the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed hybrid framework with theoretical analysis and actual experiments on resolution targets and biological samples.</description>

      <title>A detailed field theory for RNA-like molecules with periodic base sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines a field theory for RNA-like molecules in a good solvent. The field theory is based on a lattice model for single- and double-strand RNA with a periodic base sequence, and otherwise contains all known relevant details (polymer types, polymer lengths and interactions). As for the somewhat less explicit $O\left(n\right)$-symmetric model there is a close relation to the conventional one-component branched polymer and the associated Lee-Yang problem. We further elucidate this relation. We derive exact results in the limiting cases of nearly complete denaturation and nearly complete renaturation. The single-strand critical exponent $\nu_{\varphi}$ is calculated in two-loop order.</description>

      <title>Short-term memory effects in the phototactic behavior of microalgae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phototaxis, the directed motion in response to a light stimulus, is crucial for motile microorganisms that rely on photosynthesis, such as the unicellular microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. It is well known that microalgae adapt to ambient light stimuli. On time scales of several dozen minutes, when stimulated long enough, the response of the microalga evolves as if the light intensity were decreasing (Mayer, Nature 1968). Here, we show experimentally that microalgae also have a short-term memory, on the time scale of a couple of minutes, which is the opposite of adaptation. At these short time scales, when stimulated consecutively, the response of C. reinhardtii evolves as if the light intensity were increasing. Our experimental results are rationalized by the introduction of a simplified model of phototaxis. Memory comes from the interplay between an internal biochemical time scale and the time scale of the stimulus; as such, these memory effects are likely to be widespread in phototactic microorganisms.</description>
