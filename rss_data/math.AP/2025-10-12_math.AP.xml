      <title>Hausdorff dimension of the singular set for Griffith almost-minimizers in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08670v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider regularity of the crack set associated to a minimizer of the Griffith fracture energy, often used in modeling brittle materials. We show that the crack is uniformly rectifiable which in conjunction with our previous epsilon-regularity result allows us to prove that the singular set has dimension strictly less than $1$. This size estimate also applies to almost-minimizers. As a byproduct, we prove higher integrability for the gradient of local minimizers of the Griffith energy, providing a positive answer to the analog of De Giorgi's conjecture for the Mumford--Shah functional.</description>

      <title>Stability Estimates for Commutativity Properties of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laplacian $\Delta_{\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}$ on the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}\subset \mathbb{R}^n$ has the property that it can explicitly be expressed in terms of $\Lambda$, the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map of the unit ball, as $\Delta_{\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}=\Lambda^2+(n-2)\Lambda$. In this paper, we seek to characterize those manifolds for which such an exact relationship holds, and more generally measure the discrepancy of such a relationship holding in terms of geometric data. To this end, we obtain a stability estimate which shows that, for a smoothly bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^3$, if the commutator $[\Lambda,\Delta_{\mathbb{S}^{n-1}}]$ is small then that domain is itself close to a ball. We then study the case of manifolds conformal to the ball, show that a relationship as above implies a radial metric structure, and discuss stability in this setting. Finally, we provide a modern exposition of Gohberg's lemma, a foundational result in microlocal analysis which we employ as a starting step for our reasoning.</description>

      <title>On positive solutions of Lane-Emden equations on the integer lattice graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence and nonexistence of positive solutions to the Lane-Emden equations $$ -\Delta u = Q |u|^{p-2}u $$ on the $d$-dimensional integer lattice graph $\mathbb{Z}^d$, as well as in the half-space and quadrant domains, under the zero Dirichlet boundary condition in the latter two cases. Here, $d \geq 2$, $p &gt; 0$, and $Q$ denotes a Hardy-type positive potential satisfying $Q(x) \sim (1+|x|)^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha \in [0, +\infty]$. \smallskip
  We identify the Sobolev super-critical regions of the parameter pair $(\alpha, p)$ for which the existence of positive solutions is established via variational methods. In contrast, within the Serrin sub-critical regions of $(\alpha, p)$, we demonstrate nonexistence by iteratively analyzing the decay behavior at infinity, ultimately leading to a contradiction. Notably, in the full-space and half-space domains, there exists an intermediate regions between the Sobolev critical line and the Serrin critical line where the existence of positive solutions remains an open question. Such an intermediate region does not exist in the quadrant domain.</description>

      <title>Energy distance and evolution problems: a promising tool for kinetic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the rate of convergence to equilibrium of the solutions to Fokker-Planck type equations with linear drift by means of Cram\'er and Energy distances, which have been recently widely used in problems related to AI, in particular for tasks related to machine learning. In all cases in which the Fokker-Planck type equations can be treated through these distances, it is shown that the rate of decay is improved with respect to known results which are based on the decay of relative entropy.</description>

      <title>Unique continuation and Hardy's uncertainty principle for hyperbolic Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove unique continuation properties related to the Hardy uncertainty principle for solutions of the hyperbolic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation and the hyperbolic Schr\"odinger equation with potential. Under suitable conditions on the nonlinearity, or the potential, we show that if $u$ is a solution with Gaussian decay at two different times, then $u\equiv 0$. These results extend to the hyperbolic setting the work of Escauriaza, Kenig, Ponce, and Vega (JEMS, 10, 2008) for the classical Schr\"odinger equation. The proofs rely on Carleman estimates based on calculus and convexity arguments, with the main challenge being to provide a rigorous justification of these estimates. Although our approach follows the general strategy of Escauriaza, Kenig, Ponce, and Vega, several technical modifications are required to handle the hyperbolic character of the equation.</description>

      <title>Li-Yau-Hamilton Inequality on the JKO Scheme for the Granular-Medium Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a version of the Li--Yau--Hamilton inequality for the Granular-Medium equation on the torus, both at the PDE level and for its time-discrete approximation given by the JKO scheme. We then apply this estimate to derive further quantitative results for the continuous and discrete JKO flows, including Lipschitz and $L^\infty$ bounds, as well as a quantitative Harnack inequality. Finally, we use the regularity provided by this estimate to show that the JKO scheme for the Fokker--Planck equation converges in $L^2_{\mathrm{loc}}((0,+\infty); H^2(\mathbb{T}^d))$.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of global solutions to the Grushin heat equation with nonlocal and local nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the nonexistence of global solutions to the Grushin-type heat equation with nonlinear reaction terms, including cases involving memory effects: $$
  \left\{\begin{array}{ll}
  \displaystyle {u_{t}-\Delta_{\mathcal{G}}
  u = k_1 \int_0^t(t-s)^{-\gamma}\abs{u}^{p_1-1}u(s)\,\mathrm{d}s} + k_2|u|^{p_2-1}u, &amp; (z,t)\in {\mathbb{R}}^{N+k}\times (0,\infty),
  \displaystyle{u(z,0)= u_0(z),\qquad\qquad}&amp;\displaystyle{z\in {\mathbb{R}}^{N+k},}
  \end{array}
  \right. $$
  where $\Delta_{\mathcal{G}}$ denotes the Grushin operator, $u_0 \in L^1_{\mathrm{loc}}(\mathbb{R}^{N+k})$, $\gamma\in[0,1)$, $k_1,k_2 \geq 0$, and $p_1,p_2&gt;1$.
  We establish sharp nonexistence results for global-in-time positive solutions, thereby completing the picture of global existence versus blow-up and allow us to identify the corresponding Fujita-type critical exponents in certain parameter regimes. The analysis relies on the test function method, adapted to handle both the degeneracy of the Grushin operator and the influence of the memory term.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that solutions to a class of Mean Field Game systems with discount are unique provided that the discount factor is large enough, and the Lagrangian term is (proportionally) small enough. This identifies an asymptotic uniqueness regime that falls outside the usual ones involving monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Non-linear stability of shock profiles in dissipative hyperbolic-hyperbolic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give the first proof of nonlinear stability for smooth shock profiles of second-order dissipative hyperbolic-hyperbolic systems under the assumption of spectral stability, showing stability of smooth small-amplitude profiles in dimensions greater than or equal to two. This class of systems notably includes the two types of causal viscous relativistic gas models introduced respectively by Freist\"uhler-Temple and Bemfica-Disconzi-Noronha, and (the equivalent second-order form of) a class of first-order numerical relaxation systems generalizing the well-known Jin-Xin relaxation schemes. A significant technical innovation is a new para-differential type of nonlinear damping estimate similar to that used by the first author to study stability of constant states, allowing the treatment of systems far from the symmetric structure required for the standard ``Kawashima-type'' energy estimates that are typically used for that purpose.</description>

      <title>Global existence and asymptotic decay for small solutions of general quasilinear hyperbolic balance laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes global existence and asymptotic decay for small solutions to quasilinear systems of hyperbolic balance laws, where, generalizing previous works, the hyperbolic operator does not need to admit an entropy nor does the source term need to satisfy any symmetry assumptions. Dissipative properties are characterized by three conditions corresponding to regimes of small, intermediate and large wave numbers in Fourier space and the fully non-linear system is treated by using methods of para-differential calculus recently developed in the context for proofs of global existence and decay in second-order hyperbolic systems. The present work leads, in particular, to asymptotic stability of rest-states for multidimensional Jin-Xin relaxation system, a result not accessible through previous methods.</description>

      <title>Metaplectic time-frequency representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-frequency representations stemmed in 1932 with the introduction of the Wigner distribution. For most of the 20th century, research in this area primarily focused on defining joint probability distributions for position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Applications to electrical engineering were soon established with the seminal works of Gabor and the researchers at Bell Labs. In 2012, Bai, Li and Cheng used for the first time metaplectic operators, defined in the middle of 20th century by Van Hove, to generalize the Wigner distribution and unify effectively the most used time-frequency representations under a common framework. This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions. Their idea provides a fruitful framework where properties of time-frequency representations can be explained naturally by the structure of the symplectic group.</description>

      <title>Shape optimization of a small favorable region in a periodically fragmented environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a shape optimization problem for the persistence threshold of a biological species dispersing in a periodically fragmented environment, the unknown shape corresponding to the portion of the habitat which is favorable to the population. Analytically, this translates in the minimization of a weighted eigenvalue of the periodic Laplacian, with respect to a bang-bang indefinite weight. For such problem, we exploit some recent results obtained in the framework of Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions, to provide a full description of the singularly perturbed regime in which the volume of the favorable zone vanishes.
  First, we show that the optimal favorable zone shrinks to a connected, convex, nearly spherical set, in $C^{1,1}$ sense. Secondly, we show that the spherical asymmetry of the optimal favorable zone decays exponentially, with respect to a negative power of its volume, in the $C^{1,\alpha}$ sense, for every $\alpha&lt;1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefield speckle patterns are generated by interference of randomly scattered coherent light. In the weak-coupling regime of the It\^o-Schr\"odinger paraxial model for long-distance wave propagation, we show the following multiscale character: a macroscopic envelope solves a deterministic diffusion equation while the local wavefield (the speckle) is described by a complex Gaussian process both in terms of spatial axial and lateral displacements as well as frequency and angular variations of the incident wavebeam. These results describe speckle patterns and corroborate chromato-spatial memory effects observed in laser light propagation through heterogeneous media.</description>

      <title>Spectral theory for L\'evy and L\'evy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups on step 2 Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider non-local perturbations $\Delta^\psi_G$ of sub-Laplacians on a step $2$ Carnot group $G$. The perturbations are by translation-invariant non-local operators acting along the vertical directions in $G$. We use harmonic analysis on $G$ to obtain intertwining relationship between the semigroups generated by $\Delta^\psi_G$ and some strongly continuous contraction semigroups on Euclidean spaces with purely continuous spectrum, and as a result we identify the spectrum of $\Delta^\psi_G$. Further we introduce the L\'evy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) semigroup corresponding to $\Delta^\psi_G$. We prove that these Markov semigroups are ergodic, though they are not normal operators on $L^2$ space with respect to the invariant distribution $\mathsf{p}_\psi$. The intertwining relationships allow us to show that all L\'evy-OU generators on $G$ are isospectral, that is, they have the same eigenvalues with the same multiplicities. As a byproduct, we obtain a precise description of the eigenspaces, and also derive explicit formula for the co-eigenfunctions corresponding to some eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We verify a conjecture of D. R. Adams on a capacitary strong type inequality that generalizes the classical capacitary strong type inequality of V. G. Maz'ya. As a result, we characterize related function spaces as K\"othe duals to a class of Sobolev multiplier type spaces. Moreover, using tools from nonlinear potential theory, weighted norm inequalities, and Banach function space theory, we show that these spaces are also isomorphic to more concrete spaces that are easy to use and fit in well with the modern theory of function spaces of harmonic analysis.</description>

      <title>A posteriori analysis for nonlinear convection-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work provides reliable a posteriori error estimates for Runge-Kutta discontinuous Galerkin approximations of nonlinear convection-diffusion systems. The classes of systems we study are quite general with a focus on convection-dominated and degenerate parabolic problems. Our a posteriori error bounds are valid for a family of discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretizations and various temporal discretizations that include explicit and implicit-explicit time-stepping schemes, popular tools for practical simulations of this class of problem. We prove that our estimators provide reliable upper bounds for the error of the numerical method and present numerical evidence showing that they achieve the same order of convergence as the error. Since one of our main interests is the convection dominant case, we also track the dependence of the estimator on the viscosity coefficient.</description>

      <title>On elastic and non-elastic wave superpositions for the Euler system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper contains an analysis of the conditions for the existence of elastic versus non-elastic wave superpositions governed by the Euler system in (1+1)-dimensions. This system admits entropic solutions and two types of sound wave solutions. It is shown that the smallest real Lie algebra containing vector fields (associated with these waves) is isomorphic to a semidirect sum of the infinite-dimensional Abelian real Lie algebra and the non-Abelian finite-dimensional real Lie algebra. Based on this fact, we are able to find a parametrization of the region of non-elastic wave superpositions which allows for the construction of the reduced form of the Euler system. It is proven that, in this case, the manifold spanned by the vector fields associated with waves possesses the structure of a local Lie group. It is also shown that this manifold has a torsion-free affine connection and the one-parameter subgroups of the Lie group are geodesics. Based on this fact, a description of the non-elastic wave superposition is given in terms of motion of the quasi-rectifiable surfaces spanned by the pair of vector fields associated with sound waves.</description>

      <title>Sharp exponent of acceleration in general nonlocal equations with a weak Allee effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.09911v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an acceleration phenomenon arising in monostable integro-differential equations with a weak Allee effect. Previous works have shown its occurrence and have given correct upper bounds on the rate of expansion in some particular cases, but precise lower bounds were still missing. In this paper, we provide a sharp lower bound for this acceleration rate, valid for a large class of dispersion operators. Our results manage to cover fractional Laplace operators and standard convolutions in a unified way, which is new in the literature. A first very important result of the paper is a general flattening estimate of independent interest: this phenomenon appears regularly in acceleration situations, but getting quantitative estimates is most of the time open. This estimate at hand, we construct a very subtle sub-solution that captures the expected dynamics of the accelerating solution (rates of expansion and flattening) and identifies several various regimes that appear in the dynamics depending on the parameters of the problem.</description>

      <title>Steady Ring-Shaped Vortex Sheets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08220v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we construct traveling wave solutions to the two-phase Euler equations, featuring a vortex sheet at the interface between the two phases. The inner phase exhibits a uniform vorticity distribution and may represent a vacuum, forming what is known as a hollow vortex. These traveling waves take the form of ring-shaped vortices with a small cross-sectional radius, referred to as thin rings. Our construction is based on the implicit function theorem, which also guarantees local uniqueness of the solutions. Additionally, we derive asymptotics for the speed of the ring, generalizing the well-known Kelvin--Hicks formula to cases that include surface tension.</description>

      <title>Phase-field modelling of cohesive fracture. Part I: $\Gamma$-convergence results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main aim of this three-part work is to provide a unified consistent framework for the phase-field modeling of cohesive fracture.
  In this first paper we establish the mathematical foundation of a cohesive phase-field model by proving a $\Gamma$-convergence result in a one-dimensional setting. Specifically, we consider a broad class of phase-field energies, encompassing different models present in the literature, thereby both extending the results in \cite{ContiFocardiIurlano2016} and providing an analytical validation of all the other approaches. Additionally, by modifying the functional scaling, we demonstrate that our formulation also generalizes the Ambrosio-Tortorelli approximation for brittle fracture, therefore laying the groundwork for a unified framework for variational fracture problems.
  The Part~II paper presents a systematic procedure for constructing phase-field models that reproduce prescribed cohesive laws, whereas the Part~III paper validates the theoretical results with applied examples.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness for a fourth-order nonisothermal tumor growth model of Caginalp type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a nonisothermal phase-field system of Caginalp type that describes tumor growth under hyperthermia. The model couples a possibly viscous Cahn-Hilliard equation, governing the evolution of the healthy and tumor phases, with an equation for the heat balance, and a reaction-diffusion equation for the nutrient concentration. The resulting nonlinear system incorporates chemotaxis and active transport effects, and is supplemented with no-flux boundary conditions. The analysis is carried out through a two-step approximation procedure, involving a regularization of the potential and a Faedo-Galerkin discretization scheme. Under stronger regularity assumptions, we further establish the existence of strong solutions and their uniqueness via a continuous dependence result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moving boundary problems of Stefan-type for a novel third order nonlinear evolution equation with temporal modulation are here shown to be amenable to exact Airy-type solution via a classical Ermakov equation with its admitted nonlinear superposition principle. Application of the latter together with a class of involutory transformations sets the original moving boundary problem in a wide class with temporal modulation. As an appendix, reciprocally associated exactly solvable moving boundary problems are derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, by exploiting mean value properties of $s$-harmonic functions, we introduce some monotonicity formulas in the nonlocal setting. We take into account intrinsically nonlocal functionals mimicking those introduced by Alt, Caffarelli and Friedman in the seminal work [Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. (1984)]. Our approach is purely nonlocal and does not rely on the extension technique. As a byproduct we also established interior nonlocal gradient estimates and a nonlocal analogue of the Bochner identity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the wake of major breakthroughs in General Relativity during the 1960s, Roger Penrose introduced Strong Cosmic Censorship, a profound conjecture regarding the deterministic nature of the theory. Penrose's proposal has since opened far-reaching new mathematical avenues, revealing connections to fundamental questions about black holes and the nature of gravitational singularities. We review recent advances arising from modern techniques in the theory of partial differential equations as applied to Strong Cosmic Censorship, maintaining a focus on the context of gravitational collapse that gave birth to the conjecture.</description>

      <title>The coexistence of null and spacelike singularities inside spherically symmetric black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our previous work [Van de Moortel, The breakdown of weak null singularities, Duke Mathematical Journal 172 (15), 2957-3012, 2023], we showed that dynamical black holes formed in charged spherical collapse generically feature both a null weakly singular Cauchy horizon and a stronger (presumably spacelike) singularity, confirming a longstanding conjecture in the physics literature. However, this previous result, based on a contradiction argument, did not provide quantitative estimates on the stronger singularity.
  In this study, we adopt a new approach by analyzing local initial data inside the black hole that are consistent with a breakdown of the Cauchy horizon. We prove that the remaining portion is spacelike and obtain sharp spacetime estimates near the null-spacelike transition. Notably, we show that the Kasner exponents of the spacelike portion are positive, in contrast to the well-known Oppenheimer-Snyder model of gravitational collapse. Moreover, these exponents degenerate to (1,0,0) towards the null-spacelike transition.
  Our result provides the first quantitative instances of a null-spacelike singularity transition inside a black hole. In our companion paper, we moreover apply our analysis to carry out the construction of a large class of asymptotically flat one or two-ended black holes featuring coexisting null and spacelike singularities.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of oscillations for axisymmetric solar backgrounds with differential rotation and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19386v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local helioseismology comprises of imaging and inversion techniques employed to reconstruct the dynamic and interior of the Sun from correlations of oscillations observed on the surface, all of which require modeling solar oscillations and computing Green's kernels. In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>Finite element discretizations of bending plates with prestrained microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a finite element discretization of an elastic bending-plate model with an effective prestrain. The model has been obtained via homogenization and dimension reduction by B\"onlein at al. (2023). Its energy functional is the $\Gamma$-limit of a three-dimensional nonlinear microstructured elasticity functional. In the derived effective model, the microstructure is incorporated as a local corrector problem, a system of linear elliptic partial differential equations posed on a three-dimensional representative volume element. The discretization uses Discrete Kirchhoff Triangle elements for the macroscopic bending-plate problem on a mesh of scale $H$, and first-order Lagrange elements for the microscopic corrector problem on an axis-aligned mesh of scale $h$. We show that the discretized model $\Gamma$-converges to the continuous one as $(h,H)\to 0$,provided that there exists a microstructure mesh such that the elasticity tensor is Lipschitz continuous on each mesh element. This extends earlier results by Rumpf et al. (2024) to prestrained composites. Our argument does not require any rate of convergence for the microscopic discretization error. As a corollary, we also obtain convergence when $h \to 0$ and $H \to 0$ consecutively, and we prove that these limit processes commute.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic-statistical inference of mosquito dynamics from mark-release-recapture data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biological control strategies against mosquito-borne diseases--such as the sterile insect technique (SIT), RIDL, and Wolbachia-based releases--require reliable estimates of dispersal and survival of released males. We propose a mechanistic--statistical framework for mark--release--recapture (MRR) data linking an individual-based 2D diffusion model with its reaction--diffusion limit. Inference is based on solving the macroscopic system and embedding it in a Poisson observation model for daily trap counts, with uncertainty quantified via a parametric bootstrap. We validate identifiability using simulated data and apply the model to an urban MRR campaign in El Cano (Havana, Cuba) involving four weekly releases of sterile Aedes aegypti males. The best-supported model suggests a mean life expectancy of about five days and a typical displacement of about 180 m. Unlike empirical fits of survival or dispersal, our mechanistic approach jointly estimates movement, mortality, and capture, yielding biologically interpretable parameters and a principled framework for designing and evaluating SIT-based interventions.</description>
