      <title>The Recovery of $\lambda$ from a Hilbert Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the study of Hilbert schemes, the integer partition $\lambda$ helps researchers identify some geometric and combinatorial properties of the scheme in question. To aid researchers in extracting such information from a Hilbert polynomial, we describe an efficient algorithm which can identify if $p(x)\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$ is a Hilbert polynomial and if so, recover the integer partition $\lambda$ associated with it.</description>

      <title>Jacobi Stability Analysis for Systems of ODEs Using Symbolic Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical theory of Kosambi-Cartan-Chern (KCC) developed in differential geometry provides a powerful method for analyzing the behaviors of dynamical systems. In the KCC theory, the properties of a dynamical system are described in terms of five geometrical invariants, of which the second corresponds to the so-called Jacobi stability of the system. Different from that of the Lyapunov stability that has been studied extensively in the literature, the analysis of the Jacobi stability has been investigated more recently using geometrical concepts and tools. It turns out that the existing work on the Jacobi stability analysis remains theoretical and the problem of algorithmic and symbolic treatment of Jacobi stability analysis has yet to be addressed. In this paper, we initiate our study on the problem for a class of ODE systems of arbitrary dimension and propose two algorithmic schemes using symbolic computation to check whether a nonlinear dynamical system may exhibit Jacobi stability. The first scheme, based on the construction of the complex root structure of a characteristic polynomial and on the method of quantifier elimination, is capable of detecting the existence of the Jacobi stability of the given dynamical system. The second algorithmic scheme exploits the method of semi-algebraic system solving and allows one to determine conditions on the parameters for a given dynamical system to have a prescribed number of Jacobi stable fixed points. Several examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithmic schemes.</description>
