      <title>A Candidate Giant Planet Companion to the Massive, Young White Dwarf GALEX J071816.4+373139 Informs the Occurrence of Giant Planets Orbiting B Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that giant planet occurrence peaks for stars with $M_{\ast}~\approx~3~M_{\odot}$ at a value a factor of four higher than observed for solar-mass stars. This population of giant planets predicted to frequently orbit main sequence B stars at $a~\approx~10$ AU is difficult to characterize observationally while fusion persists in their host stars. Fortunately, stars with $M_{\ast}~\gtrsim~3~M_{\odot}$ sustain fusion for only a few hundred million years. By the time those stars become massive, young white dwarfs, any giant planets present would still be luminous as a consequence of their recent formation.
  From an initial sample of 3268 Gaia-identified massive, young white dwarfs, we use homogeneous Spitzer Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) photometry to search for evidence of unresolved giant planets. For 30 systems, these IRAC data provide sensitivity to objects with $M~\lesssim~10~M_{\text{Jup}}$, and we identify one candidate with $M~\approx~4~M_{\text{Jup}}$ orbiting the white dwarf GALEX J071816.4+373139. Correcting for the possibility that some of the white dwarfs in our sample result from mergers, we find a giant planet occurrence $\eta_{\text{GP}}~=~0.11_{-0.07}^{+0.13}$ for stars with initial masses $M_{\ast}~\gtrsim~3~M_{\odot}$. Our occurrence inference is consistent with both the Doppler-inferred occurrence of giant planets orbiting $M_{\ast}~\approx~2~M_{\odot}$ giant stars and the theoretically predicted factor-of-four enhancement in the occurrence of giant planets orbiting $M_{\ast}~\approx~3~M_{\odot}$ stars relative to solar-mass stars. Future James Webb Space Telescope Near Infrared Camera observations of our sample would provide sensitivity to Saturn-mass planets and thereby a definitive estimate of the occurrence of giant planets orbiting stars with $M_{\ast}~\gtrsim~3~M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Three-Body Problem at High Eccentricities = Simple Pendulum II: Octupole including Brown's Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The very long-term evolution of the hierarchical restricted three-body problem with a massive perturber is analyzed analytically in the high eccentricity regime. Perturbations on the time scale of the outer orbit can accumulate over long timescales and be comparable to the effect of the octupole term. These perturbations are described by Brown's Hamiltonian - having different forms in the literature. We show that at the high eccentricity regime - the effect of Brown's Hamiltonian is an azimuthal precesssion of the eccentricity vector and can be solved analytically. In fact, the dynamics are equivalent to a simple pendulum model allowing an explicit flip criterion.</description>

      <title>New versus past silica crush curve experiments: application to Dimorphos benchmarking impact simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crush curves are of fundamental importance to numerical modeling of small and porous astrophysical bodies. The empirical literature often measures them for silica grains, and different studies have used various methods, sizes, textures, and pressure conditions. Here we review past studies and supplement further experiments in order to develop a full and overarching understanding of the silica crush curve behavior. We suggest a new power-law function that can be used in impact simulations of analog materials similar to micro-granular silica. We perform a benchmarking study to compare this new crush curve to the parametric quadratic crush curve often used in other studies, based on the study case of the DART impact onto the asteroid Dimorphos. We find that the typical quadratic crush curve parameters do not closely follow the silica crushing experiments, and as a consequence they under (over) estimate compression close (far) from the impact site. The new crush curve presented here, applicable to pressures between a few hundred Pa and up to 1.1 GPa, might therefore be more precise. Additionally, it is not calibrated by case-specific parameters, and can be used universally for comet- or asteroid-like bodies, given an assumed composition similar to micro-granular silica.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Protoplanetary Disks Using the Keck/NIRC2 Vortex Coronagraph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of protoplanetary disks in the millimeter continuum have shown a variety of radial gaps, cavities, and spiral features. These substructures may be signposts for ongoing planet formation, and therefore these systems are promising targets for direct imaging planet searches in the near-infrared. To this end, we present results from a deep imaging survey in the $L'$-band (3.8 $\mu$m) with the Keck/NIRC2 vortex coronagraph to search for young planets in 43 disks with resolved features in the millimeter continuum or evidence for gaps/central cavities from their spectral energy distributions. Although we do not detect any new point sources, using the vortex coronagraph allows for high sensitivity to faint sources at small angular separations (down to ${\sim}$0$^{\prime\prime}$.1), allowing us to place strong upper limits on the masses of potential gas giant planets. We compare our mass sensitivities to the masses of planets derived using ALMA observations, and while we are sensitive to $\sim$1 M$_{Jup}$ planets in the gaps in some of our systems, we are generally not sensitive to planets of the masses expected from the ALMA observations. In addition to placing upper limits on the masses of gas giant planets that could be interacting with the dust in the disks to form the observed millimeter substructures, we are also able to map the micron-sized dust as seen in scattered light for 8 of these systems. Our large sample of systems also allows us to investigate limits on planetary accretion rates and disk viscosities.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Fireball Luminous Efficiency Models using Acoustic Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The total energy of a fireball is commonly obtained from optical measurements with an assumed value for luminous efficiency. Acoustic energy measurements offer an independent means of energy estimation. Here we combine optical and acoustic methods to validate the luminous efficiency model of Borovi\v{c}ka et al. (2020). Our goal is to compare these models with acoustic measurements of meteoroid energy deposition. Employing theoretical blast scaling laws following the approach of McFadden et al. (2021), we determine explosive yields for both fireball fragmentation events and cylindrical shocks for four different bright fireballs. We model fireballs using the MetSim software (Vida et al., 2023) and find that the Borovi\v{c}ka et al. (2020) model produces agreement better than a factor of two for our three chondritic fireball case studies. The major exception is an iron meteorite-producing fireball where the luminous efficiency is an order of magnitude higher than model predictions calibrated with stony fireballs. We suggest that large disparities between optical and acoustic energies could be a signature of iron fireballs and hence useful as a discriminant of that population.</description>

      <title>Asteroid Period Solutions from Combined Dense and Sparse Photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deriving high quality lightcuves for asteroids and other periodic sources from survey data is challenging due to many factors, including the sparsely sampled observational record and diurnal aliasing which is a signature imparted into the periodic signal of a source that is a function of the observing schedule of ground-based telescopes. In this paper, we examine the utility of combining asteroid observational records from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) which are the ground- and space-based facilities, respectively, to determine to what degree the data from the space-based facility can suppress diurnal aliases. Furthermore, we examine several optimizations that are used to derive the rotation periods of asteroids which we then compare to the reported rotation periods in the literature. Through this analysis we find that we can reliably derive the rotation periods for ~85% of our sample of 222 objects that are also reported in the literature and that the remaining ~15% are difficult to reliably derive as many are asteroids that are insufficiently elongated which produces a lightcurve with an insufficient amplitude and consequently, an incorrect rotation period. We also investigate a binary classification method that biases against reporting incorrect rotation periods. We conclude the paper by assessing the utility of using other ground- or space-based facilities as companion telescopes to the forthcoming Rubin Observatory.</description>

      <title>Mathieu equation as a result of Laplace perturbation theory in the restricted three body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear equations with periodic coefficients describe the behavior of various dynamical systems. This studying is devoted to their applications to the planetary restricted three-body problem (RTBP). Here we consider the Laplace method for determining perturbation in coordinates. We show that classical theory of perturbation leads to a linear equation with periodic coefficients. Than we present a modification of Laplace method. This modification allows us to study motion over a longer time interval.</description>

      <title>Assessing the residual biases in high-resolution transit absorption spectra correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years it has become common practice to divide observed transit absorption spectra by synthetic absorption spectra computed for the transit of an atmosphere-less planet. This action supposedly corrects the observed absorption spectrum, leaving the sole atmospheric absorption signature free from the biases induced by stellar rotation and centre-to-limb variations. We aim to show that while this practice is beneficial, it does not completely correct the absorption spectrum from the stellar distortions and that some residual biases remain, leaving a possibly altered atmospheric signature. By reducing the problem to its most basic form, we show that dividing the observed absorption spectrum by a synthetic absorption spectrum of the planet does not isolate the pure atmospheric absorption signature. We also used simulated synthetic transit observations to assess the magnitude of these residual biases in typical transit observations. We show that dividing the observed absorption spectrum by the planetary absorption spectrum results in an atmospheric signature modulated by the ratio of the flux behind the atmosphere and the flux behind the planet. Depending on the non-homogeneity of the stellar spectrum, this leads to distorted atmospheric signatures. Eventually, directly analysing these biased signatures will lead to wrong estimates of planetary atmosphere properties.</description>

      <title>Higher-order effects in the dynamics of hierarchical triple systems. II. Second-order and dotriacontapole-order effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the long-term evolution of hierarchical triple systems in Newtonian gravity to second order in the quadrupolar perturbation parameter, and to sixth order in $\epsilon = a/A$, the ratio of the semimajor axes of the inner and outer orbits. We apply the ``two-timescale'' method from applied mathematics to the Lagrange Planetary Equations for the inner and outer orbits, in which each osculating orbit element is split into an orbit averaged part that evolves on the long perturbative timescale, and an ``average-free'' part that is oscillatory in the orbital timescales. Averages over the two orbital timescales are performed using the well-known secular approximation. We also incorporate perturbative corrections to the relation between time and the orbital phases. We place no restrictions on the masses, on the relative orbit inclinations or on the eccentricities, beyond the requirement that the quadrupolar parameter and $\epsilon$ both be small. The result is a complete set of long-timescale evolution equations for the averaged elements of the inner and outer orbits. At first order in perturbation theory, we obtain the dotriacontapole contributions explicitly at order $\epsilon^6$. At second order in perturbation theory, i.e. quadratic in the quadrupole perturbation amplitude, we find contributions that scale as $\epsilon^{9/2}$ (found in earlier work), $\epsilon^{5}$, $\epsilon^{11/2}$, and $\epsilon^{6}$. At first perturbative order and dotriacontapole order, the two averaged semimajor axes are constant in time (and we prove that this holds to arbitrary multipole orders); but at second perturbative order, beginning at $O( \epsilon^{5})$, they are no longer constant. Nevertheless we verify that the total averaged energy of the system is conserved, and we argue that this behavior is not incompatible with classical theorems on secular evolution of the semimajor axes.</description>

      <title>The challenge of detecting remote spectroscopic signatures from radionuclides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of exoplanetary atmospheres through transit spectra is becoming increasingly feasible, and technology for direct detection remains ongoing. The possibility of detecting spectral features could enable quantitative constraints on atmospheric composition or even serve as a potential biosignature, with the sensitivity of the instrument and observation time as key limiting factors. This paper discusses the possibility that future remote observations could detect the presence of radioactive elements in the atmospheres of exoplanets. Such radionuclides could arise from cosmogenic or geologic sources, as well as from industrial sources, all of which occur on Earth. The detection of radionuclides in an exoplanetary atmosphere could reveal important properties about the planet's geology or space environment, and potentially could serve as a technosignature. However, many radionuclides, including those from industrial sources, attach to aerosol or other particles that cannot be remotely characterized. Limited experimental and theoretical spectral data exist for long-lived radionuclides, but the sensitivity required to detect the spectral features of some known radionuclides would be at least several orders of magnitude greater than required to detect the spectral features of molecular oxygen. Present-day remote spectroscopic observing mission concepts at ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths are not sensitive to discern the presence of radionuclides in exoplanetary atmospheres. Interplanetary fly-by or probe missions may be more likely to provide such data in the future.</description>

      <title>TOI-2490b- The most eccentric brown dwarf transiting in the brown dwarf desert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of the most eccentric transiting brown dwarf in the brown dwarf desert, TOI02490b. The brown dwarf desert is the lack of brown dwarfs around main sequence stars within $\sim3$~AU and is thought to be caused by differences in formation mechanisms between a star and planet. To date, only $\sim40$ transiting brown dwarfs have been confirmed. \systemt is a $73.6\pm2.4$ \mjupnospace, $1.00\pm0.02$ \rjup brown dwarf orbiting a $1.004_{-0.022}^{+0.031}$ \msunnospace, $1.105_{-0.012}^{+0.012}$ \rsun sun-like star on a 60.33~d orbit with an eccentricity of $0.77989\pm0.00049$. The discovery was detected within \tess sectors 5 (30 minute cadence) and 32 (2 minute and 20 second cadence). It was then confirmed with 31 radial velocity measurements with \feros by the WINE collaboration and photometric observations with the Next Generation Transit Survey. Stellar modelling of the host star estimates an age of $\sim8$~Gyr, which is supported by estimations from kinematics likely placing the object within the thin disc. However, this is not consistent with model brown dwarf isochrones for the system age suggesting an inflated radius. Only one other transiting brown dwarf with an eccentricity higher than 0.6 is currently known in the brown dwarf desert. Demographic studies of brown dwarfs have suggested such high eccentricity is indicative of stellar formation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The threshold at which a meteor shower becomes hazardous to spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the risk posed to spacecraft due to meteoroid impacts is dominated by sporadic meteoroids, meteor showers can raise this risk for short periods of time. NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office issues meteor shower forecasts that describe these periods of elevated risk, primarily for the purpose of helping plan extravehicular activities. These forecasts are constructed using a list of meteor shower parameters that has evolved over time to include newly discovered showers and incorporate improved measurements of their characteristics. However, at this point in time, more than a thousand meteor showers have been reported by researchers, many of which are extremely minor, are unconfirmed, or lack measurements of critical parameters. Thus, a comprehensive approach is no longer feasible. In this report we present a quantitative criterion for a potentially hazardous meteor shower and apply this criterion to the list of established meteor showers in order to determine which showers should be included in our annual forecasts.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics simulations of head-on low-velocity collisions between particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle contact model is important for powder simulations. Although several contact models have been proposed, their validity has not yet been well established. Therefore, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to clarify the particle interaction. We simulate head-on collisions of two particles with impact velocities less than a few percent of the sound velocity to investigate the dependence of the interparticle force and the coefficient of restitution (COR) on the impact velocity and particle radius. In this study, we treat particles with a radius of 10-100 nm and perform simulations. We find that the interparticle force exhibits hysteresis between the loading and unloading phases. Larger impact velocities result in strong hysteresis and plastic deformation. For all impact velocities and particle radii, the coefficient of restitution is smaller than that given by the Johnson-Kendall-Robert theory. An inelastic contact model cannot reproduce our MD simulations. In particular, the COR is significantly reduced when the impact velocity exceeds a certain value. This significant energy dissipation cannot be explained even by the contact models including plastic deformation. We also find that the COR increases with increasing particle radius. We also find that the previous contact models including plastic deformation cannot explain the strong energy dissipation obtained in our MD simulations, although they agree with the MD results for very low impact velocities. Accordingly, we have constructed a new dissipative contact model in which the dissipative force increases with the stress generated by collisions. The new stress dependent model successfully reproduces our MD results over a wider range of impact velocities than the conventional models do. In addition, we proposed another, simpler, dissipative contact model that can also reproduce the MD results.</description>

Abstract: Beyond the Sun-Earth line, spacecraft equipped with various solar telescopes are intended to be deployed at several different vantage points in the heliosphere to carry out coordinated, multi-view observations of the Sun and its dynamic activities. In this context, we investigate solar visibility by imaging instruments onboard the spacecraft orbiting the Sun-Earth Lagrange points L1, L4 and L5, respectively. An optimal arrival time for vertical periodic orbits stationed at L4 and L5 is determined based on geometric considerations that ensure maximum visibility of solar poles or higher latitudes per year. For a different set of orbits around the three Lagrange points (L1, L4 and L5), we calculate the visibility of the solar surface (i.e., observation days per year) as a function of the solar latitude. We also analyze where the solar limb viewed from one of the three Sun-Earth Lagrange points under consideration is projected onto the solar surface visible to the other two. This analysis particularly aims at determining the feasibility of studying solar eruptions, such as flares and coronal mass ejections, with coordinated observations of off-limb erupting coronal structures and their on-disk magnetic footpoints. In addition, visibility analysis of a feature (such as sunspots) on the solar surface is made for multiple spacecraft in various types of orbits with different inclinations to quantify the improvement in continuous tracking of the target feature for studying its long-term evolution from emergence, growth and to decay. A comprehensive comparison of observations from single (L1), double (L1 and L4) and multi-space missions (L1, L4 and L5) is carried out through our solar visibility analysis, and this may help us to design future space missions of constructing multiple solar observatories at the Sun-Earth Lagrange points.</description>

      <title>Flaring Activity for Low-Mass Stars in the $\beta$ Pictoris Moving Group</title>

Abstract: Stellar flares from K and M dwarfs release panchromatic radiation characterized by a significantly higher brightness temperature ($\sim$9-20 kK) than the star. The increased frequency of magnetic activity on young low-mass stars results in the energy released during flaring events becoming a notable contributor to the radiation environment. This study focuses on the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group (24 $\pm$ 3 Myr) for the analysis of young, low-mass star flaring rates within the framework of larger flare studies. The calibration of long-term optical flare statistics is crucial to updating flare activity-age relations and the interpretation of exoplanet atmosphere observations. Using the $\beta$ Pictoris moving group, we develop a modular flare extraction pipeline sensitive to low-mass stellar flares in observations from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. This pipeline is built to characterize flare properties of these stars such as total energy and cumulative flare rate. Consistent with previous studies, this sample (N=49) shows higher cumulative flare rates than early type and old field stars by at least an order of magnitude. Fitted flare frequency distributions for both early and late type M dwarfs show an average slope of $1.58 \pm 0.23$ with earlier stars flaring with lower or similar rates to late types. A typical member in this sample has daily ($\mathrm{\sim 1 \, d^{-1}}$ ) flares with TESS band energies of $10^{32} - 10^{33}$ ergs. The optical flare rates and energies for this group provide essential context into the co-evolution of host stars and associated planets.</description>

      <title>JWST-TST DREAMS: Quartz Clouds in the Atmosphere of WASP-17b</title>

Abstract: Clouds are prevalent in many of the exoplanet atmospheres that have been observed to date. For transiting exoplanets, we know if clouds are present because they mute spectral features and cause wavelength-dependent scattering. While the exact composition of these clouds is largely unknown, this information is vital to understanding the chemistry and energy budget of planetary atmospheres. In this work, we observe one transit of the hot Jupiter WASP-17b with JWST's MIRI LRS and generate a transmission spectrum from 5-12 $\rm{\mu}$m. These wavelengths allow us to probe absorption due to the vibrational modes of various predicted cloud species. Our transmission spectrum shows additional opacity centered at 8.6 $\rm{\mu}$m, and detailed atmospheric modeling and retrievals identify this feature as SiO$_2$(s) (quartz) clouds. The SiO$_2$(s) clouds model is preferred at 3.5-4.2$\sigma$ versus a cloud-free model and at 2.6$\sigma$ versus a generic aerosol prescription. We find the SiO$_2$(s) clouds are comprised of small ${\sim}0.01$ $\rm{\mu}$m particles, which extend to high altitudes in the atmosphere. The atmosphere also shows a depletion of H$_2$O, a finding consistent with the formation of high-temperature aerosols from oxygen-rich species. This work is part of a series of studies by our JWST Telescope Scientist Team (JWST-TST), in which we will use Guaranteed Time Observations to perform Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS).</description>

      <title>Equations of State, Thermodynamics, and Miscibility Curves for Jovian Planet and Giant Exoplanet Evolutionary Models</title>

Abstract: The equation of state of hydrogen-helium (H-He) mixtures plays a vital role in the evolution and structure of gas giant planets and exoplanets. Recent equations of state that account for hydrogen-helium interactions, coupled with hydrogen-helium immiscibility curves, can now produce more physical evolutionary models, such as accounting for helium rain with greater fidelity than in the past. In this work, we present a set of tools for planetary evolution\footnote{All tables of thermodynamic quantities and derivatives are available at \url{https://github.com/Rob685/hhe_eos_misc}, along with a unified Python interface. Tutorials demonstrating the interface are also available in the repository.} that provides a Python interface for existing tables of useful thermodynamic quantities, state-of-the-art H-He equations of state, and pressure-dependent H-He immiscibility curves. In particular, for a collection of independent variable choices, we provide scripts to calculate the variety of thermodynamic derivatives used to model convection and energy transport. These include the chemical potential derived from the internal energy, which is a modeling necessity in the presence of composition gradients when entropy is the other primary variable. Finally, an entropy-based convection formalism is presented and fully described that highlights the physical differences between adiabatic and isentropic interior models. This centralized resource is meant to facilitate both giant planet structural and evolutionary modeling and the entry of new research groups into the field of giant planet modeling.</description>

      <title>Planet formation regulated by galactic-scale interstellar turbulence</title>

Abstract: Planet formation occurs over a few Myr within protoplanetary discs of dust and gas, which are often assumed to evolve in isolation. However, extended gaseous structures have been uncovered around many protoplanetary discs, suggestive of late-stage in-fall from the interstellar medium (ISM). To quantify the prevalence of late-stage in-fall, we apply an excursion set formalism to track the local density and relative velocity of the ISM over the disc lifetime. We then combine the theoretical Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion rate with a simple disc evolution model, anchoring stellar accretion time-scales to observational constraints. Disc lifetimes, masses, stellar accretion rates and gaseous outer radii as a function of stellar mass and age are remarkably well-reproduced by our simple model that includes only ISM accretion. We estimate $20{-}70$ percent of discs may be mostly composed of material accreted in the most recent half of their lifetime, suggesting disc properties are not a direct test of isolated evolution models. Our calculations indicate that BHL accretion can also supply sufficient energy to drive turbulence in the outer regions of protoplanetary discs with viscous $\alpha_\mathrm{SS} \sim 10^{-5}- 10^{-1}$, although we emphasise that angular momentum transport and particularly accretion onto the star may still be driven by internal processes. Our simple approach can be easily applied to semi-analytic models. Our results represent a compelling case for regulation of planet formation by large-scale turbulence, with broad consequences for planet formation theory. This possibility urgently motivates deep observational surveys to confirm or refute our findings.</description>

      <title>An asymmetrical body: example of analytical solution for the rotation matrix in elementary functions and Dzhanibekov effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11518v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solved the Poisson equations, obtaining their exact solution in elementary functions for the rotation matrix of a free asymmetrical body with angular velocity vector lying on separatrices. This allows us to discuss the temporal evolution of Dzhanibekov's nut directly in the Laboratory system, where it is observed. The rotation matrix depends on two parameters with clear physical interpretation as a frequency and a damping factor of the solution. Qualitative analysis of the solution shows that it properly describes a single-jump Dzhanibekov effect.</description>
