      <title>TeamPath: Building MultiModal Pathology Experts with Reasoning AI Copilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in AI have introduced several strong models in computational pathology to usher it into the era of multi-modal diagnosis, analysis, and interpretation. However, the current pathology-specific visual language models still lack capacities in making diagnosis with rigorous reasoning paths as well as handling divergent tasks, and thus challenges of building AI Copilots for real scenarios still exist. Here we introduce TeamPath, an AI system powered by reinforcement learning and router-enhanced solutions based on large-scale histopathology multimodal datasets, to work as a virtual assistant for expert-level disease diagnosis, patch-level information summarization, and cross-modality generation to integrate transcriptomic information for the clinical usage. We also collaborate with pathologists from Yale School of Medicine to demonstrate that TeamPath can assist them in working more efficiently by identifying and correcting expert conclusions and reasoning paths. Overall, TeamPath can flexibly choose the best settings according to the needs, and serve as an innovative and reliable system for information communication across different modalities and experts.</description>

      <title>Dual-Path Knowledge-Augmented Contrastive Alignment Network for Spatially Resolved Transcriptomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) is a technology that measures gene expression profiles within tissue sections while retaining spatial context. It reveals localized gene expression patterns and tissue heterogeneity, both of which are essential for understanding disease etiology. However, its high cost has driven efforts to predict spatial gene expression from whole slide images. Despite recent advancements, current methods still face significant limitations, such as under-exploitation of high-level biological context, over-reliance on exemplar retrievals, and inadequate alignment of heterogeneous modalities. To address these challenges, we propose DKAN, a novel Dual-path Knowledge-Augmented contrastive alignment Network that predicts spatially resolved gene expression by integrating histopathological images and gene expression profiles through a biologically informed approach. Specifically, we introduce an effective gene semantic representation module that leverages the external gene database to provide additional biological insights, thereby enhancing gene expression prediction. Further, we adopt a unified, one-stage contrastive learning paradigm, seamlessly combining contrastive learning and supervised learning to eliminate reliance on exemplars, complemented with an adaptive weighting mechanism. Additionally, we propose a dual-path contrastive alignment module that employs gene semantic features as dynamic cross-modal coordinators to enable effective heterogeneous feature integration. Through extensive experiments across three public ST datasets, DKAN demonstrates superior performance over state-of-the-art models, establishing a new benchmark for spatial gene expression prediction and offering a powerful tool for advancing biological and clinical research.</description>

      <title>SynCell: Contextualized Drug Synergy Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: Drug synergy is strongly influenced by cellular context. Variations in protein interaction landscapes and pathway activities across cell types can reshape how drugs act in combination. However, most existing models overlook this heterogeneity and rely on static or bulk level protein protein interaction networks that ignore cell specific molecular wiring. With the availability of single cell transcriptomic data, it is now possible to reconstruct cell line specific interactomes, offering a new foundation for contextualized drug synergy modeling.
  Results: We present SynCell, a contextualized drug synergy framework that integrates drug protein, protein protein, and protein cell line relations within a unified graph architecture. SynCell leverages single cell derived, cell line specific PPI networks to embed the molecular context in which drugs act, and employs graph convolutional learning to model how pharmacological effects propagate through cell specific signaling networks. This formulation treats synergy prediction as a cell line contextualized drug drug interaction problem. Across two large scale benchmarks (NCI ALMANAC and ONeil), SynCell consistently outperforms state of the art baselines including DeepDDS, HypergraphSynergy, and HERMES, especially in predicting synergies involving unseen drugs or novel cell lines. Ablation analyses show that contextualizing PPIs with single cell resolution yields substantial gains in generalization and biological interpretability.</description>

      <title>Detecting Discontinuities in the Topology of Alzheimers gene Co-expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) emerges from a complex interplay of molecular, cellular, and network-level disturbances that are not easily captured by traditional reductionist frameworks. Conventional analyses of gene expression often rely on thresholded correlation networks or clustering-based module detection, approaches that may obscure nonlinear structure and higher-order organization. Here, we introduce a comparative topological framework that makes use of topological data analysis (TDA) and the Mapper algorithm to detect discontinuities - localized disruptions in the topology of gene co-expression space between healthy and AD brain tissue. Using gene expression data from 3 brain regions, we mapped how AD reshapes the global topology of gene-gene relationships. Discontinuity hotspots were identified via variability-based node scoring and subjected to Gene Ontology Biological Process enrichment analysis. This work illustrates the potential of TDA to uncover disease-relevant structure in high-dimensional transcriptomic data and motivates broader application of shape-based comparative methods in neurodegeneration research and other areas that benefit from comparative analysis.</description>

      <title>On the role of fractional Brownian motion in models of chemotaxis and stochastic gradient ascent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell migration often exhibits long-range temporal correlations and anomalous diffusion, even in the absence of external guidance cues such as chemical gradients or topographical constraints. These observations raise a fundamental question: do such correlations simply reflect internal cellular processes, or do they enhance a cell's ability to navigate complex environments? In this work, we explore how temporally correlated noise (modeled using fractional Brownian motion) influences chemotactic search dynamics. Through computational experiments, we show that superdiffusive motion, when combined with gradient-driven migration, enables robust exploration of the chemoattractant landscape. Cells reliably reach the global maximum of the concentration field, even in the presence of spatial noise, secondary cues, or irregular signal geometry. We quantify this behavior by analyzing the distribution of first hitting times under varying degrees of temporal correlation. Notably, our results are consistent across diverse conditions, including flat and curved substrates, and scenarios involving both primary and self-generated chemotactic signals. Beyond biological implications, these findings also offer insight into the design of optimization and sampling algorithms that benefit from structured stochasticity.</description>

      <title>Beyond Protein Language Models: An Agentic LLM Framework for Mechanistic Enzyme Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Genie-CAT, a tool-augmented large-language-model (LLM) system designed to accelerate scientific hypothesis generation in protein design. Using metalloproteins (e.g., ferredoxins) as a case study, Genie-CAT integrates four capabilities -- literature-grounded reasoning through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), structural parsing of Protein Data Bank files, electrostatic potential calculations, and machine-learning prediction of redox properties -- into a unified agentic workflow. By coupling natural-language reasoning with data-driven and physics-based computation, the system generates mechanistically interpretable, testable hypotheses linking sequence, structure, and function. In proof-of-concept demonstrations, Genie-CAT autonomously identifies residue-level modifications near [Fe--S] clusters that affect redox tuning, reproducing expert-derived hypotheses in a fraction of the time. The framework highlights how AI agents combining language models with domain-specific tools can bridge symbolic reasoning and numerical simulation, transforming LLMs from conversational assistants into partners for computational discovery.</description>

      <title>AI-driven Generation of MALDI-TOF MS for Microbial Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has become a cornerstone technology in clinical microbiology, enabling rapid and accurate microbial identification. However, the development of data-driven diagnostic models remains limited by the lack of sufficiently large, balanced, and standardized spectral datasets. This study investigates the use of deep generative models to synthesize realistic MALDI-TOF MS spectra, aiming to overcome data scarcity and support the development of robust machine learning tools in microbiology.
  We adapt and evaluate three generative models, Variational Autoencoders (MALDIVAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (MALDIGANs), and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (MALDIffusion), for the conditional generation of microbial spectra guided by species labels. Generation is conditioned on species labels, and spectral fidelity and diversity are assessed using diverse metrics.
  Our experiments show that synthetic data generated by MALDIVAE, MALDIGAN, and MALDIffusion are statistically and diagnostically comparable to real measurements, enabling classifiers trained exclusively on synthetic samples to reach performance levels similar to those trained on real data. While all models faithfully reproduce the peak structure and variability of MALDI-TOF spectra, MALDIffusion obtains this fidelity at a substantially higher computational cost, and MALDIGAN shows competitive but slightly less stable behaviour. In contrast, MALDIVAE offers the most favorable balance between realism, stability, and efficiency. Furthermore, augmenting minority species with synthetic spectra markedly improves classification accuracy, effectively mitigating class imbalance and domain mismatch without compromising the authenticity of the generated data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study enhances breast cancer prediction by using large language models to infer the likelihood of confounding diseases, namely diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease, from routine clinical data. These AI-generated features improved Random Forest model performance, particularly for LLMs like Gemma (3.9%) and Llama (6.4%). The approach shows promise for noninvasive prescreening and clinical integration, supporting improved early detection and shared decision-making in breast cancer diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Predictive Modeling of Microfluidic Cancer Cell Separation Using a Deterministic Lateral Displacement Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic Lateral Displacement (DLD) devices are widely used in microfluidics for label-free, size-based separation of particles and cells, with particular promise in isolating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for early cancer diagnostics. This study focuses on the optimization of DLD design parameters, such as row shift fraction, post size, and gap distance, to enhance the selective isolation of lung cancer cells based on their physical properties. To overcome the challenges of rare CTC detection and reduce reliance on computationally intensive simulations, machine learning models including gradient boosting, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, and multilayer perceptron (MLP) regressors are employed. Trained on a large, numerically validated dataset, these models predict particle trajectories and identify optimal device configurations, enabling high-throughput and cost-effective DLD design. Beyond trajectory prediction, the models aid in isolating critical design variables, offering a systematic, data-driven framework for automated DLD optimization. This integrative approach advances the development of scalable and precise microfluidic systems for cancer diagnostics, contributing to the broader goals of early detection and personalized medicine.</description>

      <title>CLTree: A Tool for Annotating, Rooting, and Evaluating Phylogenetic Trees Leveraging Genomic Lineages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collapse Lineage Tree (CLTree) is a software tool that annotates, roots, and evaluates phylogenetic trees by using lineages. A recursive algorithm was designed to annotate the branches by the common taxonomic lineage of its descendants in a rooted tree. For an unrooted tree, it determines the root that best conforms to the taxonomic system based on the aforementioned lineage annotations. Based on the lineage annotations of notes, CLTree infers the monophyly of taxonomic units and quantifies the concordance between the phylogenetic tree and the taxonomic system base on Shannon entropy. The core algorithm of CLTree is highly efficient with linear complexity, capable of processing phylogenetic trees with 17,955 terminal nodes within one second. We believe that CLTree will serve as a powerful tool for study of evolution and taxonomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a powerful framework for analyzing biomolecular dynamics trajectories, enabling efficient representations that capture essential system dynamics and facilitate mechanistic studies. We propose a neural network architecture incorporating Fourier Transform analysis to process trajectory data, achieving dual objectives: eliminating high-frequency noise while preserving biologically critical slow conformational dynamics, and establishing an isotropic representation space through the last hidden layer for enhanced dynamical quantification. Comparative protein simulations demonstrate our approach generates more uniform feature distributions than linear regression methods, evidenced by smoother state similarity matrices and clearer classification boundaries. Moreover, by using saliency score, we identified key structural determinants linked to effective energy landscapes governing system dynamics. We believe that the fusion of neural network features with physical order parameters creates a robust analytical framework for advancing biomolecular trajectory analysis.</description>

      <title>TRIDENT: A Trimodal Cascade Generative Framework for Drug and RNA-Conditioned Cellular Morphology Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately modeling the relationship between perturbations, transcriptional responses, and phenotypic changes is essential for building an AI Virtual Cell (AIVC). However, existing methods typically constrained to modeling direct associations, such as Perturbation $\rightarrow$ RNA or Perturbation $\rightarrow$ Morphology, overlook the crucial causal link from RNA to morphology. To bridge this gap, we propose TRIDENT, a cascade generative framework that synthesizes realistic cellular morphology by conditioning on both the perturbation and the corresponding gene expression profile. To train and evaluate this task, we construct MorphoGene, a new dataset pairing L1000 gene expression with Cell Painting images for 98 compounds. TRIDENT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving up to 7-fold improvement with strong generalization to unseen compounds. In a case study on docetaxel, we validate that RNA-guided synthesis accurately produces the corresponding phenotype. An ablation study further confirms that this RNA conditioning is essential for the model's high fidelity. By explicitly modeling transcriptome-phenome mapping, TRIDENT provides a powerful in silico tool and moves us closer to a predictive virtual cell.</description>

      <title>Learning the principles of T cell antigen discernment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T cells are central to the adaptive immune response, capable of detecting pathogenic antigens while ignoring healthy tissues with remarkable specificity and sensitivity. Quantitatively understanding how T cell receptors (TCRs) discriminate among antigens requires biophysical models and theoretical analysis of signaling networks. Here, we review current theoretical frameworks of antigen recognition in the context of modern experimental and computational advances. Antigen potency spans a continuum and exhibits nonlinear effects within complex mixtures, challenging discrete classification and simple threshold-based models. This complexity motivates the development of models such as adaptive kinetic proofreading, which integrate both activating and inhibitory signals. Advances in high-throughput technologies now generate large-scale, quantitative datasets, enabling the refinement of such models through statistical and machine learning approaches. This convergence of theory, data, and computation promises deeper insights into immune decision-making and opens new avenues for rational immunotherapy design.</description>

Abstract: We design an efficient algorithm that outputs tests for identifying predominantly homogeneous subcohorts of patients from large in-homogeneous datasets. Our theoretical contribution is a rounding technique, similar to that of Goemans and Wiliamson (1995), that approximates the optimal solution within a factor of $0.82$. As an application, we use our algorithm to trade-off sensitivity for specificity to systematically identify clinically interesting homogeneous subcohorts of patients in the RNA microarray dataset for breast cancer from Curtis et al. (2012). One such clinically interesting subcohort suggests a link between LXR over-expression and BRCA2 and MSH6 methylation levels for patients in that subcohort.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting whether a molecule can cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a key step in early-stage neuropharmaceutical development, directly influencing both research efficiency and success rates in drug discovery. Traditional empirical methods based on physicochemical properties are prone to systematic misjudgements due to their reliance on static rules. Early machine learning models, although data-driven, often suffer from limited capacity, poor generalization, and insufficient interpretability. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) methods have become essential tools for predicting BBB permeability and guiding related drug design, owing to their ability to model molecular structures and capture complex biological mechanisms. This article systematically reviews the evolution of this field-from deep neural networks to graph-based structural modeling-highlighting the advantages of multi-task and multimodal learning strategies in identifying mechanism-relevant variables. We further explore the emerging potential of generative models and causal inference methods for integrating permeability prediction with mechanism-aware drug design.

      <title>Adapting Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Bifurcation Detection in Ecological Migration Models</title>

Abstract: In this study, we explore the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to the analysis of bifurcation phenomena in ecological migration models. By integrating the fundamental principles of diffusion-advection-reaction equations with deep learning techniques, we address the complexities of species migration dynamics, particularly focusing on the detection and analysis of Hopf bifurcations. Traditional numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) often involve intricate calculations and extensive computational resources, which can be restrictive in high-dimensional problems. In contrast, PINNs offer a more flexible and efficient alternative, bypassing the need for grid discretization and allowing for mesh-free solutions. Our approach leverages the DeepXDE framework, which enhances the computational efficiency and applicability of PINNs in solving high-dimensional PDEs. We validate our results against conventional methods and demonstrate that PINNs not only provide accurate bifurcation predictions but also offer deeper insights into the underlying dynamics of diffusion processes. Despite these advantages, the study also identifies challenges such as the high computational costs and the sensitivity of PINN performance to network architecture and hyperparameter settings. Future work will focus on optimizing these algorithms and expanding their application to other complex systems involving bifurcations. The findings from this research have significant implications for the modeling and analysis of ecological systems, providing a powerful tool for predicting and understanding complex dynamical behaviors.</description>

      <title>KINDLE: Knowledge-Guided Distillation for Prior-Free Gene Regulatory Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gene regulatory network (GRN) inference serves as a cornerstone for deciphering cellular decision-making processes. Early approaches rely exclusively on gene expression data, thus their predictive power remain fundamentally constrained by the vast combinatorial space of potential gene-gene interactions. Subsequent methods integrate prior knowledge to mitigate this challenge by restricting the solution space to biologically plausible interactions. However, we argue that the effectiveness of these approaches is contingent upon the precision of prior information and the reduction in the search space will circumscribe the models' potential for novel biological discoveries. To address these limitations, we introduce KINDLE, a three-stage framework that decouples GRN inference from prior knowledge dependencies. KINDLE trains a teacher model that integrates prior knowledge with temporal gene expression dynamics and subsequently distills this encoded knowledge to a student model, enabling accurate GRN inference solely from expression data without access to any prior. KINDLE achieves state-of-the-art performance across four benchmark datasets. Notably, it successfully identifies key transcription factors governing mouse embryonic development and precisely characterizes their functional roles. In mouse hematopoietic stem cell data, KINDLE accurately predicts fate transition outcomes following knockout of two critical regulators (Gata1 and Spi1). These biological validations demonstrate our framework's dual capability in maintaining topological inference precision while preserving discovery potential for novel biological mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Investigating the consequences of mechanical ventilation in clinical intensive care settings through an evolutionary game-theoretic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems (so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using empirical and game-theoretic elements.</description>

      <title>A Diffusion Model to Shrink Proteins While Maintaining Their Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07390v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many proteins useful in modern medicine or bioengineering are challenging to make in the lab, fuse with other proteins in cells, or deliver to tissues in the body, because their sequences are too long. Shortening these sequences typically involves costly, time-consuming experimental campaigns. Ideally, we could instead use modern models of massive databases of sequences from nature to learn how to propose shrunken proteins that resemble sequences found in nature. Unfortunately, these models struggle to efficiently search the combinatorial space of all deletions, and are not trained with inductive biases to learn how to delete. To address this gap, we propose SCISOR, a novel discrete diffusion model that deletes letters from sequences to generate protein samples that resemble those found in nature. To do so, SCISOR trains a de-noiser to reverse a forward noising process that adds random insertions to natural sequences. As a generative model, SCISOR fits evolutionary sequence data competitively with previous large models. In evaluation, SCISOR achieves state-of-the-art predictions of the functional effects of deletions on ProteinGym. Finally, we use the SCISOR de-noiser to shrink long protein sequences, and show that its suggested deletions result in significantly more realistic proteins and more often preserve functional motifs than previous models of evolutionary sequences.</description>
