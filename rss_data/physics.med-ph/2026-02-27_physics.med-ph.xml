      <title>Evaluating the resolution of AI-based accelerated MR reconstruction using a deep learning-based model observer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a deep learning-based model observer (DLMO) to evaluate a multi-coil sensitivity encoding parallel MRI system at different accelerations on the Rayleigh discrimination task as a surrogate measure of resolution. We inserted Gaussian-convolved doublet and singlet signals into the white matter area of synthetic brain images. K-space raw data were acquired by using a simulated MR imaging system at acceleration factors of one (fully sampled), four and eight. These raw data were reconstructed using a conventional root-sum-of-squares (rSOS) method and an U-Net method. DLMOs were first trained with fully sampled images and then re-trained for each acceleration using a transfer learning approach. These DLMOs had a similar discrimination performance as trained human readers, using a human-label alignment training strategy. The resolution of rSOS- and U-Net-reconstructed images was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We observed that the U-Net method yielded significantly higher PSNR and SSIM than rSOS across different accelerations. However, task-based evaluation using the proposed DLMO revealed that the U-Net underperformed relative to the fully sampled reconstruction (i.e. rSOS 1x). Although U-Net at an acceleration factor of four exhibited modest gains over rSOS at the same acceleration for short signals, its AUC decreased by approximately 25% and 5% for 4 mm and 5 mm signals, respectively, compared with rSOS 1x. Comparable declines in U-Net-obtained AUC relative to rSOS 1x were also observed at acceleration factor of eight. These results demonstrate that AI-based accelerated MR reconstruction may produce visually pleasing images but may not achieve performance comparable to that of rSOS 1x. The proposed DLMO approach may be employed to characterize the discriminative efficacy of AI-based undersampled reconstruction in MRI.</description>

      <title>Continuous Blood Monitoring with Particle-based Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the circulatory system functions as a continuous source of physiological data, contemporary diagnostics remain bound to intermittent, time-delayed assessments. To resolve this, we present a framework for ubiquitous hematological profiling driven by Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC). We demonstrate how electromagnetic signals can be exploited to monitor blood in real-time, effectively converting them into diagnostic tools. We analyze the biological foundations of blood, review existing Complete Blood Count (CBC) and sensing technologies, and detail a novel pipeline for continuous blood monitoring. Furthermore, we discuss the potential applications of deploying these devices to enable real-time CBC and biomarker detection, ultimately revolutionizing how we predict, detect, and manage individual and public health.</description>
