      <title>Quantum resources of quantum and classical variational methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational techniques have long been at the heart of atomic, solid-state, and many-body physics. They have recently extended to quantum and classical machine learning, providing a basis for representing quantum states via neural networks. These methods generally aim to minimize the energy of a given ans\"atz, though open questions remain about the expressivity of quantum and classical variational ans\"atze. The connection between variational techniques and quantum computing, through variational quantum algorithms, offers opportunities to explore the quantum complexity of classical methods. We demonstrate how the concept of non-stabilizerness, or magic, can create a bridge between quantum information and variational techniques and we show that energy accuracy is a necessary but not always sufficient condition for accuracy in non-stabilizerness. Through systematic benchmarking of neural network quantum states, matrix product states, and variational quantum methods, we show that while classical techniques are more accurate in non-stabilizerness, not accounting for the symmetries of the system can have a severe impact on this accuracy. Our findings form a basis for a universal expressivity characterization of both quantum and classical variational methods.</description>

      <title>Engineering Quantum Error Correction Codes Using Evolutionary Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction and the use of quantum error correction codes is likely to be essential for the realisation of practical quantum computing. Because the error models of quantum devices vary widely, quantum codes which are tailored for a particular error model may have much better performance. In this work, we present a novel evolutionary algorithm which searches for an optimal stabiliser code for a given error model, number of physical qubits and number of encoded qubits. We demonstrate an efficient representation of stabiliser codes as binary strings -- this allows for random generation of valid stabiliser codes, as well as mutation and crossing of codes. Our algorithm finds stabiliser codes whose distance closely matches the best-known-distance codes of codetables.de for n &lt;= 20 physical qubits. We perform a search for optimal distance CSS codes, and compare their distance to the best-known-codes. Finally, we show that the algorithm can be used to optimise stabiliser codes for biased error models, demonstrating a significant improvement in the undetectable error rate for [[12, 1]] codes versus the best-known-distance code with the same parameters. As part of this work, we also introduce an evolutionary algorithm QDistEvol for finding the distance of quantum error correction codes.</description>

      <title>Check-probe spectroscopy of lifetime-limited emitters in bulk-grown silicon carbide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid-state single-photon emitters provide a versatile platform for exploring quantum technologies such as optically connected quantum networks. A key challenge is to ensure optical coherence and spectral stability of the emitters. Here, we introduce a high-bandwidth `check-probe' scheme to quantitatively measure (laser-induced) spectral diffusion and ionisation rates, as well as homogeneous linewidths. We demonstrate these methods on single V2 centers in commercially available bulk-grown 4H-silicon carbide. Despite observing significant spectral diffusion under laser illumination ($\gtrsim$ GHz/s), the optical transitions are narrow ($\sim$35 MHz), and remain stable in the dark ($\gtrsim$1 s). Through Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg interferometry, we determine the optical coherence to be near-lifetime limited ($T_2 = 16.4(4)$ ns), hinting at the potential for using bulk-grown materials for developing quantum technologies. These results advance our understanding of spectral diffusion of quantum emitters in semiconductor materials, and may have applications for studying charge dynamics across other platforms.</description>

      <title>Entanglemons: Cross-platform protected qubits from entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial ingredient for scalable fault-tolerant quantum computing is the construction of logical qubits with low error rates and intrinsic noise protection. We propose a cross-platform construction for such hardware-level noise-protection in which the qubits are protected from depolarizing (relaxation) and dephasing errors induced by local noise. These logical qubits arise from the entanglement between two internal degrees of freedom, hence - entanglemons. Our construction is based on the emergence of collective degrees of freedom from a generalized coherent state construction, similar in spirit to spin coherent states, of a set of such internally entangled units. These degrees of freedom, for a finite number of units, parametrize the quantized version of complex projective space $\mathbb{C}$P(3). The noise protection of the entanglemon qubit is then a consequence of a weakly coupled emergent degree of freedom arising due to the non-linear geometry of complex projective space. We present two simple models for entanglemons which are platform agnostic, provide varying levels of protection and in which the qubit basis states are the two lowest energy states with a higher energy gap to other states. We end by commenting on how entanglemons could be realized in platforms ranging from superconducting circuits and trapped ion platforms to possibly also quantum Hall skyrmions in graphene and quantum dots in semiconductors. The inherent noise protection in our models combined with the platform agnosticism highlights the potential of encoding information in additional weakly coupled emergent degrees of freedom arising in non-linear geometrical spaces and curved phase spaces, thereby proposing a different route to achieve scalable fault-tolerance.</description>

      <title>Anticoncentration and state design of random tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum random tensor network states where the bond dimensions scale polynomially with the system size, $N$. Specifically, we examine the delocalization properties of random Matrix Product States (RMPS) in the computational basis by deriving an exact analytical expression for the Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR) of any degree, applicable to both open and closed boundary conditions. For bond dimensions $\chi \sim \gamma N$, we determine the leading order of the associated overlaps probability distribution and demonstrate its convergence to the Porter-Thomas distribution, characteristic of Haar-random states, as $\gamma$ increases. Additionally, we provide numerical evidence for the frame potential, measuring the $2$-distance from the Haar ensemble, which confirms the convergence of random MPS to Haar-like behavior for $\chi \gg \sqrt{N}$. We extend this analysis to two-dimensional systems using random Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), where we similarly observe the convergence of IPRs to their Haar values for $\chi \gg \sqrt{N}$. These findings demonstrate that random tensor networks with bond dimensions scaling polynomially in the system size are fully Haar-anticoncentrated and approximate unitary designs, regardless of the spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Shadows and subsystems of generalized probabilistic theories: when tomographic incompleteness is not a loophole for contextuality proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that failures of tomographic completeness undermine assessments of nonclassicality in noncontextuality experiments. In this work, we study how such failures can indeed lead to mistaken assessments of nonclassicality. We then show that proofs of the failure of noncontextuality are robust to a very broad class of failures of tomographic completeness, including the kinds of failures that are likely to occur in real experiments. We do so by showing that such proofs actually rely on a much weaker assumption that we term relative tomographic completeness: namely, that one's experimental procedures are tomographic for each other. Thus, the failure of noncontextuality can be established even with coarse-grained, effective, emergent, or virtual degrees of freedom. This also implies that the existence of a deeper theory of nature (beyond that being probed in one's experiment) does not in and of itself pose any challenge to proofs of nonclassicality. To prove these results, we first introduce a number of useful new concepts within the framework of generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs). Most notably, we introduce the notion of a GPT subsystem, generalizing a range of preexisting notions of subsystems (including those arising from tensor products, direct sums, decoherence processes, virtual encodings, and more). We also introduce the notion of a shadow of a GPT fragment, which captures the information lost when one's states and effects are unknowingly not tomographic for one another.</description>

      <title>Hardware-efficient quantum error correction using concatenated bosonic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to solve problems of practical importance, quantum computers will likely need to incorporate quantum error correction, where a logical qubit is redundantly encoded in many noisy physical qubits. The large physical-qubit overhead typically associated with error correction motivates the search for more hardware-efficient approaches. Here, using a microfabricated superconducting quantum circuit, we realize a logical qubit memory formed from the concatenation of encoded bosonic cat qubits with an outer repetition code of distance $d=5$. The bosonic cat qubits are passively protected against bit flips using a stabilizing circuit. Cat-qubit phase-flip errors are corrected by the repetition code which uses ancilla transmons for syndrome measurement. We realize a noise-biased CX gate which ensures bit-flip error suppression is maintained during error correction. We study the performance and scaling of the logical qubit memory, finding that the phase-flip correcting repetition code operates below threshold, with logical phase-flip error decreasing with code distance from $d=3$ to $d=5$. Concurrently, the logical bit-flip error is suppressed with increasing cat-qubit mean photon number. The minimum measured logical error per cycle is on average $1.75(2)\%$ for the distance-3 code sections, and $1.65(3)\%$ for the longer distance-5 code, demonstrating the effectiveness of bit-flip error suppression throughout the error correction cycle. These results, where the intrinsic error suppression of the bosonic encodings allows us to use a hardware-efficient outer error correcting code, indicate that concatenated bosonic codes are a compelling paradigm for reaching fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Exponential speed-up of quantum annealing via n-local catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum speedup in solving optimization problems via adiabatic quantum annealing is often hindered by the closing of the energy gap during the anneal, especially when this gap scales exponentially with system size. In this work, we address this by demonstrating that for the Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem, an informed choice of $n-$local catalysts (operators involving $n$ qubits) can re-open the gap or prevent it from closing during the anneal process. By analyzing first-order phase transitions in toy instances of the MWIS problem, we identify effective forms of catalysts and also show that non-stoquasticity is not essential to avoid such phase transitions. While some of the toy problems studied might not be classically NP-hard, they reveal that $n-$local catalysts exponentially improve gap scaling and need to be connected across unfrustrated loops in the problem graph to be effective. Our analysis suggests that non-local quantum fluctuations entangling multiple qubits are key to achieving the desired quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Kochen-Specker non-contextuality through the lens of quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kochen-Specker theorem shows that it is impossible to assign sharp values to all dynamical variables in quantum mechanics in such a way that the algebraic relations among the values of dynamical variables whose self-adjoint operators commute are the same as those among the operators themselves. We point out that, for quantum theories obtained by quantizing some classical theory, this condition -- Kochen-Specker non-contextuality -- is implausible from the start because quantization usually changes algebraic relations. We illustrate this point and its relevance using various examples of dynamical variables quantized via Weyl quantization and coherent state quantization. Our observations suggest that the relevance of the Kochen-Specker theorem to the question of whether one can assign sharp values to all dynamical variables is rather limited.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory dissipative tunneling in an asymmetric double-well potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative tunneling remains a cornerstone effect in quantum mechanics. In chemistry, it plays a crucial role in governing the rates of chemical reactions, often modeled as the motion along the reaction coordinate from one potential well to another. The relative positions of energy levels in these wells strongly influences the reaction dynamics. Chemical research will benefit from a fully controllable, asymmetric double-well equipped with precise measurement capabilities of the tunneling rates. In this paper, we show that a continuously driven Kerr parametric oscillator with a third order non-linearity can be operated in the quantum regime to create a fully tunable asymmetric double-well. Our experiment leverages a low-noise, all-microwave control system with a high-efficiency readout of the which-well information. We explore the reaction rates across the landscape of tunneling resonances in parameter space. We uncover two new and counter-intuitive effects: (i) a weak asymmetry can significantly decrease the activation rates, even though the well in which the system is initialized is made shallower, and (ii) the width of the tunneling resonances alternates between narrow and broad lines as a function of the well depth and asymmetry. We predict by numerical simulations that both effects will also manifest themselves in ordinary chemical double-well systems in the quantum regime. Our work paves the way for analog molecule simulators based on quantum superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>A Roadmap for Simulating Chemical Dynamics on a Parametrically Driven Bosonic Quantum Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical reactions are commonly described by the reactive flux transferring population from reactants to products across a double-well free energy barrier. Dynamics often involves barrier recrossing and quantum effects like tunneling, zero-point energy motion and interference, which traditional rate theories, such as transition-state theory, do not consider. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of simulating reaction dynamics using a parametrically driven bosonic superconducting Kerr-cat device. This approach provides control over parameters defining the double-well free energy profile, as well as external factors like temperature and the coupling strength between the reaction coordinate and the thermal bath of non-reactive degrees of freedom. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this protocol by showing that the dynamics of proton transfer reactions in prototypical benchmark model systems, such as hydrogen bonded dimers of malonaldehyde and DNA base pairs, could be accurately simulated on currently accessible Kerr-cat devices.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Feature Embedding Placement in the Ansatz of a Quantum Kernel in QSVMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing a useful feature map for a quantum kernel is a critical task when attempting to achieve an advantage over classical machine learning models. The choice of circuit architecture, i.e. how feature-dependent gates should be interwoven with other gates is a relatively unexplored problem and becomes very important when using a model of quantum kernels called Quantum Embedding Kernels (QEK). We study and categorize various architectural patterns in QEKs and show that existing architectural styles do not behave as the literature supposes. We also produce a novel alternative architecture based on the old ones and show that it performs equally well while containing fewer gates than its older counterparts.</description>

      <title>Detecting unfaithful entanglement by multiple fidelities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certifying entanglement for unknown quantum states experimentally is a fundamental problem in quantum computing and quantum physics. Because of being easy to implement, a most popular approach for this problem in modern quantum experiments is detecting target quantum states with fidelity-based entanglement witnesses. Specifically, if the fidelity between a target state and an entangled pure state exceeds a certain value, the target state can be guaranteed to be entangled. Recently, however, it has been realized that there exist so-called unfaithful quantum states, which can be entangled, but their entanglement cannot be certified by any fidelity-based entanglement witnesses. In this paper, by specific examples we show that if one makes a slight modification to fidelity-based entanglement witnesses by combining multiple fidelities together, it is still possible to certify entanglement for unfaithful quantum states with this popular technique. Particularly, we will analyze the mathematical structure of the modified entanglement witnesses, and propose an algorithm that can search for the optimal designs for them.</description>

      <title>Scalable &amp; Noise-Robust Communication Advantage of Multipartite Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed computing, involving multiple servers collaborating on designated computations, faces a critical challenge in optimizing inter-server communication -- an issue central to the study of communication complexity. Quantum resources offer advantages over classical methods in addressing this challenge. In this work, we investigate a distributed computing scenario with multiple senders and a single receiver, establishing a scalable advantage of multipartite quantum entanglement in mitigating communication complexity. Specifically, we demonstrate that when the receiver and the senders share a multi-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state -- a quintessential form of genuine multipartite entanglement -- certain global functions of the distributed inputs can be computed with only one bit of classical communication from each sender. In contrast, without entanglement, two bits of communication are required from all but one sender. Consequently, quantum entanglement reduces communication overhead by (n-1) bits for n senders, allowing for arbitrary scaling with an increasing number of senders. We also show that the entanglement-based protocol exhibits significant robustness under white noise, thereby establishing the potential for experimental realization of this novel quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Coherent dynamics of a nuclear-spin-isomer superposition</title>

Abstract: Preserving quantum coherence with the increase of a system's size and complexity is a major challenge. Molecules, with their diverse sizes and complexities and many degrees of freedom, are an excellent platform for studying the transition from quantum to classical behavior. While most quantum-control studies of molecules focus on vibrations and rotations, we focus here on creating a quantum superposition between two nuclear-spin isomers of the same molecule. We present a scheme that exploits an avoided crossing in the spectrum to create strong coupling between two uncoupled nuclear-spin-isomer states, hence creating an isomeric qubit. We model our scheme using a four-level Hamiltonian and explore the coherent dynamics in the different regimes and parameters of our system. Our four-level model and approach can be applied to other systems with a similar energy-level structure.</description>

      <title>Generation of strong mechanical squeezing through the joint effect of two-tone driving and parametric pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an innovative scheme to efficiently prepare strong mechanical squeezing through utilizing the synergistic mechanism of two-tone driving and parametric pumping in an optomechanical system. By reasonable choosing the system parameters, the proposal highlights the following prominent advantages: the squeezing effect of the cavity field induced by the optical parametric amplifier can be transferred to the mechanical oscillator, which has been squeezed by the two-tone driving, and the degree of squeezing of the mechanical oscillator will surpass that obtained by any single mechanism; the joint mechanism can enhance the degree of squeezing significantly and break the 3 dB mechanical squeezing limit, which is particularly evident in range where the red/blue-detuned ratio is sub-optimal; the mechanical squeezing achieved through this distinctive joint mechanism exhibits notable robustness against both thermal noise and decay of mechanical oscillator. Our project offers a versatile and efficient approach for generating strong mechanical squeezing across a wide range of conditions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Speed limit on the production of quantumness of observables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-classical features of quantum systems can degrade when subjected to environment and noise. Here, we ask a fundamental question: What is the minimum amount of time it takes for a quantum system to exhibit non-classical features in the presence of noise? Here, we prove distinct speed limits on the quantumness of observable as the norm of the commutator of two given observables. The speed limit on such quantumness measures sets the fundamental upper bound on the rate of change of quantumness, which provides the lower bound on the time required to change the quantumness of a system by a given amount. Additionally, we have proved speed limit for the non-classical features such as quantum coherence that captures the amount of superposition in the quantum systems. We have demonstrated that obtained speed limits are attainable for physical processes of interest, and hence, these bounds can be considered to be tight.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian glide-time symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems, going beyond conventional Hermitian systems, have brought in intriguing concepts such as exceptional points and complex spectral topology as well as exotic phenomena such as non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSEs). However, previous studies on non-Hermitian systems predominantly focus on the properties of eigenstates, with rather limited discussions on non-Hermitian dynamic phenomena. Here, inspired by the celebrated success of the parity-time symmetry in non-Hermitian physics, we theoretically study a one-dimensional non-Hermitian system with glide-time reversal (GT) symmetry. We discover that the GT symmetry leads to unique physical properties and enables rich dynamic phenomena in non-Hermitian systems. Remarkably, we reveal the dynamic NHSEs that exhibit diverse behaviors across distinct dynamic phases, elucidating the richness of non-Hermitian dynamics. We establish the theoretical frameworks for understanding the rich non-Hermitian dynamic phenomena. We further show that the rich dynamic phases in the GT-symmetric systems enable the remarkable tuning of the dynamics in the bulk as well as at the edge boundaries. These include the directional wave propagation and amplification in the bulk, as well as the wave trapping and the dynamic patterns at the edge boundaries. With both the development in the theoretical framework and the study of the rich non-Hermitian dynamic phases, this work serves as a stepstone for future studies on non-Hermitian dynamics with a special emphasize on the pivotal role of the lattice symmetry.</description>

      <title>Error-Minimizing Measurements in Postselected One-Shot Symmetric Quantum State Discrimination and Acceptance as a Performance Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hypothesis testing with quantum states, given a black box containing one of the two possible states, measurement is performed to detect in favor of one of the hypotheses. In postselected hypothesis testing, a third outcome is added, corresponding to not selecting any of the hypotheses. In postselected scenario, minimum error one-shot symmetric hypothesis testing is characterized in literature conditioned on the fact that one of the selected outcomes occur. We proceed further in this direction to give the set of all possible measurements that lead to the minimum error. We have given an arbitrary error-minimizing measurement in a parametric form. Note that not selecting any of the hypotheses decimates the quality of testing. We further give an example to show that these measurements vary in quality. There is a need to discuss the quality of postselected hypothesis testing. We then characterize the quality of postselected hypothesis testing by defining a new metric acceptance and give expression of acceptance for an arbitrary error-minimizing measurement in terms of some parameters of the measurement. On the set of measurements that achieve minimum error, we have maximized the acceptance, and given an example which achieves that, thus giving an example of the best possible measurement in terms of acceptance.</description>

      <title>A Test of Empty Wave via Quantum Memory in a Weak Measurement Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, a long-standing question remains: How does a single photon traverse double slits? One intuitive picture suggests that the photon passes through only one slit, while its wavefunction splits into an ``empty" wave and a ``full" wave. However, the reality of this empty wave is yet to be verified. Here, we present a novel experimental configuration that combines quantum memory and weak measurement to investigate the nature of the empty wave. A single atomic excitation is probabilistically split between free space and a quantum memory, analogous to the two paths in a double-slit experiment. The quantum memory serves as a path detector, where single-photon Raman scattering is enhanced due to the presence of a stored spin wave, without collapsing the quantum state. This enhancement is recorded as classical information, and the spin wave stored in the quantum memory is retrieved twice, with an interference visibility of 79%. Unlike conventional weak measurement schemes, where weak values are detected during post-selection, our approach converts the weak value into classical information before interference takes place. Our results demonstrate the potential of quantum memory as a measurement device that preserves coherence while extracting partial information, offering new insights into quantum measurement.</description>

Abstract: We present a quantum heat engine based on a quantum Otto cycle, whose working substance reproduces the same outcomes of a SU(1,1) interference process at the end of each adiabatic transformation. This device takes advantage of the extraordinary quantum metrological features of the SU(1,1) interferometer to better discriminate the sources of uncertainty of relevant observables during each adiabatic stroke of the cycle. Applications to circuit QED platforms are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Thermal spectrometer for superconducting circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits provide a versatile and controllable platform for studies of fundamental quantum phenomena as well as for quantum technology applications. A conventional technique to read out the state of a quantum circuit or to characterize its properties is based on rf measurement schemes involving costly and complex instrumentation. Here we demonstrate a simple dc measurement of a thermal spectrometer to investigate properties of a superconducting circuit, in this proof-of-concept experiment a coplanar waveguide resonator. A fraction of the microwave photons in the resonator is absorbed by an on-chip bolometer, resulting in a measurable temperature rise. By monitoring the dc signal of the thermometer due to this process, we are able to determine the resonance frequency and the lineshape (quality factor) of the resonator. The demonstrated scheme, which is a simple dc measurement, has a wide band up to 200 GHz, well exceeding that of the typical rf spectrometer. Moreover, the thermal measurement yields a highly frequency independent reference level of the Lorentzian absorption signal, unlike the conventional rf measurement. In the low power regime, the measurement is fully calibration-free. Our technique thus offers an alternative spectrometer for quantum circuits, which is in many ways superior with respect to conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Graph-theoretical approach to the eigenvalue spectrum of perturbed higher-order exceptional points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exceptional points are special degeneracy points in parameter space that can arise in (effective) non-Hermitian Hamiltonians describing open quantum and wave systems. At an n-th order exceptional point, n eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors simultaneously coalesce. These coalescing eigenvalues typically exhibit a strong response to small perturbations which can be useful for sensor applications. A so-called generic perturbation with strength $\epsilon$ changes the eigenvalues proportional to the n-th root of $\epsilon$. A different eigenvalue behavior under perturbation is called non-generic. An understanding of the behavior of the eigenvalues for various types of perturbations is desirable and also crucial for applications. We advocate a graph-theoretical perspective that contributes to the understanding of perturbative effects on the eigenvalue spectrum of higher-order exceptional points, i.e. n &gt; 2. To highlight the relevance of non-generic perturbations and to give an interpretation for their occurrence, we consider an illustrative example, a system of microrings coupled by a semi-infinite waveguide with an end mirror. Furthermore, the saturation effect occurring for cavity-selective sensing in such a system is naturally explained within the graph-theoretical picture.</description>

      <title>Entanglement, Spin Squeezing and Quantum Sensing in a Spin-5/2 Heisenberg Molecular Iron(III) Triangle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study provides insights into the static and dynamic quantum properties of the trinuclear high-spin iron(III) molecular complex. Using exact diagonalization of a spin-5/2 Heisenberg triangle in a magnetic field, we model the corresponding quantum behavior of the molecular compound Fe$_3$. Our rigorous analysis employs various key metrics to explore a rich quantum behavior of this molecular compound. At sufficiently low temperatures, the bipartite negativity reveals that the pairwise entanglement between any pair of iron(III) magnetic ions of the molecular complex Fe$_3$ can be significantly enhanced by a small magnetic field. This enhancement is followed by unconventional step-like changes characterized by a sequence of plateaus and sudden downturns as the magnetic field further increases. A qualitatively similar behavior is also observed in the genuine tripartite entanglement among all three iron(III) magnetic ions in the trinuclear complex Fe$_3$. Notably, the bipartite and tripartite entanglement persist in the molecular complex Fe$_3$ up to moderate temperatures of approximately 30~K and 70~K, respectively. We also utilized a spin squeezing parameter to identify parameter regions of coherent, entangled, and squeezed states of the molecular compound Fe$_3$. Our findings demonstrate that the squeezed states, which are relevant for technological applications, can be achieved at temperatures below 15~K and magnetic fields under 25~T. Additionally, we demonstrate the achievement of quantum-enhanced sensitivity by initializing the molecular complex Fe$_3$ in Dicke states. Finally, we investigated a quantum-sensing protocol by applying a local magnetic field specifically to one iron(III) magnetic ion of the molecular compound Fe$_3$ and performing readout sequentially on one of two remaining iron(III) magnetic ions.</description>

      <title>Efficient fault-tolerant code switching via one-way transversal CNOT gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code switching is an established technique that facilitates a universal set of FT quantum gate operations by combining two QEC codes with complementary sets of gates, which each by themselves are easy to implement fault-tolerantly. In this work, we present a code switching scheme that respects the constraints of FT circuit design by only making use of transversal gates. These gates are intrinsically FT without additional qubit overhead. We analyze application of the scheme to low-distance color codes, which are suitable for operation in existing quantum processors, for instance based on trapped ions or neutral atoms. We briefly discuss connectivity constraints that arise for architectures based on superconducting qubits. Numerical simulations of circuit-level noise indicate that a logical $T$-gate, facilitated by our scheme, could outperform both flag-FT magic state injection protocols and a physical $T$-gate at low physical error rates. Transversal code switching naturally scales to code pairs of arbitrary code distance. We observe improved performance of a distance-5 protocol compared to both the distance-3 implementation and the physical gate for realistically attainable physical entangling gate error rates. We discuss how the scheme can be implemented with a large degree of parallelization, provided that logical auxiliary qubits can be prepared reliably enough. Our logical $T$-gate circumvents potentially costly magic state factories. The requirements to perform QEC and to achieve an FT universal gate set are then essentially the same: Prepare logical auxiliary qubits offline, execute transversal gates and perform fast-enough measurements. Transversal code switching thus serves to enable more practical hardware realizations of FT universal quantum computation. The scheme alleviates resource requirements for experimental demonstrations of quantum algorithms run on logical qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the occurrence of Rydberg atom-ion molecules (RAIMs) in a hybrid atom-ion system with an ion crystal trapped in a Paul trap coupled to Rydberg atoms on its either ends. To assess the feasibility of such a system, we perform a detailed Floquet analysis of the effect of the Paul trap's rf potential on the RAIMs and provide a qualitative analysis of the survival probability based on scaling laws. We conclude that the RAIM survives for sufficiently weak and low frequency traps. We then use this hybrid system and propose a scheme to utilise the common motional modes of the ion crystal to suppress (blockade) or enhance (anti-blockade) the probability of forming two RAIMs at the ends of the chain, replacing the typical blockade radius by the length of the ion crystal.</description>

      <title>Simulating the Schwinger Model with a Regularized Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schwinger model serves as a benchmark for testing non-perturbative algorithms in quantum chromodynamics (QCD), emphasizing its similarities to QCD in strong coupling regimes, primarily due to the phenomena such as confinement and charge screening. However, classical algorithms encounter challenges when simulating the Schwinger model, such as the "sign problem" and the difficulty in handling large-scale systems. These limitations motivate the exploration of alternative simulation approaches, including quantum computing techniques, to overcome the obstacles. While existing variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) methods for simulating the Schwinger model primarily rely on mathematical gradient-based optimization, which sometimes fail to provide intuitive and physically-guided optimization pathways. In contrast, the Variational Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (VQITE) method offers a physically-inspired optimization approach. Therefore, we introduce that VQITE holds promise as a potent tool for simulating the Schwinger model. However, the standard VQITE method is not sufficiently stable, as it encounters difficulties with the non-invertible matrix problem. To address this issue, we have proposed a regularized version of the VQITE, which we have named the Regularized-VQITE (rVQITE) method, as it incorporates a truncation-based approach. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed rVQITE approach achieves better performance and exhibits faster convergence compared to other related techniques. We employ the rVQITE method to simulate the phase diagrams of various physical observables in the Schwinger model, and the resulting phase boundaries are in agreement with those obtained from an exact computational approach.</description>

      <title>Efficient Entanglement Routing for Satellite-Aerial-Terrestrial Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of 6G and beyond, space-aerial-terrestrial quantum networks (SATQNs) are shaping the future of the global-scale quantum Internet. This paper investigates the collaboration among satellite, aerial, and terrestrial quantum networks to efficiently transmit high-fidelity quantum entanglements over long distances. We begin with a comprehensive overview of existing satellite-, aerial-, and terrestrial-based quantum networks. Subsequently, we address the entanglement routing problem with the objective of maximizing quantum network throughput by jointly optimizing path selection and entanglement generation rates (PS-EGR). Given that the original problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is inherently intractable, we propose a Benders' decomposition (BD)-based algorithm to solve the problem efficiently. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed PS-EGR scheme, offering valuable insights into various optimizable factors within the system. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and propose promising avenues for future research in SATQNs.</description>

      <title>Fusion and flow: formal protocols to reliably build photonic graph states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonics offers a promising platform for implementations of measurement-based quantum computing. Recently proposed fusion-based architectures aim to achieve universality and fault-tolerance. In these approaches, computation is carried out by performing fusion and single-qubit measurements on a resource graph state. The verification of these architectures requires linear algebraic, probabilistic, and control flow structures to be combined in a unified formal language. This paper develops a framework for photonic quantum computing by bringing together linear optics, ZX calculus, and dataflow programming. We characterize fusion measurements that induce Pauli errors and show that they are correctable using a novel flow structure for fusion networks. We prove the correctness of new repeat-until-success protocols for the realization of arbitrary fusions and provide a graph-theoretic proof of universality for linear optics with entangled photon sources. The proposed framework paves the way for the development of compilation algorithms for photonic quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Optimizing a parameterized controlled gate with Free Quaternion Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In variational algorithms, quantum circuits are conventionally parametrized with respect to single-qubit gates.In this study, we parameterize a generalized controlled gate and propose an algorithm to estimate the optimal parameters for locally minimizing the cost value, where we extend the free quaternion selection method, an optimization method for a single-qubit gate. To benchmark the performance, we apply the proposed method to various optimization problems, including the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for Ising and molecular Hamiltonians, Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) for fidelity maximization, and unitary compilation of time evolution operators. In these applications, the proposed method shows efficient optimization and greater expressibility with shallower circuits than other methods. Furthermore, this method is also capable of generalizing and fully optimizing particle-number-conserving gates, which are in demand in chemical systems applications.Taking advantage of this property, we have actually approximated time evolution operators of molecular Hamiltonian and simulated the dynamics with shallower circuits in comparison to the standard implementation by Trotter decomposition.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Quantum Eigensolver Algorithms With Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore accelerating Hamiltonian ground state energy calculation on NISQ devices. We suggest using search-based methods together with machine learning to accelerate quantum algorithms, exemplified in the Quantum Eigensolver use case. We trained two small models on classically mined data from systems with up to 16 qubits, using XGBoost's Python regressor. We evaluated our preliminary approach on 20-, 24- and 28-qubit systems by optimising the Eigensolver's hyperparameters. These models predict hyperparameter values, leading to a 0.13\%-0.15\% reduction in error when tested on 28-qubit systems. However, due to inconclusive results with 20- and 24-qubit systems, we suggest further examination of the training data based on Hamiltonian characteristics. In future work, we plan to train machine learning models to optimise other aspects or subroutines of quantum algorithm execution beyond its hyperparameters.</description>

      <title>Geometric contribution to adiabatic amplification in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concepts from non-Hermitian quantum mechanics have proven useful in understanding and manipulating a variety of classical systems, such as encountered in optics, classical mechanics, and metamaterial design. Recently, the non-Hermitian analog of the Berry phase for adiabatic processes has been experimentally measured. In non-Hermitian systems, the Berry phase can have an imaginary part, which contributes to the amplification or decay of the total wave intensity. When the imaginary part of the Berry curvature is zero, this geometric amplification factor is determined solely by the initial and final points of the adiabatic path in parameter space, and does not depend on how these points are connected by the path. We list classes of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians where this path independence is guaranteed by suitable symmetries, and find that, for some of these classes, the amplification factor can be written only in terms of the Petermann factors of the initial and final points. Our result can, in turn, be used to experimentally obtain the Petermann factor by observing how the norm of the wavefunction changes under adiabatic processes. We validate our theory using a couple of concrete examples of physical relevance.</description>

      <title>Pauli weight requirement of the matrix elements in time-evolved local operators: dependence beyond the equilibration temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of simulating the out-of-equilibrium evolution of local operators in the Heisenberg picture is governed by the operator entanglement, which grows linearly in time for generic non-integrable systems, leading to an exponential increase in computational resources. A promising approach to simplify this challenge involves discarding parts of the operator and focusing on a subspace formed by "light" Pauli strings - strings with few Pauli matrices - as proposed by Rakovszki et al. [PRB 105, 075131 (2022)]. In this work, we investigate whether this strategy can be applied to quenches starting from homogeneous product states. For ergodic dynamics, these initial states grant access to a wide range of equilibration temperatures. By concentrating on the desired matrix elements and retaining only the portion of the operator that contains Pauli strings parallel to the initial state, we uncover a complex scenario. In some cases, the light Pauli strings suffice to describe the dynamics, enabling efficient simulation with current algorithms. However, in other cases, heavier strings become necessary, pushing computational demands beyond our current capabilities. We analyze this behavior using a newly introduced measure of complexity, the Operator Weight Entropy, which we compute for different operators across most points on the Bloch sphere.</description>

      <title>Improved Electron-Nuclear Quantum Gates for Spin Sensing and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to sense and control nuclear spins near solid-state defects might enable a range of quantum technologies. Dynamically Decoupled Radio-Frequency (DDRF) control offers a high degree of design flexibility and long electron-spin coherence times. However, previous studies considered simplified models and little is known about optimal gate design and fundamental limits. Here, we develop a generalised DDRF framework that has important implications for spin sensing and control. Our analytical model, which we corroborate by experiments on a single NV center in diamond, reveals the mechanisms that govern the selectivity of gates and their effective Rabi frequencies, and enables flexible detuned gate designs. We apply these insights to show a potential 60x sensitivity enhancement for detecting weakly coupled spins and to study the optimisation of quantum gates in multi-qubit registers. These results advance the understanding for a broad class of gates and provide a toolbox for application-specific design, enabling improved quantum control and sensing.</description>

      <title>On-chip pulse shaping of entangled photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate spectral shaping of entangled photons with a six-channel microring-resonator-based silicon photonic pulse shaper. Through precise calibration of thermal phase shifters in a microresonator-based pulse shaper, we demonstrate line-by-line phase control on a 3~GHz grid for two frequency-bin-entangled qudits, corresponding to Hilbert spaces of up to $6\times 6$ ($3\times 3$) dimensions for shared (independent) signal-idler filters. The pulse shaper's fine spectral resolution enables control of nanosecond-scale temporal features, which are observed by direct coincidence detection of biphoton correlation functions that show excellent agreement with theory. This work marks, to our knowledge, the first demonstration of biphoton pulse shaping using an integrated spectral shaper and holds significant promise for applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a reconciliation protocol with a two-step error correction scheme using a short blocklength low rate code and a long blocklength high rate code. We show that by using this two-step decoding method it is possible to achieve secret key rates beyond the Devetak-Winter bound. We simulate the protocol using short blocklength low-density parity check code, and show that we can obtain reconciliation efficiencies up to 1.5. Using these high reconciliation efficiencies, it is possible double the achievable distances of CV-QKD systems.</description>

      <title>A fault-tolerant pairwise measurement-based code on eight qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a pairwise measurement-based code on eight qubits that is error correcting for circuit noise, with fault distance 3. The code can be implemented on a subset of a rectangular array of qubits with nearest neighbor connectivity of pairwise Pauli measurements, with a syndrome extraction circuit of depth 28. We describe fault-tolerant logical operations on patches of this eight-qubit code that generate the full Clifford group. We estimate the performance under circuit noise both during logical idle and during a logical two-qubit measurement. We estimate the pseudo-threshold to be between $10^{-5}$ and $2\times 10^{-4}$, depending on the amount of noise on idle physical qubits. The use of post-selection in addition to error correction (correcting all degree one faults and rejecting a subset of the higher degree faults) can improve the pseudo-threshold by up to an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Efficient Measurement-Driven Eigenenergy Estimation with Classical Shadows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms exploiting real-time evolution under a target Hamiltonian have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in extracting key spectral information. However, the broader potential of these methods, particularly beyond ground state calculations, is underexplored. In this work, we introduce the framework of multi-observable dynamic mode decomposition (MODMD), which combines the observable dynamic mode decomposition, a measurement-driven eigensolver tailored for near-term implementation, with classical shadow tomography. MODMD leverages random scrambling in the classical shadow technique to construct, with exponentially reduced resource requirements, a signal subspace that encodes rich spectral information. Notably, we replace typical Hadamard-test circuits with a protocol designed to predict low-rank observables, thus marking a new application of classical shadow tomography for predicting many low-rank observables. We establish theoretical guarantees on the spectral approximation from MODMD, taking into account distinct sources of error. In the ideal case, we prove that the spectral error scales as $\exp(- \Delta E t_{\rm max})$, where $\Delta E$ is the Hamiltonian spectral gap and $t_{\rm max}$ is the maximal simulation time. This analysis provides a rigorous justification of the rapid convergence observed across simulations. To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we consider its application to fundamental tasks, such as determining the low-lying, i.e. ground or excited, energies of representative many-body systems. Our work paves the path for efficient designs of measurement-driven algorithms on near-term and early fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

      <title>On the transition from quantum decoherence to thermal dynamics in natural conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A single mechanism, endemic to the standard model of physics, is proposed to explain wavefunction collapse, classical motion, dissipation, equilibration, and the transition from pure quantum mechanics through open system decoherence to the natural regime. Spontaneous events in the neighborhood of a particle disrupts correlation such that large many-particle states do not persist and each particle collapses to a stable mode of motion established by its neighbors. These events are the source of thermal fluctuation and drive diffusion. Consequently, evolution is not deterministic, unitary or classically conservative; diffusion toward a steady state occurs incessantly in every system of particles, though slowed under unnatural experimental conditions that suppress these events. Mean properties of a system evolve as particles jump between single-particle modes, producing observed transport laws and equilibrium properties without additional postulate or empirical factors. These modes are localized in dense material, yielding classical characteristics. Boltzmann's equal probability postulate is valid only when comparing results of nonrelativistic observers.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Negativity and Replica Symmetry Breaking in General Holographic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement negativity $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ is a useful measure of quantum entanglement in bipartite mixed states. In random tensor networks (RTNs), which are related to fixed-area states, it was found in [arXiv:2101.11029] that the dominant saddles computing the even R\'enyi negativity $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ generically break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. This calls into question previous calculations of holographic negativity using 2D CFT techniques that assumed $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry and proposed that the negativity was related to the entanglement wedge cross section. In this paper, we resolve this issue by showing that in general holographic states, the saddles computing $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ indeed break the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry. Our argument involves an identity relating $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ to the $k$-th R\'enyi entropy on subregion $AB^*$ in the doubled state $|{\rho_{AB}}\rangle_{AA^*BB^*}$, from which we see that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ replica symmetry is broken down to $\mathbb{Z}_{k}$. For $k&lt;1$, which includes the case of $\mathcal{E}(A:B)$ at $k=1/2$, we use a modified cosmic brane proposal to derive a new holographic prescription for $\mathcal{E}^{(2k)}$ and show that it is given by a new saddle with multiple cosmic branes anchored to subregions $A$ and $B$ in the original state. Using our prescription, we reproduce known results for the PSSY model and show that our saddle dominates over previously proposed CFT calculations near $k=1$. Moreover, we argue that the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ symmetric configurations previously proposed are not gravitational saddles, unlike our proposal. Finally, we contrast holographic calculations with those arising from RTNs with non-maximally entangled links, demonstrating that the qualitative form of backreaction in such RTNs is different from that in gravity.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Order Topological Phase And Transition in 1H Transition Metal Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experimental observations of hybrid topological states [Nature 628, 527 (2024)], we predict hybrid-order topological insulators (HOTIs) in 1H transition metal compounds (TMCs), where both second-order and first-order topological states coexist near the Fermi level. Initially, 1H-TMCs exhibit a second-order topological phase due to the d-orbital band gap. Upon coupling of p- and d- orbitals couple, first-order topological characteristics emerge. This hybrid-order topological phase transition is tunable via crystal field effects. Combined with first-principles calculations, we illustrate the phase transition with WTe2 and NbSe2. In addition, the first-order topological band gap of the HOTI exhibits a strong spin Hall effect. Our finding reveal novel hybrid-order topological phase in 2D electron materials and highlight spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Unique and Universal scaling in dynamical quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13293v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universality and scaling are fundamental concepts in equilibrium continuous phase transitions. Here, we unveil a unique and universal scaling behavior of the critical time in slowly driven dynamical quantum phase transition. Going beyond the analogy with equilibrium phase transition, we find that the critical time exhibits a power-law scaling with quenching rate and the scaling exponent is fully determined by underlining universality class. We explain this unique scaling behavior based on the adiabatic-impulse scenario in the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. This universal scaling behavior is verified to be valid not only in noninteracting single-particle system, but also in many-body interacting system, and not only in Hermitian system, but also in non-Hermitian system. Our study unravels a deep and fundamental relationship between dynamical phase transition and equilibrium phase tranition.</description>

      <title>Ultra spectral sensitivity and non-local bi-impurity bound states from quasi-long-range non-hermitian skin modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental tenet of quantum mechanics is that the energy spectrum of a quantum system shall remain stable against infinitesimally weak and spatially confined perturbations. In this article, we demonstrate that this principle of spectral stability fails in non-Hermitian systems at the thermodynamic limit. Consider, for instance, a non-interacting non-Hermitian system $H_0$ with a couple of point-like impurities, each of which introduces a local short-range potential $V_i$ with $i=1, \ldots, n$ labeling the impurities. If the impurity potentials are sufficiently weak, introducing a single impurity will not alter the spectrum; that is, $H_0$ and $H_0 + V_1$ have nearly identical energy spectra. However, if a second impurity is introduced, $H_0 + V_1 + V_2$, we find that no matter how weak these local potentials are, as long as the distance between them is sufficiently large, significant alterations in the energy spectrum can arise, directly contradicting the traditional expectation of a stable spectrum. Remarkably, this phenomenon is non-local, and the impact of the perturbations increases exponentially with the distance between the two impurities. In other words, although the Hamiltonian is entirely local, its energy spectrum, which is blind to the presence of a single infinitesimally weak impurity, is capable of detecting the presence of two infinitesimally weak impurities separated by a large distance in space. Using Green's function techniques, we uncover the origin of this spectral sensitivity, which arises from the formation of non-local bi-impurity bound states: non-local stationary states with wavepackets propagating back-and-forth between the two impurities. We provide an analytic theory to identify and characterize such spectral instabilities, showing perfect agreement with numerical solutions.</description>

Abstract: Measuring the internal quality factor of coplanar waveguide superconducting resonators is an established method of determining small losses in superconducting devices. Traditionally, the resonator losses are only attributed to two-level system (TLS) defects using a power dependent model for the quality factor. However, excess non-equilibrium quasiparticles can also limit the quality factor of the planar superconducting resonators used in circuit quantum electrodynamics. At millikelvin temperatures, quasiparticles can be generated by breaking Cooper pairs via a single high-energy or multiple sub-gap photons. Here a two-temperature, power and temperature dependent model is proposed to evaluate resonator losses for isolating TLS and quasiparticle loss simultaneously. The model combines the conventional TLS power and temperature dependence with an effective temperature non-equilibrium quasiparticle description of the superconducting loss. The quasiparticle description is based on the quasiparticle number density calculated using rate equations for an external quasiparticle generation source, recombination, and trapping. The number density is translated to an effective temperature using a thermal distribution that may be different from the bath. Experimental measurements of high-quality factor resonators fabricated from single crystal aluminum and titanium nitride thin films on silicon are interpreted with the presented model. This approach enables identification of quasiparticle and TLS loss, resulting in the determination that the TiN resonator has comparable TLS and quasiparticle loss at low power and low-temperature, while the low-temperature Al resonator behavior is dominated by non-equilibrium quasiparticle loss.</description>

Abstract: Implementing quantum operations in the form of natural Hamiltonian dynamics is desirable, since they almost require no external control or feedback. In this work, we propose a NISQ-friendly quantum-classical hybrid approach to designing a time-independent Hamiltonian that generates a given multi-qubit unitary. In particular, we execute a Variational Quantum Algorithm, whose ansatz is carefully chosen to be a sequence of appropriately parametrized unitaries describing at most two-qubit nearest neighbour interactions, dictating the target unitary. Subsequently, we apply our approach to simulate multi-qubit target gates, with and without stochastic noise. We demonstrate that our strategy allows us to implement a Toffoli gate with sufficiently high fidelity, as compared to the other similar techniques. Our approach is an example of the usage of quantum computing for the design of quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Bounding first-order quantum phase transitions in adiabatic quantum computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of adiabatic quantum computation (AQC), it has been argued that first-order quantum phase transitions (QPTs) due to localisation phenomena cause AQC to fail by exponentially decreasing the minimal spectral gap of the Hamiltonian along the annealing path as a function of the qubit number. The vanishing of the spectral gap is often linked to the localisation of the ground state in a local minimum, requiring the system to tunnel into the global minimum at a later stage of the annealing. Recent methods have been proposed to avoid this phenomenon by carefully designing the involved Hamiltonians. However, it remains a challenge to formulate a comprehensive theory of the effect of the various parameters and the conditions under which QPTs make the AQC algorithm fail. Equipped with concepts from graph theory, in this work we link graph quantities associated to the Hamiltonians along the annealing path with the occurrence of QPTs. These links allow us to derive bounds on the location of the minimal spectral gap along the annealing path, augmenting the toolbox for the analysis of strategies to improve the runtime of AQC algorithms.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Quantum Compilers using a DAG-based or phase polynomial-based Intermediate Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the NISQ era, where quantum computing is dominated by hybrid quantum algorithms, it is important for quantum circuits to be well-optimized to reduce noise from unnecessary gates.
  We investigate different phase polynomial-based compilation strategies to determine the current best practices and compare them against the DAG-based Qiskit and TKET compilers. We find that phase polynomial-based compiling is very fast compared to DAG-based compiling. For long circuits, these compilers generate fewer CNOT gates than Qiskit or TKET, but for short circuits, they are quite inefficient. We also show that supplementary algorithms such as Reverse Traversal and simulated annealing might improve the generated CNOT count slightly, but the effect is negligable in most settings and generally not worth the additional compiler runtime. Instead, more sophisticated phase polynomial synthesis algorithms are needed.</description>

Abstract: Consider a general quantum stochastic source that emits at discrete time steps quantum pure states which are chosen from a finite alphabet according to some probability distribution which may depend on the whole history. Also, fix two positive integers $m$ and $l$. We encode any tensor product of $ml$ many states emitted by the quantum stochastic source by breaking the tensor product into $m$ many blocks where each block has length $l$, and considering sequences of $m$ many isometries so that each isometry encodes one of these blocks into the Fock space, followed by the concatenation of their images. We only consider certain sequences of such isometries that we call ``special block codes" in order to ensure that the string of encoded states is uniquely decodable. We compute the minimum average codeword length of these encodings which depends on the quantum source and the integers $m$, $l$, among all possible special block codes. Our result extends the result of [Bellomo, Bosyk, Holik and Zozor, Scientific Reports 7.1 (2017): 14765] where the minimum was computed for one block, i.e.\ for $m=1$. Lastly, we give a simplified non-adaptive compression technique based on constrained special block codes for general quantum stochastic sources. For quantum stationary sources in particular, we show that the minimum average codeword length per symbol computed over all constrained special block codes is equal to the von-Neumann entropy rate of the source for an asymptotically long block size.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian skin effects in open spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), in which eigenstates exhibit localized behaviors at boundaries drastically different from the extended Bloch waves of Hermitian systems, is among the most scrutinized dissipative phenomena. The localization of the eigenstates at a system's edge hints at nonreciprocal transport towards the latter. In several open systems, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians are obtained as an approximation of Liouvillian dynamics by neglecting the quantum jump operators. However this approximation might lose critical information about timescales and conditions required for the nonreciprocal dynamics to manifest. We compare the dynamics governed by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians with those described by the corresponding Liouvillians, identifying the conditions under which both approaches predict the skin effect at the same level. Our analyses uncover the consistency and limitation of non-Hermitian approaches and identify the key ingredients underlying the skin effect in open magnetic systems. Also, our results highlight the connection between the NHSE and the classical magnetization dynamics, suggesting that our predictions can be tested in multilayered magnetic structures with interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10991v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling represents an active approach towards the protection of quantum memories and quantum gates. Because dynamical decoupling operations can interfere with system's own time evolution, the protection of quantum gates is more challenging than that of quantum states. In this work, we put forward a simple but general approach towards the realization of higher-order protection of quantum gates and further execute the first cloud-based experimental demonstration of dynamical-decoupling-protected quantum gates at the first order and the second order. The central idea of our approach is to engineer (hence regain the control of) the gate Hamiltonian in coordination with higher-order dynamical decoupling sequences originally proposed for the protection of quantum memories. The physical demonstration on an IBM quantum processor indicates the effectiveness and potential of our approach on noisy intermediate scale quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Path integral for the quartic oscillator: An accurate analytic formula for the partition function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09859v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work an approximate analytic expression for the quantum partition function of the quartic oscillator described by the potential $V(x) = \frac{1}{2} \omega^2 x^2 + g x^4$ is presented. Using a path integral formalism, the exact partition function is approximated by the partition function of a harmonic oscillator with an effective frequency depending both on the temperature and coupling constant $g$. By invoking a Principle of Minimal Sensitivity (PMS) of the path integral to the effective frequency, we derive a mathematically well-defined analytic formula for the partition function. Quite remarkably, the formula reproduces qualitatively and quantitatively the key features of the exact partition function. The free energy is accurate to a few percent over the entire range of temperatures and coupling strengths $g$. Both the harmonic ($g\rightarrow 0$) and classical (high-temperature) limits are exactly recovered. The divergence of the power series of the ground-state energy at weak coupling, characterized by a factorial growth of the perturbational energies, is reproduced as well as the functional form of the strong-coupling expansion along with accurate coefficients. Explicit accurate expressions for the ground- and first-excited state energies, $E_0(g)$ and $E_1(g)$ are also presented.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dynamics Happens Only on Paper: QBism's Account of Decoherence</title>

Abstract: QBism has long recognized quantum states, POVM elements, Kraus operators, and even unitary operations to be cut from the same cloth: They express aspects of an agent's belief system concerning the consequences (for her) of actions she might take upon her external world. Such action-consequence pairs have conventionally been called "quantum measurements." The calculus of quantum theory is then viewed as an empirically motivated addition to Bayesian decision theory when brought to this notion of measurement. This radical approach has allowed QBism to eliminate conceptual problems that plague other interpretations of quantum mechanics. However, one issue has remained elusive: If a QBist does not believe in the existence of an ontic (agent-independent) dynamical variable evolving over time, why would there be any constraints on her quantum-state assignment in the absence of performing a measurement? Why would she introduce unitary or open-system quantum dynamics at all? Here, we present a representation theorem based on van Fraassen's reflection principle to answer these questions. Simply put, an agent's assignment of quantum dynamics represents her belief that a measurement action she is contemplating would not change her current odds for future gambles. A corollary to this approach is that one can make sense of "open-system dynamics" without the need to introduce an "environment with a measurement record," as is common in decoherence accounts of quantum measurement. QBism's understanding instead rests more fundamentally on an agent's beliefs about the system of interest (not system plus environment) and her judgments about measurements she might perform on that system. More broadly, this result establishes QBism's contention that measurement itself is the central concept of quantum theory and thus the framework upon which any future QBist ontology must hang.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Signal Processing (QSP), together with the quantum singular value transformation, is one of the central quantum algorithms due to its efficiency and generality in many fields including quantum simulation, quantum machine learning, and quantum cryptography. The largest bottleneck of QSP and its family is its difficulty in finding the phase angle sequence for signal processing. We find that this is in particular prominent when one employs the generalized formalism of the QSP, or the GQSP, to employ arbitrary single-qubit unitaries for signal processing operator. In this work, we extend the framework of GQSP and propose a robust angle finding algorithm. The proposed angle finding algorithm, based on Prony's method, successfully generates angle sequence of precision $10^{-13}$ up to polynomial degrees of hundreds within a second. By applying our method to Hamiltonian simulation, we find that the number of calls, or queries, to signal operators are essentially halved compared to the ordinary framework of QSP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently gained attention where the growth of operator complexity in time is measured in terms of the off-diagonal operator Lanczos coefficients. The operator Lanczos algorithm reduces the problem of complexity growth to a single-particle semi-infinite tight-binding chain (known as the Krylov chain). Employing the phenomenon of Anderson localization, we propose the phenomenology of inverse localization length on the Krylov chain that undergoes delocalization/localization transition on the Krylov chain while the physical system undergoes ergodicity breaking. On the Krylov chain we find delocalization in an ergodic regime, as we show for the SYK model, and localization in case of a weakly ergodicity-broken regime. Considering the dynamics beyond scrambling, we find a collapse across different operators in the ergodic regime. We test for two settings: (1) the coupled SYK model, and (2) the quantum East model. Our findings open avenues for mapping ergodicity/weak ergodicity-breaking transitions to delocalization/localization phenomenology on the Krylov chain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this tutorial, we present the definition, interpretation and properties of some of the main quasiprobabilities that can describe the statistics of measurement outcomes evaluated at two or more times. Such statistics incorporate the incompatibility of the measurement observables and the state of the measured quantum system. We particularly focus on Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobabilities and related distributions. We also discuss techniques to experimentally access a quasiprobability distribution, ranging from the weak two-point measurement scheme, to a Ramsey-like interferometric scheme and procedures assisted by an external detector. We illustrate the use of quasiprobabilities in quantum thermodynamics to describe the quantum statistics of work and heat, and to explain anomalies in the energy exchanges entailed by a given thermodynamic transformation. On the one hand, in work protocols, we show how absorbed energy can be converted to extractable work and vice versa due to Hamiltonian incompatibility at distinct times. On the other hand, in exchange processes between two quantum systems initially at different temperatures, we explain how quantum correlations in their initial state may induce cold-to-hot energy exchanges, which are unnatural between any pair of equilibrium nondriven systems. We conclude the tutorial by giving simple examples where quasiprobabilities are applied to many-body systems: scrambling of quantum information, sensitivity to local perturbations, and quantum work statistics in the quenched dynamics of models that can be mapped onto systems of free fermions, for instance the Ising model with a transverse field. We meticulously present derivations of essential concepts alongside straightforward examples, aiming to enhance comprehension and facilitate learning.</description>

Abstract: The recently proposed zero-added-loss multiplexing (ZALM) source of entangled photons enables higher efficiency in entanglement distribution than spontaneous parametric down-conversion sources and can be carried out using both space-to-ground and ground-to-ground links. We demonstrate the flexibility of ZALM architectures to be adapted to alternative entanglement distribution protocols. Focusing on the counter-intuitive result that entanglement can be generated between distant parties without using any entanglement as a resource, we analyze two protocols for entanglement distribution to memories via separable states. Modelling them in a ZALM setup, we consider the effects of noise both in the communication channels and in the memories. We thereby identify the optimal protocol to use, with respect to the highest entanglement generated, given the noise conditions of the network.</description>

Abstract: We derive a time-dependent master equation for an externally driven system whose subsystems weakly interact with each other and locally connect to the thermal reservoirs. The nonadiabatic equation obtained here can be viewed as a generalization of the local master equation, which has already been extensively used in describing the dynamics of a boundary-driven system. In addition, we investigate the fundamental reason underlying the thermodynamic inconsistency generated by the local and nonadiabatic master equations. We fnd that these two equations are consistent with the second law of thermodynamics when the system is far away from the steady state, while they give rise to the contradiction at the steady state. Finally, we numerically confrm our results by considering a toy model consisting of two qubits and two local heat baths.</description>

      <title>Chaos controlled and disorder driven phase transitions induced by breaking permutation symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effects of disorder and chaos on quantum many-body systems can be superficially similar, yet their interplay has not been sufficiently explored. This work finds a continuous phase transition when disorder breaks permutation symmetry, with details of the transition being controlled by the degree of chaos in the clean limit. The system changes from an area law entangled phase in the permutation symmetric subspace where collective variables exist to volume law entanglement in the full Hilbert space, beyond a critical strength of the disorder. The critical strength tends to zero when the original disorder free system is fully chaotic. We study this mainly via the scaling of the collective spin of non-equilibrium states which transit to have properties of what has been dubbed "deep Hilbert space". This has potential implications for general many body physics, as well as technologies such as transmon qubits.</description>

      <title>High-Entanglement Capabilities for Variational Quantum Algorithms: The Poisson Equation Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10156v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discretized Poisson equation matrix (DPEM) in 1D has been shown to require an exponentially large number of terms when decomposed in the Pauli basis when solving numerical linear algebra problems on a quantum computer. Additionally, traditional ansatz for Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) that are used to heuristically solve linear systems (such as the DPEM) have many parameters, making them harder to train. This research attempts to resolve these problems by utilizing the IonQ Aria quantum computer capabilities that boast all-to-all connectivity of qubits. We propose a decomposition of the DPEM that is based on 2- or 3-qubit entanglement gates and is shown to have $O(1)$ terms with respect to system size, with one term having an $O(n^2)$ circuit depth and the rest having only an $O(1)$ circuit depth (where $n$ is the number of qubits defining the system size). To test these new improvements, we ran numerical simulations to examine how well the VQAs performed with varying system sizes, showing that the new setup offers an improved scaling of the number of iterations required for convergence compared to Hardware-Efficient Ansatz.</description>

Abstract: Bound entanglement is a special form of quantum entanglement that cannot be used for distillation, i.e., the local transformation of copies of arbitrarily entangled states into a smaller number of approximately maximally entangled states. Implying an inherent irreversibility of quantum resources, this phenomenon highlights the gaps in our current theory of entanglement. This review provides a comprehensive exploration of the key findings on bipartite bound entanglement. We focus on systems of finite dimensions, an area of high relevance for many quantum information processing tasks. We elucidate the properties of bound entanglement and its interconnections with various facets of quantum information theory and quantum information processing. The article illuminates areas where our understanding of bound entangled states, particularly their detection and characterization, is yet to be fully developed. By highlighting the need for further research into this phenomenon and underscoring relevant open questions, this article invites researchers to unravel its relevance for our understanding of entanglement in Nature and how this resource can most effectively be used for applications in quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Single Bell inequality to detect genuine nonlocality in three-qubit genuinely entangled states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It remains an open question whether every pure multipartite state that is genuinely entangled is also genuinely nonlocal. Recently, a new general construction of Bell inequalities allowing the detection of genuine multipartite nonlocality (GMNL) in quantum states was proposed in [F. J. Curchod, M. L. Almeida, and A. Acin, New J. Phys. 21, 023016 (2019) with the aim of addressing the above problem. Here we show how, in a simple manner, one can improve this construction to deliver tighter Bell inequalities for detection of GMNL. Remarkably, we then prove one of the improved Bell inequalities to be powerful enough to detect GMNL in every three-qubit genuinely entangled state. We also generalize some of these inequalities to detect not only GMNL but also nonlocality depth in multipartite states and we present a possible way of generalizing them to the case of more outcomes.</description>

      <title>Comparison of estimation limits for quantum two-parameter estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measurement estimation bounds for local quantum multiparameter estimation, which provide lower bounds on possible measurement uncertainties, have so far been formulated in two ways: by extending the classical Cram\'er--Rao bound (e.g., the quantum Cram\'er--Rao bound and the Nagaoka Cram'er--Rao bound) and by incorporating the parameter estimation framework with the uncertainty principle, as in the Lu--Wang uncertainty relation. In this work, we present a general framework that allows a direct comparison between these different types of estimation limits. Specifically, we compare the attainability of the Nagaoka Cram\'er--Rao bound and the Lu--Wang uncertainty relation, using analytical and numerical techniques. We show that these two limits can provide different information about the physically attainable precision. We present an example where both limits provide the same attainable precision and an example where the Lu--Wang uncertainty relation is not attainable even for pure states. We further demonstrate that the unattainability in the latter case arises because the figure of merit underpinning the Lu--Wang uncertainty relation (the difference between the quantum and classical Fisher information matrices) does not necessarily agree with the conventionally used figure of merit (mean squared error). The results offer insights into the general attainability and applicability of the Lu--Wang uncertainty relation. Furthermore, our proposed framework for comparing bounds of different types may prove useful in other settings.</description>

      <title>Thermalization propagation front and robustness against avalanches in localized systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the robustness of the many-body localized (MBL) phase to the quantum-avalanche instability by studying the dynamics of a localized spin chain coupled to a $T=\infty$ thermal bath through its leftmost site. By analyzing local magnetizations, we estimate the size of the thermalized sector of the chain and find that it increases logarithmically slowly in time. This logarithmically slow propagation of the thermalization front allows us to lower bound the slowest thermalization time, and find a broad parameter range where it scales fast enough with the system size that MBL is robust against thermalization induced by avalanches. The further finding that the imbalance -- a global quantity measuring localization -- thermalizes over a time scale exponential both in disorder strength and system size is in agreement with these results.</description>

      <title>Analytic Model for the Energy Spectrum of the Anharmonic Oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent work we have proposed an original analytic expression for the partition function of the quartic oscillator. This partition function, which has a simple and compact form with {\it no adjustable parameters}, reproduces some key mathematical properties of the exact partition function and provides free energies accurate to a few percent over a wide range of temperatures and coupling constants. In this work, we present the derivation of the energy spectrum of this model. We also generalize our previous study limited to the quartic oscillator to the case of a general anharmonic oscillator. Numerical application for a potential of the form $V(x)=\frac{\omega^2}{2} x^2 + g x^{2m}$ show that the energy levels are obtained with a relative error of about a few percent, a precision which we consider to be quite satisfactory given the simplicity of the model, the absence of adjustable parameters, and the negligible computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04946v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an energy calculation algorithm leveraging quantum phase difference estimation (QPDE) scheme and a tensor-network-based unitary compression method in the preparation of superposition states and time-evolution gates. Alongside its efficient implementation, this algorithm reduces depolarization noise affections exponentially. We demonstrated energy gap calculations for one-dimensional Hubbard models on IBM superconducting devices using circuits up to 32-system (plus one-ancilla) qubits, a five-fold increase over previous QPE demonstrations, at the 7242 controlled-Z gate level of standard transpilation, utilizing a Q-CTRL error suppression module. Additionally, we propose a technique towards molecular executions using spatial orbital localization and index sorting, verified by a 13- (17-)qubit hexatriene (octatetraene) simulation. Since QPDE can handle the same objectives as QPE, our algorithm represents a leap forward in quantum computing on real devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We assess a scheme for measurement-free quantum teleportation from the perspective of the resources underpinning its performance. In particular, we focus on recently made claims about the crucial role played by the degree of non-Markovianity of the dynamics of the information carrier whose state we aim to teleport. We prove that any link between efficiency of teleportation and back-flow of information depends fundamentally on the way the various operations entailed by the measurement-free teleportation protocol are implemented, while - in general - no claim of causal link can be made. Our result reinforces the need for the explicit assessment of the underlying physical platform when assessing the performance and resources for a given quantum protocol and the need for a rigorous quantum resource theory of non-Markovianity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements have revealed new links between information geometry and classical stochastic thermodynamics, particularly through the Fisher information with respect to time. Recognizing the non-uniqueness of the quantum Fisher metric in Hilbert space, we exploit the fact that any quantum Fisher information (QFI) can be decomposed into a metric-independent incoherent part and a metric-dependent coherent contribution. We demonstrate that the incoherent component of any QFI can be directly linked to entropic acceleration, and for GKSL dynamics with local detailed balance, to the rate of change of generalized thermodynamic forces and entropic flow, paralleling the classical results. Furthermore, we show that the classical uncertainty relation between the geometric uncertainty of a path in state space and the time-averaged rate of information change also holds for quantum systems. We generalise a classical geometric bound on the entropy rate for far-from-equilibrium processes by incorporating a non-negative quantum contribution that arises from the geometric action due to coherent dynamics. Finally, we apply an information-geometric analysis to the recently proposed quantum-thermodynamic Mpemba effect, demonstrating this framework's ability to capture thermodynamic phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we contribute to the mathematical foundations of the recently established theory of Spectrum Broadcast Structures (SBS). These are multipartite quantum states, encoding an operational notion of objectivity and exhibiting a more advanced form of decoherence. We study SBS and asymptotic convergence to SBS in the case of a central system interacting with N environments via the von Neumann-type measurement interactions, ubiquitous in the theory of open quantum systems. We will be focusing on the case where the system is modeled by an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and the operators associated with the system in the Hamiltonian have purely continuous spectrum. Such a setup yields mathematical complications that have hitherto not been addressed in the theory of SBS.</description>

Abstract: We extend previous efforts to quantify the entanglement generated in Hawking's evaporation process by including rotation and thermal environments (e.g. the cosmic microwave background). Both extensions are needed to describe real black holes in our universe. Leveraging techniques from Gaussian quantum information, we find that the black hole's ergoregion is an active source of quantum entanglement and that thermal environments drastically degrade entanglement generation. Our predictions are suitable to be tested in the lab using analogue platforms and also provide tools to assess the fate of quantum information for black holes in more generic settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the stroboscopic time-evolution under a Floquet unitary, in any spatial dimension, and of any Hermitian operator, can be mapped to an operator Krylov space which is identical to that generated by the edge operator of the non-interacting Floquet transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one-spatial dimension, and with inhomogeneous Ising and transverse field couplings. The latter has four topological phases reflected by the absence (topologically trivial) or presence (topologically non-trivial) of edge modes at $0$ and/or $\pi$ quasi-energies. It is shown that the Floquet dynamics share certain universal features characterized by how the Krylov parameters vary in the topological phase diagram of the Floquet TFIM with homogeneous couplings. These results are highlighted through examples, all chosen for numerical convenience to be in one spatial dimension: non-integrable Floquet spin $1/2$ chains and Floquet $Z_3$ clock model where the latter hosts period-tripled edge modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Andreev reflection is a fundamental transport process occurring at the junction between a normal metal and a superconductor (a N-S junction), when an incident electron from the normal side can only be transmitted in the superconductor as a Cooper pair, with the reflection of a hole in the normal metal. As a consequence of the spin singlet nature of the BCS Cooper pairs, the current due to Andreev reflection at a N-S junction is always symmetric in spin. Using a Keldysh Nambu Floquet approach, combining analytical and numerical calculations, we study in details the AC transport at a N-S junction, when the two spin components in the normal metal are driven by different periodic drives. We show that, in the Andreev regime, i.e. when the superconducting gap is much larger than the frequency of the drives, the spin-resolved photo-assisted currents are always equal even if the two drives are different. In addition, we show that in this regime the excess noise depends only on the sum of the periodic drives, and we consider in particular the case of Lorentzian pulses (Levitons). We also show how these properties get modified when going beyond the Andreev regime. Finally we give a simple analytical proof of the special properties of the Andreev regime using an exact mapping to a particular N-N junction.</description>

      <title>Generalized nonlinear Langevin equation from quantum nonlinear projection operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically derive the quantum generalized nonlinear Langevin equation using Morozov's projection operator method. This approach extends the linear Mori-Zwanzig projection operator technique, allowing for the inclusion of nonlinear interactions among macroscopic modes. Additionally, we obtain the quantum generalized Fokker-Planck equation within the Heisenberg picture, which is consistent with Morozov's original formulation. These equations are fundamentally significant in non-equilibrium statistical physics, particularly in scenarios characterized by enhanced fluctuations, such as anomalous transport phenomena near critical points. The quantum nature of the derived generalized Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations is anticipated to provide a more detailed description than their classical equivalents. Specifically, the noise kernel in the quantum generalized Langevin equation is multiplicative, which broadens the applicability beyond Gaussian approximations. Given specific interactions, these equations are expected to be instrumental in investigating critical transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Introducing Quantum Information and Computation to a Broader Audience with MOOCs at OpenHPI</title>

Abstract: Quantum computing is an exciting field with high disruptive potential, but very difficult to access. For this reason, many approaches to teaching quantum computing are being developed worldwide.
  This always raises questions about the didactic concept, the content actually taught, and how to measure the success of the teaching concept. In 2022 and 2023, the authors taught a total of nine two-week MOOCs (massive open online courses) with different possible learning paths on the Hasso Plattner Institute's OpenHPI platform. The purpose of the platform is to make computer science education available to everyone free of charge. The nine quantum courses form a self-contained curriculum. A total of more than 17{,}000 course attendances have been taken by about 7400 natural persons, and the number is still rising. This paper presents the course concept and evaluates the anonymized data on the background of the participants, their behaviour in the courses, and their learning success.
  This paper is the first to analyze such a large dataset of MOOC-based quantum computing education. The summarized results are a heterogeneous personal background of the participants biased towards IT professionals, a majority following the didactic recommendations, and a high success rate, which is strongly correlatated with following the didactic recommendations. The amount of data from such a large group of quantum computing learners provides many avenues for further research in the field of quantum computing education. The analyses show that the MOOCs are a low-threshold concept for getting into quantum computing. It was very well received by the participants. The concept can serve as an entry point and guide for the design of quantum computing courses.</description>

      <title>Squeezing the quantum noise of a gravitational-wavedetector below the standard quantum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements of space and time, like those made by the detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), are often confronted with fundamental limitations imposed by quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that the position and momentum of an object cannot both be precisely measured, giving rise to an apparent limitation called the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). Reducing quantum noise below the SQL in gravitational-wave detectors, where photons are used to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors, has been an active area of research for decades. Here we show how the LIGO A+ upgrade reduced the detectors' quantum noise below the SQL by up to 3 dB while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, more than two decades after this possibility was first presented.</description>

      <title>Singular excitement beyond the horizon of a rotating black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have shown that an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector, when coupled linearly to a massless scalar field and permitted to fall radially into certain black holes, will exhibit non-monotonicity in its transition properties near the horizon. Specifically, the transition probability of a detector freely falling into a (3+1)-dimensional Schawrzschild black hole, when considering the Unruh and Hartle-Hawking vacuum states, was shown to possess a local extremum at horizon crossing [K.K. Ng et al., New J. Phys. 24 (2022) 103018]. The transition rate of a detector falling into a static (2+1)-dimensional Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole, for the Hartle-Hawking state, was also found to have multiple local extrema near the horizon under certain parameter settings [M.R. Preciado-Rivas et al., arXiv:2402.14908v1]. These discoveries are of interest, as they suggest that the event horizon of a black hole may be distinguishable to a local probe when QFT effects are included. In this paper, we explore the problem of a UDW detector falling freely into a rotating BTZ black hole. We numerically compute the detector's transition rate for different values of black hole mass, black hole angular momentum, detector energy gap, and field boundary conditions at infinity. Our results lead to a more generalized description of the behaviour of particle detectors in BTZ black hole spacetime, from which the previous non-rotating BTZ case can be retrieved in the limit as angular momentum vanishes.</description>

      <title>Entangled pairs in evaporating black holes without event horizons</title>

Abstract: Investigations into Hawking radiation often assume a black hole model featuring an event horizon, despite the growing consensus that such causal structures may not exist in nature. While this assumption is not crucial for deriving the local properties of radiation at future null infinity, it plays a significant role in discussions about Hawking partners -- the field modes that purify Hawking radiation. This article aims to explore the definition and fate of Hawking partners in black hole scenarios where semiclassical mass loss due to Hawking radiation is considered. Our analysis avoids the assumption of event horizons and instead focuses on collapse processes that feature a trapped region bounded by a dynamical horizon. We derive the form of the partners, accounting for the effects of back-scattering. Furthermore, using these results and mild assumptions, we find that Hawking partners cannot "leak" out of the dynamical horizon to partially purify the Hawking radiation in the regime where general relativity coexists semiclassically with quantum field theory. This finding emphasizes the necessity for new physics, such as quantum gravity, to resolve the final fate of information.</description>

      <title>Industrial 300$\,$mm wafer processed spin qubits in natural silicon/silicon-germanium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The realisation of an universal quantum computer will require the operation of thousands to millions of qubits. The possibility of using existing industrial semiconductor fabrication techniques and infrastructure for up-scaling and reproducibility makes silicon based spin qubits one of the most promising platforms to achieve this goal. The implementation of the up to now largest semiconductor based quantum processor was realized in a silicon/silicon-germanium heterostructure known for its low charge noise, long qubit coherence times and fast driving speeds, but the high structural complexity creates challenges for industrial implementations. Here we demonstrate quantum dots hosted in a natural Si/SiGe heterostructure fully fabricated by an industrial 300$\,$mm semiconductor wafer process line from heterostructure growth to Co micromagnet monolithic integration. We report charge noise values below 2$\,\mathrm{\mu eV/\sqrt{Hz}}$, spin relaxation times of over 1$\,$s and coherence times $T_2^*$ and $T_2^H$ of 1$\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ and 50$\,\mathrm{\mu s}$ respectively, for quantum wells grown using natural silicon. Further, we achieve Rabi frequencies up to 5$\,$MHz and single qubit gate fidelities above 99$\,\%$. In addition to scalability, the high reproducibility of the 300$\,$mm processes enables the deterministic study of qubit metric dependencies on process parameters, which is essential for optimising qubit quality.</description>
