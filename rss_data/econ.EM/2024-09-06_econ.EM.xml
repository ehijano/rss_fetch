      <title>Performance of Empirical Risk Minimization For Principal Component Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes bounds on the predictive performance of empirical risk minimization for principal component regression. Our analysis is nonparametric, in the sense that the relation between the prediction target and the predictors is not specified. In particular, we do not rely on the assumption that the prediction target is generated by a factor model. In our analysis we consider the cases in which the largest eigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the predictors grow linearly in the number of predictors (strong signal regime) or sublinearly (weak signal regime). The main result of this paper shows that empirical risk minimization for principal component regression is consistent for prediction and, under appropriate conditions, it achieves optimal performance (up to a logarithmic factor) in both the strong and weak signal regimes.</description>

      <title>Difference-in-differences with as few as two cross-sectional units -- A new perspective to the democracy-growth debate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pooled panel analyses often mask heterogeneity in unit-specific treatment effects. This challenge, for example, crops up in studies of the impact of democracy on economic growth, where findings vary substantially due to differences in country composition. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimator that leverages the temporal dimension of the data to estimate unit-specific average treatment effects on the treated (ATT) with as few as two cross-sectional units. Under weak identification and temporal dependence conditions, the proposed DiD estimator is shown to be asymptotically normal. The method is further complemented with an identification test that, unlike pre-trends tests, is more powerful and can detect violations of parallel trends in the post-treatment period. Empirical results using the DiD estimator suggest Benin's economy would have been 6.3% smaller on average over the 1993-2018 period had she not democratised.</description>
