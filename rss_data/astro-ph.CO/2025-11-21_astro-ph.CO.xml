      <description>arXiv:2511.15803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observational constraints on large-scale white noise (LSWN) in the cosmic density field, a phenomenon predicted to arise from non-linear mode coupling during cosmological evolution. Building on the theoretical framework of Paper I, where we demonstrated that non-linearities inevitably redistribute power from small to large scales through mode mixing, we confront these predictions with current cosmological data. We modify the CLASS Boltzmann code to incorporate a white noise component $k_\mathrm{BH}/k$ in the primordial power spectrum and perform parameter estimation using current cosmological data. The non-detection of excess power on the largest observable scales places stringent upper bounds: $k_\mathrm{BH} \leq 1.80 \times 10^{-13}~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at 99\% confidence. These constraints imply the primordial power spectrum must deviate from perfect scale invariance on small scales, either through a cutoff at $k_{\mathrm{cut}} \lesssim 3~\mathrm{pc}^{-1}$ or through running of the spectral index with $\alpha_s \lesssim -0.015$. Our results demonstrate that LSWN provides a powerful probe of the primordial spectrum at scales orders of magnitude smaller than directly observable, offering unique constraints on early-universe physics.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on the product of dark energy chemical potential and number density in out-of-equilibrium models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we impose observational limits on the product of dark energy chemical potential, $\mu$, and number density, $n$, at the present time in out-of-equilibrium models, considering that particles can be created or destroyed in the fluid at a rate $\Gamma=3\alpha H(a)$, where $\alpha$ is a constant and $H(a)\equiv\dot{a}/a$ is the Hubble parameter. We combine the bounds derived from the positivity of entropy and the second law of thermodynamics with observational constraints on the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) and Barboza-Alcaniz (BA) parameterizations of the equation of state (EoS) of the component. We use Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) data from Pantheon+; baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from DESI DR2; and cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements from Planck. For $\alpha&gt;0$ (particle creation), the thermodynamic restrictions yield only upper limits for the $\mu_{0}n_{0}$ product, while in the case of $\alpha&lt;0$ (particle destruction) they establish both upper and lower limits, allowing for a range of values to be obtained. In both scenarios, however, we find that the chemical potential of dark energy must be negative, $\mu&lt;0$, which indicates a preference for the phantom regime. In particular, when $\alpha&lt;0$, it is noted that the thermodynamic bounds are simultaneously compatible only for very small absolute values of $\alpha$, with $\alpha=-0.0002$ being the limiting case and resulting in $\mu_{0}n_{0}(\alpha=-0.0002)=-2.2_{-0.7}^{+1.0}\,\,GeV/m^{3}$.</description>

      <title>DESI-Like Hubble Expansion From Staged Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) second data release shows a moderate preference for dark energy with a time-varying equation of state parameter, suggesting that the standard $\Lambda$CDM model may need to be revised. In particular, DESI favors dark energy whose equation of state parameter can drop below $-1$, violating the null energy condition. Chen and Loeb have recently suggested that this violation may be avoided if a subcomponent of the dark matter possesses a time-dependent equation of state. In this work, we present a renormalizable realization of that idea, which can be regarded as a more natural effective field theory. We show that such a construction not only yields dark matter with a time-varying equation of state parameter, but also naturally produces a self-interacting dark matter candidate with a velocity-dependent cross section as a consequence of gauge invariance. The second feature is relevant for addressing tensions between $\Lambda$CDM and observations of small-scale structure, particularly the diversity of galactic rotation curves. Even if further study ultimately finds our fiducial model to be disfavored, this work is valuable for constraining the space of renormalizable, natural models that have the potential to realize the behavior desired by Chen and Loeb.</description>

      <title>Effects of New Forces on Scalar Dark Matter Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New long range forces acting on ordinary matter are highly constrained. However it is possible such forces act on dark matter, as it is less constrained observationally. In this work, we consider dark matter to be made of light bosons, such as axions. We introduce a mediator that communicates a new force between dark matter particles, in addition to gravity. The mediator is taken to be light, but not massless, so that it can affect small scale galactic behavior, but not current cosmological behavior. As a concrete application of this idea, we analyze the effects on scalar dark matter solitons bound by gravitation, i.e., boson stars, which have been claimed to potentially provide cores of galaxies. We numerically determine the soliton's profiles in the presence of this new force. We also extend the analysis to multiple mediators. We show that this new force alters the relation between core density and core radius in a way that can provide improvement in fitting data to observed galactic cores, but for couplings of order the gravitational strength, the improvement is only modest.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Constraints on the Phenomenological Interacting Dark Energy Model with Fermi Gamma-Ray Bursts and DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we constrain the phenomenological interacting dark energy (IDE) model using \emph{Fermi} gamma-ray burst (GRB) dataset and the latest baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 2 (DR2). Through a joint Bayesian analysis, we perform a cosmological comparative assessment of the $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and CPL models with the phenomenological IDE model. For the phenomenological IDE model in a flat universe, we obtain: $\xi=2.644^{+1.144}_{-0.933}$, $\xi + 3w_X = -1.001^{+2.827}_{-3.153}$ with the GOLD sample ($z \geq 1.4$) and DESI DR2; and $\xi=2.879^{+0.995}_{-0.990}$, $\xi + 3w_X = 0.086^{+1.365}_{-1.440}$ with the FULL sample ($z \geq 1.4$) and DESI DR2. Our analysis shows that the $\Lambda$CDM model without interaction are consistent with the latest \emph{Fermi} sample and DESI DR2 at $1\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the Constraint on the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ Modified Gravity in the CSST $3\times2$pt Photometric Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We forecast the constraint on the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ model from the photometric survey operated by the Chinese Space Station Survey Telescope (CSST). The simulated $3\times2$pt data of galaxy clustering, weak lensing, and galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements within 100 deg$^{2}$ are used in the analysis. The mock observational maps are constructed from a light cone, redshift sampling and noise. The angular power spectra are measured with pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimators and compared to theory in the same basis using validated weighting functions and an analytic covariance matrix that includes Gaussian, connected non-Gaussian, and super-sample terms. We model the theoretical spectra using two methods. The first one uses MGCAMB to compute the linear modified-gravity clustering power spectra, and the second one adopts the FREmu emulator with a baseline of nonlinear $\Lambda$CDM prescription. Parameter inference is performed with Cobaya, and the cosmological and modified-gravity parameters are sampled within the emulator training domain, which is jointly fitted with the systematic parameters. We find that the predictions from the two methods are in good agreement at the overlapping large scales, and the emulator method can correctly provide additional high-$\ell$ information. The $1\sigma$ upper bounds of $\log_{10}|f_{R0}|$ are found to be $&lt;-5.42$ for cosmic shear only case and $&lt;-5.29$ for the 100 deg$^2$ CSST $3\times2$pt probe. The full CSST photometric survey with 17,500 deg$^2$ survey area is expected to further improve the constraint precision by about one order of magnitude. Our results demonstrate that the CSST $3\times2$pt survey can deliver strict tests on $f(R)$ gravity.</description>

      <title>Creation of Viscous Dark Energy by the Hubble Flow: Comparison with SNe Ia Master Sample Binned Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a cosmological model featuring evolutionary dark energy, according to the idea that the creation of its constituents arises from the gravitational field of the expanding universe, whose non-equilibrium physics is described by a non-zero bulk viscosity coefficient. This physical scenario calls for two additional parameters with respect to the {\Lambda}CDM model, one of which is the equation of state parameter of the created dark energy. The model is constrained by the requirement that its deceleration parameter coincides with the one predicted by the {\Lambda}CDM model. Then, we construct the effective running Hubble constant, a theoretical function that corresponds to the ratio of the Hubble parameter in our model to the {\Lambda}CDM expansion rate. The model's theoretical predictions for the effective running Hubble constant are compared with the binned data of the Supernovae Ia Master Sample. The comparison is performed by a MCMC procedure for each bin, with three parameters left free to vary, while the particle creation rate is taken from a grid of values, each of which is fixed in the given MCMC run. The most important result emerging from this analysis is that the created dark energy constituent corresponds to an equation of state parameter with phantom character. Only if particle creation is removed do the dark energy constituents acquire a quintessence character. No matter the intrinsic nature of the constituents, their effective z-dependent equation of state parameter is, both with and without considering particle creation, entirely of phantom nature across the considered redshift range.</description>

      <title>Constraining interacting dark energy models with black hole superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent preference for a dynamical dark energy (DE) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument seems to call for interactions between DE and dark matter (DM), either from direct DM-DE interaction or indirect interaction induced by modified gravity. Therefore, an independent probe for these kinds of DE-DM interactions would be appealing from observational aspects. In this paper, we propose the black hole superradiance as a novel astrophysical probe for field-theoretic interacting DE-DM models, providing complementary constraints independent of large-scale cosmological observations. The core principle is that the DE-DM interaction can alter the effective mass of the superradiant ultralight boson, thereby modifying its superradiant instability rate around spinning black holes. We explore this connection through two distinct scenarios: a model where the DE field mediates a dark fifth force within the DM sector, affecting the superradiance from DM particles; and a novel mechanism where the DE field itself becomes superradiant due to the effective mass enhancement induced by dense DM spikes around supermassive black holes. By applying a statistical framework to black hole observations in both scenarios, we derive constraints on the fundamental DE-DM coupling strength. Although the current constraints are rather loose due to small samples and inaccurate measurements, our work provides new astrophysical constraints on these interacting DE-DM scenarios and establishes a new synergy between black hole physics and cosmology for probing the fundamental nature of the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Absorption effects in the expanding Universe: spectral transmittance functions of intergalactic medium for distant sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the formation of troughs in the continuous spectra of sources in redshift range $5-15$ for two reionization histories followed from the distant galaxy spectra and CMB anisotropy. We supposed that neutral hydrogen and helium atoms of homogeneous intergalactic medium are mainly in ground state and absorb the light of distant sources in the lines of Lyman series and continuums of HI, HeI and HeII. The frequency dependence of optical depths in the 40 lines of Lyman series of HI and HeII, and in 10 lines of HeI, as well as in their continuums were computed in order to estimate the spectral flux of radiation from halos virialized during Cosmic Dawn and Reionization epochs. Assuming the thermal continuous spectra with virialized temperature of halos with dwarf galaxy mass $\sim10^9$ M$_\odot$, we compute the spectral fluxes from such halos in the vicinity of our galaxy taking into account the cosmological distances, redshifts and absorptions by each absorber and all together. The obtained spectral transmittance functions of intergalactic medium, $S(\lambda;z)$, are analysed on the subject which absorber systems of HI, HeI and HeII are corresponding for formation of troughs in the continuous spectra of sources at redshift range $5-15$ and how it depends on reionization history. It is shown, that spectral features in the continuous spectra of sources in redshift range $5-7$ are very sensitive to the reionization histories of both elements, hydrogen and helium.</description>

      <title>Denoising weak lensing mass maps with diffusion model and generative adversarial network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The matter distribution of the Universe can be mapped through the weak gravitational lensing (WL) effect: small distortions of the shapes of distant galaxies, which reflects the inhomogeneity of the cosmic density field. The most dominant contaminant in the WL effect is the shape noise; the signal is diluted due to the finite number of source galaxies. In order to explore the full potential of WL measurements, sharpening the signal by removing the shape noise from the observational data, i.e., WL denoising, is a pressing issue. Machine learning approaches, in particular, deep generative models, have proven effective at the WL denoising task. We implement a denoising model based on the diffusion model (DM) and conduct systematic in-depth comparisons with generative adversarial networks (GANs), which have been applied in previous works for WL denoising. Utilizing the large suite of mock simulations of WL observations, we demonstrate that DM surpasses GAN in the WL denosing task in multiple aspects: (1) the training process is more stable, (2) taking the average of multiple samples from DM can robustly reproduce the true signal, and (3) DM can recover various statistics with higher accuracy.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter-Dark Radiation Interactions and the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models in which a subcomponent of dark matter interacts with dark radiation have been proposed as a solution to the Hubble tension. In this framework, the interacting subcomponent of dark matter is in thermal equilibrium with the dark radiation in the early universe, but decouples from it around the time of matter-radiation equality. We study this general class of models and evaluate the quality of fit to recent cosmological data on the cosmic microwave background (from Planck 2018 and ACT DR6), baryon acoustic oscillations, large-scale structure, supernovae type Ia, and Cepheid variables. We focus on three benchmark scenarios that differ in the rate at which the dark matter decouples from the dark radiation, resulting in different patterns of dark acoustic oscillations. Fitting without ACT DR6 data, we find that all three scenarios significantly reduce the Hubble tension relative to $\Lambda$CDM, with an exponentially fast decoupling being the most preferred. The tension is reduced to less than $2 \, \sigma$ in fits that don't include the SH0ES collaboration results as part of the data and to less than $1 \, \sigma$ when these are included. When ACT DR6 data is included, the fit is significantly worsened. We find that the largest $H_0$ value at the $95 \%$ confidence region is $70.1$ km/s/Mpc without the SH0ES data, leading to only a mild reduction in the tension. This increases to $72.5$ km/s/Mpc, corresponding to a reduction in the tension to less than $3 \, \sigma$, if the SH0ES results are included in the fit.</description>

      <title>Dark energy after pre-recombination early dark energy in light of DESI DR2 and the latest ACT and SPT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been noted that with the pre-recombination early dark energy (EDE) resolution of Hubble tension, the preference of recent datasets for the evolving dark energy (DE) can be suppressed significantly. In this work, we clarify and reconfirm this result with DESI DR2 and the latest ACT DR6 and SPT-3G D1, the tightest small-scale CMB constraints up to date. In the $w_0w_a$CDM model with EDE, a quintessence-like component ($w_0+w_a\geq-1$) can be 1$\sigma$ consistent with Planck+ACT+SPT+DESI+Pantheon+SH0ES datasets, and $\Delta\chi^2\lesssim -14$ compared with $w_0w_a$CDM model without EDE. This reveals the possibility that when the potential resolutions of Hubble tension are considered, current accelerated expansion can attribute to a canonical evolving scalar field or cosmological constant, and again highlights the importance of re-examining the nature of DE within the broader context of cosmological tensions.</description>

      <title>Holographic Constraints on the String Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that holography imposes strong and general constraints on scalar field potentials in the string landscape, determined by the asymptotic structure of the underlying spacetime. Applying these holographic consistency conditions, we identify broad classes of scalar potentials that are incompatible with a well-defined dual description. These include potentials with extended plateaus, excessively steep or shallow asymptotics, certain zero crossings, and specific alignments of stable AdS minima in moduli space. In particular, making the standard assumption that the CFT dual to a stable AdS vacuum must be realized as a worldvolume theory of a brane in string theory, we show that the brane selects an infinite-distance limit in moduli space where parametric scale separation is forbidden. Furthermore, the steepness and positivity of the potential are restricted in that infinite distance direction. We also find that requiring the validity of the effective theory in the future vacuum, a natural holographic criterion, automatically enforces the Trans-Planckian Censorship Conjecture (TCC) for classical cosmological solutions with positive potentials. Taken together, these constraints exclude the leading proposals to realize scale-separated AdS vacua and metastable de Sitter vacua in the string theory landscape such as DGKT and KKLT.</description>

      <title>Do z&gt;6 quasars reside in protoclusters?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the properties of a sample of z&gt;6 bright (bolometric luminosity L$_{\rm bolo}$&gt;10$^{46.25}$ erg/s) Quasars drawn from a realization of the GAlaxy Evolution and Assembly (GAEA) model coupled with the Planck Millennium Simulation. We focus on the properties and environment of host galaxies, and their evolution down to z=0, with the aim of assessing how well the bright high redshift QSOs population traces the progenitors of most massive haloes in the local Universe. Our results show that at z&gt;6 bright QSOs live in a variety of environments, and that secular processes like disc instability are responsible for triggering roughly the same number of QSOs as galaxy mergers. Half of cubic (7.5 $h^{-1}$ cMpc size) mock fields built around these high-z QSOs include other active galaxies (with L$_{\rm bolo}$&gt;10$^{44}$ erg/s) in sizeable number, the other host galaxies being relatively isolated. The large field-to-field variance in the the number of companions (both active and non-active) recently reported from JWST observations is fairly well reproduced by GAEA predictions. Descendants of host galaxies at z=0 cover a wide range of physical properties and environments with only a small fraction of the hosts of high-z QSOs ending up in massive galaxy clusters. Viceversa, GAEA predicts that only a small fraction of Bright Central Galaxies have a bright z&gt;6 QSOs among their progenitors. Our results suggest that luminous high-z QSO loosely trace the progenitors of low-z galaxy clusters, and that additional information about the environment of high-z QSOs are required to identify the most promising proto-cluster candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assume axion-like particles (ALPs) to provide the full dark matter abundance and derive various lower bounds on the ALP mass. We contrast the post- and pre-inflationary symmetry breaking cases and present allowed regions in the plane of ALP mass and energy scale of inflation. For the post-inflationary case, we revisit bounds from isocurvature perturbations taking into account that, as suggested by simulations, axion radiation by cosmic strings during the scaling regime provides the dominant production mechanism of dark matter, obtaining significantly weaker limits than previously. Combining isocurvature, with constraints from black hole superradiance and free streaming, we find that the bound $m_a \gtrsim 10^{-17}$ eV applies for most cases considered here. It can be potentially relaxed to $\sim 6\times 10^{-19}$ eV only in the post-inflationary case with a strongly temperature-dependent axion mass, subject to uncertainties on the axion emission spectrum. Significantly stronger bounds are obtained in the post-inflationary scenario from the non-observation of CMB tensor modes, which can be as strong as $m_a &gt; 5\times 10^{-7}$ eV for small reheating efficiencies, $\epsilon \lesssim 5\times 10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>A scattering perspective on gravitational lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves propagating across gravitational potentials undergo lensing effects that, in the wave-optics regime, manifest as frequency-dependent amplitude and phase modulations. In this work, we revisit the diffraction integral formalism of gravitational lensing and demonstrate that it admits a natural and transparent interpretation within the framework of scattering theory. We establish a direct correspondence between the lensing amplification factor and the scattering amplitude of waves propagating in curved spacetime, clarifying how familiar lensing limits map onto distinct scattering regimes. In particular, we show that the diffraction integral matches exactly the eikonal limit of the scattering amplitude at lowest post-Minkowskian order, after a change in coordinates and the inclusion of finite-distance effects. We further extend the standard formalism by including subleading corrections to the post-Minkowskian and eikonal approximations. Our results provide a unified theoretical framework for the interpretation of lensed gravitational-wave signals and open the way to more accurate waveform modeling for future lensed observations.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Chemical Enrichment in the Abell 2029 Core with XRISM, XMM-Newton, and Chandra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new measurements of the chemical abundance pattern in the core of the nearby galaxy cluster Abell~2029, based on XRISM observations with Resolve (37 ks) and Xtend (500 ks), combined with archival data from XMM-Newton (EPIC, RGS) and Chandra. Fe abundances derived from Resolve, Xtend, and EPIC are broadly consistent, while RGS gives systematically lower values. Because the XRISM gate valve remained closed during these observations, Resolve spectral fitting is restricted to the 2--10 keV band, providing reliable constraints only for elements with strong lines in this band (S, Ar, Ca, Fe, Ni). Abundances of the $\alpha$-elements are therefore derived using complementary observations from Xtend, EPIC, RGS, and Chandra. We construct an average X/Fe pattern in the cluster core by using Resolve exclusively for S/Fe, Ar/Fe, Ca/Fe, and Ni/Fe, and RGS + Xtend for O/Fe. The Ne/Fe ratio is averaged from Xtend, EPIC, RGS, and Chandra measurements; Mg/Fe from EPIC and Chandra measurements; and Si/Fe from Xtend, EPIC, and Chandra. Comparison with the supernovae yield models indicates that the observed abundance pattern in A2029 core is best reproduced by a combination of core-collapsed yields from low-metallicity progenitors ($Z_{\rm init}=0.001$) and a sub-Chandrasekhar-mass, double-degenerate Type Ia model. Additionally, we find an excess in Ca abundance in the core of A2029 that cannot be reproduced by the standard supernovae yield models.</description>

      <title>Structure Formation with Dark Magnetohydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range interactions in the dark sector can give rise to collective plasma phenomena that are capable of modifying the evolution of dark matter halos. We present the first study of gravitational collapse in a secluded dark $U(1)_D$ model using a magnetohydrodynamic description of the dark matter. We show that dark magnetic fields generate an anisotropic pressure that alters the Jeans scale and suppresses small-scale power in a direction-dependent manner. For a range of primordial magnetic spectral indices, this effect produces distinctive modifications to the linear matter power spectrum. We find that current observations cannot yet constrain viable dark magnetic fields, as CMB tensor modes mostly provide more stringent constraints. Nevertheless, forthcoming high-resolution probes of the matter power spectrum (CMB-HD lensing, HERA, and EDGES) will be able to test these predictions and are sensitive to dark charge-to-mass ratios in the range $10^{-20}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}\lesssim q_\chi/m_\chi\lesssim 10^{-14}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The textbook N=1 supergravity has an F-term potential depending on a superpotential $W(z_i)$ and a Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$, with the scalar potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})=e^K (|DW|^2 - 3 |W|^2)$. In this approach, it is not always easy to find the potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ with the required properties. We show that in supergravity with a nilpotent superfield and with any Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i} )$ one can obtain any desired potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ by a proper choice of the Kahler metric of the nilpotent superfield. This construction is particularly suitable for cosmological and particle physics applications, which may require maximal freedom in the choice of kinetic terms and scalar potentials.</description>

      <title>Temperature definitions and phase transitions within non-minimal large and small inflationary potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore and compare two distinct temperature definitions for scalar field inflation in the context of small- and large-field potentials. The first is based on a real gas, fluid-like temperature, $T_{RG}$, while the second corresponds to a relativistic species-like temperature, $T_{RS}$. We derive the fundamental thermodynamic relations for both and analyze their implications for the most viable inflationary potentials, consistent with Planck constraints. We also investigate non-minimally coupled scenarios, finding that $T_{RS}$ is the most self-consistent choice, as it decreases during inflation, satisfies standard thermodynamic laws, and exhibits frame-independent behavior in both the Jordan and Einstein frames. Remarkably, the $T_{RS}$ approach shows that the inflaton's dynamics is well-described by Van der Waals-like isotherms, linking inflationary evolution to thermodynamic phase transitions. We find that the onset of inflation is associated with a phase transition acting as the ``trigger'' of the inflationary epoch. Our analysis highlights inconsistencies in the hilltop potential and, more generally, in small-field potentials unless a non-minimal coupling is introduced. Conversely, the Starobinsky and $\alpha$-attractor models emerge as the most suitable paradigms. We further show that \emph{frame independence} is achieved only for coupling values $\zeta \leq 1/6$, supporting very small values. Finally, our study of natural inflation with non-minimal coupling reveals a strong dependence on the coupling parameter, where bounds associated with thermodynamic phase transitions coincide with observationally viable ranges, suggesting that thermodynamic considerations may provide an additional criterion to discriminate among inflationary scenarios.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Reionization Constraints: An ANN-Emulator Framework for the SCRIPT Semi-numerical Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constraining the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) with physically motivated simulations is hampered by the high cost of conventional parameter inference. We present an efficient emulator-based framework that dramatically reduces this bottleneck for the photon-conserving semi-numerical code SCRIPT. Our approach combines (i) a reliable coarse-resolution MCMC to locate the high-likelihood region (exploiting the large-scale convergence of SCRIPT) with (ii) an adaptive, targeted sampling strategy to build a compact high-resolution training set for an artificial neural network based emulator of the model likelihood. With only $\approx 10^3$ high-resolution simulations, the trained emulators achieve excellent predictive accuracy ($R^2 \approx 0.97$--$0.99$) and, when embedded within an MCMC framework, reproduce posterior distributions from full high-resolution runs. Compared to conventional MCMC, our pipeline reduces the number of expensive simulations by a factor of $\sim 100$ and lowers total CPU cost by up to a factor of $\sim 70$, while retaining statistical fidelity. This computational speedup makes inference in much higher-dimensional models tractable (e.g., those needed to incorporate JWST and upcoming 21 cm datasets) and provides a general strategy for building efficient emulators for next generation of EoR constraints.</description>

      <title>Herglotz-type $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-conservation of the energy-momentum tensor in $f(R,T)$ gravity can be interpreted as an effective manifestation of dissipation. Motivated by this, we propose a new formulation of $f(R,T)$ gravity based on the Herglotz variational principle, which extends the usual {Hamilton} variational principle to dissipative systems by allowing the Lagrangian to depend explicitly on the action. The resulting gravitational field equations extend those of $f(R,T)$ gravity by including Herglotz contributions. In the Newtonian limit, these contributions modify the gravitational potential, allowing us to constrain the Herglotz vector through Mercury's perihelion precession and the relativistic light deflection. Remarkably, the Herglotz corrections lead to a scaling law consistent with observations from the Cassini spacecraft. Examining two representative cosmological models, the Herglotz vector effectively reduces to a single function that, under suitable conditions, can play the role of a cosmological constant, providing an alternative mechanism for the Universe's accelerated expansion. Within the Herglotz variational approach, the linear $f(R,T)=R+\alpha T$ model, previously ruled out in the standard formulation due to its fixed deceleration parameter, becomes consistent with observations.</description>

      <title>High-frequency Gravitational Waves from Superstring Phases in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When moduli roll in the early universe, all physical scales - including string tensions - simultaneously evolve. The dynamics of cosmic string loops with time-varying tension can produce cosmic string loop trackers in which most of the energy density of the universe lies in the form of string loops. This solution can exist as an attractor until the rolling modulus reaches its minimum, when the loops ultimately decay through gravitational wave emission. We explore the spectrum of gravitational waves produced by such string loop trackers. The resulting spectrum is high-frequency and peaks in the GHz regime today. The amplitude of the signal is diluted by any subsequent matter-dominated epochs, and thus the potential observability of the signal crucially depends on the duration of the moduli-dominated epoch that follows once the moduli settle down and oscillate about their minimum.</description>

      <title>Tracing Early Cosmic Chemical Enrichment: A Uniform XMM-Newton Survey of Metallicity in Galaxy Groups and Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observed metal abundances in the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy groups and clusters, $Z_{ICM}$, exceed what is expected from present-day stellar populations alone. Galaxy clusters are presumed to be near closed-box systems, allowing constraints to be placed on the origins of metals and stellar populations responsible for $Z_{ICM}$. We present a uniform XMM-Newton survey of 26 galaxy groups and clusters, measuring radial metallicity profiles and relating $Z_{ICM}$ with the stellar fraction $M_*/M_{gas}$. We determine $Z_{ICM}$ via spectral fitting across multiple annuli finding a best fit of $Z_{ICM} = -0.08^{+0.07}_{-0.07}\, log\left(\frac{M_*}{M_{gas}}\right) + 0.30^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ with intrinsic scatter $\sigma_p = 0.09^{+0.02}_{-0.01}$. We use closed-box chemical evolution models to estimate the metallicity yield from observable stellar populations, incorporating updated supernova yields and corrections for metals locked in remnants, $Z_* = (1.14 \pm 0.52) \, log\left(1 + \frac{M_*}{M_{gas}}\right)$. Our results demonstrate that present-day stellar populations systematically underpredict $Z_{ICM}$, with an inferred excess component increasing in systems with low $M_*/M_{gas}$. This trend supports the need for an early enrichment population (EEP) distinct from visible stars, $Z_{EEP}$. We find this necessity holds when reconsidering the closed-box assumption by removing all galaxy groups, potential leaky systems, deriving $Z_{EEP}$ within $1\sigma$ when including and excluding groups. Three systems (NGC1132, NGC5098, and NGC4325) deviate from the survey trend, exhibiting steep negative radial metallicity gradients and unusually low $Z_{ICM}$. We posit these systems to be late-forming whose ICM enrichment reflects only recent stellar populations. Our analysis quantifies the necessity of an EEP and provides trends for testing cluster chemical evolution models.</description>

      <title>WIMP Freeze-out dynamics under Tsallis statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize thermal WIMP (Weakly Interacting Massive Particle) freeze-out within Tsallis nonextensive statistics. Using Curado-Tsallis $q$-distributions $f_q(E;\mu,T)$ we compute $q$-deformed number and energy densities, pressure, entropy density and Hubble rate, $\{n_q,\rho_q,P_q,s_q,H_q\}$. The Boltzmann equation is generalized accordingly to obtain the comoving abundance $Y_{\chi,q}(x)$ and relic density $\Omega_{\chi,q}h^2$ for a dark-matter candidate $\chi$ in a model-independent setup. The thermally averaged cross section is expanded as $\langle\sigma v\rangle_q \approx a + b\,\langle v_{\rm rel}^2\rangle_q$ up to $p$-wave. The freeze-out parameter $x_f(q)$ is determined from $\Gamma_{{\rm ann},q}(T_f)\simeq H_q(T_f)$ using a $q$-logarithmic inversion, with the expansion rate modified through ultra-relativistic rescalings $R_\rho(q)$ of the effective relativistic degrees of freedom $g_*$ and $g_{*s}$. We show that $x_f$ increases with $q$ and that QCD-threshold features propagate into $Y_{\chi,q}(x)$ and $\Omega_{\chi,q}h^2$. We then perform two $q$-grid scans: fixing $\langle\sigma v\rangle_q$ while varying the dark-matter mass $m_\chi$, and fixing $m_\chi$ while varying the $s$-wave coefficient $a$. For an $s$-wave dominated scenario we construct $\chi^2$ profiles in these planes by comparing $\Omega_{\chi,q}h^2$ with the Planck benchmark $\Omega_c h^2 = 0.120\pm 0.001$. In both cases we find a clear degeneracy in the preferred nonextensive parameter $q_{\rm best}$ along valleys in parameter space. However, fixed-mass scans (varying $\langle\sigma v\rangle_q$) are significantly more constraining than fixed-cross-section scans, reflecting that $\Omega_{\chi,q}h^2$ is mainly controlled by $\langle\sigma v\rangle_q$, so that for realistic cross sections the best-fit $q_{\rm best}$ remains close to the extensive limit $q\to 1$.</description>

      <title>k-inflation: Non-separable case meets ACT measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a non-separable subset of $k$-essence in which the kinetic and potential sectors interact through an $X^{\rho}V(\phi)$ coupling, implemented via a potential-dependent prefactor $f(\phi)=1+2\mathcal{K}V$. In slow roll, this structure preserves a constant sound speed $c_s^2=1/(2\rho-1)$ while modifying the Hubble flow in a controlled way, thereby shifting the inflationary observables relative to the separable template. For monomial potentials $V=A\phi^n$ (with $n=2$ and $n=2/3$ as representative cases) we derive closed analytic expressions for $n_s(N_\ast)$ and $r(N_\ast)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_{\rm mix}^2)$, where $\epsilon_{\rm mix}\propto\mathcal{K}$ encodes the non-separable $X^\rho V$ mixing, and we validate them against exact background integrations. The analytic and numerical predictions agree at the sub-per-mille level for $n_s$ and at the percent level for $r$, confirming the accuracy of the small-mixing expansion. For $\mathcal{K}&lt;0$ the mixing systematically lowers both $n_s$ and $r$ at fixed $N_\ast$, allowing otherwise marginal monomials to fall within the region favored by recent ACT+{\it Planck}+BAO constraints (P--ACT--LB). All solutions shown satisfy the health conditions $f(\phi)&gt;0$, $\rho&gt;\tfrac12$, and the positivity bound $V&lt;1/(2|\mathcal K|)$ (from $f&gt;0$). We also discuss parameter dependence and the expected equilateral-type non-Gaussianity, which remains comfortably within current bounds for the benchmarks considered.</description>

      <title>Domain walls in the scaling regime: Equal Time Correlator and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain walls are topological defects that may have formed in the early Universe through the spontaneous breakdown of discrete symmetries, and can be a strong source of gravitational waves (GWs). We perform 3D lattice field theory simulations with CosmoLattice, considering grid sizes $N = 1250$, $2048$ and $4096$, to study the dynamics of the domain wall network and its GW signatures. We first analyze how the network approaches the scaling regime with a constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$ number of domain walls per Hubble volume, including setups with a large initial number of domains as expected in realistic scenarios, and find that scaling is always reached in a few Hubble times after the network formation. To better understand the properties of the scaling regime, we then numerically extract the Equal Time Correlator (ETC) of the energy-momentum tensor of the network, thus determining its characteristic shape for the case of domain walls, and verifying explicitly its functional dependence as predicted by scaling arguments. The ETC can be further extended to the Unequal Time Correlator (UTC) controlling the GW emission by making assumptions on the coherence of the source. By comparison with the actual GW spectrum evaluated by CosmoLattice, we are then able to infer the degree of coherence of the domain wall network. Finally, by performing numerical simulations in different background cosmologies, e.g. radiation domination and kination, we find evidence for a universal ETC at subhorizon scales and hence a universal shape of the GW spectrum in the UV, while the expansion history of the Universe may instead be determined by the IR features of the GW spectrum.</description>

      <title>Cross-correlating the EMU Pilot Survey 1 with CMB lensing: Constraints on cosmology and galaxy bias with harmonic-space power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measured the harmonic-space power spectrum of galaxy clustering auto-correlation from the Evolutionary Map of the Universe Pilot Survey 1 data (EMU PS1) and its cross-correlation with the lensing convergence map of cosmic microwave background (CMB) from Planck Public Release 4 at the linear scale range from $\ell=2$ to 500. We applied two flux density cuts at $0.18$ and $0.4$mJy on the radio galaxies observed at 944MHz and considered two source detection algorithms. We found the auto-correlation measurements from the two algorithms at the 0.18mJy cut to deviate for $\ell\gtrsim250$ due to the different criteria assumed on the source detection and decided to ignore data above this scale. We report a cross-correlation detection of EMU PS1 with CMB lensing at $\sim$5.5$\sigma$, irrespective of flux density cut. In our theoretical modelling we considered two redshift distribution simulation models that yield consistent results, a linear and a non-linear matter power spectrum, and two linear galaxy bias models. That is a constant redshift-independent galaxy bias $b(z)=b_g$ and a constant amplitude galaxy bias $b(z)=b_g/D(z)$. By fixing a cosmology model and considering a non-linear matter power spectrum, we measured a constant galaxy bias at $0.18$mJy ($0.4$mJy) with $b_g=2.32^{+0.41}_{-0.33}$ ($2.18^{+0.17}_{-0.25}$) and a constant amplitude bias with $b_g=1.72^{+0.31}_{-0.21}$ ($1.78^{+0.22}_{-0.15}$). When $\sigma_8$ is a free parameter for the same models at $0.18$mJy ($0.4$mJy) with the constant model we found $\sigma_8=0.68^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ ($0.82\pm0.10$), while with the constant amplitude model we measured $\sigma_8=0.61^{+0.18}_{-0.20}$ ($0.78^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$), respectively. Our results agree at $1\sigma$ with the measurements from Planck CMB and the weak lensing surveys and also show the potential of cosmology studies with future radio continuum survey data.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Hubble Constant with a Simulated Full Covariance Matrix Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubble parameter, $H(z)$, plays a crucial role in understanding the expansion history of the universe and constraining the Hubble constant, $\mathrm{H}_0$. The Cosmic Chronometers (CC) method provides an independent approach to measuring $H(z)$, but existing studies either neglect off-diagonal elements in the covariance matrix or use an incomplete covariance matrix, limiting the accuracy of $\mathrm{H}_0$ constraints. To address this, we use a Positive-Definite Covariance Network (PD-CovNet) to simulate the full $33 \times 33$ covariance matrix based on a previously published $15 \times 15$ covariance matrix. Hyperparameters are chosen via leave-one-z-out validation, and performance is benchmarked against a Gaussian-process (GP) baseline. Under identical five-fold cross-validation over redshift groups, we prove that PD-CovNet is a reliable generator of the full covariance compared to the GP baseline. Using this full PD-CovNet-simulated covariance alongside three comparators with different covariance specifications, we constrain $\mathrm{H}_0$ with two independent methods (EMCEE and GP). Across all covariance specifications and both constraint methods, standardized differences and two-sided p-values show no statistically meaningful shift in the central value of the constrained $\mathrm{H}_0$. However, the precision of the constrained $\mathrm{H}_0$ depends on both covariance and method: EMCEE is uniformly more precise than GP once covariance is modeled; within a fixed method, incorporating more covariance reduces precision; and PD-CovNet hyperparameters have a modest effect on uncertainty. These results indicate the importance of accurate covariance modeling in CC-based $\mathrm{H}_0$ constraints.</description>

      <title>Did DESI DR2 truly reveal dynamical dark energy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental question in cosmology is whether dark energy evolves over time, a topic that has gained prominence since the discovery of cosmic acceleration. Recently, the DESI collaboration has reported increasing evidence for evolving dark energy using combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB), type Ia supernova (SN), and their new measurements of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). However, our analysis reveals that these combinations are problematic due to clear tensions among the CMB, BAO and SN datasets. Consequently, DESI's claim of dynamical dark energy (DDE) is not robust. A more reliable approach involves constraining the evolution of dark energy using each dataset independently. Through a statistical comparison for each dataset, on average, we find that DDE is strongly preferred over the $\Lambda$CDM model. This suggests that DDE likely exists, although its real parameter space remains elusive due to weak constraints on the dark energy equation of state and inconsistencies among the datasets. Interestingly, when considering DDE, none of the individual datasets -- including CMB, DESI DR2, Pantheon+, Union3, and DESY5 -- can independently detect cosmic acceleration at a significant level. Our findings not only clarify the current understanding of the nature of dark energy but also challenge the established discovery of cosmic acceleration and the long-held notion that dark energy exerts negative pressure. Both individual and combined datasets suggest that the ultimate fate of the universe is likely to be dominated by matter rather than dark energy.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Gaussian Process Kernels Using Nested Sampling and ABC Rejection for H(z) Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent cosmological observations have achieved high-precision measurements of the Universe's expansion history, prompting the use of nonparametric methods such as Gaussian processes (GP) regression. We apply GP regression for reconstructing the Hubble parameter using CC data, with improved covariance modeling and latest study in CC data. By comparing reconstructions in redshift space $z$ and transformed space $\log(z+1)$ , we evaluate six kernel functions using nested sampling (NS) and approximate Bayesian computation rejection (ABC rejection) methods and analyze the construction of Hubble constant $H_0$ in different models. Our analysis demonstrates that reconstructions in $\log(z+1)$ space remain physically reasonable, offering a viable alternative to conventional $z$ space approaches, while the introduction of nondiagonal covariance matrices leads to degraded reconstruction quality, suggesting that simplified diagonal forms may be preferable for reconstruction. These findings underscore the importance of task-specific kernel selection in GP-based cosmological inference. In particular, our findings suggest that careful preliminary screening of kernel functions, based on the physical quantities of interest, is essential for reliable inference in cosmological research using GP.</description>

      <title>On the interpretation of XRISM X-ray measurements of turbulence in the intracluster medium: a comparison with cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04727v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether the properties of turbulent gas motions recently measured via X-ray spectroscopy in the Coma cluster of galaxies by XRISM are in tension with the turbulent picture established by current numerical cosmological simulations. We use a high-resolution simulation of a Coma-like cluster and show that the simulation yields velocity structure functions and X-ray line-widths that are compatible with those measured by the XRISM observations of Coma. In particular, it has been previously suggested that a much steeper turbulence spectrum than the Kolmogorov would be needed to explain the XRISM observations under a homogeneous, cluster volume-filling turbulence model. Our results show that this tension is overcome thanks to the more complicated turbulent picture in cosmological simulations, that indeed shows a patchy distribution of turbulent regions in galaxy clusters, with a spectrum that is generally consistent with a Kolmogorov power-law over a fairly wide range of scales. More generally, our study highlights the fact that the interpretation of XRISM data of galaxy clusters depends on the turbulence model used and the importance of combining data and advanced simulations in the future steps.</description>

      <title>Cosmological observational tests in the JWST Era. I: angular size - redshift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study is devoted to the cosmological "angular size - redshift" test. An analysis is performed of the angular and linear sizes of galaxies from the new ASTRODEEP-JWST catalogue, which contains over 500,000 objects at high redshifts (up to ~20 photometrically determined and up to ~14 spectroscopically determined). For the calculations, 6 860 galaxies with reliably determined spectroscopic redshifts and 319,771 galaxies with known photometric redshifts were used. The linear sizes of galaxies were computed within the framework of two cosmological models - the standard ({\Lambda}CDM) model and one of the static models (the so-called "tired light" model). We have shown that within the framework of the {\Lambda}CDM model, a significant evolution of the linear sizes of galaxies is observed, with the rate of the evolution closely matching the rate of the cosmic expansion. In contrast, in the static model, the characteristic linear sizes of galaxies exhibit almost no evolution with increasing z.</description>

Abstract: The 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen is a promising probe of the early Universe, yet extracting astrophysical parameters from its power spectrum remains a major challenge. We present a beginner-friendly PyTorch pipeline for Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (MNRE), a Simulation-Based Inference (SBI) method that bypasses explicit likelihoods. Using 21cmFAST simulations, we show that MNRE can recover key astrophysical parameters such as the ionizing efficiency $\zeta$ and X-ray luminosity $L_X$ directly from power spectra. Our implementation prioritizes transparency and accessibility, offering a practical entry point for new researchers in 21-cm cosmology.</description>

      <title>Signatures of dynamical activity in the hot gas profiles of groups and clusters in the FLAMINGO simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In anticipation of upcoming cosmological surveys, we use the large volume Flamingo hydrodynamical simulations to look for signatures of dynamical activity, focusing on the hot gas profiles of groups and clusters out to redshift $z=1$. To determine the dynamical state of each object, we consider the halo mass accretion rate, $\Gamma$, as well as three observational proxies: stellar mass gap, $\Mstar$; X-ray concentration, $c_\mathrm{x}$, and X-ray centroid shift, $\left&lt;w\right&gt;$. In general, the median values of these indicators vary in accordance with an increase in dynamical activity with both mass and redshift. We find $\left&lt;w\right&gt;$ to be the most reliable proxy, while $c_\mathrm{x}$ and $\Mstar$ are more sensitive to resolution and feedback model details. Looking at the profiles, the correlation between dark matter density and $\Gamma$ has a characteristic radial dependence, being negatively (positively) correlated at small (large) radii. This trend is insensitive to both halo mass and redshift. Similar behaviour is also seen for the hot gas densities in low redshift clusters, particularly when using $\left&lt;w\right&gt;$, but the correlations become weaker in groups, at higher redshift and when stronger feedback is employed. We also find the intrinsic scatter in the gas density profiles to decrease with redshift, particularly in groups, contrary to what is seen for the dark matter. Interestingly, the radius of minimum gas density scatter increases with feedback strength, suggesting that this property could be a useful feedback diagnostic in future observational studies.</description>

      <title>Morphology of Inflationary Gravitational Wave Spectra imprinted by a Sequence of Post-Inflationary Epochs $via$ ${\rm GWInSpect}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The expansion history of the Universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) remains largely unconstrained. The high-energy post-inflationary era may involve multiple distinct epochs, each characterized by a different equation of state (EoS). A key prediction of inflation is the generation of tensor perturbations that later manifest as a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The large-scale amplitude and small-scale spectral tilt ($n_{\rm GW}$) of these GWs encode the inflationary energy scale and the subsequent expansion history, respectively. A soft post-inflationary EoS ($w&lt;1/3$) yields red-tilted GW spectra ($n_{\rm GW}&lt;0$), while a stiff EoS ($w&gt;1/3$) results in a blue-tilt ($n_{\rm GW}&gt;0$). In our previous work [arXiv:2407.07956], we developed an analytical framework for computing the GW spectral energy density, $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$, for multiple post-inflationary transitions ($w_1 \to w_2 \to \cdots \to w_n \to 1/3$), focusing on the parameter space relevant for future GW observations. In this paper, we extend that framework to systematically investigate the $morphological~diversity$ of inflationary GW spectra generated by multi-epoch post-inflationary histories. Remaining model agnostic, we demonstrate that a wide variety of spectral shapes, ranging from convex and concave monotonic profiles to multi-peaked non-monotonic spectra, can naturally emerge depending on the sequence and duration of these epochs. We also introduce GWInSpect, a publicly available Python package that computes $\Omega_{\rm GW}(f)$ for arbitrary sequences of EoS transitions, providing a practical tool to study the pre-BBN expansion history of the Universe.</description>

      <title>JWST lensed quasar dark matter survey IV: Stringent warm dark matter constraints from the joint reconstruction of extended lensed arcs and quasar flux ratios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the free-streaming length of dark matter (DM) and subhalo abundance around 28 quadruple image strong lenses using observations from JWST MIRI presented in Paper III of this series. We improve on previous inferences on DM properties from lensed quasars by simultaneously reconstructing extended lensed arcs with image positions and relative magnifications (flux ratios). Our forward modeling framework generates full populations of subhalos, line-of-sight halos, and globular clusters, uses an accurate model for subhalo tidal evolution, and accounts for free-streaming effects on halo abundance and concentration. Modeling lensed arcs leads to more-precise model-predicted flux ratios, breaking covariance between subhalo abundance and the free-streaming scale parameterized by the half-mode mass $m_{\rm{hm}}$. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model {\tt{galacticus}} ($N$-body simulations), we infer (Bayes factor of 10:1) $m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.4} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ ($m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.2} \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), a 0.4 dex improvement relative to omitting lensed arcs. These bounds correspond to lower limits on thermal relic DM particle masses of $7.4$ and $8.4$ keV, respectively. Conversely, assuming DM is cold, we infer a projected mass in subhalos ($10^6 &lt; m/M_{\odot}&lt;10^{10.7}$) of $1.7_{-1.2}^{+2.6} \times 10^7 \ \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$ at $95 \%$ confidence. This is consistent with {\tt{galacticus}} predictions ($0.9 \times 10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$), but in mild tension with recent $N$-body simulations ($0.6 \times 10^7 \mathrm{M}_{\odot} \ \rm{kpc^{-2}}$). Our results are among the strongest bounds on WDM, and the most precise measurement of subhalo abundance around strong lenses. Further improvements will follow from the large sample of lenses to be discovered by Euclid, Rubin, and Roman.</description>

Abstract: We present the full sample of measurements of the warm dust emission of 31 strongly-lensed, multiply imaged quasars, observed with JWST MIRI multiband imaging, which we use to constrain the particle properties of dark matter. The strongly lensed warm dust region of quasars is compact and statistically sensitive to a population of dark matter halos down to masses of $10^6$ M$_\odot$. The high spatial resolution and infrared sensitivity of MIRI make it uniquely suited to measure multiply imaged warm dust emission from quasars and thus to infer the properties of low-mass dark halos. We use the measured flux ratios to test for a warm dark matter turnover in the halo mass function. To infer the dark matter parameters, we use a forward modeling pipeline which explores dark matter parameters while also accounting for tidal stripping effects on subhalos, globular clusters, and complex deflector macromodels with $m=1, m=3, \text{ and } m=4$ elliptical multipole moments. Adopting a comparable prior on the projected density of substructure to our previous analyses, the data presented here provide a factor of 2 improvement in sensitivity to a turnover in the halo mass function. Assuming subhalo abundance predicted by the semi-analytic model galacticus we infer with a Bayes factor of 10:1, a half-mode mass $m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.8} M_{\odot}$ (m&gt;5.6 keV for a thermally produced dark matter particle). If instead we use a prior from N-body simulations, we infer $m_{\rm{hm}} &lt; 10^{7.6} M_{\odot}$ (m&gt;6.4 keV). This is one of the strongest constraints to date on a turnover on the halo mass function, and the flux ratios and inference methodology presented here can be used to test a broad range of dark matter physics.</description>

      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: A demonstration of CMB lensing measurement from daytime data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing power spectrum analysis using daytime data (11am-11pm UTC) gathered by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) over the period 2017-2022 (ACT Data Release 6). This dataset is challenging to analyze because the Sun heats and deforms the telescope mirror, complicating the characterization of the telescope. We perform more than one hundred null and consistency checks to ensure the robustness of our measurement and its compatibility with nighttime observations. We detect the CMB lensing power spectrum at 17$\sigma$ significance, with an amplitude $A_\textrm{lens} = 1.045 \pm 0.063$ with respect to the prediction from the best-fit Planck-ACT CMB power spectrum $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In combination with the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, this corresponds to a constraint on the amplitude of matter fluctuations $\sigma_8 = 0.826 \pm 0.027$. The analysis presented here is especially relevant for ground-based millimeter-wave CMB experiments at the Atacama site, paving the way for future analyses making use of both nighttime and daytime data to place tight constraints on cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>Converging on the Cepheid Metallicity Dependence: Implications of Non-Standard Gaia Parallax Recalibration on Distance Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By comparing Cepheid brightnesses with geometric distance measures including Gaia EDR3 parallaxes, most recent analyses conclude metal-rich Cepheids are brighter, quantified as $\gamma \sim -0.2$ mag/dex. While the value of $\gamma$ has little impact on the determination of the Hubble constant in contemporary distance ladders (due to the similarity of metallicity across these ladders), $\gamma$ plays a role in gauging the distances to metal-poor dwarf galaxies like the Magellanic Clouds and is of considerable interest in testing stellar models. Recently, Madore &amp; Freedman (2025, hereafter MF25) recalibrated Gaia EDR3 parallaxes by adding to them a magnitude offset to match certain historic Cepheid parallaxes which otherwise differ by $\sim1.6\sigma$. A calibration which adjusts Gaia parallaxes by applying a magnitude offset (i.e., a multiplicative correction in parallax) differs significantly from the Gaia Team's calibration (Lindegren et al. 2021), which is additive in parallax space - especially at distances much closer than 1 kpc or beyond 10 kpc, outside the $\sim$2-3 kpc range on which the MF25 calibration was based. The MF25 approach reduces $\gamma$ to zero. If extrapolated, it places nearby cluster distances like the Pleiades too close compared to independent measurements, while leaving distant quasars with negative parallaxes. We conclude that the MF25 proposal for Gaia calibration and $\gamma \sim 0$ produces farther-reaching consequences, many of which are strongly disfavored by the data.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-Mass-Driven Instabilities as the Earliest Flavor Conversion in Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective neutrino flavor conversions in core-collapse supernovae (SNe) begin with instabilities, initially triggered when the dominant $\nu_e$ outflow concurs with a small antineutrino flux of opposite lepton number, with $\overline{\nu}_e$ dominating over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$. When these "flipped" neutrinos emerge in the energy-integrated angular distribution (angular crossing), they initiate a fast instability. However, before such conditions arise, spectral crossings typically appear within $20~\mathrm{ms}$ of collapse, i.e., local spectral excesses of $\overline{\nu}_e$ over $\overline{\nu}_\mu$ along some direction. Therefore, post-processing SN simulations cannot consistently capture later fast instabilities because the early slow ones have already altered the conditions.</description>

      <title>Creating a Universe from Nothing as an Alternative to the Cosmological Principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the cosmological Robertson-Walker geometry required of the cosmological principle both the Weyl tensor $C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ and the Bach tensor $W^{\mu\nu}=[2\nabla_{\kappa}\nabla_{\lambda}-R_{\lambda\kappa}]C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ vanish. In general, in perturbations around the cosmological background neither of the fluctuating $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ or $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ would vanish. However, it is possible for $\delta W^{\mu\nu}$ to vanish even as $\delta C^{\mu\lambda\nu\kappa}$ does not. In this paper we construct an explicit model in which this is the case. The model consists of a 3-tensor gravitational wave
  fluctuating around a background with a constant negative 3-curvature. The model is exactly solvable and consists purely of geometric quantities with no matter fields at all (i.e., $G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta G^{\mu\nu}=0$, $W^{\mu\nu}=0$, $\delta W^{\mu\nu}=0$, where $G^{\mu\nu}$ is the Einstein tensor). The model can thus be created out of nothing, with creating a universe from nothing thus being an alternative principle to the cosmological principle. The fluctuating gravitational wave contributes to the temperature anisotropy in the cosmic microwave background and its $B$ mode polarization in a calculable manner, one for which we provide a simple analytic way of treating spatial modes that is based on the use of a spatial mode addition theorem. In addition, we provide a treatment of the anisotropy that is based on properties of bandwidth limited functions. Classically by ``nothing" we mean that there are no $T^{\mu\nu}$ or $\delta T^{\mu\nu}$ matter field terms. Quantum-mechanically by ``nothing" we mean that all fields other than the gravitational field are in a negative energy mode vacuum state, with the only occupied positive energy modes being graviton modes. As well as use the Bach tensor as a diagnostic, we consider dynamics based on it.</description>

      <title>The Cosmic Dance: Observational Detection of Coherent Spin in Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin of galaxy clusters encodes key information about their formation, dynamics, and the influence of large-scale structure. However, whether clusters possess statistically significant spin and how to measure it observationally remain open questions. Here, we present the first observational, statistical detection of coherent spin in galaxy clusters, using two samples of 2,170 and 1,329 systems with $M &gt; 10^{14}\,M_\odot$, selected from two publicly available group catalogs (\citet{2017A&amp;A...602A.100T} and \citet{2012ApJ...752...41Y}) constructed with two different algorithms and but both based primarily on SDSS galaxies. Cluster spin is quantified by identifying the orientation in the projected plane that maximizes the redshift difference ($\Delta Z_{\rm max}$) between member galaxies in two regions divided by a trial axis. We find compelling statistical evidence for coherent rotation, as the observed $\Delta Z_{\rm max}$ distribution departs markedly from the randomized controls, exhibiting pronounced deviations near $380\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. Stacked visualizations confirm the spatial segregation of redshifted and blueshifted galaxies across the rotation axis. The radial profile of the rotational velocity indicates that it increases as a function of radius. The cluster rotation speed increases with mass, from $\sim360~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{14} M_\odot$ to $\sim693~\mathrm{km\,s}^{-1}$ at $10^{15} M_\odot$. Additionally, cluster spin tends to align parallel with the central galaxy spin and perpendicular to the nearest cosmic filament, particularly in richer systems. These results reveal significant coherent spin in galaxy clusters, shaped by both internal dynamics and large-scale structure.</description>

      <title>A generalized study of linear electromagnetic cascades in astrophysical sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-energy gamma rays can trigger electromagnetic cascades via pair production on ambient photons, reprocessing their energy to lower frequencies. A classic example is the cascade from the gamma rays produced by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays in extragalactic photon fields, whose universal spectral shape was first described by Berezinsky in the 1970s. Recently, internal cascades, developing within the gamma-ray sources themselves, have gained a prominent role, as the IceCube data suggest that most detected neutrinos originate in gamma-ray-opaque environments. We analyze under what conditions these internal cascades can approach a universal spectrum. Since the Berezinsky treatment breaks down if synchrotron losses dominate, we present a generalized theory incorporating synchrotron-dominated cascades. We show the emergence of universal cascade spectrum among various examples of high-energy sources containing non-thermal cosmic rays, and discuss the conditions for its appearance.</description>

      <title>Quasar Radiative Feedback May Suppress Galaxy Growth on Intergalactic Scales at $z = 6.3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present observational evidence that intense ionizing radiation from a luminous quasar suppresses nebular emission in nearby galaxies on intergalactic scales at $z=6.3$. Using JWST/NIRCam grism spectroscopy from the SAPPHIRES and EIGER programs, we identify a moderate but statistically significant decline in [O\,\textsc{iii}]\,$\lambda5008$ luminosity relative to the UV continuum ($L_{5008}/L_{1500}$) among galaxies within $\sim$ 7 comoving Mpc (cMpc) of the quasar J0100$+$2802, the most UV-luminous quasar known at this epoch ($M_{1450}=-29.26$). While $L_{1500}$ remains roughly constant with transverse distance, $L_{5008}$ increases significantly, suggesting suppression of very recent star formation toward the quasar. The effect persists after controlling for completeness, local density, and UV luminosity, and correlates with the projected photoionization-rate profile $\Gamma_{\mathrm{qso}}$. A weaker but directionally consistent suppression in $L_{5008}/L_{1500}$ is also observed along the line of sight. The transverse suppression radius ($\sim$ 7 cMpc) implies a recent radiative episode with a cumulative duration $\sim$ 3.1 Myr, shorter than required for thermal photoheating to dominate and thus more naturally explained by rapid H$_2$ photodissociation and related radiative processes. Environmental effects alone appear insufficient to explain the signal. Our results provide direct, geometry-based constraints on large-scale quasar radiative feedback and recent quasar lifetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider gravitational collapse of a fluid sphere with torsion generated by spin, which forms a black hole. We use the Tolman metric and the Einstein$-$Cartan field equations with a relativistic spin fluid as a source. We show that gravitational repulsion of torsion prevents a singularity, replacing it with a nonsingular bounce. Quantum particle creation during contraction prevents shear from overcoming torsion. Particle creation during expansion can generate a finite period of inflation and produce large amounts of matter. The resulting closed universe on the other side of the event horizon may have several bounces. Such a universe is oscillatory, with each cycle larger than the preceding cycle, until it reaches a size at which dark energy dominates and expands indefinitely. Our Universe might have therefore originated from a black hole existing in another universe.</description>

      <title>Galaxy Protoclusters as Drivers of Cosmic Reionization: I. Bubble Overlap at Redshift z ~ 7 in LAGER-z7OD1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the launch of JWST, the sample size of reionization-era Lyman-alpha-emitters (LAEs) has been steadily growing; yet inferences about the neutral hydrogen fraction in the intergalactic medium exhibit increasing variance at redshift z ~ 7, possibly indicating significant field-to-field fluctuations in the progression of cosmic reionization. In this paper, we present new JWST/NIRSpec and Keck/LRIS spectra of nine LAEs in the redshift z ~ 7 protocluster, LAGER-z7OD1. Measurements of Lyman-alpha-transmission and Lyman-alpha velocity offset along multiple sightlines map the Lyman-alpha damping wing optical depth across the galaxy overdensity. In the standard context of inside-out ionization, we estimate radii of ionized bubbles (R(min) = 0.07 - 0.69 Mpc) based on the distance from each LAE to the first neutral patch along the sightline. The resulting 3D topology reveals three distinct sub-clusters where the ionized bubbles are approaching overlap. Five of the nine LAEs plausibly ionized their bubbles, a few bursts of star formation and a modest escape fraction are sufficient. We demonstrate, however, that the actual ionized volumes are likely larger, at least R(ism) = 0.42 - 1.29 Mpc, based on an empirical model for interstellar attenuation of Lyman-alpha. Modeling galactic attenuation of Lyman-alpha significantly increases the inferred intergalactic transmission (thus enlarging the ionized pathlength). The errorbars on the reddening correction allow fully overlapping bubbles, and our results are consistent with accelerated reionization in the protocluster.</description>

      <title>DiffstarPop: A generative physical model of galaxy star formation history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present DiffstarPop, a differentiable forward model of cosmological populations of galaxy star formation histories (SFH). In the model, individual galaxy SFH is parametrized by Diffstar, which has parameters $\theta_{\rm SFH}$ that have a direct interpretation in terms of galaxy formation physics, such as star formation efficiency and quenching. DiffstarPop is a model for the statistical connection between $\theta_{\rm SFH}$ and the mass assembly history (MAH) of dark matter halos. We have formulated DiffstarPop to have the minimal flexibility needed to accurately reproduce the statistical distributions of galaxy SFH predicted by a diverse range of simulations, including the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation, the Galacticus semi-analytic model, and the UniverseMachine semi-empirical model. Our publicly available code written in JAX includes Monte Carlo generators that supply statistical samples of galaxy assembly histories that mimic the populations seen in each simulation, and can generate SFHs for $10^6$ galaxies in 1.1 CPU-seconds, or 0.03 GPU-seconds. We conclude the paper with a discussion of applications of DiffstarPop, which we are using to generate catalogs of synthetic galaxies populating the merger trees in cosmological N-body simulations.</description>
