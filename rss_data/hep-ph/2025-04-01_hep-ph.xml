      <title>Neutrino Non-Standard Interaction and Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the possible implications of physics beyond the standard model in the neutrino sector applying non-standard interaction. Recently, the NOvA and T2K neutrino experiments have announced their measurements for the CP violating parameter $\delta_{CP}$. The observed value of T2K is around 1.5$\pi$, while NOvA gives the same parameter value around 0.8$\pi$ in the normal mass order scenario. Although it is too early to make any conclusions about the difference in measurements but attempts have been made in the literature to invoke the new physics ideas to explain the difference. We include the dual non-standard neutrino interaction effects and find interesting results. Furthermore, we show the possibility of seeing an appreciable difference in the normal and inverted neutrino mass hierarchies if one measures the CP asymmetries in the upcoming long-baseline neutrino experiments.</description>

      <title>Higgs Criticality and the Metastability Bound: a target for future colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New physics at the TeV scale or lower may destabilise the electroweak vacuum. How low could the vacuum instability scale be? This fundamental question may be tied to a deeper understanding of the Higgs potential and its associated hierarchy problem. The scale of vacuum instability can be viewed as an upper bound on the Higgs mass-the so-called vacuum metastability bound-and criticality of the Higgs potential through some underlying mechanism then places our universe at this metastable point. In this report, we summarise recent work developing this eminently testable hypothesis. If the vacuum metastability bound plays a role in determining the properties of the Higgs boson, the new physics responsible will likely be discovered or excluded in the entire natural region of parameter space at future facilities. This makes it a tantalising and attractive target for future colliders.</description>

      <title>A Search for "New Physics'' "Beyond the Standard Model'' in Open Data with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this new era of large data, it is important to make sure we do not miss any signs of new physics. Using the publicly-available open data collected by the arXiv.org experiment in the \texttt{hep-ph} channel, corresponding to a raw total integrated $\mathcal{L}$iterature of 65,276 papers, we perform a search for ``New Physics'' and related signals. In the worst-case, we are able to detect ``New Physics'' with ``the LHC'' at a significance level of at least $6.5\sigma$. This ``New Physics'' signature is primarily ``Dark'' in nature, and is potentially axion(-like) dark matter. We also show the potential for further improvement in the future, and that ``New Physics'' can be found with ``a Future Collider'' at at least $8.9\sigma$, as well as the potential to find ``New Physics'' without any collider at all. This search is performed using code that was $80\%$ written by Machine Learning methods.</description>

      <title>One Born Oppenheimer Effective Theory to rule all Exotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of XYZ exotic states in the hadronic sector with two heavy quarks constitute one of the most important open problems in particle theory. In this work, we demonstrate that the QCD derived Born-Oppenheimer effective field theory (BOEFT) framework, provides a systematic framework to describe exotic states of arbitrary composition. The BOEFT construction is based on QCD taking into consideration the scale separation and symmetry of systems containing two heavy quarks. We show the results for the coupled channel Schr\"odinger equations incorporating nonadiabatic mixing terms that describes exotic states for arbitrary quantum number of the light degrees of freedom: hybrids, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, doubly heavy baryons, and quarkonia at leading order. Additionally, we present the results of the predicted spin-symmetry multiplets, and the expression of the nonperturbative gauge-invariant correlators to be computed on lattice that are required for BOEFT: static energies, generalized Wilson loops, gluelumps, adjoint mesons or baryons, and triplet or sextext mesons or baryons. Moreover, for the static energies, we describe the short-distance behavior based on multipole expansion and the mixing with heavy-light thresholds at long distances based on the conserved quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>Probing and Knocking with Muons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose here a set of new methods involving probing and knocking with muons (PKMu). There is a wealth of rich physics to explore with GeV muon beams. Examples include but not limited to: muon scattering can occur at large angles, providing evidence of potential muon-philic dark matter or dark mediator candidates; muon-electron scattering can be used to detect new types of bosons associated with charged lepton flavor violation; precise measurements of GeV-scale muon-electron scattering can be employed to probe quantum correlations.</description>

      <title>General Formulas for Loop-Induced Decays of $A \to Z\gamma\gamma$ and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the Standard Model Higgs extensions, including the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model with vector-like fermions and the Triplet-Higgs Model, we derive general one-loop contributions to the rare decay process $A \rightarrow Z \gamma \gamma$. The analytical expressions are formulated with Passarino-Veltman scalar functions, which represent the scalar coefficients of one-loop Lorentz-covariant tensor integrals. These functions are written in accordance with the input conventions of the {\tt LoopTools} and {\tt Collier} packages, facilitating the efficient numerical generation of decay rates and their distributions using these computational tools. As part of our phenomenological study, we examine the branching ratios of this decay channel within the viable parameter space of the considered models. Our results indicate that the branching ratio can reach $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ in the Two-Higgs-Doublet Model and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ in the Triplet-Higgs Model at specific points within the allowed parameter regions. Furthermore, the inclusion of vector-like fermions in the loop leads to a significant modification of the partial decay rates, with an observed variation of approximately $10\%$. Additionally, we explore the dependence of the branching ratios on key model parameters, including the charged Higgs mass, mixing angles, and the soft-breaking scale, providing deeper insights into the phenomenological implications of these Higgs-extended frameworks.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic and axial-vector structure of singly heavy baryons in a pion mean-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talk, we present a series of recent works on the electromagnetic and axial-vector structures of low-lying singly heavy baryons. We first explain the pion mean-field approach, in which light and singly heavy baryons can be considered on an equal footing. We then discuss the results for the electromagnetic and radiative transition form factors of the singly heavy baryons. We also demonstrate the results for the strong decay rates and quark spin content of the singly heavy baryons. Finally, we propose a consistent way of dealing with the $1/m_Q$ corrections in the pion mean-field approach.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the nucleon and their mechanical structure: Twist-2 case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a series of recent works on the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the nucleon within a pion mean-field approach, which is also called the chiral quark-soliton model. We investigate the flavor structure of the mass, angular momentum, and $D$-term form factors of the nucleon. The main findings of the present work are given as follows: the contribution of the strange quark is rather small for the mass and angular momentum form factors, it plays an essential role in the $D$-term form factors. It indicates that the $D$-term form factor is sensitive to the outer part of the nucleon. The flavor blindness, i.e, $D^{u-d}\simeq 0$, is valid only if the strange quark is considered. We also discuss the effects of twist-4 operators. Though the gluonic contributions are suppressed by the packing fraction of the instanton vacuum in the twist-2 case, contributions from twist-4 operators are significant.</description>

      <title>Probing the general 2HDM with flavor-violation through $A \to ZH$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) discovery prospects for a second Higgs doublet through $gg \to A$, followed by $A \to ZH$ weak decay, where $A$ and $H$ are exotic $\textit{CP}$-odd and $\textit{CP}$-even scalars of the general two Higgs doublet model (G2HDM) that has flavor-changing neutral Higgs (FCNH) couplings. The FCNH extra top Yukawa coupling $\rho_{tc}$ and flavor-conserving $\rho_{tt}$ coupling can drive electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) to account for the disappearance of antimatter from the Universe. With dominant $H \to t\bar c + \bar tc$ decay, it gives rise to trilepton final states. By a phenomenological analysis, we show that the $A \to ZH \to \ell^+ \ell^-t\bar c$ final state could be a promising probe of G2HDM at the LHC with flavor-violation.</description>

      <title>Pion, Kaon and nucleon gravitational form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unified set of predictions for pion, kaon and nucleon gravitational form factors is obtained using a symmetry-preserving truncation of each relevant quantum field equation. A crucial aspect of the study is the self-consistent characterization of the dressed quark-graviton vertices, applied when probing each quark flavor inside mesons or nucleons. The calculations reveal that each hadron's mass radius is smaller than its charge radius, matching available empirical inferences; moreover, core pressures are significantly greater than those in neutron stars. This set of predictions is expected to be instrumental as forthcoming experiments provide opportunities for validation.</description>

      <title>The influence of electron-electron interaction on pair production in supercritical collisions of highly charged ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of electron-electron interaction on positron emission in supercritical collisions of highly charged ions is studied within the monopole approximation using the time-dependent density functional theory and the time-dependent Hartree-Fock-Slater methods. Positron production probabilities and energy spectra are calculated for U-U, U-Cm, and Cm-Cm collision systems, considering both bare nuclei and highly charged ions with partially filled electron shells. The results demonstrate that electron screening substantially reduces positron production and suppresses the characteristic signatures of spontaneous vacuum decay, previously found in collisions of bare nuclei.</description>

      <title>Vacuum polarization current in presence of intense Sauter field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum vacuum becomes unstable under an external field, leading to spontaneous particle-antiparticle pair creation. In canonical quantization, the time-dependent particle number, defined via Bogoliubov transformations lacks physical meaning until the external field vanishes. To address this, we explore dynamical quantities that remain well-defined at both asymptotic and intermediate times, focusing on the vacuum polarization current. Investigating this observable provides insights into the system's intermediate-time behavior. We consider pair creation in a spatially homogeneous, time-dependent, intense Sauter field. Specifically, we analyze the real and imaginary parts of the correlation function, linking them to vacuum polarization effects. The vacuum polarization current in an intense laser pulse is computed numerically, revealing that it correlates with the real part of the correlation function. Initially, the current changes sign and gradually decreases, but unlike the particle number, it does not reach a constant asymptotic value. Instead, for large times, it exhibits nearly undamped oscillations, a distinctive feature of scalar particles, oscillating strongly around zero. Additionally, we explore the uniqueness of the vacuum polarization current in the adiabatic basis, comparing different reference mode function choices. Notably, we find that the current remains independent of the basis choice.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of the temperature dependence of the relativistic degrees of freedom (dofs) of the plasma on lepton and baryon asymmetry. Motivated by the significant effect of the varying dofs on the tri-resonant leptogenesis particle model in low-scale leptogenesis, we show how this effect impacts the evolution of the lepton asymmetry in a simplified setup. We provide analytical approximations as well as numerical results showing that the simplified setup exhibits similar behavior as the concrete model. As the dofs enter the transport equations via the expansion rate of the Universe and the temperature of the plasma, we argue that any analysis must take these effects into account in order to be consistent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the developed Bethe-Salpeter theory for dealing with unstable state, we investigate unstable meson-meson molecular state in which at least one of the constituents is an unstable meson and provide a reasonable and feasible scheme to deal with this interesting problem in the framework of relativistic quantum field theory. The developed Bethe-Salpeter theory is applied to investigate the unstable meson composed of a quark and an antiquark, and we obtain the Green's function for unstable meson in the framework of relativistic quantum field theory, which is used to deal with unstable constituent of molecular state. We can obtain the physical mass and width of unstable molecular state composed of two heavy mesons, which contain the contribution from at least one unstable constituent of molecular state.</description>

      <title>Enhanced signal of momentum broadening in hard splittings for $\gamma$-tagged jets in a multistage approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate medium-induced modifications to jet substructure observables that characterize hard splitting patterns in central Pb-Pb collisions at the top energy of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Using a multistage Monte Carlo simulation of in-medium jet shower evolution, we explore flavor-dependent medium effects through simulations of inclusive and $\gamma$-tagged jets. The results show that quark jets undergo a non-monotonic modification compared to gluon jets in observables such as the Pb-Pb to $p$-$p$ ratio of the Soft Drop prong angle $r_g$, the relative prong transverse momentum $k_{T,g}$ and the groomed mass $m_g$ distributions. Due to this non-monotonic modification, $\gamma$-tagged jets, enriched in quark jets, provide surprisingly clear signals of medium-induced structural modifications, distinct from effects dominated by selection bias. This work highlights the potential of hard substructures in $\gamma$-tagged jets as powerful tools for probing the jet-medium interactions in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. All simulations for $\gamma$-tagged jet analyses carried out in this paper used triggered events containing at least one hard photon, which highlights the utility of these observables for future Bayesian analysis.</description>

      <title>Production of $K^+K^-$ Pairs Through Decay of $\phi$ Meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for the production of $K^+K^-$ pairs through the decay of $\phi$ mesons produced from a thermal background, based on the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. The differential production rate of $K^+K^-$ is related to the self-energy of the $\phi$ meson, incorporating the contributions of the quark loop at leading order and the kaon loop at next-to-leading order in the $1/N_c$ expansion. We numerically evaluate the invariant mass spectrum of the $K^+K^-$ pair both in vacuum and at finite temperature. The inclusion of the kaon loop results in a finite width of the spectrum, improving agreement with experimental data. We also investigate the spin alignment of the $\phi$ meson induced by its motion relative to the thermal background. In the NJL model with only chiral condensates, we find that deviations from the unpolarized limit of 1/3 are negligible.</description>

      <title>Semileptonic baryon decays $\Xi_b\rightarrow \Xi_c \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell $ in perturbative QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a detailed analysis of the semileptonic $\Xi_b\rightarrow \Xi_c \ell^- \bar{\nu}_\ell$ decays within the perturbative QCD (PQCD) framework. In our study, the $\Xi_b\rightarrow \Xi_c$ transition form factors are calculated using several popular models for baryonic light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs). These form factors are then employed to analyze a range of observable quantities for the semileptonic processes via the helicity formalism. Our work presents predictions for the branching fractions of these decays for both the $\tau$ and $e$ channels. Notably, the obtained lepton flavor universality ratio, $\mathcal{R}_{\Xi_c}\approx 0.3$, may offer new insights into the $\mathcal{R}^{(*)}$ puzzle. Furthermore, we investigate various angular observables, such as forward-backward asymmetries, lepton-side convexity parameters, and polarization asymmetries, which provide complementary information regarding potential new physics in $b$-baryonic semileptonic transitions. The numerical results for these angular observables are presented as both functions of $q^2$ and as averaged values. We observe that the lepton mass plays a significant role in shaping the angular distributions, affecting most of the observables under consideration. These results are expected to be valuable for both current and future experimental investigations of semileptonic heavy-to-heavy baryon decays.</description>

      <title>Production of open and hidden charm in fixed-target experiments at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the production of $D$ mesons and $J/\psi$ quarkonia in proton-nucleus collisions in the fixed-target LHCb experiment. We consider gluon-gluon fusion within $k_t$-factorization, processes initiated by intrinsic charm in the nucleon and perturbative recombination mechanism. All the mechanisms seem to be necessary to describe the LHCb experimental data. We get an upper limit for the probability of the large-$x$ $c \bar c$ Fock component in the nucleon, which is slightly less than 1 \%. The recombination mechanism allows the description of $D^0$ and $\bar D^0$ asymmetry observed by the LHCb collaboration.\\ We also discuss the production of $J/\psi$ quarkonia, including color singlet mechanisms. We include $g^* g^* \to J/\psi g$ and $g^* g^* \to \chi_c(1^+,2^+)(\to J/\psi \gamma)$ within $k_t$-factorization approach. Different unintegrated gluon distributions from the literature are used. A reasonable agreement is achieved with some distributions from the literature.</description>

      <title>KNO scaling in quark and gluon jets at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koba-Nielsen-Olesen (KNO) scaling of hadron multiplicity distributions, empirically confirmed to hold approximately in $e^+e^-$ collisions and Deep Inelastic Scattering, has been observed to be violated in hadron-hadron collisions. In this work, we show that the universality of KNO scaling can be extended to hadron-hadron collisions when restricted to QCD jets. We present a comprehensive study of KNO scaling in QCD jets produced in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. Using perturbative QCD calculations in the double logarithmic approximation and PYTHIA simulations, we find that KNO scaling approximately holds for both quark and gluon jets across a broad jet $p_T$ range, from $0.1$ TeV to $2.5$ TeV, at both the parton and hadron levels. Especially, we highlight characteristic differences between the KNO scaling functions of quark and gluon jets, with the quark-jet scaling function lying above that of gluon jets at both low and high multiplicities. This distinction is essential for interpreting inclusive jet data at the LHC. Furthermore, we propose direct experimental tests of KNO scaling in QCD jets at the LHC through quark-gluon discrimination using jet substructure techniques, as demonstrated by applying energy correlation functions to PYTHIA-generated data.</description>

      <title>A possibility for grand unification and non-Higgs mass generation in a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like theory of fermions interacting with current metric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grand unification possibilities in Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like models are studied. To address the problem of vector boson masses and nonrenormalizability of the theory, algebraic formalism encompassing the effective action, Schwinger-Keldysh path integral, and Bogoliubov-Parasiuk-Hepp-Zimmerman renormalization is constructed. A new NJL-like model: the theory of current metric field interacting with fermions is proposed. Bosonization in this model can produce massless vector bosons under certain conditions which makes it a candidate grand unified theory. Both Higgs and non-Higgs effects can contribute to particle masses.</description>

      <title>Quark production in the bottom-up thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of quark production on bottom-up thermalization in heavy-ion collisions. First, we extend the parametric estimates of bottom-up thermalization in pure gluon systems by incorporating quark production in the weak-coupling (high-energy) limit. Our analysis reveals that quark production does not alter the qualitative features of the three-stage thermalization process in this limit. Furthermore, we obtain the scaling behavior of the quark number density over time at each stage. Then, by solving the Boltzmann equation in diffusion approximation (BEDA) for longitudinally boost-invariant systems, we demonstrate how our detailed numerical simulations approach the predicted three-stage thermalization picture as the strong coupling $\alpha_s$ decreases. Finally, we carry out a detailed comparison of our BEDA results with those obtained by solving the QCD effective kinetic theory for intermediate values of $\alpha_s$, observing remarkably good quantitative agreement between the two approaches.</description>

      <title>Leading qT/Q correction for Drell-Yan in TMD factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization theorem accommodates various types of power corrections. Among them, the least studied are qT/Q corrections, which become significant at large values of transverse momentum. These corrections partially originate from higher-twist TMD distributions, which exhibit singularity at small transverse distances. We propose a decomposition that reveals this singularity explicitly, and makes the qT/Q correction manifest. As a concrete application, we consider the next-to-leading power correction for the angular distributions in Drell-Yan, and determine the leading qT/Q corrections. These corrections are significant for the angular distributions A1 and A3, in complete agreement with the data.</description>

      <title>Large CP violation in $\Lambda^0_b \to pK^-\pi^+\pi^-$ and its U-spin partner decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHCb Collaboration has recently found a large CP-violating rate asymmetry in the $b$-baryon decay $\Lambda^0_b \to pK^-\pi^+\pi^-$. This is the first observation of CP violation in baryon processes, opening a new window to test its standard model (SM) origin. Many more baryon decays are expected to exhibit observable signals of CP violation. We show that there also exists large CP violation in the U-spin partner decay mode, $\Xi^0_b \to \Sigma^+\pi^- K^+K^-$, with rate asymmetry $$A_{CP}(\Xi^0_b \to \Sigma^+\pi^- K^+ K^-) = - A_{CP}(\Lambda^0_b \to p K^- \pi^+ \pi^-)~ \frac{Br(\Lambda^0_b \to p K^- \pi^+ \pi^-)}{Br(\Xi^0_b \to \Sigma^+ \pi^- K^+ K^-)}~ \frac{\tau^{\Xi_b}}{\tau^{\Lambda_b}}$$ in the U-spin symmetry limit. Neglecting small annihilation contributions, we obtain $$A_{CP}(\Lambda^0_b \to p \pi^+ \pi^- \pi^-) =A_{CP}( \Xi^0_b \to \Sigma^+ \pi^- K^+ K^-) = -(12 \pm 3) \%.$$ These predictions provide crucial tests for the SM.</description>

      <title>Unique Decay Modes and Signatures of pNGB scalars in $SU(5)/SO(5)$ Composite Higgs Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the Higgs boson, whether it is elementary or composite, will be investigated through precision measurements in ongoing experiments. In composite Higgs scenarios, the Higgs may manifest as a pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) arising from a strongly interacting sector. The $SU(5)/SO(5)$ Composite Higgs Model features a rich scalar sector, with the decay patterns of the scalars being heavily influenced by how fermions are embedded in various representations of $SU(5)$. We discuss how the mass of the pNGB scalars and their couplings depend functionally on the compositeness scale and parameters of the strong sector. Unique decay modes of the scalars emerge from the model when the mixing between the mass and the gauge eigenstates is non-negligible. We present a comprehensive and thorough analysis of the fermiophilic and fermiophobic decay modes of the pNGB scalars. One of our main findings is that the decay patterns of the two singly charged scalars differ significantly. Additionally, one pNGB scalar decays to another on-shell pNGB scalar when the masses are more than $\sim 1$ TeV. Both these factors play a significant role in creating highly distinctive signatures in collider experiments. A muon collider presents a promising avenue for detecting pNGB scalars with masses greater than 1 TeV, particularly, in final states involving multiple jets.</description>

      <title>Effects of superradiance on relativistic Foldy-Wouthuysen densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent interest in the studies of structured states obtained in relativistic electron beams has highlighted the use of two alternative descriptions, each based on a different wavefunction and the related space-time density. Although both wavefunctions obey the Dirac equation (one directly and the other through a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation) they lead to different dynamics and properties, such as the presence or absence of spin-orbit interactions. In this work we investigate wavepacket dynamics for the Klein-Gordon equation, which displays the same ambiguity regarding the choice of different densities, in a setting involving Klein tunneling across a series of supercritical potential barriers. Relying on the superradiant character of this setting, we obtain solutions to the wavepacket dynamics indicating that the density based on a Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation of the wavefunction can be locally amplified outside the light-cone. In principle, the exponential increase of the charge due to the field inhomogeneities can lead to an arbitrarily large amplification over macroscopic distances. These results might lead to question the descriptions based on Foldy-Wouthuysen densities.</description>

      <title>Separating non-collective effects in d-Au collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we present the multiplicity and yields of charged hadrons and particle ratios in d-Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}= 200$ GeV using the PYTHIA8/Angantyr. The model reproduces the multiplicity ($N_{ch}$) and pseudo-rapidity distribution reasonably well in minimum-biased d-Au collisions without assuming the formation of a thermalized medium. The invariant yield from Angantyr underpredicts the data in central collisions. We discussed the similarity between the nuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$ and data/MC from Angantyr and the possibility of using it as an alternative to check in-medium effects. The data/MC suggests that the central d-Au collisions exhibit signals like baryon enhancement, but no high $p_T$ suppression was found. The d-Au collisions have a much smaller invariant yield than the thermal model calculation for similar $N_{part}$. Based on the available data and simulation results, we argue that a medium may form in the central d-Au collision, but it differs from the perfect QGP formed in Pb-Pb collisions at LHC.</description>

      <title>Quantum signatures and decoherence during inflation from deep subhorizon perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to shed light on the quantum-to-classical transition of the primordial perturbations in single field inflation, we investigate the decoherence and associated quantum corrections to the correlation functions of superhorizon scalar curvature perturbations. The latter are considered as an open quantum system which undergoes quantum decoherence induced by a time-dependent environment of deep subhorizon tensorial modes through the trilinear interactions predicted by General Relativity. We first prove that, in full generality, a time dependent subhorizon environment can be relevant for decoherence during inflation, by considering derivativeless interactions, which, in our case, give the most important results. For the first time, the time dependence of the environment is properly taken into account by modifying the quantum master equation. Important non-Markovian effects pop up, instead, when dealing with derivative interactions. We adopt a possible way to treat them which has been recently proposed and seems well suited for our case. Our results show that when considering the interplay between derivativeless and derivative interactions, decoherence is slowed down. This underlines the importance of accounting for all the interactions in open quantum-system calculations in an inflationary setting. We finally compute the quantum corrections to cosmological correlation functions, by solving the transport equations induced by the quantum master equation. We also compare the results to the solutions obtained by an alternative method previously used in the literature. We observe a resummation of the quantum corrections to the power-spectrum, which is a general property of quantum master equations. We extend these results to the bispectrum, showing a decay of this correlation function in time which is analogous to the one found, previously, for the power-spectrum.</description>

Abstract: In its second data release (DR2), the \textit{Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument} (DESI) publicly released measurements of Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) from over 13.1 million galaxies and 1.6 million quasars, covering the redshift range $0.295 \leq z \leq 2.330$. In this work, we investigate the impact of this new dataset on dark sector interaction models, which are motivated by non-gravitational interactions between dark energy (DE) and dark matter (DM), commonly referred to as interacting dark energy models (IDE). We focus on two frameworks: the traditional IDE model and the recently proposed sign-switching Interacting model (S-IDE), aiming to derive new and robust constraints on both scenarios. After carefully selecting the sample for the joint analysis, ensuring compatibility among the data without significant tension, our main results indicate that both models can alleviate the $H_0$ tension, reducing it to moderate tension approximately $2.7\sigma$. The IDE model shows compatibility with the latest $S_8$ constraints from cosmic shear surveys, while the S-IDE model predicts lower values of $S_8$, which align with alternative perspectives on the $S_8$ tension. For the traditional IDE model, we derive new bounds for the coupling parameter, marking the strongest constraints to date through geometric measurements. This highlights the crucial role that supernova samples can play in refining these constraints. For the S-IDE model, we find mild evidence (approximately $2\sigma$) for the coupling parameter, suggesting a potential interaction between DE and DM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of non-equilibrium matter under extreme conditions lies beyond the capabilities of classical computation alone. Remarkable advances in quantum information science and technology are profoundly changing how we understand and explore fundamental quantum many-body systems, and have brought us to the point of simulating essential aspects of these systems using quantum computers. I discuss highlights, opportunities and the challenges that lie ahead.</description>

      <title>Bayesian method for quantifying the non-Gaussian fluctuations in low-intermediate energy heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a model-independent method to quantify the non-Gaussian fluctuations in the observable distributions, which are assessed by the difference between the measured observable distributions and reconstructed observable distributions via the Bayesian method. Our results indicate that the strength of non-Gaussian fluctuation increases with the beam energy, and is primarily driven by non-central collision mechanisms. The experimental measurement of the strength of non-Gaussian fluctuation of the observable distributions will provide valuable insights into understanding the nonequilibrium effects in heavy ion collisions and the liquid-gas phase transition in finite nuclei.</description>

      <title>On an approach to canonicalizing elliptic Feynman integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic method for the construction of canonical bases for univariate elliptic Feynman integrals with multiple kinematic scales, which frequently arise in phenomenologically relevant scattering processes. The construction is performed in the Legendre normal form of elliptic curves, where the geometric propoerties of the curves are simple and explicit and further kinemtic singularities are present as marked points. The canonical bases are constructed using Abelian differentials of three kinds with a universal linear transformation. The bases constructed in the normal form can be mapped to generic integral families via an appropriate M\"obius transformation. As a demonstration, we discuss the application of our method to several concrete examples, where we show that the $\varepsilon$-factorization of sub-sector dependence can also be simply done. Our method can be readily applied to more complicated integral families straightforwardly.</description>

      <title>Nuclear clustering process in heavy-ion collisions : experimental constraints on the low-temperature region of the QCD phase diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the production of Hydrogen and Helium isotopes in heavy-ion collisions in the incident energy range between 80 and 150 MeV/nucleon. We compare their inclusive multiplicities emitted in the transverse plane of the reaction with the predictions given by the thermal model. As a first step, we validate the choice of this approach to describe the experimental measurements. We also show that the transient states have to be explicitly taken into account for a good statistical description of the experimental multiplicities. From the thermodynamical parameter values obtained we complete the existing database built with the use of thermal-statistical models to reproduce particle production in the (ultra-)relativistic-energy measurements. We then proposed a new constraint on the so-called freeze-out region in the temperature (T) versus baryonic chemical potential (muB) phase diagram of the quantum chromodynamics. These new results indicate that there is a common framework to describe the hadron production and nuclear clustering processes in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP) - 2026 update is taking place in a turbulent international climate. Many of the norms that have governed relations between states for decades are being broken or challenged. The future progress of science in general, and particle physics in particular, will depend on our ability to maintain peaceful international scientific collaboration in the face of political pressures. We plead that the ESPP 2026 update acknowledge explicitly the importance of peaceful international scientific collaboration, not only for the progress of science, but also as a precious bridge between geopolitical blocs.

      <title>Physics case for low-$\sqrt{s}$ QCD studies at FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of hadronic final states in $e^{+}e^{-}$ collisions at centre-of-mass (CM) energies below the Z peak can notably extend the FCC-ee physics reach in terms of precision quantum chromodynamics (QCD) studies. Hadronic final states can be studied over a range of hadronic energies $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{had}} \approx 20\mbox{--}80\,\mathrm{GeV}$ by exploiting events with hard initial- and final-state QED radiation (ISR/FSR) during the high-luminosity Z-pole run, as well as in dedicated short (about one month long) $e^{+}e^{-}$ runs at CM energies $\sqrt{s} \approx 40\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $60\,\mathrm{GeV}$. Using realistic estimates and fast detector simulations, we show that data samples of about $10^{9}$ hadronic events can be collected at the FCC-ee at each of the low-CM-energy points. Such datasets can be exploited in a variety of precision QCD measurements, including studies of light-, heavy-quark and gluon jet properties, hadronic event shapes, fragmentation functions, and nonperturbative dynamics. This will offer valuable insights into strong interaction physics, complementing data from nominal FCC-ee runs at higher center-of-mass energies, $\sqrt{s} \approx 91, 160, 240,$ and $365\,\mathrm{GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Modelling Gaia photometry signals of dark halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the framework of microlensing to show that observations of binary systems, such as those made by {\it Gaia}, combined with follow-up weak lensing measurements, can provide a means to probe halos of exotic matter, possibly clumped around compact objects such as black holes. This could potentially cover a broad range of physical scenarios - from dark matter mini-halos to black holes with bosonic configurations around them, known as hair. Assuming that light can freely propagate through the halo of the exotic matter, the companion star will produce characteristic, sizable lensing signatures due to the deviation from a central gravitational potential. The signature of the multiple images, the magnification and the light-curve could be the smoking gun of such structures. We discuss how the precise observations of the {\it Gaia} survey offer an opportunity to search for new, yet undiscovered fundamental fields interacting gravitationally with baryons.</description>

      <title>Exclusion of a diquark-antidiquark structure for the lightest positive-parity charmed mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nature of low-lying scalar and axial-vector charmed mesons has been debated for decades, with hadronic molecular and compact tetraquark models being prominent candidates. These two models predict quite different features for the accessible SU(3) multiplets in the scalar and axial-vector sectors, which can be tested through lattice calculations at SU(3) symmetric points. In this work, we perform lattice calculations for both scalar and axial-vector charmed mesons with an SU(3) symmetric pion mass about 613 MeV for the SU(3) $[6]$ and $[\overline{15}]$ multiplets. We find that the $[6]$ multiplet exhibits attractive interactions in both scalar and axial-vector sectors, while the $[\overline{15}]$ multiplet shows repulsive interactions in both sectors. The energy shifts in the scalar and axial-vector sectors are compatible with each other within uncertainties. These results are fully consistent with the hadronic molecular picture, while challenging the compact tetraquark model, which predicts the existence of low-lying $[\overline{15}]$ states in the axial-vector sector but not in the scalar sector.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of the non-relativistic spinning test body (STB) in the framework of Einstein-Cartan theory(ECT), in which the weak equivalence principle is violated by the spin-gravitational interaction. We derive the general equation of geodesic in terms of comoving tetrads. More concretely, we consider the case of the quadratic form of the lagrangian, within the environment of weak and static spherically symmetric space-time. We find that the trajectories of STB deviate from the traditional Mathisson\textendash Papapetrou equation, which is due to the coupling of the spin of the test particle to the torsion field of the environment. This allows us to test the theory with free-fall experiment in the laboratory, such as atom interferometer. By using the previous data, we find the upper bound of the possible torsion field on Earth is given by up to $2.0\times 10^{1} \mathrm{~m^{-1}}$ and torsion gradient up to $3.1 \times 10^{-6}\mathrm{~m^{-2}}$. This result may enable us to provide a theoretical foundation for future precision measurements of the existence of the fifth force.</description>

      <title>The Belle II Experiment at SuperKEKB -- Input to the European Particle Physics Strategy</title>

Abstract: Belle II is an intensity-frontier experiment at the SuperKEKB collider in Tsukuba, Japan. Over the coming decades, it will record the decays of billions of bottom mesons, charm hadrons, and tau leptons produced in 10 GeV electron-positron collisions. The experiment's low-background environment and precisely known kinematics enable high-precision measurements of hundreds of Standard Model (SM) parameters while probing for new particles at mass scales far beyond the direct reach of high-energy colliders. We project Belle II's sensitivity for key measurements - where it will be uniquely positioned or world-leading - over datasets ranging from 1 to 50 ab${}^{-1}$. By exploring previously uncharted regions of non-SM parameter space with high precision, Belle II will either reveal new physics or set stringent constraints, guiding future experimental and theoretical efforts. Additionally, we outline near-term upgrades to the Belle II detector and SuperKEKB accelerator, which will enhance sensitivity in searches for new physics beyond the SM across flavor, tau, electroweak, and dark sector physics. These improvements will ensure that Belle II remains both complementary to and competitive with the LHC and other experiments.</description>

      <title>Current status of real-time imaging of antiproton annihilation in biological targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following a successful pioneering study of the biological effects of antimatter ( the AD-4/ACE experiment at CERN), the use of antiprotons in clinical radiotherapy became a very serious possibility. A major part of any future radiotherapy using antiprotons will be real-time imaging of antiproton annihilation in biological targets. In principle, real-time imaging is possible thanks to the secondary particles, neutral pions and charger pions, produced by the annihilation of antiprotons in the cells they come to a stop in.Neutral pions decay dominantly and almost instantaneously into a photon pair, and one approach to real-time imaging is based on the detection of these high-energy gammas. An alternative is based on the detection of charged pions, which have lifetimes almost a billion times longer than neutral pions. This paper is a brief review of this field of research, from the first real-time imaging achieved by the AD-4/ACE experiment in 2004 to the present day.</description>

      <title>Worldvolume fermion as baryon with homogeneous instantons in holographic $\mathrm{QCD}_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate holographically the effective theory of the worldvolume fermion on the flavor branes in the D3/D7 model with homogeneously smeared D(-1)-branes. As a top-down approach in gauge-gravity duality, the D(-1)-branes are instantons and violate the CP symmetry in the dual theory. The background geometry of this model contains black brane (deconfined geometry) and bubble D3-brane solutions (confined geometry), all with a non-zero Romand-Romand zero form as axion. The dual theories to the backgrounds are respectively the Super Yang-Mills theory at finite temperature and three-dimensional confining Yang-Mills theory, all with a Chern-Simons term induced by instantons. In the confined geometry, we introduce a baryon vertex as a D5-brane wrapped on $S^{5}$, then identify the fermionic flux on the D7-brane as a baryonic operator. Afterwards, we study the spectrum and the holographic correlation function of the flavored fermion on the D7-branes. Remarkably, the fermionic spectrum is in agreement with the dispersion curves obtained from the confined correlation function, and the mass ratio of the lowest baryon and meson in our model is close to the associated experimental data. Moreover, the effective interaction terms of the holographic baryon and meson are derived and all the coupling constants take order of $N_{c}^{1/2}$ agreeing with the evaluation from the large N field theory. In the deconfined geometry, the holographic correlation function is also evaluated numerically while the fermion on D7-brane is identified to plasmino instead of baryon. The dispersion curves from the deconfined correlation function basically covers the results from the hard thermal loop approximation and may imply the instanton-induced interaction with spin. Overall, this work constructs a holographic theory about baryonic fermion and mesonic boson with instantons or CP violation.</description>

Abstract: We systematically derive the chiral kinetic theory for chiral fermions with collisions, including the self-energy corrections, from quantum field theories. We find that the Wigner functions and chiral kinetic equations receive both the classical and quantum corrections from the self-energies and their spacetime gradients. We also apply this formalism to study nonequilibrium neutrino transport due to the interaction with thermalized electrons and nucleons, as realized in core-collapse supernovae. We derive neutrino currents along magnetic fields and neutrino spin Hall effect induced by the density gradient at first order in the Fermi constant $G_{\rm F}$ for anisotropic neutrino distributions.</description>

      <title>The small kt-region in Drell-Yan production at next-to-leading order with the Parton Branching Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Parton Branching (PB) method describes the evolution of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton distributions, covering all kinematic regions from small to large transverse momenta kT. The small kT-region is very sensitive both to the contribution of the intrinsic motion of partons (intrinsic kT) and to the resummation of soft gluons taken into account by the PB TMD evolution equations. We study the role of soft-gluon emissions in TMD as well as integrated parton distributions. We perform a detailed investigation of the PB TMD methodology at next-to-leading order (NLO) in Drell-Yan (DY) production for low transverse momenta. We present the extraction of the nonperturbative "intrinsic-kT" distribution from recent measurements of DY transverse momentum distributions at the LHC across a wide range in DY masses, including a detailed treatment of statistical, correlated and uncorrelated uncertainties. We comment on the (in)dependence of intrinsic transverse momentum on DY mass and center-of-mass energy, and on the comparison with other approaches.</description>

      <title>Violation of LGtI inequalities in the light of NO$\nu$A and T2K anomaly</title>

Abstract: The recent anomaly observed in NO$\nu$A and T2K experiments in standard three-flavor neutrino oscillation could potentially signal physics extending beyond the standard model (SM). For the NSI parameters that can accommodate this anomaly, we explore the violation of Leggett-Garg type inequalities (LGtI) within the context of three-flavor neutrino oscillations. Our analysis focuses on LGtI violations in scenarios involving complex NSI with $\epsilon_{e\mu}$ or $\epsilon_{e\tau}$ coupling in long baseline accelerator experiments for normal and inverted mass ordering.LGtI violation is significantly enhanced in normal ordering (NO) for $\epsilon_{e\tau}$ scenario for T2K, NO$\nu$A, and DUNE experiment set-up. We find that for inverted ordering (IO), in the DUNE experimental set-up above $8.5$ GeV, the LGtI violation can be an indication of $\epsilon_{e\tau}$ new physics scenario.</description>

Abstract: Neutrino propagation in the Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields is considered. We extend an approach developed in \cite{Popov:2019nkr} to describe neutrino flavour and spin oscillations using wave packets. The evolution equations for the neutrino wave packets in a uniform and non-uniform magnetic fields are derived. The analytical expressions for neutrino flavour and spin oscillations probabilities accounting for damping due to the wave packet separation are obtained for the case of a uniform magnetic field. It is shown that terms in the flavour oscillations probabilities that depend on the magnetic field strength are characterized by two coherence lengths. One of the coherence lengths coincides with the coherence length for neutrino oscillations in vacuum, while the second one is proportional to the cube of the average neutrino momentum $p_0^3$. The probabilities of flavour and spin oscillations are calculated numerically for neutrino interacting with the non-uniform Galactic magnetic field. It is shown that oscillations on certain frequencies are suppressed on the Galactic scale due to the neutrino wave packets separation. The flavour compositions of high-energy neutrino flux coming from the Galactic centre and ultra-high energy neutrinos from an extragalactic sourse are calculated accounting for neutrino interaction with the magnetic field and decoherence due to the wave packet separation. It is shown that for neutrino magnetic moments $\sim 10^{-13} \mu_B$ and larger these flavour compositions significantly differ from ones predicted by the vacuum neutrino oscillations scenario.</description>

      <title>The charge and magnetic radii of the nucleons from the generalized parton distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proton-radius puzzle refers to the discrepancy observed in measurements of the proton's charge radius when using different methods. This inconsistency has prompted extensive research and debate within the physics community, as it challenges the understanding of quantum electrodynamics and the fundamental properties of protons. In the present study, we determine the charge and magnetic radii of the proton and neutron through a global analysis of the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness. We emphasize the importance of a simultaneous analysis of all available experimental data related to nucleon radii, rather than relying on individual experiments, specific observables, or limited kinematic regions. This comprehensive approach ensures robust and consistent results, avoiding values that are either too small or too large. Our analysis yields the following results: $ r_{pE} = 0.8558 \pm 0.0135~\textrm{fm} $, $ r_{pM} = 0.8268 \pm 0.0533~\textrm{fm} $, $ \left&lt;r_{nE}^2\right&gt; = -0.1181 \pm 0.0270~\textrm{fm}^2 $, and $ r_{nM} = 0.8367 \pm 0.0845~\textrm{fm} $.</description>

      <title>Thermal and nonthermal dark matters with gravitational neutrino reheating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have discussed in detail how neutrinos produced from inflaton solely through gravitational interaction can successfully reheat the universe. For this, we have introduced the well-known Type-I seesaw neutrino model. Depending on seesaw model parameters, two distinct reheating histories have been realized and dubbed as i) Neutrino dominating: Following the inflaton domination, the universe becomes neutrino dominated, and their subsequent decay concludes the reheating process, and ii) Neutrino heating: Despite being sub-dominant compared to inflaton energy, neutrinos efficiently heat the thermal bath and produce the radiation dominated universe. Imposing baryon asymmetric yield, the $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ constraint at Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) considering primordial gravitational waves (PGW), we have arrived at the following constraints on reheating equation of state to lie within $0.5\lesssim w_\phi\lesssim1.0$. In these neutrino-driven reheating backgrounds, we further performed a detailed analysis of both thermal and non-thermal production of dark matter (DM), invoking two minimal models, namely the Higgs portal DM and classical QCD pseudo scalar axion. An interesting correlation between seemingly uncorrelated DM and Type-I seesaw parameters has emerged when confronting various direct and indirect observations. When DMs are set to freeze-in, freeze-out, or oscillate during reheating, new parameter spaces open, which could be potentially detectable in future experiments, paving an indirect way to look into the early universe in the laboratory.</description>

Abstract: The MUonE experiment aims to extract the hadronic contribution to the muon anomalous magnetic moment from a precise measurement of the muon-electron differential scattering cross section. We show that MUonE can also discover thermal relic dark matter using only its nominal experimental setup. Our search strategy is sensitive to models of dark matter in which pairs of pseudo-Dirac fermions are produced in muon-nucleus scattering in the target, and the heavier state decays semi-visibly to yield dilepton pairs displaced downstream from the interaction point. This approach can probe sub-GeV thermal-relic dark matter whose cosmological abundance is governed by the same model parameters that set the MUonE signal strength. Furthermore, our results show that the downstream ECAL plays a key role in rejecting backgrounds for this search, thereby providing strong motivation for the MUonE to keep this component in the final experimental design.</description>

      <title>The Interaction of Moving $\mathbf{Q\bar{Q}}$ and QQq in the Thermal Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strength of the force between heavy quarks is studied for heavy quarkonium ($\mathrm{Q\bar{Q}}$) and doubly heavy baryons ($\mathrm{QQq}$) at finite temperature and rapidity using the gauge/gravity duality in this paper. The strength of the interaction is defined as an effective running coupling $\alpha$ from lattice. By considering the $\mathrm{Q\bar{Q}}$ and $\mathrm{QQq}$ moving through the thermal quark-gluon plasma, we find that the interaction of heavy quarks for $\mathrm{Q\bar{Q}}$ is small and remains almost constant when $L&lt;0.2\,\mathrm{fm}$. The strength of the interaction for $\mathrm{QQq}$ is always less than that for $\mathrm{Q\bar{Q}}$ and approaches a constant when $L&lt;0.4\,\mathrm{fm}$. The $\alpha$ and the maximum of effective running coupling $\tilde{\alpha}$ for both $\mathrm{Q\bar{Q}}$ and $\mathrm{QQq}$ decrease with increasing temperature or rapidity. Through comparison, we find that $\mathrm{QQq}$ is more sensitive to changes in temperature and rapidity, and the interaction force between quarks is always less than that of $\mathrm{Q\bar{Q}}$, indicating that $\mathrm{Q\bar{Q}}$ is more stable than $\mathrm{QQq}$ in the presence of temperature and rapidity.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study for the first time jet-medium interactions in heavy-ion collisions with introduction of saturation and Sudakov effects with parameters tuned for upcoming forward calorimeter acceptances in experiments, in particular the ALICE FoCal detector. We focus on $\gamma +$jet correlations by taking into account in-medium parton evolution using the BDIM equation that describes jet interactions with the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) combined with vacuum-like emissions (VLE). We systematically introduce the early time gluon saturation dynamics through the small-$x$ Improved Transverse Momentum Dependent factorization (ITMD). For our purpose, we use Monte Carlo programs KATIE and TMDICE to generate hard events and in-medium parton evolution, respectively. We present results of azimuthal correlations and nuclear modification ratios to gauge the impact of the gluon saturation effects at early time for the in-medium jet energy loss.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Direct Detection of Higgsino Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While much supersymmetric weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) parameter space has been ruled out, one remaining important candidate is Higgsino dark matter. The Higgsino can naturally realize the "inelastic dark matter" scenario, where the scattering off a nucleus occurs between two nearly-degenerate states, making it invisible to WIMP direct detection experiments if the splitting is too large to be excited. It was realized that a "luminous dark matter" detection process, where the Higgsino upscatters in the Earth and subsequently decays into a photon in a large neutrino detector, offers the best sensitivity to such a scenario. We consider the possibility of adding a large volume of a heavy element, such as Pb or U, around the detector. We also consider the presence of U and Th in the Earth itself, and the effect of an enhanced high-velocity tail of the dark matter distribution due to the presence of the Large Magellanic Cloud. These effects can significantly improve the sensitivity of detectors such as JUNO, SNO+, KamLAND, and Borexino, potentially making it possible in the future to cover much of the remaining parameter space for this classic supersymmetric WIMP dark matter.</description>

      <title>First Extraction of Transverse Momentum Dependent Helicity Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the first global analysis of transverse momentum dependent helicity distributions of the proton. The analysis is performed at next-to-leading order with the evolution factor at next-to-next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy. Nonzero signals are determined for up and down quarks and their $k_T$-integrated polarization are consistent with analyses in collinear factorization, while the distributions of other flavors are loosely constrained by existing data. With increasing transverse momentum, quarks at large $x$ become less polarized while those at small $x$ become more polarized.</description>

      <title>EW corrections and Heavy Boson Radiation at a high-energy muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we investigate several phenomenological and technical aspects related to electroweak (EW) corrections at a high-energy muon collider, focusing on direct production processes (no VBF configurations). We study in detail the accuracy of the Sudakov approximation, in particular the Denner-Pozzorini algorithm, comparing it with exact calculations at NLO EW accuracy. We also assess the relevance of resumming EW Sudakov logarithms (EWSL) at 3 and 10 TeV collisions. Furthermore, we scrutinise the impact of additional Heavy Boson Radiation (HBR), namely the weak emission of $W, Z$, and Higgs bosons in inclusive and semi-inclusive configurations. All results are obtained via the fully automated and publicly available code MadGraph5_aMC@NLO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conduct an investigation on the spin $\frac{3}{2}\rightarrow \frac{1}{2}$ semileptonic weak transition of single heavy baryons for the exclusive decay $\Sigma_{b}^{*0}\,\rightarrow\, \Sigma_{c}^{+}\,\ell\,\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ in three possible lepton channels within the three point QCD sum rule method. We compute the responsible form factors of this semileptonic decay by incorporating both perturbative and non-perturbative contributions of the operator product expansion series up to mass dimension six. Having acquired the form factors, the decay widths of the processes in all lepton channels are determined. Our findings as well as possible future experimental information can be employed in order to check the SM predictions and explore the possibility of new physics in heavy baryonic decay channels.</description>

      <title>Chromopolarizability of charm-beauty quarkonium from $B_c(2S) \rightarrow B_c\pi\pi$ transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15415v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chromopolarizability of a charm-beauty quarkonium characterizes its interaction with soft gluonic fields and can be probed through heavy quarkonium decays. Using the dispersion theory which considers the $\pi\pi$ final state interaction model-independently, we analyze the transition $B_c(2S) \rightarrow B_c\pi^+\pi^-$ and determine the chromopolarizability $\alpha_{B_c(2S) B_c}=(0.66\pm 0.25)$ GeV$^{-3}$ and the parameter $\kappa =-0.02\pm 0.13$. Our results indicate that the transitional chromopolarizability of the $c\bar{b}$ state lies between the transitional chromopolarizabilities of the $c\bar{c}$ and $b\bar{b}$ states. These findings provide valuable insights into the interactions of charm-beauty quarkonium with light hadrons.</description>

      <title>Why detect forward muons at a muon collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We survey the opportunities offered by the detection of the forward muons that accompany the creation of neutral effective vector bosons at a muon collider, in different kinematic regimes. Vectors with relatively low energy produce the Higgs boson and the extended muon angular coverage enables studies of the Higgs properties, such as the measurement of the inclusive production cross section and of the branching ratio to invisible final states. New heavy particles could be produced by vectors of higher energy, through Higgs portal interactions. If the new particles are invisible, the detection of the forward muons is essential in order to search for this scenario. The angular correlations of the forward muons are sensitive to the quantum interference between the vector boson helicity amplitudes and can be exploited for the characterisation of vector boson scattering and fusion processes. This is illustrated by analysing the CP properties of the Higgs coupling to the Z boson. Our findings provide a physics case and a set of benchmarks for the design of a dedicated forward muon detector.</description>

      <title>Subtraction of the $t\bar{t}$ contribution in $tW\bar{b}$ production at the one-loop level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07455v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $tW\bar{b}$ production contributes to the real corrections to the $tW$ cross section. It would interfere with the top quark pair production, causing difficulties in a clear definition of the $tW{\bar b}$ events. The subtraction of the $t\bar{t}$ contributions has been performed in the diagram removal or diagram subtraction schemes for the tree-level processes. However, these schemes rely on the ability to identify the double resonant diagrams and thus can not be extended to loop diagrams. We propose a new scheme to subtract the $t\bar{t}$ contributions by power expansion of the squared amplitude in the resonant region. In order to cancel the infra-red divergences of the loop amplitudes, a widely used method is to introduce the dipole counter-terms, an ingredient in calculations of the full next-to-leading order QCD corrections. In our scheme, these counter-terms are also power-expanded. As a proof of principle, we calculate the one-loop correction to the $d\bar{d}\to \bar{b}Wt$ process, and present the invariant mass distribution of the $W\bar{b}$ system.</description>

      <title>Thermo-Coupled Early Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Early dark energy solutions to the Hubble tension introduce an additional scalar field which is frozen at early times but becomes dynamical around matter-radiation equality. In order to alleviate the tension, the scalar's share of the total energy density must rapidly shrink from $\sim 10\%$ at the onset of matter domination to $\ll 1\%$ by recombination. This typically requires a steep potential that is imposed $\textit{ad hoc}$ rather than emerging from a concrete particle physics model. Here, we point out an alternative possibility: a homogeneous scalar field coupled quadratically to a cosmological background of light thermal relics (such as the Standard Model neutrino) will acquire an effective potential which can reproduce the dynamics necessary to alleviate the tension. We identify the relevant parameter space for this "thermo-coupled" scenario and study its unique phenomenology at the background level, including the back-reaction on the neutrino mass. Follow-up numerical work is necessary to determine the constraints placed on the model by early-time measurements.</description>

      <title>Scale-invariant total decay width $\Gamma(H\to b\bar{b})$ using the novel method of characteristic operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15402v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel method via using the characteristic operator~(CO) ${\cal \hat{D}}_{n_{\gamma}, n_{\beta}}$ is proposed to extend the applicability of PMC, which is a theoretical generalization of previous PMC single-scale setting approach. Using the CO formulism, we are able to facilitate the derivation of complex scenarios within a structured theoretical framework, leading to simpler procedures and more compact expressions. The CO framework not only streamlines derivations for complex scenarios, yielding simplified procedures and more compact expressions, but also achieves a scheme-and-scale invariant pQCD series by fixing the correct effective magnitude of $\alpha_s$ and the running mass simultaneously. Both are well matched with the expansion coefficients of the series, leading to the wanted scheme-and-scale invariant conformal series. As an example, we show the achievement of scale-invariant N$^{4}$LO total decay width $\Gamma(H\to b\bar{b})$ under the $\overline{\rm MS}$-scheme. Using the CO framework, its effective coupling $\alpha_{s}(Q_{*})$ and effective $b$-quark $\overline{\rm MS}$-mass $\overline{m}_{b}(Q_{*})$ are determined by absorbing all non-conformal $\{\beta_{i}\}$-terms from the renormalization group equations for either $\alpha_s$ or $\overline{m}_{b}$ simultaneously. The PMC scale is fixed up to N$^3$LL-accuracy, $Q_{*} = 55.2916$~GeV and a scale-invariant total decay width is obtained, $\Gamma(H \to b\bar{b}) = 2.3819 _{-0.0231}^{+0.0230}$~MeV, whose errors are squared averages of the ones associated with $\Delta \alpha_{s}(M_{Z}) = \pm 0.0009$, $\Delta M_{H} = 0.11$~GeV, $\Delta \overline{m}_{b}(\overline{m}_{b}) = \pm 0.007$~GeV, and the uncalculated N$^{5}$LO contributions $\Delta\Gamma= \pm0.0001$~MeV predicted via Bayesian analysis with the degree-of-belief ${\rm DoB}=95.5\%$.</description>

Abstract: This work presents an asymmetric dark matter model with relic density determined by the freeze-out of asymmetric semi-annihilations into long-lived particles slowly decaying into the Standard Model states. We carefully consider the $CPT$ symmetry and unitarity constraints to the asymmetries entering the Boltzmann equation. The main idea of the paper is to point out a critical inconsistency in the previous literature, where these constraints are violated. We present a systematic approach to avoid the inconsistency.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of boosted and resolved multi-Higgs-boson events with symmetry-preserving attention networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production of multiple Higgs bosons at the CERN LHC provides a direct way to measure the trilinear and quartic Higgs self-interaction strengths as well as potential access to beyond the standard model effects that can enhance production at large transverse momentum $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. The largest event fraction arises from the fully hadronic final state in which every Higgs boson decays to a bottom quark-antiquark pair ($b\bar{b}$). This introduces a combinatorial challenge known as the \emph{jet assignment problem}: assigning jets to sets representing Higgs boson candidates. Symmetry-preserving attention networks (SPA-Nets) have been been developed to address this challenge. However, the complexity of jet assignment increases when simultaneously considering both $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ reconstruction possibilities, i.e., two "resolved" small-radius jets each containing a shower initiated by a $b$-quark or one "boosted" large-radius jet containing a merged shower initiated by a $b\bar{b}$ pair. The latter improves the reconstruction efficiency at high $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. In this work, we introduce a generalization to the SPA-Net approach to simultaneously consider both boosted and resolved reconstruction possibilities and unambiguously interpret an event as "fully resolved'', "fully boosted", or in between. We report the performance of baseline methods, the original SPA-Net approach, and our generalized version on nonresonant $HH$ and $HHH$ production at the LHC. Considering both boosted and resolved topologies, our SPA-Net approach increases the Higgs boson reconstruction purity by 57--62\% and the efficiency by 23--38\% compared to the baseline method depending on the final state.</description>

      <title>Interplay of intrinsic motion of partons and soft gluon emissions in Drell-Yan production studied with PYTHIA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the intrinsic transverse momentum (intrinsic-$k_T$) of partons within colliding hadrons, typically modeled with a Gaussian distribution characterized by a specific width (the intrinsic-$k_T$ width), has been an extremely challenging issue. This difficulty arises because event generators like Pythia require an intrinsic-$k_T$ width that unexpectedly varies with collision energy, reaching unphysical values at high energies. This paper investigates the underlying physics behind this energy dependence in Pythia, revealing that it arises from an interplay between two non-perturbative processes: the internal transverse motion of partons and non-perturbative soft gluon emissions. These contributions are most constrained in the production of Drell-Yan pairs with very low transverse momentum, where soft gluon effects become increasingly prominent with rising collision energy-contrary to initial expectations. Through a detailed analysis of the non-perturbative Sudakov form factor and its influence on intrinsic-$k_T$ width, we clarify the observed energy scaling behavior in Pythia, providing insight into a longstanding issue in parton shower modeling.</description>

      <title>Revisiting CMSSM with Non-Universal Gaugino Masses under Current Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the longstanding tension between the Constrained Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (CMSSM) and recent experimental data, we investigate non-universal gaugino masses within an SU(5) Grand Unified Theory (GUT) framework, focusing on the $\tilde{g}$-SUGRA scenario where $\lvert M_{3} \rvert \gg \lvert M_{1} \rvert, \lvert M_{2} \rvert$. This hierarchy enables a heavier gluino, thereby evading current experimental bounds on supersymmetric particles. Our analysis reveals that precise Higgs measurements place stringent constraints on the model, requiring $\tan\beta \gtrsim 5$ and $ M_{0} \gtrsim 20 \, \tan\beta \,\text{GeV}$. Although the $\tilde{g}$-SUGRA scenario can help reconcile the persistent $(g-2)_\mu$ anomaly, the Higgs constraints significantly restrict its parameter space, making a large contribution to $(g-2)_{\mu}$ challenging. We also assess the discovery prospects in upcoming dark matter direct detection experiments, including PandaX-xT (200 t.y.), LZ (projected), and XENONnT (20 t.y.), which may not fully cover the viable parameter space. In contrast, future collider experiments$-$such as the High-Luminosity LHC at $3\,\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$ and $\mathrm{CLIC}_{1500}$ at $2.5\,\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$$-$can comprehensively probe the remaining regions. These findings highlight $\tilde{g}$-SUGRA as a promising solution to the CMSSM tension and offer clear, testable predictions for upcoming collider searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We outline the theory of spin magnetization applicable to the QGP (quark-gluon plasma) epoch of the Universe. We show that a fully spin-polarized single flavor up-quark gas could generate a cosmic magnetic fields in excess of $10^{15}$ Tesla, far in excess of a possible upper limit to the primordial field. The complete multi component ferro-magnetized primordial fermion gas we consider consists of (five) nearly free electrically charged quarks, and leptons (electrons, muons, tau). We present details of how the magnetization is obtained using a grand partition function approach and point to the role of the nonrelativistic particle component. In the range of temperature 150 MeV to 500 MeV our results are also of interest to laboratory QGP experiments. We show that the required polarization capable to explain large scale structure magnetic fields observed has $1/T$ scaling in the limit of high $T$, and could be very small, at pico-scale. In the other limit, as temperature decreases in the expanding Universe, we show that any magnetic fields present before hadronization can be carried forward to below quark confinement condition temperature by polarization of electrons and muons.</description>

      <title>The Role of the Schwinger Effect in Superradiant Axion Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superradiance can cause the axion cloud around a rotating black hole to reach extremely high densities, and the decay of these axions can produce a powerful laser. The electric field of these lasers is strong enough that the Schwinger effect may become significant, resulting in the production of an electron-positron plasma. We explore the dynamics between axion lasers and this electron-positron plasma. While there are several mechanisms by which the inclusion of a plasma can impact the laser's behavior, the most significant of these mechanisms is that the electron-positron plasma imparts an effective mass on the photon. As the plasma frequency increases, axion decay becomes energetically unfavorable, up to the point where the axion no longer decays into photons, shutting off the laser. We find that the impact of the electron-positron plasma on the dynamics of the system depend heavily on the parameters, specifically the axion mass $m_\phi$ and the superradiant coupling $\alpha$, and that we may divide parameter space into three regimes: the unenhanced, enhanced, and unstable regimes. In the unenhanced and enhanced regime, the system will eventually settle into an equilibrium state, emitting a laser of constant luminosity while the number of axions remains constant. In the unenhanced regime, this equilibrium state can be calculated while neglecting the effects of Schwinger production; in the enhanced regime, the equilibrium luminosity is slightly larger than what it would be without Schwinger production. In the unstable regime, the electron-positron plasma suppresses axion decay to the point where the system is never able to reach equilibrium; instead, the axions continue to grow superradiantly. In all three cases, the production of superradiant axions will eventually cause the black hole to spin down to the point where superradiance ceases.</description>

      <title>Constraints on new vector boson mediated electron-nucleus interactions from spectroscopy of polar diatomic molecules</title>

Abstract: A measurement of parity violation in the hyperfine structure of $^{138}$Ba$^{19}$F [E. Altunta\c{s} et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 142501 (2018)] is reinterpreted with electronic structure calculations in terms of beyond Standard Model vector boson mediated electron-nucleus interactions. Our results set constraints on previously unexplored, new boson mediated axial vector-vector nucleus-electron interactions. Similar bounds are obtained by analyzing the atomic parity violation experiment with $^{133}$Cs. Moreover, we show that future experiments with cold heavy diatomic molecules like $^{225}$RaF can improve the present sensitivity to axial vector-vector nucleus-electron and nucleon-nucleus interactions by up to five orders of magnitudes.</description>

      <title>eV-scale sterile neutrino: A window open to non-unitarity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An excess observed in the accelerator neutrino experiments in the $\nu_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu_{e}$ channel at high confidence level (CL) has been interpreted as due to eV-scale sterile neutrino(s). But, it has been suffered from the problem of ``appearance - disappearance tension'' at the similarly high CL because the measurements of the $\nu_{\mu} \rightarrow \nu_{\mu}$ channel do not observe the expected event number depletion corresponding to the sterile contribution in the appearance channel. We suggest non-unitarity as a simple and natural way of resolving the tension, which leads us to construct the non-unitary $(3+1)$ model. With reasonable estimation of the parameters governing non-unitarity, we perform an illustrative analysis to know if the tension is resolved in this model. At the best fit of the appearance signature we have found the unique solution with $\sin^2 2\theta_{14} \approx 0.3$, which is consistent with the (reactors + Ga) data combined fit. Unexpectedly, our tension-easing mechanism bridges between the two high CL signatures, the BEST and LSND-MiniBooNE anomalies.</description>

      <title>Sub-GeV Dark Matter Direct Detection with Neutrino Observatories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new technique for sub-GeV dark matter (DM) searches and a new use of neutrino observatories. DM-electron scattering in an observatory can excite or ionize target molecules, which then produce light that can be detected by the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). While individual DM scatterings are undetectable, the aggregate rate from many independent scatterings can be isolated from the total PMT dark rate using the expected DM annual modulation. We showcase this technique with the example of JUNO, a 20,000-ton scintillator detector, showing that its sensitivity in some mass ranges exceeds all other techniques and reaches key particle-theory benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Study of gravitational waves from phase transitions in three-component dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a dark matter model comprising three types of particles with distinct spins, along with a scalar field $\phi$ that mediates interactions between Standard Model particles and dark matter. It discusses the electroweak phase transition following the Big Bang, during which all particles are initially massless due to the inactive Higgs mechanism. As temperature decreases, the effective potential reaches zero at two points, leading to two minima at the critical temperature ($T_c$), and eventually to a true vacuum state. The formation of new vacuum bubbles, where electroweak symmetry is broken and particles acquire mass, generates gravitational waves as these bubbles interact with the fabric of space-time. The paper derives the gravitational wave frequency and detection range based on the model's parameters, aligning with observational data from the Planck satellite and detection thresholds from PandaX-4T and XENONnT. It concludes by comparing the predicted background gravitational wave density with the sensitivities of LISA and BBO detectors.</description>

Abstract: We construct relativized mock meson states for heavy quarkonium, where the Dirac spinors import kinetic relativistic correction and the dynamic wave functions are the same as those solved from Schr\"odinger equation. We find that the kinetic relativistic correction imported by Dirac spinors is crucial to study the two-photon transition form factors. Using relativized mock meson states, we give credible predictions for the two-photon transition form factors and decay widths of $\eta_{c,b}(n^1S_0)$ and $\chi_{c,b}(n^3P_0)$ ($n=1,2,3$).</description>

      <title>Constraints on Velocity and Spin Dependent Exotic Interaction at the Millimeter Scale with a Diamagnetic-levitated Force Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light bosons, beyond the standard model and as prominent candidates for dark matter, can mediate velocity and spin dependent exotic interaction between electron spins and nucleons. At short ranges, it remains an open challenge to test this exotic interaction with high precision. Here, we present a method based on diamagnetic-levitated force sensor to detect the exotic interaction at the millimeter scale. Improved constraints for the coupling $g_A^e g_V^N$ are established, within the force range spanning from 0.15 mm to 1.5 mm. And the constraint $|g_A^e g_V^N| \leq 4.39 \times10^{-26}$ at $\lambda$ = 0.5 mm at the $95 \%$ confidence level, significantly surpasses previous results by more than three orders of magnitude. The diamagnetic levitation force measurement system developed here can also be repurposed to probe other exotic spin-dependent interactions, such as the exotic spin-spin interaction. This system provides a platform for the exploration of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Scalarized neutron stars in massive scalar-tensor gravity: X-ray pulsars and tidal deformability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.13453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) in scalar-tensor theories of gravitation with the phenomenon of spontaneous scalarization can develop significant deviations from general relativity. Cases with a massless scalar were studied widely. Here we compare the NS scalarizations in the Damour--Esposito-Far{\`e}se theory, the Mendes-Ortiz theory, and the $\xi$-theory with a massive scalar field. Numerical solutions for slowly rotating NSs are obtained. They are used to construct the X-ray pulse profiles of a pair of extended hot spots on the surface of NSs. We also calculate the tidal deformability for NSs with spontaneous scalarization which is done for the first time with a massive scalar field. We show the universal relation between the moment of inertia and the tidal deformability. The X-ray pulse profiles, the tidal deformability, and the universal relation may help to constrain the massive scalar-tensor theories in X-ray and gravitational-wave observations of NSs, including the Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) satellite, Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope, and LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA laser interferometers.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to the $R$ and $R^2$ invariants from torsion fluctuations on maximally symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the runnings of the $R$ and $R^2$ operators that stem from integrating out quantum torsion fluctuations on a maximally symmetric Euclidean background, while treating the metric as a classical field. Our analysis is performed in a manifestly covariant way, exploiting both the recently-introduced spin-parity decomposition of torsion perturbations and the heat kernel technique. The Lagrangian we start with is the most general one for 1-loop computations on maximally symmetric backgrounds involving kinetic terms and couplings to the scalar curvature that is compatible with a gauge-like symmetry for the torsion. The latter removes the twice-longitudinal vector mode from the spectrum, and it yields operators of maximum rank four. We also examine the conditions required to avoid ghost instabilities and ensure the validity of our assumption to neglect metric quantum fluctuations, demonstrating the compatibility between these two assumptions. Then, we use our findings in the context of Starobinsky's inflation to calculate the contributions from the torsion tensor to the $\beta$-function of the $R^2$ term. While this result is quantitatively reliable only at the $0$-th order in the slow-roll parameters or during the very early stages of inflation -- due to the background choice -- it qualitatively illustrates how to incorporate quantum effects of torsion in the path integral formalism.</description>

      <title>From chiral EFT to perturbative QCD: a Bayesian model mixing approach to symmetric nuclear matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constraining the equation of state (EOS) of strongly interacting, dense matter is the focus of intense experimental, observational, and theoretical effort. Chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) can describe the EOS between the typical densities of nuclei and those in the outer cores of neutron stars while perturbative QCD (pQCD) can be applied to properties of deconfined quark matter, both with quantified theoretical uncertainties. However, describing the full range of densities in between with a single EOS that has well-quantified uncertainties is a challenging problem. Bayesian multi-model inference from $\chi$EFT and pQCD can help bridge the gap between the two theories. In this work, we introduce a correlated Bayesian model mixing framework that uses a Gaussian Process (GP) to assimilate different information into a single QCD EOS for symmetric nuclear matter. The present implementation uses a stationary GP to infer this mixed EOS solely from the EOSs of $\chi$EFT and pQCD while accounting for the truncation errors of each theory. The GP is trained on the pressure as a function of number density in the low- and high-density regions where $\chi$EFT and pQCD are, respectively, valid. We impose priors on the GP kernel hyperparameters to suppress unphysical correlations between these regimes. This, together with the assumption of stationarity, results in smooth $\chi$EFT-to-pQCD curves for both the pressure and the speed of sound. We show that using uncorrelated mixing requires uncontrolled extrapolation of at least one of $\chi$EFT or pQCD into regions where the perturbative series breaks down and leads to an acausal EOS. We also discuss extensions of this framework to non-stationary and less differentiable GP kernels, its future application to neutron-star matter, and the incorporation of additional constraints from nuclear theory, experiment, and multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

Abstract: We study scalar-tensor gravitational theories using on-shell amplitude methods. We focus on theories with gravity coupled to a massless scalar via the Gauss-Bonnet and Chern-Simons terms. In this framework, we calculate the waveforms for classical scalar radiation emitted in scattering of macroscopic objects, including spin effects. To this end, we use the Kosower-Maybee-O'Connell formalism, with the 5-particle amplitude for scalar emission in matter scattering calculated at tree level using the unitarity-factorization bootstrap techniques. We also discuss in detail the dependence of that amplitude on the contact terms of the intermediate 4-particle scalar-graviton-matter amplitude. Finally, we discuss the conditions for resolvability of classical scalar radiation.</description>

      <title>Nuclear transparency and shadowing of the two-step process in the $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05129v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate nuclear transparency induced by pion electroproduction on nuclei $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ with our interest in the role of the two-step process in the Glauber multiple scattering theory. Based on the framework in which the short-range correlation and the quantum diffusion model are incorporated into the Glauber theory, the experimental data in the range of photon virtuality $0.5&lt; Q^2&lt; 10$ GeV$^2/c^2$ are analyzed, including the recent JLab data at 6 GeV electron beam together with the proposal for 12 GeV upgrade. The application of the quantum diffusion model during the formation length of the quark/antiquark $(q\bar{q})$ pair in the final state of pion reproduces the increase in the nuclear transparency up to the increase of high $Q^2$, showing evidence for color transparency. In particular, through the coherent length of the $\gamma^*$ fluctuation into $\rho^0$, the two-step process with the $\rho N$ scattering cross section chosen to be $\sigma_{\rho N}=\sigma_{\pi N}$ also contributes to an increase in the nuclear transparency in the low $Q^2$ region. Combined with the one-step process (direct photon coupling) usually adopted in the original formulation of the Glauber theory, this reaction mechanism provides another source of the $Q^2$ dependence of the transparency at low virtualities through the shadowing in the initial state interaction. By the further attenuation due to the shadowing, a better agreement is obtained with the pion transparency measured in the $A(e,e'\pi^+)$ reaction for $^{12}$C, $^{27}$Al, $^{63}$Cu, and $^{197}$Au nuclei.</description>

      <title>Mixed Warm Dark Matter Constraints using Milky Way Satellite Galaxy Counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Warm dark matter has been strongly constrained in recent years as the sole component of dark matter. However, a less-explored alternative is that dark matter consists of a mixture of warm and cold dark matter (MWDM). In this work, we use observations of Milky Way satellite galaxies to constrain MWDM scenarios where the formation of small-scale structure is suppressed either by generic thermal relic warm dark matter or a sterile neutrino produced through the Shi-Fuller mechanism. To achieve this, we model satellite galaxies by combining numerical simulations with semi-analytical models for the subhalo population, and use a galaxy--halo connection model to match galaxies onto dark matter subhalos. By comparing the number of satellites predicted by MWDM models to the observed satellite population from the Dark Energy Survey and Pan-STARRS1, we constrain the fraction of warm dark matter, $f_{\rm WDM}$, as a function of its mass, $m_{\rm WDM}$. We exclude dark matter being composed entirely of thermal relic warm dark matter with $m_{\rm WDM} \leq 6.6 $ keV at a posterior ratio of 10:1, consistent with previous works. However, we find that warm dark matter with smaller mass is allowed when mixed with cold dark matter, and that the $f_{\rm WDM}$ constraints strengthen with decreasing $m_{\rm WDM}$ until they plateau at $f_{\rm WDM} \lesssim 0.45 $ for $m_{\rm WDM} \lesssim 1.5$ keV. Likewise, in the case of a sterile neutrino with mass of 7 keV produced through the Shi-Fuller mechanism, we exclude a fraction of $f_{\nu_s} \lesssim 0.45$, independent of mixing angle. Our results extend constraints on MWDM to a region of parameter space that has been relatively unconstrained with previous analysis.</description>

      <title>Perturbative stability of non-Abelian electric field solutions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider SU(2) gauge theory with a scalar field in the fundamental representation. The model is known to contain electric field solutions sourced by the scalar field that are distinct from embedded Maxwell electric fields. We examine the perturbative stability of the solution and identify a region of parameter space where the solution is stable. In the regime where the scalar field has a negative mass squared, the solution has two branches and we identify an instability in one of the branches.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy and nonlinear echoes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the context of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory with a nonminimal coupling between the electromagnetic and scalar field, we study linear (non)radial perturbations and nonlinear radial dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes. In a certain region of the parameter space, this theory admits hairy black holes with a stable photon sphere. This has a counterpart in the effective potential of linear perturbations, featuring multiple maxima and minima. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectrum contains long-lived modes trapped in the potential cavity and the time-domain linear response displays echoes, as previously observed for horizonless compact objects. Interestingly, the black-hole dynamics in this theory can be studied at the nonlinear level. By performing fully-fledged 1+1 simulations, we show that echoes are present even when the nonlinearities are significant. To our knowledge, this is the first example of echoes appearing in a consistent theory beyond a linearized analysis. In a follow-up work we will study whether this feature is also present in the post-merger signal from black hole collisions in this theory.</description>

      <title>Projective imaging of high-energy nuclei through coherent exclusive vector meson production in electron-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15596v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the major goals of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is to better understand the distributions of quarks and gluons inside nuclei at high-energy. A principal measurement is coherent exclusive vector meson (VM) production in diffractive $eA$ collisions. The gluon spatial distribution inside the nucleus can be obtained through a Fourier transform of the nuclear momentum transfer ($|t|$) distribution for these VMs. However, the $|t|$ distribution is one of the most challenging measurements at the EIC. This research aims to overcome one of the main obstacles in this measurement: limited precision in measuring $|t|$, making it difficult to resolve the diffractive pattern from coherent events. We employ a method for reconstructing $|t|$ by utilizing the electron beam polarization in $eA$ collisions and measuring the projected $|t|$ distribution to overcome this complication. Through the study of diffractive VM production, we carry out an experimental simulation of how the detector effect would change the extracted nuclear geometry and how to use projective techniques to avoid defects. This technique will allow us to measure the diffractive pattern in coherent events more precisely, providing a potential solution for a critical measurement that is difficult for the EIC baseline detector.</description>

      <title>Gray-body factors: Method matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The calculation of gray-body factors is essential for understanding Hawking radiation and black hole thermodynamics. While the formalism developed by Chandrasekhar is effective for static black holes, it faces significant challenges in Kerr spacetimes, particularly in the superradiant regime, where a specific choice of coordinates introduces numerical inaccuracies. To address these limitations, an alternative method based on re-scaling radial coordinates and employing Frobenius-like expansions has been investigated. We compare the gray-body factors obtained for a near-maximally rotating black hole using both methods and find that the Chandrasekhar formalism systematically overestimates the values in the superradiant regime compared to well-established analytical results. Specifically, for a spin parameter of $a_* = 0.999$, the Chandrasekhar method yields values approximately twice as large as the correct result. Since this approach has been implemented in \texttt{BlackHawk}, we assess the impact of these discrepancies on constraints derived from gamma-ray observations of highly spinning primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Running vacuum and H^4-inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of QFT in cosmological spacetime indicate that the speeding up of the present universe may not just be associated with a rigid cosmological term but with a running one that evolves with the expansion rate: $\Lambda=\Lambda(H)$. This running is inherited from the cosmic evolution of the vacuum energy density (VED), $\rho_{\rm vac}$, which is sensitive to quantum effects in curved spacetime that ultimately trigger that running. The VED is a function of the Hubble rate and its time derivatives: $\rho_{\rm vac}=\rho_{\rm vac}(H, \dot{H},\ddot{H},...)$. Two nearby points of the cosmic evolution during the FLRW epoch are smoothly related as $\delta\rho_{\rm vac}\sim {\cal O}(H^2)$. In the very early universe, in contrast, the higher powers of the Hubble rate take over and bring about a period of fast inflation. They originate from quantum effects on the effective action of vacuum, which we compute. Herein we focus on the lowest possible power for inflation to occur: $H^4$. During the inflationary phase, $H$ remains approximately constant and very large. Subsequently, the universe enters the usual FLRW radiation epoch. This new mechanism (`RVM-inflation') is not based on any supplementary `inflaton' field, it is fueled by pure QFT effects on the dynamical background and is different from Starobinsky's inflation, in which $H$ is never constant.</description>

      <title>DESI results: Hint towards coupled dark matter and dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a scenario where a dark energy quintessence field $\phi$ with positive kinetic energy is coupled with dark matter. With two different self-interaction potentials for the field and a particular choice of the coupling function, we show explicitly how the observable effective equation of state parameter $w_{\rm eff}$ for the dark energy field crosses the phantom barrier ($w_{\rm eff} = -1$) while keeping the equation of state of the quintessence field $w_\phi &gt; -1$. With appropriate choices of parameters, $w_{\rm eff}$ crosses the phantom divide around redshift $z\sim 0.5$, transitioning from $w_{\rm eff} &lt;-1$ in the past to $w_{\rm eff}&gt;-1$ today. This explains DESI observations well. Our analysis reveals that the model remains consistent within the $2\sigma$ confidence intervals provided by DESI for several combinations of the scalar field parameters, highlighting its potential in explaining the dynamics of dark energy arising from a simple Yukawa-type long-range interaction in the dark sector. While the current findings offer a promising framework for interpreting DESI observations, future work, including a comprehensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, is necessary to constrain the parameter space further and strengthen the statistical significance of the results.</description>

      <title>The $\pi\pi$ scattering amplitude at large $N_\text{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the scaling of meson-meson scattering amplitudes with the number of colors, $N_\text{c}$. We use lattice calculations in a theory with $N_\text{f}=4$ degenerate flavors, with $N_\text{c}=3-6$ and pion mass $M_\pi\approx 560$ MeV. We focus on three different scattering channels, two of which have the same quantum numbers as some tetraquark candidates recently found at LHCb: the $T_{cs0}^0(2900)$, $T_{c\bar{s}0}^{++}(2900)$, $T_{c\bar{s}0}^0(2900)$ and $T_{c\bar{s}1}^0(2900)$ states. Finite-volume energies are extracted using a large set of operators, containing two-particle operators with the form of two pions or two vector mesons, and local tetraquark operators. The resulting energy spectra is used to constrain the infinite-volume scattering amplitude by means of L\"uscher's quantization condition. We consider polynomial parametrizations of the phase shift, as well as one-loop chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) predictions. We find that our lattice results follow the expected $N_\text{c}$ scaling and are sensitive to subleading $N_\text{c}$ corrections. In addition, we constrain the scaling of different combinations of low-energy constants from matching to large $N_\text{c}$ ChPT. The results for the channel corresponding to a $(\pi^+ D^+_s - K^+ D^+)$ state show evidence of a virtual bound state with energy $E_\text{virtual}=1.63(10)M_\pi$ for $N_\text{c}=3$, while this pole disappears at $N_\text{c}&gt;3$. This may be connected to the exotic states found in experiment.</description>

      <title>The Large Hadron electron Collider as a bridge project for CERN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The LHeC is the project for delivering electron-nucleon collisions at CERN using the HL-LHC beams. An Energy Recovery Linac in racetrack configuration will provide 50 GeV electrons to achieve centre-of-mass energies around 1 TeV/nucleon and instantaneous luminosities around $10^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. The LHeC program elaborated in the CDR of 2021 included a phase with concurrent operation of electron-hadron and hadron-hadron collisions, followed by a standalone phase of electron-hadron collisions only. In view of the current HL-LHC schedule, in this paper we have examined the possibilities of a program after the regular HL-LHC program with only electron-proton operation. In this operation mode, the LHeC would serve as an impactful bridge project between major colliders at CERN. The standalone physics program comprises electroweak, Higgs, top-quark, BSM and strong-interaction physics. In addition, it empowers the physics analyses at the HL-LHC by retrofitting measurements and searches with significantly more precise knowledge of the proton structure and $\alpha_s$. The accelerator technology deployed in the Energy Recovery Linac for the LHeC is a major stepping-stone for the performance, cost reduction and training for future colliders. The capital investments in the LHeC electron accelerator can be reused in a cost-efficient way as the injector for the FCC-ee. Finally, data from the LHeC are essential to enable the physics potential of any new high-energy hadron collider. The operational plan of 6 years easily fits in the period between two major colliders at CERN. Similar to the LHeC empowering the HL-LHC physics program, the FCC-eh would be an impactful addition to the FCC physics program.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we review the physics opportunities at linear $e^+e^-$ colliders with a special focus on high centre-of-mass energies and beam polarisation, take a fresh look at the various accelerator technologies available or under development and, for the first time, discuss how a facility first equipped with a technology mature today could be upgraded with technologies of tomorrow to reach much higher energies and/or luminosities. In addition, we will discuss detectors and alternative collider modes, as well as opportunities for beyond-collider experiments and R\&amp;D facilities as part of a linear collider facility (LCF). The material of this paper will support all plans for $e^+e^-$ linear colliders and additional opportunities they offer, independently of technology choice or proposed site, as well as R\&amp;D for advanced accelerator technologies. This joint perspective on the physics goals, early technologies and upgrade strategies has been developed by the LCVision team based on an initial discussion at LCWS2024 in Tokyo and a follow-up at the LCVision Community Event at CERN in January 2025. It heavily builds on decades of achievements of the global linear collider community, in particular in the context of CLIC and ILC.</description>
