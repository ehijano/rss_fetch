      <title>Beyond skyrmion spin texture from quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology profoundly influences diverse fields of science, providing a powerful framework for classifying phases of matter and predicting nontrivial excitations, such as solitons, vortices, and skyrmions. These topological defects are typically characterized by integer numbers, called topological charges, representing the winding number in their order parameter field. The classification and prediction of topological defects, however, become challenging when singularities are included within the integration domain for calculating the topological charge. While such exotic nonlinear excitations have been proposed in the superfluid $^3$He-A phase and spinor Bose-Einstein condensate of atomic gases, experimental observation of these structures and studies of their stability have long been elusive. Here we report the observation of a singular skyrmion that goes beyond the framework of topology in a ferromagnetic superfluid. The exotic skyrmions are sustained by undergoing anomalous symmetry breaking associated with the eccentric spin singularity and carry half of the elementary charge, distinctive from conventional skyrmions or merons. By successfully realizing the universal regime of the quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, we identified the eccentric fractional skyrmions, produced by emission from a magnetic domain wall and a spontaneous splitting of an integer skyrmion with spin singularities. The singular skyrmions are stable and can be observed after 2~s of hold time. Our results confirm the universality between classical and quantum Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities and broaden our understanding on complex nonlinear dynamics of nontrivial texture beyond skyrmion in topological quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Impurities in a trapped 1D Bose gas of arbitrary interaction strength: localization-delocalization transition and absence of self-localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss impurities in a trapped one-dimensional Bose gas with arbitrary boson-boson and boson-impurity interactions. To fully account for quantum effects, in particular in the regime of strong boson-boson interactions, we employ numerical simulations based on the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and analytic approximations exploiting the mapping to weakly interacting fermions. Mobile impurities in a box potential undergo a phase transition between a delocalized state and a solution localized at one of the potential edges upon increasing the impurity-boson interaction. While a mean-field ansatz based on coupled Gross-Pitaevski -- Schr\"odinger equations gives reasonable predictions of this transition, it also predicts the existence of a self-localized polaron solution, which we show to be an artifact of the underlying decoupling approximation. This demonstrates that impurity-boson correlations are important even in the limit of weak boson-boson interactions, where mean-field approaches are expected to work well. Furthermore we calculate the energy of a single polaron formed by a heavy impurity for arbitrary interaction strengths and give analytical approximations for large but finite boson-boson couplings. Finally we numerically determine the polaron-polaron interaction potential in Born-Oppenheimer approximation, which in the Tonks gas limit is oscillatory due to Friedel oscillations in the Bose gas.</description>

      <title>A dissipation-induced superradiant transition in a strontium cavity-QED system</title>

Abstract: In cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED), emitters and a resonator are coupled together to enable precise studies of quantum light-matter interactions. Over the past few decades, this has led to a variety of quantum technologies such as more precise inertial sensors, clocks, memories, controllable qubits, and quantum simulators. Furthermore, the intrinsically dissipative nature of cavity QED platforms makes them a natural testbed for exploring driven-dissipative phenomena in open quantum systems as well as equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase transitions in quantum optics. One such model, the so-called cooperative resonance fluorescence (CRF) model, concerns the behavior of coherently driven emitters in the presence of collective dissipation (superradiance). Despite tremendous interest, this model has yet to be realized in a clean experimental system. Here we provide an observation of the continuous superradiant phase transition predicted in the CRF model using an ensemble of ultracold $^{88}$Sr atoms coupled to a driven high-finesse optical cavity on a long-lived optical transition. Below a critical drive, atoms quickly reach a steady state determined by the self-balancing of the drive and the collective dissipation. The steady state possesses a macroscopic dipole moment and corresponds to a superradiant phase. Above a critical drive strength, the atoms undergo persistent Rabi-like oscillations until other decoherence processes kick in. In fact, our platform also allows us to witness the change of this phase transition from second to first order induced by single-particle spontaneous emission, which pushes the system towards a different steady state. Our observations are a first step towards finer control of driven-dissipative systems, which have been predicted to generate quantum states that can be harnessed for quantum information processing and in particular quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of phase transitions in quantum control landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control landscape phase transitions (CLPTs) occur as abrupt changes in the cost function landscape upon varying a control parameter, and can be revealed by non-analytic points in statistical order parameters. A prime example are quantum speed limits (QSL) which mark the onset of controllability as the protocol duration is increased. Here we lay the foundations of an analytical theory for CLPTs by developing Dyson, Magnus, and cumulant expansions for the cost function that capture the behavior of CLPTs with a controlled precision. Using linear and quadratic stability analysis, we reveal that CLPTs can be associated with different types of instabilities of the optimal protocol. This allows us to explicitly relate CLPTs to critical structural rearrangements in the extrema of the control landscape: utilizing path integral methods from statistical field theory, we trace back the critical scaling of the order parameter at the QSL to the topological and geometric properties of the set of optimal protocols, such as the number of connected components and its dimensionality. We verify our predictions by introducing a numerical sampling algorithm designed to explore this optimal set via a homotopic stochastic update rule. We apply this new toolbox explicitly to analyze CLPTs in the single- and two-qubit control problems whose landscapes are analytically tractable, and compare the landscapes for bang-bang and continuous protocols. Our work provides the first steps towards a systematic theory of CLPTs and paves the way for utilizing statistical field theory techniques for generic complex control landscapes.</description>

      <title>Encircling the Liouvillian exceptional points: a brief review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points are the branch-point singularities of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, and have rich consequences in open-system dynamics. While the exceptional points and their critical phenomena are widely studied in the non-Hermitian settings without quantum jumps, they also emerge in open quantum systems depicted by the Lindblad master equations, wherein they are identified as the degeneracies in the Liouvillian eigenspectrum. These Liouvillian exceptional points often have distinct properties compared to their counterparts in non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, leading to fundamental modifications of the steady states or the steady-state-approaching dynamics. Since the Liouvillian exceptional points widely exist in quantum systems such as the atomic vapours, superconducting qubits, and ultracold ions and atoms, they have received increasing amount of attention of late. Here we present a brief review on an important aspect of the dynamic consequence of Liouvillian exceptional points, namely the chiral state transfer induced by the parametric encircling the Liouvillian exceptional points. Our review focuses on the theoretical description and experimental observation of the phenomena in atomic systems that are experimentally accessible. We also discuss the on-going effort to unveil the collective dynamic phenomena close to the Liouvillian exceptional points, as a consequence of the many-body effects therein. Formally, these phenomena are the quantum-many-body counterparts to those in classical open systems with nonlinearity, but hold intriguing new potentials for quantum applications.</description>

Abstract: Using exact solutions of the three-body problem, the spectrum of isolated three-body resonances for two identical particles interacting with another one is derived in the regime of large scattering length. The universality of the problem is depicted by using a contact model parameterized by two three-body parameters and the scattering length.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the emergence of quantum state designs in systems with symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state designs, by enabling an efficient sampling of random quantum states, play a quintessential role in devising and benchmarking various quantum protocols with broad applications ranging from circuit designs to black hole physics. Symmetries, on the other hand, are expected to reduce the randomness of a state. Despite being ubiquitous, the effects of symmetry on quantum state designs remain an outstanding question. The recently introduced projected ensemble framework generates efficient approximate state $t$-designs by hinging on projective measurements and many-body quantum chaos. In this work, we examine the emergence of state designs from the random generator states exhibiting symmetries. Leveraging on translation symmetry, we analytically establish a sufficient condition for the measurement basis leading to the state $t$-designs. Then, by making use of the trace distance measure, we numerically investigate the convergence to the designs. Subsequently, we inspect the violation of the sufficient condition to identify bases that fail to converge. We further demonstrate the emergence of state designs in a physical system by studying the dynamics of a chaotic tilted field Ising chain with translation symmetry. We find faster convergence of the trace distance during the early time evolution in comparison to the cases when the symmetry is broken. To delineate the general applicability of our results, we extend our analysis to other symmetries. We expect our findings to pave the way for further exploration of deep thermalization and equilibration of closed and open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Apparent delay of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in quenched open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a new intermediate regime in the quench time, $\tau_{q}$, separating the usual validity of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) and its breakdown for rapid quenches in open systems under finite quench protocols. It manifests in the power-law scaling of the transition time with $\tau_{q}$ as the system appears to enter the adiabatic regime, even though the ramp is already terminated and the final quench value is held constant. This intermediate regime, which we dub as the delayed KZM, emerges due to the dissipation preventing the system from freezing in the impulse regime. This results in a large delay between the actual time the system undergoes a phase transition and the time inferred from a threshold-based criterion for the order parameter, as done in most experiments. We demonstrate using the open Dicke model and its one-dimensional lattice version that this phenomenon is a generic feature of open systems that can be mapped onto an effective coupled oscillator model. We also show that the phenomenon becomes more prominent near criticality, and its effects on the transition time measurement can be further exacerbated by large threshold values for an order parameter. Due to this, we propose an alternative method for threshold-based criterion which uses the spatio-temporal information, such as the system's defect number, for identifying the transition time.</description>
