      <title>On Ising model in magnetic field on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conjecture an approximate expression for the free energy in the thermodynamic limit of the classical square lattice Ising model in a uniform (real) magnetic field. The zero-field result is well known due to Onsager for more than eighty years, but no such result exists for a nonzero magnetic field on a regular lattice. We verify our conjecture using numerical tensor renormalization group (TRG) methods and find good agreement with a maximum deviation of $\sim2\%$ from the numerical results for the free energy across all $\beta$ and real magnetic field, $h$.</description>

      <title>Comments on the minimal training set for CNN: a case study of the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal training set to train a working CNN is explored in detail. The considered model is the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the square lattice. Here $J_1 &lt; 0$ and $J_2 &gt; 0$ are the nearest and next-to-nearest neighboring couplings, respectively. We train the CNN using the configurations of $g \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} J_2/|J_1| = 0.7$ and employ the resulting CNN to study the phase transition of $g = 0.8$. We find that this transfer learning is successful. In particular, only configurations of two temperatures, one is below and one is above the critical temperature $T_c$ of $g=0.7$, are needed to reach accurately determination of the $T_c$ of $g=0.8$. However, it may be subtle to use this strategy for the training. Specifically, for the considered model, due to the inefficiency of the single spin flip algorithm used in sampling the configurations at the low-temperature region, the two temperatures associated with the training set should not be too far away from the $T_c$ of $g=0.7$, otherwise, the performance of the obtained CNN is not of high quality, hence cannot determine the $T_c$ of $g=0.8$ accurately. For the considered model, we also uncover the condition for training a successful CNN when only configurations of two temperatures are considered as the training set.</description>

      <title>Ab initio Complex Langevin computation of the roton gap for a dipolar Bose condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute from first principles the dispersion relation $\omega(k)$ of a dipolar Bose gas of erbium atoms close to the roton instability by employing the Complex Langevin (CL) algorithm. Other than the path integral Monte Carlo algorithm, which samples the quantum mechanical path integral in the $N$-particle basis, CL samples the field-theoretic path integral of interacting bosons and can be evaluated for experimentally realistic atom numbers. We extract the energy of roton excitations as a function of the s-wave scattering length, and compare our results to those from Gross-Pitaevskii theory, with and without quantum fluctuation corrections.</description>

      <title>Four-Fermion Deformations on Line Defects in QED$_4$ with Yukawas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the dynamics induced by a Wilson Line of charge $q$ and electron charge $e$ in $QED_4$ coupled to a real scalar via Yukawa interactions. We observe that there is a range of the fixed product $e^2 q$ with $e\rightarrow 0$ and $q\rightarrow \infty$ for which four-fermion operators play a dominant role for the dynamics of the theory. We uncover the fixed-point dynamics of the theory and analyze their critical behavior.</description>

      <title>Lattice calculation of the $\pi^0$, $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ transition form factors and the hadronic light-by-light contribution to the muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a first ab-initio calculation of the $\pi^0$, $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ transition form factors performed with physical light-quark masses. We provide a complete parametrization of the form factors that includes both single and double-virtual kinematics. Our results are compared with experimental measurements of the form factors in the space-like region and with the measured two-photon decay widths. In a second step, our parametrizations of the transition form factors are used to compute the dominant pseudoscalar-pole contributions to the hadronic light-by-light scattering in the muon $g-2$. Our final result reads $a_{\mu}^{\rm hlbl, ps-pole} = (85.1 \pm 5.2) \times 10^{-11}$. Although the pion-pole is dominant, we confirm that, together, the $\eta$ and $\eta^{\prime}$ provide roughly half of its contribution.</description>

      <title>Charged critical behavior and nonperturbative continuum limit of three-dimensional lattice SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional (3D) lattice SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs theories with multicomponent ($N_f&gt;1$) degenerate scalar fields and U($N_f$) global symmetry, focusing on systems with $N_c=2$, to identify critical behaviors that can be effectively described by the corresponding 3D SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theory. The field-theoretical analysis of the RG flow allows one to identify a stable charged fixed point for large values of $N_f$, that would control transitions characterized by the global symmetry-breaking pattern ${\rm U}(N_f)\rightarrow \mathrm{SU}(2)\otimes \mathrm{U}(N_f-2)$. Continuous transitions with the same symmetry-breaking pattern are observed in the SU(2) lattice gauge model for $N_f \ge 30$. Here we present a detailed finite-size scaling analysis of the Monte Carlo data for several large values of $N_f$. The results are in substantial agreement with the field-theoretical predictions obtained in the large-$N_f$ limit. This provides evidence that the SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theories provide the correct effective description of the 3D large-$N_f$ continuous transitions between the disordered and the Higgs phase, where the flavor symmetry breaks to $\mathrm{SU}(2)\otimes \mathrm{U}(N_f-2)$. Therefore, at least for large enough $N_f$, the 3D SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theories with multicomponent scalar fields can be nonperturbatively defined by the continuum limit of lattice discretizatized models with the same local and global symmetries.</description>

      <title>$B \to \rho \ell \bar{\nu}$ resonance form factors from $B \to \pi\pi \ell \bar{\nu}$ in lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay $B \to \rho \ell \bar{\nu}$ is an attractive process for determining the magnitude of the smallest CKM matrix element, $|V_{ub}|$, and can provide new insights into the origin of the long-standing exclusive-inclusive discrepancy in determinations of this Standard-Model parameter. This requires a nonperturbative QCD calculation of the $B \to \rho$ form factors $V$, $A_0$, $A_1$, and $A_{12}$. The unstable nature of the $\rho$ resonance has prevented precise lattice QCD calculations of these form factors to date. Here, we present the first lattice QCD calculation of the $B \to \rho$ form factors in which the $\rho$ is treated properly as a resonance in $P$-wave $\pi \pi$ scattering. To this end, we use the Lellouch-L\"uscher finite-volume formalism to compute the $B \to \pi \pi$ form factors as a function of both momentum transfer and $\pi \pi$ invariant mass, and then analytically continue to the $\rho$ resonance pole. This calculation is performed with $2+1$ dynamical quark flavors at a pion mass of approximately 320 MeV, and demonstrates a clear path toward results at the physical point.</description>

      <title>Chiral condensates and screening masses of neutral pseudoscalar mesons from lattice QCD at physical quark masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of temperature $T$ and external magnetic fields $eB$ on the chiral condensates and screening masses of neutral pseudoscalar mesons, including $\pi^0$, $K^0$, and $\eta_{s\bar{s}}^0$, in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with physical quark masses. The chiral condensates are intrinsically connected to the screening masses via Ward-Takahashi identities, with the latter characterizing the inverse of the spatial correlation length in the pseudoscalar channel. Using highly improved staggered quarks, we perform simulations on lattices with temporal extents $N_\tau = 8, 12, 16$ and an aspect ratio of 4, covering five temperatures from 145 MeV to 166 MeV. For each temperature, eight magnetic field strengths are simulated, reaching up to $eB \sim 0.8$ GeV$^2$. These simulations allow us to provide continuum estimates for the chiral condensates and screening masses. We observe intricate behavior in the light ($ud$), strange-light ($ds$) and strange ($s$) quark condensates as functions of the magnetic field and temperature, reflecting the competition between magnetic catalysis and inverse magnetic catalysis effects. This complex behavior is also mirrored in the screening masses of the neutral pseudoscalar mesons. Notably, the screening masses of $\pi^0$ and $K^0$ exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on $eB$, closely following the variations in their corresponding chiral condensates. Meanwhile, the screening mass of $\eta_{s\bar{s}}^0$ decreases monotonically with increasing $eB$. These findings provide valuable insights for understanding the behavior of QCD in a thermomagnetic medium and can serve as benchmarks for low-energy QCD models and effective theories.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Matrix Elements for Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) is a rare hypothesised process that, if discovered, would establish that the neutrino is Majorana, that is, it is its own antiparticle. Interpretation of experimental results relies on knowledge of nuclear matrix elements, whose large model uncertainty is the limiting factor in comparing measured (bounds on) half-lives to the neutrino mass. Nuclear effective field theory and lattice QCD have the potential to compute these matrix elements with better control over uncertainties, enhancing the discovery potential of next-generation $0\nu\beta\beta$ experiments. This work will survey various lattice QCD double-beta decay calculations and discuss their implications.</description>

      <title>Transverse-momentum-dependent pion structures from lattice QCD: Collins-Soper kernel, soft factor, TMDWF, and TMDPDF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) calculation of the pion valence-quark transverse-momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) within the framework of large-momentum effective theory (LaMET). Using correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge (CG), we computed the quasi-TMD beam function for a pion with a mass of 300 MeV, a fine lattice spacing of $a = 0.06$ fm and multiple large momenta up to 3 GeV. The intrinsic soft functions in the CG approach are extracted from form factors with large momentum transfer, and as a byproduct, we also obtain the corresponding Collins-Soper (CS) kernel. Our determinations of both the soft function and the CS kernel agree with perturbation theory at small transverse separations ($b_\perp$) between the quarks. At larger $b_\perp$, the CS kernel remains consistent with recent results obtained using both CG and gauge-invariant TMD correlators in the literature. By combining next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) factorization of the quasi-TMD beam function and the soft function, we obtain $x$-dependent pion valence-quark TMDPDF for transverse separations $b_\perp \gtrsim 1$ fm. Interestingly, we find that the $b_\perp$ dependence of the phenomenological parameterizations of TMDPDF for moderate values of $x$ are in reasonable agreement with our QCD determinations. In addition, we present results for the transverse-momentum-dependent wave function (TMDWF) for a heavier pion with 670 MeV mass.</description>
