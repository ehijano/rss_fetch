      <title>RAPID-LLM: Resilience-Aware Performance analysis of Infrastructure for Distributed LLM Training and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RAPID-LLM is a unified performance modeling framework for large language model (LLM) training and inference on GPU clusters. It couples a DeepFlow-based frontend that generates hardware-aware, operator-level Chakra execution traces from an abstract LLM specification (model shape, batch/sequence settings, training vs. inference, and hybrid parallelism choices) with an extended Astra-Sim backend that executes those traces on explicit multi-dimensional network topologies with congestion-aware routing and support for degraded and faulty links. The frontend assigns per-operator latency using a tile-based model that accounts for SM under-utilization and multi-level memory traffic (SRAM/ L2/ HBM), and prunes memory-infeasible configurations using an activation-liveness traversal under recomputation, parallelism and ZeRO/FDSP sharding policies.
  Across A100-based validation cases, RAPID-LLM predicts Llama inference step latency and GPT-scale training time per batch within 10.4\% relative to published measurements, and matches ns-3 packet-level results within 8\% on representative communication workloads. Case studies demonstrate how RAPID-LLM enables fast, exhaustive sweeps over hybrid-parallel configurations, quantifies sensitivity to soft link faults under realistic routing and congestion, and evaluates hypothetical GPU design variants including HBM bandwidth throttling effects.</description>

      <title>Performance Guarantees for Data Freshness in Resource-Constrained Adversarial IoT Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Timely updates are critical for real-time monitoring and control applications powered by the Internet of Things (IoT). As these systems scale, they become increasingly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, where malicious agents interfere with legitimate transmissions to reduce data rates, thereby inflating the age of information (AoI). Existing adversarial AoI models often assume stationary channels and overlook queueing dynamics arising from compromised sensing sources operating under resource constraints. Motivated by the G-queue framework, this paper investigates a two-source M/G/1/1 system in which one source is adversarial and disrupts the update process by injecting negative arrivals according to a Poisson process and inducing i.i.d. service slowdowns, bounded in attack rate and duration. Using moment generating functions, we then derive closed-form expressions for average and peak AoI for an arbitrary number of sources. Moreover, we introduce a worst-case constrained attack model and employ stochastic dominance arguments to establish analytical AoI bounds. Numerical results validate the analysis and highlight the impact of resource-limited adversarial interference under general service time distributions.</description>

      <title>Age of Information with Age-Dependent Server Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a single-source multi-server generate-at-will discrete-time non-preemptive status update system where update packets are transmitted using {\em only one} of the available servers, according to a server selection policy. In particular, when a transmission is complete, the update system makes a threshold-based decision on whether to wait or transmit, and if latter, which server to use for transmissions, on the basis of the instantaneous value of the age of information (AoI) process. In our setting, servers have general heterogeneous discrete phase-type (DPH) distributed service times, and also heterogeneous transmission costs. The goal is to find an age-dependent multi-threshold policy that minimizes the AoI cost with a constraint on transmission costs, the former cost defined in terms of the time average of an arbitrary function of AoI. For this purpose, we propose a novel tool called \emph{multi-regime absorbing Markov chain} (MR-AMC) in discrete time. Using the MR-AMC framework, we exactly obtain the distribution of AoI, and subsequently the costs associated with AoI and transmissions. With the exact analysis in hand, optimum thresholds can be obtained in the case of a few servers, by exhaustive search. We validate the proposed analytical model, and also demonstrate the benefits of age-dependent server selection, with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>WANDER: An Explainable Decision-Support Framework for HPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-performance computing (HPC) systems expose many interdependent configuration knobs that impact runtime, resource usage, power, and variability. Existing predictive tools model these outcomes, but do not support structured exploration, explanation, or guided reconfiguration. We present WANDER, a decision-support framework that synthesizes alternate configurations using counterfactual analysis aligned with user goals and constraints. We introduce a composite trade-off score that ranks suggestions based on prediction uncertainty, consistency between feature-target relationships using causal models, and similarity between feature distributions against historical data. To our knowledge, WANDER is the first such system to unify prediction, exploration, and explanation for HPC tuning under a common query interface. Across multiple datasets WANDER generates interpretable and trustworthy, human-readable alternatives that guide users to achieve their performance objectives.</description>

      <title>Libra: Unleashing GPU Heterogeneity for High-Performance Sparse Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse matrix multiplication operators (i.e., SpMM and SDDMM) are widely used in deep learning and scientific computing. Modern accelerators are commonly equipped with Tensor Core Units (TCUs) and CUDA cores to accelerate sparse operators. The former excels at structured matrix computations, whereas the latter offers greater programming flexibility. However, how to combine these two resources to maximize sparse-operator performance remains unclear. In this work, we first identify the source of performance gains in hybrid computation and systematically analyze their complementary strengths. Motivated by this, we propose Libra, a holistic framework that efficiently leverages heterogeneous computing resources to accelerate both SpMM and SDDMM operators. Specifically, Libra introduces a 2D-aware (locality and utilization) workload distribution method to precisely identify the optimal task mapping, simultaneously leveraging the data reuse capabilities of TCUs and the flexibility of CUDA cores to minimize computational redundancy. Libra further incorporates hybrid load balancing, occupancy-aware task scheduling, and efficient kernel implementations to maximize execution efficiency. Extensive experiments on H100 and RTX 4090 GPUs demonstrate that Libra surpasses all the 12 up-to-date baselines significantly, e.g., on average 1.77x speedup over FlashSparse, 1.73x over RoDe, and 2.9x over DGL for end-to-end GNN applications. Libra opens up a new perspective for sparse operator acceleration by fully unleashing the power of heterogeneous GPU resources.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Ranking Software Variants with Minimal Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking is a common practice in software engineering to assess the qualities and performance of software variants, coming from multiple competing systems or from configurations of the same system. Benchmarks are used notably to compare and understand variant performance, fine-tune software, detect regressions, or design new software systems. The execution of benchmarks to get a complete picture of software variants is highly costly in terms of computational resources and time. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for reducing benchmarks while maintaining stable rankings, using test suite optimization techniques. That is, we remove instances from the benchmarks while trying to keep the same rankings of the variants on all tests. Our method, BISection Sampling, BISS, strategically retains the most critical tests and applies a novel divide-and-conquer approach to efficiently sample among relevant remaining tests. We experiment with datasets and use cases from LLM leaderboards, SAT competitions, and configurable systems for performance modeling. Our results show that our method outperforms baselines even when operating on a subset of variants. Using BISS, we reduce the computational cost of the benchmarks on average to 44% and on more than half the benchmarks by up to 99% without loss in ranking stability.</description>
