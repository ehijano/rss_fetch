      <title>On the number of generators of groups acting arc-transitively on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a finite connected graph ${\Gamma}$ and a group $G$ acting transitively on the vertices of ${\Gamma}$, we prove that the number of vertices of ${\Gamma}$ and the cardinality of $G$ are bounded above by a function depending only on the cardinality of ${\Gamma}$ and on the exponent of $G$. We also prove that the number of generators of a group $G$ acting transitively on the arcs of a finite graph ${\Gamma}$ cannot be bounded by a function of the valency alone.</description>

      <title>Generalised Triangle Groups of Type (2,4,2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A conjecture of Rosenberger says that a group of the form $\langle x,y|x^p=y^q=W(x,y)^r=1\rangle$ (with $r&gt;1$) is either virtually solvable or contains a non-abelian free subgroup. This note is an account of an attack on the conjecture in the case $(p,q,r)=(2,4,2)$. The results obtained are only partial, but nevertheless provide strong evidence in support of the conjecture in the case in question, in that the word $W$ in any counterexample is shown to satisfy some strong restrictions. The exponent-sums of $x$ and $y$ in $W$ must be even and odd respectively, while its free-product (or syllable) length must be at least 68. There is also a report of computer investigations which yield a stronger lower bound of 196 for the free-product length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine all factorisations $X=AB$, where $X$ is a finite almost simple group and $A,B$ are core-free subgroups such that $A\cap B$ is cyclic or dihedral. As a main application, we classify the graphs $\Gamma$ admitting an almost simple arc-transitive group $X$ of automorphisms, such that $\Gamma$ has a 2-cell embedding as a map on a closed surface admitting a core-free arc-transitive subgroup $G$ of $X$. We prove that apart from the case where $X$ and $G$ have socles $A_n$ and $A_{n-1}$ respectively, the only such graphs are the complete graphs $K_n$ with $n$ a prime power, the Johnson graphs $J(n,2)$ with $n-1$ a prime power, and 14 further graphs. In the exceptional case, we construct infinitely many graph embeddings.</description>

      <title>Uniform growth in small cancellation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An open question asks whether every group acting acylindrically on a hyperbolic space has uniform exponential growth. We prove that the class of groups of uniform uniform exponential growth acting acylindrically on a hyperbolic space is closed under taking certain geometric small cancellation quotients. There are two consequences: firstly, there is a finitely generated acylindrically hyperbolic group that has uniform exponential growth but has arbitrarily large torsion balls. Secondly, the uniform uniform exponential growth rate of a classical $C''(\lambda)$-small cancellation group, for sufficiently small $\lambda$, is bounded from below by a universal positive constant. We give a similar result for uniform entropy-cardinality estimates. This yields an explicit upper bound on the isomorphism class of marked $\delta$-hyperbolic $C''(\lambda)$-small cancellation groups of uniformly bounded entropy in terms of $\delta$ and the entropy bound.</description>

      <title>Partial actions of inverse categories and their algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce partial and global actions of inverse categories on posets in two variants, fibred actions and actions by symmetries. We study in detail actions of an inverse category $\mathcal{C}$ on specific subposets of the poset of finite subsets of $\mathcal{C}$, the Bernoulli actions. We show that to each fibred action of an inverse category on a poset there corresponds another inverse category, the semidirect product associated to the action. The Bernoulli actions give rise to the Szendrei expansions of $\mathcal{C}$, which define a endofunctor of the category of inverse categories. We extend the concept of enlargement from inverse semigroup theory to, and we show that if $\mathcal{D}$ is an enlargement of $\mathcal{C}$ then their Cauchy completions are equivalent categories; in particular, some pairs corresponding to partial and global Bernoulli actions are enlargements. We conclude by studying convolution algebras of finite inverse categories and showing that if $\mathcal{D}$ is an enlargement of $\mathcal{C}$ then their convolution algebras are Morita equivalent. Furthermore, using Kan extensions we also analyze the infinite case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate multiplicative groups consisting entirely of singular alternating sign matrices (ASMs), and present several constructions of such groups. It is shown that every finite group is isomorphic to a group of singular ASMs, with a singular idempotent ASM as its identity element. The relationship between the size, the rank, and the possible multiplicative orders of singular ASMs is explored.</description>

      <title>Contractive representations of odometer semigroup</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a natural number $n \geq 1$, the odometer semigroup $O_n$, also known as the adding machine or the Baumslag-Solitar monoid with two generators, is a well-known object of study in group theory. This is also a central object of study for various algebraic-analytic structures. This paper examines the odometer semigroup in relation to representations of bounded linear operators. We focus on noncommutative operators and prove that contractive representations of $O_n$ always admit to nicer isometric representations of $O_n$ on vector-valued Fock spaces. We give a complete description of representations of $O_n$ on the Fock space and relate it to the dilation theory and invariant subspaces of Fock representations of $O_n$. Along the way, we also classify Nica covariant representations of $O_n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.01672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abstract. This article determines relations between two notions concerning monoids: factorability structure, introduced to simplify the bar complex; and quadratic normalisation, introduced to generalise quadratic rewriting systems and normalisations arising from Garside families. Factorable monoids are characterised in the axiomatic setting of quadratic normalisations. Additionally, quadratic normalisations of class (4,3) are characterised in terms of factorability structures and a condition ensuring the termination of the associated rewriting system.</description>

      <title>Endomorphisms of Artin groups of type D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we determine a classification of the endomorphisms of the Artin group $A [D_n]$ of type $D_n$ for $n\ge 6$. In particular we determine its automorphism group and its outer automorphism group. We also determine a classification of the homomorphisms from $A[D_n]$ to the Artin group $A [A_{n-1}]$ of type $A_{n-1}$ and a classification of the homomorphisms from $A[A_{n-1}]$ to $A[D_n]$ for $n\ge 6$. We show that any endomorphism of the quotient $A [D_n] / Z (A [D_n])$ lifts to an endomorphism of $A [D_n]$ for $n \ge 4$. We deduce  a classification of the endomorphisms of $A [D_n] / Z (A [D_n])$, we determine the automorphism and outer automorphism groups of $A [D_n] / Z (A [D_n])$, and we show that $A [D_n] / Z (A [D_n])$ is co-Hopfian, for $n \ge 6$. The results are algebraic in nature but the proofs are based on topological arguments (curves on surfaces and mapping class groups).</description>

      <title>On the residual nilpotence of generalized free products of groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be the generalized free product of two groups with an amalgamated subgroup. We propose an approach that allows one to use results on the residual $p$-finiteness of $G$ for proving that this generalized free product is residually a finite nilpotent group or residually a finite metanilpotent group. This approach can be applied under most of the conditions on the amalgamated subgroup that allow the study of residual $p$-finiteness. Namely, we consider the cases where the amalgamated subgroup is a) periodic, b) locally cyclic, c) central in one of the free factors, d) normal in both free factors, or e) is a retract of one of the free factors. In each of these cases, we give certain necessary and sufficient conditions for $G$ to be residually a) a finite nilpotent group, b) a finite metanilpotent group.</description>

      <title>Minimal doubling for small subsets in compact Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14062v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a sharp bound for the minimal doubling of a small measurable subset of a compact connected Lie group. Namely, let $G$ be a compact connected Lie group of dimension $d_G$, we show that for for all measurable subsets $A$, we have $$\mu_G(A^2) \geq \left(2^{d_G-d_H} - C\mu_G(A)^{\frac{2}{d_G-d_H}}\right)\mu_G(A)$$ where $d_H$ is the maximal dimension of a proper closed subgroup $H$ and $C &gt; 0$ is a dimensional constant. This settles a conjecture of Breuillard and Green, and recovers and improves - with completely different methods - a recent result of Jing--Tran--Zhang corresponding to the case $G=SO_3(\mathbb{R})$. As is often the case, the above doubling inequality stems from a special case of general product-set estimates. We prove that for all $\epsilon &gt;0$ and for any pair of sufficiently small measurable subsets $A,B$ a Brunn--Minkowski-type inequality holds:
  $$ \mu_G(AB)^{\frac{1}{d_G-d_H}} \geq (1-\epsilon)\left( \mu_G(A)^{\frac{1}{d_G-d_H}} + \mu_G(B)^{\frac{1}{d_G-d_H}}\right).$$
  Going beyond the scope of the Breuillard--Green conjecture, we prove a stability result asserting that the only subsets with close to minimal doubling are essentially neighbourhoods of proper subgroups i.e. of the form $$H_{\delta}:=\{g \in G: d(g,H)&lt;\delta\}$$ where $H$ denotes a proper closed subgroup of maximal dimension, $d$ denotes a bi-invariant distance on $G$ and $\delta &gt;0$.
  Our approach relies on a combination of two toolsets: optimal transports and its recent applications to the Brunn--Minkowski inequality, and the structure theory of compact approximate subgroups.</description>

      <title>Assouad-Nagata dimension of minor-closed metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12273v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assouad-Nagata dimension addresses both large and small scale behaviors of metric spaces and is a refinement of Gromov's asymptotic dimension. A metric space $M$ is a minor-closed metric if there exists an (edge-)weighted graph $G$ satisfying a fixed minor-closed property such that the underlying space of $M$ is the vertex-set of $G$, and the metric of $M$ is the distance function in $G$. Minor-closed metrics naturally arise when removing redundant edges of the underlying graphs by using edge-deletion and edge-contraction. In this paper, we determine the Assouad-Nagata dimension of every minor-closed metric. Our main theorem simultaneously generalizes known results about the asymptotic dimension of $H$-minor free unweighted graphs and about the Assouad-Nagata dimension of complete Riemannian surfaces with finite Euler genus.</description>

      <title>Discovering Abstract Symbolic Relations by Learning Unitary Group Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17002v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a principled approach for symbolic operation completion (SOC), a minimal task for studying symbolic reasoning. While conceptually similar to matrix completion, SOC poses a unique challenge in modeling abstract relationships between discrete symbols. We demonstrate that SOC can be efficiently solved by a minimal model - a bilinear map - with a novel factorized architecture. Inspired by group representation theory, this architecture leverages matrix embeddings of symbols, modeling each symbol as an operator that dynamically influences others.
  Our model achieves perfect test accuracy on SOC with comparable or superior sample efficiency to Transformer baselines across most datasets, while boasting significantly faster learning speeds (100-1000$\times$). Crucially, the model exhibits an implicit bias towards learning general group structures, precisely discovering the unitary representations of underlying groups. This remarkable property not only confers interpretability but also significant implications for automatic symmetry discovery in geometric deep learning.
  Overall, our work establishes group theory as a powerful guiding principle for discovering abstract algebraic structures in deep learning, and showcases matrix representations as a compelling alternative to traditional vector embeddings for modeling symbolic relationships.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18498v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Global representation rings were discovered by Sarah Witherspoon in 1995 and the Knutson Index was introduced by the second author in 2022. In the present paper we introduce the Knutson Index for general commutative rings and study it for Burnside rings and global representation rings. We also introduce the global table of a finite group, that encompasses both the character table and the Burnside table of marks. We discuss what properties of a group can be recovered from its global table.</description>
