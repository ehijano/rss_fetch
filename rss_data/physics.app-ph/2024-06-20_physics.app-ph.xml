      <title>Effect of free surface, oxide and coating layers on rafting in $\gamma-\gamma'$ superalloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex microstructure evolution has been observed \rev{both bare and coated } Ni-based single crystal superalloys. Rafting and $\gamma'$ depletion are investigated in this study through a brief experimental analysis and a detailed phase field model to account for mechanical-diffusion coupling. The proposed model has been implemented in a finite element code. As a main result, it is shown that rafting, $\gamma'$ depletion close to free surface/oxide layer or $\gamma'$ coalescence close to coating layer, and mechanical behavior are strongly coupled. The local additional flux of Al explains this coupling to a large extent. Finally, a discussion of strain localization and local flux of Al paves the way for clarification of these cases that degrade the performance of superalloys.</description>

      <title>Ultralow thermal conductance across the [FePt/h-BN/FePt] interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat transfer in nanocomposite materials has attracted great interest for various applications. Multilayer structures provide an important platform to study interfacial thermal transport and to engineer materials with ultralow thermal conductivity. Here we report on the fabrication and thermal characterization of [h-BN/$L1_0$-FePt]xN multilayers, where hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) nanosheets (2.5 nm thick) and $L1_0$-FePt layers (6.5 nm thick) alternate periodically. Differential three-omega($3\omega$) measurements reveal an ultralow effective thermal conductivity of $ 0.60 \pm 0.05 W \cdot m^{-1}K^{-1}$ across the multilayer films, and a low thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of $ 67.9 \pm 6.6 MW \cdot m^{-2}K^{-1}$ for the [FePt/h-BN(2.5nm)/FePt] interface at room temperature. We attribute the ultralow thermal conductivity to the weak van der Waals bonding at h-BN/FePt interfaces, which dominates the thermal resistance of the multilayer structure. These findings provide insights into the thermal transport in 2D-material/metal multilayer nanostructures and suggest the [h-BN/FePt] superlattice as a promising material for nanoscale thermal barrier coating. Furthermore, the obtained TBC lays the foundation for analyzing heat transfer in FePt-(h-BN) nanogranular films, a promising magnetic recording media which can potentially provide high thermal gradient for heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR). This work advances the understanding of thermal transport in 2D-material/metal nanocomposites and demonstrates interface engineering as an effective approach to achieve materials with ultralow thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Advances in perovskite nanocrystals and nanocomposites for scintillation applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the field of radiation detection has witnessed a paradigm shift with the emergence of plastic scintillators incorporating perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). This innovative class of scintillators not only capitalizes on the superior luminescent properties of PNCs but also harnesses the flexibility and processability of polymers. This review explores the intricate landscape of synthesizing and fabricating scintillating PNCs and nanocomposites, delving into the methods employed in their production. From solution-based methods to innovative solid-state approaches, the synthesis of PNCs for scintillators application is explored comprehensively. Furthermore, embedding strategies within polymeric matrices are scrutinized, shedding light on the various techniques utilized to achieve optimal dispersion and compatibility. The evaluation of the final nanocomposites is finally discussed, with a particular emphasis on their scintillating performance and radiation hardness. Through a meticulous exploration of synthesis methodologies, embedding techniques, and performance assessments, this review aims to provide a multilayered understanding of the state-of-the-art in PNCs-based nanoscintillators.</description>

      <title>Scintillation Properties of CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals Prepared by Ligand-Assisted Reprecipitation and Dual Effect of Polyacrylate Encapsulation toward Scalable Ultrafast Radiation Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP-NCs) embedded in polymeric hosts are gaining attention as scalable and low-cost scintillation detectors for technologically relevant applications. Despite rapid progress, little is currently known about the scintillation properties and stability of LHP-NCs prepared by the ligand assisted reprecipitation (LARP) method, which allows mass scalability at room temperature unmatched by any other type of nanostructure, and the implications of incorporating LHP-NCs into polyacrylate hosts are still largely debated. Here, we show that LARP-synthesized CsPbBr3 NCs are comparable to particles from hot-injection routes and unravel the dual effect of polyacrylate incorporation, where the partial degradation of LHP-NCs luminescence is counterbalanced by the passivation of electron-poor defects by the host acrylic groups. Experiments on NCs with tailored surface defects show that the balance between such antithetical effects of polymer embedding is determined by the surface defect density of the NCs and provide guidelines for further material optimization.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Crystallization and Phase Transition of Niobium Dioxide Thin-Films for Neuromorphic Computing Applications Using a Tube Furnace Optical Transmission System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Significant research has focused on low-power stochastic devices built from memristive materials. These devices foster neuromorphic approaches to computational efficiency enhancement in merged biomimetic and CMOS architectures due to their ability to phase transition from a dielectric to a metal at an increased temperature. Niobium dioxide has a volatile memristive phase change that occurs $\sim$800$^\circ$C~that makes it an ideal candidate for future neuromorphic electronics. A straightforward optical system has been developed on a horizontal tube furnace for \emph{in situ} spectral measurements as an as-grown \NbtOf\ film is annealed and ultimately crystallizes as \NbOt. The system measures the changing spectral transmissivity of \NbtOf\ as it undergoes both reduction and crystallization processes. We were also able to measure the transition from metallic-to-non-metallic \NbOt\ during the cooldown phase, which is shown to occur about 100$^\circ$C~ lower on a sapphire substrate than fused silica. After annealing, the material properties of the \NbtOf\ and \NbOt\ were assessed via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and 4-point resistivity, confirming that we have made crystalline \NbOt.</description>

      <title>Hardware Realization of Neuromorphic Computing with a 4-Port Photonic Reservoir for Modulation Format Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence drive researchers to explore energy-efficient, brain-inspired new hardware. Reservoir computing encompasses recurrent neural networks for sequential data processing and matches the performance of other recurrent networks with less training and lower costs. However, traditional software-based neural networks suffer from high energy consumption due to computational demands and massive data transfer needs. Photonic reservoir computing overcomes this challenge with energy-efficient neuromorphic photonic integrated circuits or NeuroPICs. Here, we introduce a reservoir NeuroPIC used for modulation format identification in C-band telecommunication network monitoring. It is built on a silicon-on-insulator platform with a 4-port reservoir architecture consisting of a set of physical nodes connected via delay lines. We comprehensively describe the NeuroPIC design and fabrication, experimentally demonstrate its performance, and compare it with simulations. The NeuroPIC incorporates non-linearity through a simple digital readout and achieves close to 100% accuracy in identifying several configurations of quadrature amplitude modulation formats transmitted over 20 km of optical fiber at 32 GBaud symbol rate. The NeuroPIC performance is robust against fabrication imperfections like waveguide propagation loss, phase randomization, etc. and delay line length variations. Furthermore, the experimental results exceeded numerical simulations, which we attribute to enhanced signal interference in the experimental NeuroPIC output. Our energy-efficient photonic approach has the potential for high-speed temporal data processing in a variety of applications.</description>

      <title>Highly Sensitive Label-free Biomolecular Detection Using Au-WS2 Nanohybrid Based SERS Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in nanotechnology have led to the development of surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) based rapid and low-cost technologies for ultra-sensitive label-free detection and identification of molecular analytes. Herein, we utilized the synergistic plasmonic and chemical enhancement effects of Au-WS2 nanohybrids to attain the high-intensity Raman signals of targeted analytes. To develop these nanohybrids, a series of monodispersed Au nanoparticles (NPs) of varying diameters from 20 to 80 nm was chemically synthesized and successively blended with liquid-phase exfoliated WS2 nano-flakes of average lateral size 90 nm. They provided a maximum enhancement factor (EF) of ~1.80 109 corresponding to the characteristic peaks at 1364 cm-1 and 1512 cm-1 for R6G analyte molecules. Theoretical studies based on the finite-difference time-domain simulations on Au-WS2 nanohybrid systems revealed a huge field-intensity enhancement with an EF of more than 1000 at the plasmonic hotspots, which was induced by the strong coupling of individual plasmon oscillations of the adjacent Au NPs upon light interactions. These electromagnetic effects along with the chemical enhancement effects of WS2 nanoflakes were found to be mainly responsible for such huge enhancement in Raman signals. Furthermore, these hybrids were successfully employed for achieving highly sensitive detection of the E. coli ATCC 35218 bacterial strain with a concentration of 104 CFU/mL in phosphate-buffered saline media, indicating their real capabilities for practical scenarios. The findings of the present study will indeed provide vital information in the development of innovative nanomaterial-based biosensors, that will offer new possibilities for addressing critical public health concerns.</description>

      <title>Micro-gap thermo-photo-thermionics: An alternative approach to harvesting thermo-photons and its comparison with thermophotovoltaics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates an alternative to thermophotovoltaics for harvesting thermal and optical energy via photon coupling and thermionic energy conversion. In this device, a heat source is radiatively coupled to a thermionic electron emitter through a nanoscale gap and the electron emitter is coupled to collector through a microscale gap. The analysis using fluctuational electrodynamics and finite time thermodynamics shows that for identical thermal radiator and photon to electron conversion materials, the output power density in the thermionic device can be more than twice that of the thermophotovoltaic device; the thermionic mechanism can also provide more than 30 percent improvement in the energy conversion efficiency compared to the thermophotovoltaic device. Moreover, the maximum power point voltage in the thermionic device is shown to significantly exceed the band gap of conversion material, which determines the theoretical upper limit of the open circuit voltage in a thermophotovoltaic cell. Therefore, the results of this study indicate that thermionic energy harvesting via thermo-photon coupling can be a promising alternative to thermophotovoltaics.</description>

      <title>Orbit symmetry breaking in MXene implements enhanced soft bioelectronic implants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bioelectronic implants with soft mechanics, biocompatibility, and excellent electrical performance enable biomedical implants to record electrophysiological signals and execute interventions within internal organs, promising to revolutionize the diagnosing, monitoring, and treatment of various pathological conditions. However, challenges remain in improving excessive impedance at the bioelectronic-tissue interface and thus the efficacy of electrophysiological signaling and intervention. Here, we devise orbit symmetry breaking in MXene (a low-cost scalability, biocompatible, and conductive 2D layered material, that we refer to as OBXene), that exhibits low bioelectronic-tissue impedance, originating from the out-of-plane charge transfer. Furthermore, the Schottky-induced piezoelectricity stemming from the asymmetric orbital configuration of OBXene facilitates interlayered charge transport in the device. In this study, we report an OBXene-based cardiac patch applied on the left ventricular epicardium of both rodent and porcine models to enable spatiotemporal epicardium mapping and pacing, while coupling the wireless and battery-free operation for long-term real-time recording and closed-loop stimulation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry lies at the heart of 2D bioelectronics, determining material properties at the fundamental level. Breaking the symmetry allows emergent functionalities and effects. However, symmetry modulation in 2D bioelectronics and the resultant applications have been largely overlooked. Here we devise an oxidized architectural MXene, referred as OXene, that couples orbit symmetric breaking with inverse symmetric breaking to entitle the optimized interfacial impedance and Schottky-induced piezoelectric effects. The resulting OXene validates applications ranging from microelectrode arrays, gait analysis, active transistor matrix, and wireless signaling transmission, which enables highly-fidelity signal transmission and reconfigurable logic gates. Further OXene interfaces are investigated in both rodent and porcine myocardium, featuring high-quality and spatiotemporally resolved physiological recordings, while accurate differentiated predictions, enabled via various machine learning pipelines.</description>

      <title>Double-tough and ultra-strong ceramics: leveraging multiscale toughening mechanisms through Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optimization-driven approach to creating a double-tough ceramic material with a brick-and-mortar microstructure, where the mortar is itself transformation-toughened, engineered with the goal of simultaneously achieving high strength and fracture toughness levels. Specifically, we design a material where high-strength alumina bricks are interconnected via a ceria-stabilized zirconia mortar. As the design of such a material, driven by multiscale toughening mechanisms, requires a laborious trial-and-error approach, we propose a Bayesian optimization framework as an integral part of our methodology to streamline and accelerate the design process. We use a Gaussian process to emulate the material's mechanical response and implement a cost-aware batch Bayesian optimization to efficiently identify optimal design process parameters, accounting for the cost of experimentally varying them. This approach expedites the optimization of the material's mechanical properties. As a result, we develop a bio-inspired all-ceramic composite that exhibits an exceptional balance between bending strength (704 MPa), and fracture toughness (13.6 MPa m^0.5).</description>

      <title>Structural and Electrical Properties of Grafted Si/GaAsSb Heterojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The short-wave infrared (SWIR) wavelength, especially 1.55 um, has attracted significant attention in various areas such as high-speed optical communication and LiDAR systems. Avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are a critical component as a receiver in these systems due to their internal gain which enhances the system performance. Silicon-based APDs are promising since they are CMOS compatible, but they are limited in detecting 1.55 um light detection. This study proposes a p-type Si on n-type GaAs0.51Sb0.49 (GaAsSb) lattice matched to InP substrates heterojunction formed using a grafting technique for future GaAsSb/Si APD technology. A p+Si nanomembrane is transferred onto the GaAsSb/AlInAs/InP substrate, with an ultrathin ALD-Al2O3 oxide at the interface, which behaves as both double-side passivation and quantum tunneling layers. The devices exhibit excellent surface morphology and interface quality, confirmed by atomic force microscope (AFM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM). Also, the current-voltage (I-V) of the p+Si/n-GaAsSb heterojunction shows ideal rectifying characteristics with an ideality factor of 1.15. The I-V tests across multiple devices confirm high consistency and yield. Furthermore, the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurement reveals that GaAsSb and Si are found to have type-II band alignment with a conduction band offset of 50 meV which is favorable for the high-bandwidth APD application. The demonstration of the GaAsSb/Si heterojunction highlights the potential to advance current SWIR PD technologies.</description>

      <title>High Bulk Modulus Pentamodes: the Three-Dimensional Metal Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite significant advances in the field of phononic crystals, the development of acoustic metafluids that replicate the behaviour of liquids in three dimensions remains elusive. For instance, water - the quintessential pentamode (PM) material - has a bulk modulus two orders of magnitude higher than current state-of-the-art PMs. The need for a low shear modulus inherently conflicts with the desire of high bulk modulus and density. In this letter, we shed light on the limitations of existing PM geometries and propose an innovative shape for the links that constitute the network. Inspired by the kinematics of ropes, these links are constructed from thin fibres and demonstrate the potential to create PMs with properties akin to those of liquids. As a prime example, we present the design of the first metamaterial that fully deserves the name 3D metal water, since its acoustic properties in the low frequency regime are indistinguishable with water. Additionally, we highlight a shear band gap in the lattice dispersion diagram, and illustrate the influence of geometric parameters on the dynamic properties at higher frequencies. This novel design of metafluids holds promise for applications requiring anisotropic materials such as acoustic lenses, waveguides, and cloaks.</description>

      <title>New Reservoir Computing Kernel Based on Chaotic Chua Circuit and Investigating Application to Post-Quantum Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this project was to develop a new Reservoir Computer implementation, based on a chaotic Chua circuit. In addition to suitable classification and regression benchmarks, the Reservoir Computer was applied to Post-Quantum Cryptography, with its suitability for this application investigated and assessed. The cryptographic algorithm utilised was the Learning with Errors problem, for both encryption and decryption. To achieve this, the Chua circuit was characterised, in simulation, and by physical circuit testing. The Reservoir Computer was designed and implemented using the results of the characterisation. As part of this development, noise was considered and mitigated.
  The benchmarks demonstrate that the Reservoir Computer can achieve current literature benchmarks with low error. However, the results with Learning with Errors suggest that a Chua-based Reservoir Computer is not sufficiently complex to tackle the high non-linearity in Post-Quantum Cryptography. Future work would involve researching the use of different combinations of multiple Chua Reservoir Computers in larger neural network architectures. Such architectures may produce the required high-dimensional behaviour to achieve the Learning with Errors problem.
  This project is believed to be only the second instance of a Chua-based Reservoir Computer in academia, and it is the first to be applied to challenging real-world tasks such as Post-Quantum Cryptography. It is also original by its investigation of hitherto unexplored parameters, and their impact on performance. It demonstrates a proof-of-concept for a mass-producible, inexpensive, low-power consumption hardware neural network. It also enables the next stages in research to occur, paving the road for using Chua-based Reservoir Computers across various applications.</description>

      <title>Size Effect of Negative Capacitance State and Subthreshold Swing in Van der Waals Ferrielectric Field-Effect Transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytical calculations corroborated by the finite element modelling show that thin films of Van der Waals ferrielectrics covered by a 2D-semiconductor are promising candidates for the controllable reduction of the dielectric layer capacitance due to the negative capacitance (NC) effect emerging in the ferrielectric film. The NC state is conditioned by energy-degenerated poly-domain states of the ferrielectric polarization induced in the films under incomplete screening conditions in the presence of a dielectric layer. Calculations performed for the FET-type heterostructure "ferrielectric CuInP2S6 film - 2D-MoS2 single-layer - SiO2 dielectric layer" reveal the pronounced size effect of the multilayer capacitance. Derived analytical expressions for the electric polarization and multilayer capacitance allow to predict the thickness range of the dielectric layer and ferrielectric film for which the NC effect is the most pronounced in various Van der Waals ferrielectrics, and the corresponding subthreshold swing becomes much less than the Boltzmann's limit. Obtained results can be useful for the size and temperature control of the NC effect in the steep-slope ferrielectric FETs.</description>

      <title>Influence of the coating brittleness on the thermomechanical fatigue behavior of a $\beta$-NiAl coated R125 Ni-based superalloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The brittleness of an aluminide diffusion coating protecting a Ren\'e 125 Ni-based polycrystalline superalloy was investigated over a wide range of temperatures in its as-received and thermally aged form. Isothermal and thermal cycled aging were performed on the coated system at a maximum temperature of 1100 {\deg}C. Microstructure evolutions and damage initiation within the coating were characterized. Interrupted tensile tests and thermomechanical fatigue tests were conducted to document critical stress-strain conditions leading to the coating cracking and lifetime for the case of thermo-mechanical fatigue loading. Advanced digital image correlation and acoustic emission techniques were used to detect coating cracking. Isothermal oxidation or cyclic oxidation led to improved strain-to-failure due to metallurgical evolutions and also longer fatigue life under thermomechanical fatigue conditions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical phase-field model of cavity electromagnonic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cavity electromagnonic system, which simultaneously consists of cavities for photons, magnons (quanta of spin waves), and acoustic phonons, provides an exciting platform to achieve coherent energy transduction among different physical systems down to single quantum level. Here we report a dynamical phase-field model that allows simulating the coupled dynamics of the electromagnetic waves, magnetization, and strain in 3D multiphase systems. As examples of application, we computationally demonstrate the excitation of hybrid magnon-photon modes (magnon polaritons), Floquet-induced magnonic Aulter-Townes splitting, dynamical energy exchange (Rabi oscillation) and relative phase control (Ramsey interference) between the two magnon polariton modes. The simulation results are consistent with analytical calculations based on Floquet Hamiltonian theory. Simulations are also performed to design a cavity electro-magno-mechanical system that enables the triple phonon-magnon-photon resonance, where the resonant excitation of a chiral, fundamental (n=1) transverse acoustic phonon mode by magnon polaritons is demonstrated. With the capability to predict coupling strength, dissipation rates, and temporal evolution of photon/magnon/phonon mode profiles using fundamental materials parameters as the inputs, the present dynamical phase-field model represents a valuable computational tool to guide the fabrication of the cavity electromagnonic system and the design of operating conditions for applications in quantum sensing, transduction, and communication.</description>

      <title>Microwave amplification chain calibration in an axion haloscope via cavity-emitted radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an axion haloscope, the weak photon signal, theoretically converted from axions, is captured by a detection cavity. The amplification chain assists the signal receiver to read the signal from the cavity and requires accurate calibration. Typically, the readout line is calibrated using the Y-factor method, involving a switch that directs the signal from either the detection line or the calibration line. However, this switch introduces several disadvantages. In response, we propose a calibration method that eliminates the need for a switch. In this approach, the cavity temperature is decoupled to its incoming noise source and can be controlled, resulting in excess or deficiency of the noise spectrum near its resonance frequency. The experimental result shows that the amplification chain can be calibrated directly using the temperature-varied cavity-emitted radiation.</description>

      <title>Flexoelectricity in Amorphous Hafnium Oxide (HfO$_2$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity, inherent in all materials, offers a promising alternative to piezoelectricity for nanoscale actuation and sensing. However, its widespread application faces significant challenges: differentiating flexoelectric effects from those of piezoelectricity and other phenomena, verifying its universality across all material structures and thicknesses, and establishing a comprehensive database of flexoelectric coefficients across different materials. This work introduces a groundbreaking methodology that accurately isolates flexoelectricity from piezoelectric, electrostrictive and electrostatic effects, with a detection threshold extending below 1 fC/m. The robustness of this method is demonstrated through its application to amorphous hafnium oxide (HfO$_2$), successfully measuring a flexoelectric coefficient of 105 $\pm$ 10 pC/m. This measurement signifies the first measurement of flexoelectricity in hafnia, as well as in any amorphous material. Additionally, the study compiles a list of published flexoelectric coefficients, revealing an important insight. The relationship between the flexoelectric coefficient and the material's relative permittivity is better approximated by a quadratic proportionality. This challenges the traditional linear assumption proposed in Kogan's work and opens new avenues for future research in flexoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Simulation of sympathetic cooling efficiency in a linear Paul trap driven by alternative waveforms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cooling of ions or other charged particles in electromagnetic traps is an essential tool to achieve control over their degrees of freedom on the quantum level. For many objects, there is no viable route for direct cooling, such as an accessible laser cooling transition. In such a case, the sympathetic cooling can be used, where a particle with such a direct route is used to cool down the other particle via Coulomb interaction. On the downside, this cooling process often is inefficient. Here, we numerically evaluate the sympathetic cooling performance in a quadrupole ion trap for different driving waveforms. We find that using different driving waveforms and optimized trap parameters the sympathetic cooling performance can be enhanced. These results will open up the way to achieve larger sympathetic cooling rates from which many techniques, such as aluminum ion clocks, might profit.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of low power and highly uniform 6-bit operation in SiO2-based memristors embedded with Pt nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, an optimized method was implemented for attaining stable multibit operation with low energy consumption in a two-terminal memory element made from the following layers: Ag/Pt nanoparticles (NPs)/SiO2/TiN in a 1-Transistor-1-Memristor configuration. Compared to the reference sample where no NPs were embedded, an enlarged memory window was recorded in conjunction with reduced variability for both switching states. A comprehensive numerical model was also applied to shed light on this enhanced performance, which was attributed to the spatial confinement effect induced by the presence of the Pt NPs and its impact on the properties of the percolating conducting filaments (CFs). Although 5-bit precision was demonstrated with the application of the incremental-step-pulse-programming (ISPP) algorithm, the reset process was unreliable and the output current increased abnormally when exceeded the value of 150 uA. As a result, the multibit operation was limited. To address this issue, a modified scheme was developed to accurately control the distance between the various resistance levels and achieve highly reliable 6-bit precision. Our work provides valuable insights for the development of energy-efficient memories for applications where a high density of conductance levels is required.</description>

Abstract: Energy-Based Models (EBMs) have emerged as a powerful framework in the realm of generative modeling, offering a unique perspective that aligns closely with principles of statistical mechanics. This review aims to provide physicists with a comprehensive understanding of EBMs, delineating their connection to other generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Normalizing Flows. We explore the sampling techniques crucial for EBMs, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, and draw parallels between EBM concepts and statistical mechanics, highlighting the significance of energy functions and partition functions. Furthermore, we delve into state-of-the-art training methodologies for EBMs, covering recent advancements and their implications for enhanced model performance and efficiency. This review is designed to clarify the often complex interconnections between these models, which can be challenging due to the diverse communities working on the topic.</description>

Abstract: We study the low-frequency noise (LFN), i.e. flicker noise, also referred to as 1/f noise, in 2D networks of molecularly functionalized gold nanoparticles (NMN: nanoparticle-molecule network). We examine the noise behaviors of the NMN hosting alkyl chains (octanethiol), fatty acid oleic acids (oleylamine), redox molecule switches (polyoxometalate derivatives) or photo-isomerizable molecules (azobenzene derivatives) and we compare their 1/f noise behaviors. These noise metrics are used to evaluate which molecules are the best candidates to build in-materio reservoir computing molecular devices based on NMNs.</description>

      <title>Stress-Dependent Optical Extinction in LPCVD Silicon Nitride Measured by Nanomechanical Photothermal Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding optical absorption in silicon nitride is crucial for cutting-edge technologies like photonic integrated circuits, nanomechanical photothermal infrared sensing and spectroscopy, and cavity optomechanics. Yet, the origin of its strong dependence on film deposition and fabrication process is not fully understood. This Letter leverages nanomechanical photothermal sensing to investigate optical extinction $\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$ at 632.8 nm wavelength in LPCVD SiN strings across a wide range of deposition-related tensile stresses ($200-850$ MPa). Measurements reveal a reduction in $\kappa_{\mathrm{ext}}$ from 10$^3$ to 10$^1$ ppm with increasing stress, correlated to variations in Si/N content ratio. Within the band-fluctuations framework, this trend indicates an increase of the energy bandgap with the stress, ultimately reducing absorption. Overall, this study showcases the power and simplicity of nanomechanical photothermal sensing for low absorption measurements, offering a sensitive, scattering-free platform for material analysis in nanophotonics and nanomechanics.</description>

      <title>Foundry compatible, efficient wafer-scale manufacturing of ultra-low loss, high-density Si$_3$N$_4$ photonic integrated circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) photonic integrated circuits (PICs) have shown low linear loss, negligible nonlinear loss, and high power handling over traditional silicon photonics. To achieve high-density photonic integration and high effective nonlinearity through tight optical confinement, thick stoichiometric Si$_3$N$_4$ films are indispensable. However, when using low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) to achieve high optical material transparency, Si$_3$N$_4$ films exhibit large tensile stress on the order of GPa. Methods for crack prevention are therefore essential. The photonic Damascene process has addressed this issue, attaining record low loss Si$_3$N$_4$ PICs, but it lacks control of the waveguide height. Conversely, precise waveguide dimension and ultra-low loss have been achieved with subtractive processing, but this method is not compatible with mass production due to the use of electron beam lithography. To date, an outstanding challenge is to attain both lithographic precision and ultra-low loss in high confinement Si$_3$N$_4$ PICs that are compatible with large-scale foundry manufacturing. Here, we present a single-step deposited, DUV-based subtractive method for producing wafer-scale ultra-low loss Si$_3$N$_4$ PICs that harmonize these necessities. By employing deep etching of densely distributed, interconnected trenches into the substrate, we effectively mitigate the tensile stress in the Si$_3$N$_4$ layer, enabling direct deposition of thick films without cracking and substantially prolonged storage duration. Lastly, we identify ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced damage that can be remedied through rapid thermal annealing. Collectively, we develop ultra-low loss Si$_3$N$_4$ microresonators and 0.5 m-long spiral waveguides with losses down to 1.4 dB/m at 1550 nm with high production yield.</description>

      <title>Silicon Nitride C-Band Grating Coupler with Reduced Waveguide Back-Reflection Using Adaptively Corrected Elliptical Grates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experimental results for a fully etched C-band grating coupler with reduced back reflection fabricated in an 800 nm silicon nitride platform. Back-reflections are reduced by symmetrically interrupting the first few grates around the center axis of the propagating light. The span of the etched grates is gradually increased until they cover the full width. By interrupting the grates, light is reflected back obliquely, which leads to the excitation of higher-order modes that are scattered out of the structure. While this approach has been previously shown in silicon, it comes with a significant penalty in coupling efficiency of around 2.4 dB of extra loss in the layer stack investigated here. In this work, we present the design and measurement results of a grating coupler in which waveguide-to-waveguide back-reflections are suppressed by ~10 dB with this technique, while at the same time mitigating excess insertion losses by reshaping the grates as ellipses of varying eccentricity. This helps to compensate the phase front error induced by the interruption of the grates. This correction does not affect the level by which the back-reflection is suppressed, but reduces the insertion loss penalty from 2.4 dB to 1 dB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mobility of emerging (e.g., two-dimensional, oxide, organic) semiconductors is commonly estimated from transistor current-voltage measurements. However, such devices often experience contact gating, i.e., electric fields from the gate modulate the contact resistance during measurements, which can lead conventional extraction techniques to estimate mobility incorrectly even by a factor &gt;2. This error can be minimized by measuring transistors at high gate-source bias, |$V_\mathrm{gs}$|, but this regime is often inaccessible in emerging devices that suffer from high contact resistance or early gate dielectric breakdown. Here, we propose a method of extracting mobility in transistors with gate-dependent contact resistance that does not require operation at high |$V_\mathrm{gs}$|, enabling accurate mobility extraction even in emerging transistors with strong contact gating. Our approach relies on updating the transfer length method (TLM) and can achieve &lt;10% error even in regimes where conventional techniques overestimate mobility by &gt;2$\times$.</description>

      <title>Linearizing Binary Optimization Problems Using Variable Posets for Ising Machines</title>

Abstract: Ising machines are next-generation computers expected to efficiently sample near-optimal solutions of combinatorial optimization problems. Combinatorial optimization problems are modeled as quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems to apply an Ising machine. However, current state-of-the-art Ising machines still often fail to output near-optimal solutions due to the complicated energy landscape of QUBO problems. Furthermore, the physical implementation of Ising machines severely restricts the size of QUBO problems to be input as a result of limited hardware graph structures. In this study, we take a new approach to these challenges by injecting auxiliary penalties preserving the optimum, which reduces quadratic terms in QUBO objective functions. The process simultaneously simplifies the energy landscape of QUBO problems, allowing the search for near-optimal solutions, and makes QUBO problems sparser, facilitating encoding into Ising machines with restriction on the hardware graph structure. We propose linearization of QUBO problems using variable posets as an outcome of the approach. By applying the proposed method to synthetic QUBO instances and to multi-dimensional knapsack problems, we empirically validate the effects on enhancing minor-embedding of QUBO problems and the performance of Ising machines.</description>

      <title>Fundamental scaling limits and bandwidth shaping of frequency-modulated combs</title>

Abstract: Frequency-modulated (FM) combs based on active cavities like quantum cascade lasers have recently emerged as promising light sources in many spectral regions. Unlike passive modelocking, which uses amplitude modulation to generate amplitude modulation, FM combs use phase modulation to generate phase modulation. They can therefore be regarded as a phase-domain version of passive modelocking. However, while the ultimate scaling laws of passive modelocking have long been known -- Haus showed in 1975 that pulses have a bandwidth proportional to effective gain bandwidth -- the limits of FM combs have been much less clear. Here, we show that FM combs are governed by the same fundamental limits, producing combs whose bandwidths are linear in the effective gain bandwidth. Not only do we show theoretically that the diffusive effect of gain curvature limits comb bandwidth, we also show experimentally how this limit can be increased. By adding carefully designed resonant-loss structures that are evanescently coupled to the cavity of a terahertz laser, we reduce the curvature and increase the effective gain bandwidth of the laser, demonstrating bandwidth enhancement. Our results give a new degree of freedom for the creation of active chip-scale combs and can be applied to a wide array of cavity geometries.</description>

      <title>Amplified linear and nonlinear chiral sensing assisted by anapole modes in hybrid metasurfaces</title>

Abstract: The interaction between chiral molecules and circularly polarized light is largely influenced by the local optical chirality density. This interaction prompts substantial demand of the design of nanophotonic platforms capable of enhancing such effects across large and accessible volumes. Such a magnification requires nanostructures that provide strong electric and magnetic field enhancements while preserving the phase relation of circular light. Dielectric nanostructures, particularly those able to support resonances, are ideal candidates for this task due to their capacity for high electric and magnetic field enhancements. On the other hand, efficient third harmonic generation calls for strong electric field resonances within dielectric materials, a feature often boosted by incorporating plasmonic materials into hybrid systems. In this work, we numerically propose a coupled silicon disk-gold ring system that can exploit the anapole-induced field confinement to provide a broadband magnified circular dichroism under realistic conditions, reaching values up to a 230-fold enhancement. We also demonstrate that this structure can be employed as an efficient third harmonic generator which, when integrated with chiral media, enables an 800-fold enhancement in circular dichroism. Furthermore, we show that pulsed illumination at intensities up to 10 GW/cm2 does not induce temperature increments that could potentially damage the samples. These findings suggest that this system can be a promising and versatile approach towards ultrasensitive chiral sensing.</description>

      <title>Cavity engineered phonon-mediated superconductivity in MgB$_2$ from first principles quantum electrodynamics</title>

Abstract: Strong laser pulses can control superconductivity, inducing non-equilibrium transient pairing by leveraging strong-light matter interaction. Here we demonstrate theoretically that equilibrium ground-state phonon-mediated superconductive pairing can be affected through the vacuum fluctuating electromagnetic field in a cavity. Using the recently developed ab initio quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory approximation, we specifically investigate the phonon-mediated superconductive behavior of MgB$_2$ under different cavity setups and find that in the strong light-matter coupling regime its superconducting transition temperature can be, in principles, enhanced by $\approx 73\%$ ($\approx 40\%$) in an in-plane (out-of-plane) polarized cavity. However, in a realistic cavity, we expect the T$_{\rm{c}}$ of MgB$_2$ can increase, at most, by $5$ K via photon vacuum fluctuations. The results highlight that strong light-matter coupling in extended systems can profoundly alter material properties in a non-perturbative way by modifying their electronic structure and phononic dispersion at the same time. Our findings indicate a pathway to the experimental realization of light-controlled superconductivity in solid-state materials at equilibrium via cavity-material engineering.</description>
