      <title>A fluorescence microscopy platform for time-resolved studies of spin-correlated radical pairs in biological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The importance of spin-correlated radical pairs in biology is increasingly recognized, with roles in biological effects of weak magnetic fields and emerging quantum spin-based biomedical applications. Fluorescence microscopy offers sufficient sensitivity to study magnetic field effects on radical pair reactions in living cells, but conventional techniques cannot directly resolve their dynamics because most biologically relevant radical pairs are non-emissive. To overcome this challenge, we introduce two novel microscopy techniques: single color pump-probe (PP) and pump-field-probe (PFP) fluorescence. Here, we describe their working principles, provide their mathematical formulation, and validate both techniques through theoretical analysis and experiments on well-established flavin-based magnetic field sensitive reactions. These approaches offer a sensitive and broadly applicable platform for quantifying and visualizing the quantum spin dynamics of radical pair chemical reactions in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Objective clustering protocol for single-molecule data: A lifetime vs. intensity study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-molecule spectroscopy (SMS) is an exceptionally sensitive technique, but its inherently limited photon budget produces noisy data that can readily lead to subjective analyses, fitting errors, and reduced statistical power, obscuring true subpopulations and their dynamics. Here, we present an unbiased, objective method to cluster two-dimensional single-molecule data and demonstrate it on fluorescence lifetime-intensity correlations. The clustering method is based on Gaussian mixture modeling, with the optimal number of clusters determined through the Bayesian information criterion (BIC). The BIC score per cluster, which displays in general a non-monotonically decreasing trend, presents multiple local minima as candidate solutions for the number of fitted clusters. We also demonstrate the usefulness of statistically grouping resolved levels. The clustering protocol was benchmarked on simulated data and applied to experimental data from the Alexa Fluor 647 dye, QD 605, and the main light-harvesting complexes of plants and cyanobacteria. The combined application of grouping and clustering achieves substantial noise reduction and the identification of relevant, physically meaningful states that would typically be obscured by manual inspection.</description>

      <title>Models of topological barriers and molecular motors of bacterial DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacterial genomes are partitioned into kilobases long domains that are topologically independent from each other, meaning that change of DNA superhelicity in one domain does not propagate to neighbours. This is made possible by proteins like the LacI repressor, which behave like topological barriers and block the diffusion of torsion along the DNA. Other proteins, like DNA gyrases and RNA polymerases, called molecular motors, use the energy released by the hydrolysis of ATP to apply forces and/or torques to the DNA and modify its superhelicity. Here, we report on simulation work aimed at enlightening the interplay between DNA supercoiling, topological barriers, and molecular motors. To this end, we developed a coarse-grained Hamiltonian model of topological barriers and a model of molecular motors and investigated their properties through Brownian dynamics simulations. We discuss their influence on the contact map of a model nucleoid and the steady state values of twist and writhe in the DNA. These coarse-grained models, which are able to predict the dynamics of plectonemes depending on the position of topological barriers and molecular motors, should prove helpful to back up experimental efforts, like the development of Chromosome Conformation Capture techniques, and decipher the organisational mechanisms of bacterial chromosomes.</description>

      <title>First experimental measurements of biophotons from Astrocytes and Glioblastoma cell cultures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biophotons are non-thermal and non-bioluminescent ultraweak photon emissions, first hypothesised by Gurwitsch in 1924 as a regulatory mechanism in cell division, and then experimentally observed in living organisms. Today, two main hypotheses explain their origin: stochastic decay of excited molecules and coherent electromagnetic fields produced in biochemical processes. Recent interest focuses on the role of biophotons in cellular communication and disease monitoring. This study presents the first campaign of biophoton emission measurements from cultured astrocytes and glioblastoma cells, conducted at Fondazione Pisana per la Scienza (FPS) using two ultra-sensitive setups developed by the collaboration at the National Laboratories of Frascati (LNF-INFN) and at the University of Rome II - Tor Vergata. The statistical analyses of the data collected revealed a clear separation between cellular signals and dark noise, confirming the high sensitivity of the apparatuses. The Diffusion Entropy Analysis (DEA) was applied to the data to uncover dynamic patterns, revealing anomalous diffusion and long-range memory effects potentially related to intercellular signalling and cellular communication. These findings support the hypothesis that biophoton emissions encode rich information beyond intensity, reflecting metabolic and pathological states. The differences that emerged from the application of Diffusion Entropy Analysis to the biophotonic signals of Astrocytes and Glioblastoma are highlighted and discussed in the paper. This work lays the foundation for future studies on neuronal cultures and proposes biophoton dynamics as a promising tool for non-invasive diagnostics and cellular communication research.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Growing-Dividing Autocatalytic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formalize the structure of a class of mathematical models of growing-dividing autocatalytic systems demonstrating that self-reproduction emerges only if the system's 'growth dynamics' and 'division strategy' are mutually compatible. Using various models in this class (the linear Hinshelwood cycle and nonlinear coarse-grained models of protocells and bacteria), we show that depending on the chosen division mechanism, the same chemical system can exhibit either (i) balanced exponential growth, (ii) balanced nonexponential growth, or (iii) system death (where the system either explodes to infinity or collapses to zero in successive generations). We identify the class of division processes that lead to these three outcomes, offering strategies to stabilize or destabilize growing-dividing systems. Our work provides a geometric framework to further explore growing-dividing systems and will aid in the design of self-reproducing synthetic cells.</description>

      <title>Mapping complex optical light field distributions with single fluorescent molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single fluorescent molecules, behaving as ideal electric dipole emitters, are powerful nanoscopic probes of complex optical fields. Here, this property is exploited to precisely map the polarization and vectorial structure of tightly focused laser beams, utilizing both linear and circular polarization states. The resulting three-dimensional fluorescence excitation maps strikingly reveal the intrinsic chiral and non-chiral structure of the light field, in perfect quantitative agreement with a full vectorial wave-optical model. This precise correspondence not only enables the reliable determination of absolute molecular orientations but also allows for the accurate characterization of the field's properties. These results fundamentally advance our understanding of light-matter interaction at the single-molecule level and open new avenues for characterizing complex light fields, with broad applications in super-resolution microscopy and nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Design principles of the cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cytotoxic T lymphocytes eliminate infected or malignant cells, safeguarding surrounding tissues. Although experimental and systems-immunology studies have cataloged many molecular and cellular actors involved in an immune response, the design principles governing how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses emerge from cellular decision-making remain elusive. Here, we recast the T-cell response as a feedback-controlled program, wherein the rates of activation, proliferation, differentiation and death are regulated through antigenic, pro- and anti-inflammatory cues. By exploring a broad class of feedback-controller designs as potential immune programs, we demonstrate how the speed and magnitude of T-cell responses emerge from optimizing signal-feedback to protect against diverse infection settings. We recover an inherent trade-off: infection clearance at the cost of immunopathology. We show how this trade-off is encoded into the logic of T-cell responses by hierarchical sensitivity to different immune signals. Notably, we find that designs that balance harm from acute infections and autoimmunity produce immune responses consistent with experimentally observed patterns of T-cell effector expansion in mice. Extending our model to immune-based T-cell therapies for cancer tumors, we identify a trade-off between the affinity for tumor antigens ("quality") and the abundance ("quantity") of infused T-cells necessary for effective treatment. Finally, we show how therapeutic efficacy can be improved by targeted genetic perturbations to T-cells. Our findings offer a unified control-logic for cytotoxic T-cell responses and point to specific regulatory programs that can be engineered for more robust T-cell therapies.</description>

      <title>ChromRec: Self-Assembly of Nucleosomes Driven by Directional Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center "recognition" potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question to be addressed. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.</description>
