      <title>Societal and scientific impact of policy research: A large-scale empirical study of some explanatory factors using Altmetric and Overton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates how scientific research influences policymaking by analyzing citations of research articles in policy documents (policy impact) for nearly 125,000 articles across 434 public policy journals. We reveal distinct citation patterns between policymakers and other stakeholders like researchers, journalists, and the public. News and blog mentions, social media engagement, and open access publications (excluding fully open access) significantly increase the likelihood of a research article being cited in policy documents. Conversely, articles locked behind paywalls and those published under the full open access model (based on Altmetric data) have a lower chance of being policy-cited. Publication year and policy type show no significant influence. Our findings emphasize the crucial role of science communication channels like news media and social media in bridging the gap between research and policy. Interestingly, academic citations hold a weaker influence on policy citations compared to news mentions, suggesting a potential disconnect between how researchers reference research and how policymakers utilize it. This highlights the need for improved communication strategies to ensure research informs policy decisions more effectively. This study provides valuable insights for researchers, policymakers, and science communicators. Researchers can tailor their dissemination efforts to reach policymakers through media channels. Policymakers can leverage these findings to identify research with higher policy relevance. Science communicators can play a critical role in translating research for policymakers and fostering dialogue between the scientific and policymaking communities.</description>

      <title>Nurses as agents for achieving Environmentally Sustainable Health Systems: A bibliometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Objective: To analyze the current scientific knowledge and research lines focused on environmentally sustainable health systems, including the role of nurses. Background: There seem to be differences between creating interventions focused on environmentally sustainable health systems, including nurses, and the scarcity of research on this topic, framed on the Sustainable Development Goals. Methods: A bibliometric analysis was carried out, via three databases (Web of Science, Scopus, and Pubmed), and the guideline recommendations were followed to select bibliometric data. Results: The search resulted in 159 publications, significantly increasing the trends from 2017 to 2021 (p=0.028). The most relevant countries in this area were the United States of America, the United Kingdom, and Sweden. Also, the top articles were from relevant journals, indexed in Journal Citation Report, and the first and the second quartile linked to the nursing field and citations (p&lt;0.001). Conclusion: Education is key to achieving environmentally sustainable health systems via institutions and policies. Implications for nursing management: There is a lack of experimental data and policies on achieving or maintaining environmentally sustainable health care systems, indicating that nurses have an important role and should be consulted and included in decision-making policies regarding sustainability in the healthcare systems.</description>

      <title>BrainKnow -- Extracting, Linking, and Associating Neuroscience Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The vast accumulation of neuroscience knowledge presents a challenge for researchers to timely and accurately locate the specific information they require. Constructing a knowledge engine that automatically extracts and organizes information from academic papers can provide researchers with timely and accurate informational services. We present the Brain Knowledge Engine (BrainKnow), which extracts and integrates neuroscience knowledge from published papers from PubMed. BrainKnow comprises a substantial repository, containing 3,626,931 relations spanning a broad spectrum of 37,011 neuroscience concepts extracted from 1817744 articles. The relations in BrainKnow can be accessed and navigated through a user-friendly web interface. Additionally, BrainKnow employs graph network algorithms for the recommendation and visualization of knowledge. BrainKnow is capable of automatic real-time updates. BrainKnow represents the first neuroscience knowledge graph that not only integrates knowledge in-depth but also facilitates fully automated updates.</description>
