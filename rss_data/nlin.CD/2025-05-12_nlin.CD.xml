      <title>Spiral defect chaos with intermittency increases mean termination time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac models are examples of excitable systems and can support stable spiral waves. For certain parameter values, however, these spiral waves can become unstable, resulting in spiral defect chaos (SDC), characterized by the continuous creation and annihilation of spiral waves and thought to underlie atrial fibrillation. During SDC, the number of spiral waves fluctuates and eventually drops to zero, marking the termination of activity. In this work, we demonstrate that varying a single parameter allows the system to transition from SDC to a single spiral wave, passing through an intermediate regime of intermittency. In this intermittent dynamics, intervals of SDC are sandwiched between non-SDC intervals during which the number of spiral waves remains small and constant. We quantify this intermittency and show that the mean termination time increases significantly as the control parameter approaches values for which a single spiral wave is stable. In addition, we find that it is also possible to have intermittently present quasi-stable spiral waves in part of the computational domain while the remainder of the domain exhibits SDC. Our results may have implications for clinical atrial fibrillation, which often shows intermittency, switching back-and-forth between fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm.</description>

      <title>Locally Optimal Percolation for Network Resilience Dismantling via Fiedler Vector Gradient Iterative Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network resilience, dynamically quantified by the Fiedler value (\(\lambda_2\),the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix) ensures functional stability and efficient energy transmission, yet also introduces vulnerabilities that dismantling the resilience of the network can cause a functional breakdown of the network. However, traditional percolation strategies focused on structural attacks often fail to effectively affect resilience and lack universal applicability. Here, we employ a Laplacian spectral perturbation approach to systematically identify and remove edges critical to resilience. We derive the sensitivity of \(\lambda_2\) to topological changes and employ the gradient of Fiedler vector to measure each edge's contribution of resilience, revealing an intrinsic relationship to community partition. Accordingly, we propose the Fiedler Gradient Iterative Attack (FGIA) algorithm, which constructs locally optimal edge removal sequences to maximize \(\lambda_2\) degradation with significantly lower computational cost than brute-force methods. Our results offer a rigorous approach for inducing controlled resilience collapse, with potential applications in neuroscience and critical infrastructure protection.</description>

      <title>On Optimal Control of a Genotype-Structured Prey-Predator System for Ecological Rescue and Oscillation Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolutionary changes impacts interactions among populations and can disrupt ecosystems by driving extinctions or by collapsing population oscillations, posing significant challenges to biodiversity conservation. This study addresses the ecological rescue of a predator population threatened by a mutant prey population using optimal control method. To study this, we proposed a model which incorporates genotypically structured prey comprising of wild-type, heterozygous and mutant prey types and predator population. We proved that this model has both local and global existence and uniqueness of solutions ensuring the model robustness. Then, we applied optimal control method along with Pontryagin Maximum Principle by incorporating a control input in the model to minimize the mutant population and subsequently to stabilize the ecosystem. The numerical results clearly reveal that the undesired dynamics of the model can be controlled showing the suppression of the mutant, rescues the predator, and restores the oscillatory dynamics of the system. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of the control strategy and provide a mathematical framework for managing such ecological disruptions</description>

      <title>Geometry of Almost-Conserved Quantities in Symplectic Maps. Part I: Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noether's theorem, which connects continuous symmetries to exact conservation laws, remains one of the most fundamental principles in physics and dynamical systems. In this work, we draw a conceptual parallel between two paradigms: the emergence of exact invariants from continuous symmetries, and the appearance of approximate invariants from discrete symmetries associated with reversibility in symplectic maps. We demonstrate that by constructing approximating functions that preserve these discrete symmetries order by order, one can systematically uncover hidden structures, closely echoing Noether's framework. The resulting functions serve not only as diagnostic tools but also as compact representations of near-integrable behavior.
  The first article establishes the formal foundations of the method. Using the symmetric form of the map as a flexible test case, we benchmark the perturbative construction against established techniques, including the Lie algebra method for twist coefficients. To resolve the inherent ambiguity in the perturbation series, we introduce an averaging procedure that naturally leads to a resonant theory -- capable of treating rational rotation numbers and small-denominator divergences. This enables an accurate and structured description of low-order resonances, including singular and non-singular features in the quadratic and cubic H\'enon maps. The approach is systematic, requiring only linear algebra and integrals of elementary functions, yet it yields results in striking agreement with both theory and numerical experiment. We conclude by outlining extensions to more general maps and discussing implications for stability estimates in practical systems such as particle accelerators.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Almost-Conserved Quantities in Symplectic Maps. Part II: Recovery of approximate invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noether's theorem, which connects continuous symmetries to exact conservation laws, remains one of the most fundamental principles in physics and dynamical systems. In this work, we draw a conceptual parallel between two paradigms: the emergence of exact invariants from continuous symmetries, and the appearance of approximate invariants from discrete symmetries associated with reversibility in symplectic maps. We demonstrate that by constructing approximating functions that preserve these discrete symmetries order by order, one can systematically uncover hidden structures, closely echoing Noether's framework. The resulting functions serve not only as diagnostic tools but also as compact representations of near-integrable behavior.
  The second article applies the method to global dynamics, with a focus on large-amplitude motion and chaotic systems. We demonstrate that the approximate invariants, once averaged, accurately capture the structure of resonances and the boundaries of stability regions. We also explore the recovery of exact invariants in integrable cases, showing that the method reproduces the correct behavior when such structure is present. A single unified function, derived from the map coefficients, yields phase portraits, rotation numbers, and tune footprints that closely match numerical tracking across wide parameter ranges. Comparisons with the Square Matrix method reveal that while both approaches satisfy local constraints, our technique provides greater accuracy and robustness in resonant and strongly nonlinear regimes. These results highlight the method's practical power and broad relevance, offering a compact, analytic framework for organizing nonlinear dynamics in symplectic maps with direct applications to beam physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Almost-Conserved Quantities in Symplectic Maps. Part III: Approximate Invariants in Nonlinear Accelerator Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a perturbative method for constructing approximate invariants of motion directly from the equations of discrete-time symplectic systems. This framework offers a natural nonlinear extension of the classic Courant-Snyder (CS) theory -- a foundational cornerstone in accelerator physics now spanning seven decades and historically focused on linear phenomena. The original CS formalism emerged under conditions where nonlinearities were weak, design goals favored linear motion, and analytical tools -- such as the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory -- had not yet been fully developed. While various normal form methods have been proposed to treat near-integrable dynamics, the approach introduced here stands out for its conceptual transparency, minimal computational overhead, and direct applicability to realistic systems. We demonstrate its power and versatility by applying it to several operational accelerator configurations at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FermiLab), illustrating how the method enables fast, interpretable diagnostics of nonlinear behavior across a broad range of machine conditions.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Propagation for Learning in Lagrangian Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for training dynamical systems governed by Lagrangian mechanics using Equilibrium Propagation. Our approach extends Equilibrium Propagation -- initially developed for energy-based models -- to dynamical trajectories by leveraging the principle of action extremization. Training is achieved by gently nudging trajectories toward desired targets and measuring how the variables conjugate to the parameters to be trained respond. This method is particularly suited to systems with periodic boundary conditions or fixed initial and final states, enabling efficient parameter updates without requiring explicit backpropagation through time. In the case of periodic boundary conditions, this approach yields the semiclassical limit of Quantum Equilibrium Propagation. Applications to systems with dissipation are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Elongation of material lines and vortices by Euler flows on two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the influence of the differential geometry of the flow domain on the motion of fluids on two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, particularly on the elongation of material lines and vortices. We derive a formula for the second order time derivative of the square of the distance between close fluid particles and show that a curvature term appears. The elongation of a material line is accelerated by negative curvature. The use of this expression extends Haller's definition of hyperbolic domains to flows on curved surfaces. The need to consider curvature effects is illustrated by three examples. The example of a curved two-dimensional torus implies that the filamentation of vortices can be triggered by negative curvature.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of time-delayed embeddings with self-intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study regularity of the time-delayed coordinate maps \[\phi_{h,k}(x) = (h(x), h(Tx), \ldots, h(T^{k-1}x))\] for a diffeomorphism $T$ of a compact manifold $M$ and smooth observables $h$ on $M$. Takens' embedding theorem shows that if $k &gt; 2\dim M$, then $\phi_{h,k}$ is an embedding for typical $h$. We consider the probabilistic case, where for a given probability measure $\mu$ on $M$ one allows self-intersections in the time-delayed embedding to occur along a zero-measure set. We show that if $k \geq \dim M$ and $k &gt; \dim_H(\text{supp} \mu)$, then for a typical observable, $\phi_{h,k}$ is injective on a full-measure set with a pointwise Lipschitz inverse. If moreover $k &gt; \dim M$, then $\phi_{h,k}$ is a local diffeomorphism at almost every point. As an application, we show that if $k &gt; \dim M$, then the Lyapunov exponents of the original system can be approximated with arbitrary precision by almost every orbit in the time-delayed model of the system. We also give almost sure pointwise bounds on the prediction error and provide a non-dynamical analogue of the main result, which can be seen as a probabilistic version of Whitney's embedding theorem.</description>

      <title>Discerning media bias within a network of political allies: an analytic condition for disruption by partisans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An individual's opinion concerning political bias in the media is shaped by exogenous factors (independent analysis of media outputs) and endogenous factors (social activity, e.g. peer pressure by political allies and opponents in a network). Previous numerical studies show, that persuadable agents in allies-only networks are disrupted from asymptotically learning the intrinsic bias of a media organization, when the network is populated by one or more obdurate agents (partisans), who are not persuadable themselves but exert peer pressure on other agents. Some persuadable agents asymptotically learn a false bias, while others vacillate indefinitely between a false bias and the true bias, a phenomenon called turbulent nonconvergence which also emerges in opponents-only and mixed networks without partisans. Here we derive an analytic instability condition, which demarcates turbulent nonconvergence from asymptotic learning as a function of key network properties, for an idealized model of media bias featuring a biased coin. The condition is verified with Monte Carlo simulations as a function of network size, sparsity, and partisan fraction. It is derived in a probabilistic framework, where an agent's opinion is uncertain and is described by a probability density function, which is multimodal in general, generalizing previous studies which assume that an agent's opinion is certain (i.e. described by one number). The results and their social implications are interpreted briefly in terms of the social science theory of structural balance.</description>

Abstract: We will study the relationship between two well-known theories, genetic evolution and random matrix theory in the context of many-body systems. It is suggested that genetic evolution can be described by a random matrix theory with statistical distribution in which mutation acts as a Gross-Witten-Wadia phase transition.</description>

      <title>Chaotic-Integrable Transition for Disordered Orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have drawn connections between the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the multi-orbit Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, emphasizing their similarities and differences regarding chaotic behaviors. The features of the spectral form factor, such as the dip-ramp-plateau structure and the adjacent gap ratio, indicate chaos in the disordered orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. One significant conclusion is that the plateau value of the out-of-time-order correlator, whether in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with two- or four-body interactions, or a disorder-free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, does not effectively differentiate between integrable and chaotic phases in many-body systems. This observation suggests a limitation in using out-of-time-order correlator plateau values as a diagnostic tool for chaos. Our exploration of these ideas provides a deeper understanding of how chaos arises in non-Fermi liquid systems and the tools we use to study it. It opens the door to further questions, particularly about whether there are more effective ways to distinguish between chaotic and integrable phases in these complex systems.</description>
