      <title>MOND as a transformation between non-inertial reference frames via Sciama's interpretation of Mach's Principle</title>

Abstract: Moderhai Milgrom's Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) correction to Newtonian gravity or inertia is shown to be equivalent to a more fundamental formulation considering a non-inertial local reference frame and the fixed background of the observable universe, in the spirit of Mach's principle. Both Newton's gravitational constant $G\sim c^2/(M_u/R_u)$ and Milgrom's MOND acceleration scale constant $a_0\sim GM_u/R_u^2$ are replaced by two varying, measurable, and cosmological quantities determined by the causally connected mass and size of the universe. They arise from an inverse and an inverse squared distance scalar fields of matter density, respectively. This Machian interpretation of MOND is invariant under global rescalings of mass, length, and time across all regimes and is free from fundamental constants and free parameters, except for the speed of light. Machian MOND satisfies the fundamental consequences of Mach's principle not featured in Newton's and Einstein's theories: the decrease of inertia of a body when masses are removed from its neighborhood, and in the absence of a cosmic background, rotational motion is undefined up to the speed of light. Consequently, Machian MOND provides the necessary limiting behavior to which any phenomenological non-linear theory of modified inertia or gravity that incorporates Mach's principle, in agreement with galaxy rotation curves, should reduce as an effective approximation.</description>

      <title>Quantum entropy and cardinality of the rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12972v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare two methods for evaluating the cardinality of the Cartesian product $N \times N$ of the set of natural numbers $N$. The first is used to explain the thermodynamics of black body radiation by using convergent functions on $N \times N$. The cardinality of $N \times N$ enters through the partition function, internal energy and entropy for every macrostate given by a normal mode of electromagnetic wave. Here, $N \times N$ is assigned a greater cardinality than $N$. The second method was devised in analysis to count the rational numbers by using divergent functions on $N \times N$. Here, $N \times N$ is not assigned a greater cardinality than $N$. In this article, we show that the experimentally confirmed first approach is mathematically more consistent with the definition of the real line and foundations of topology. It also provides a quantitative measure of the cardinality of $N \times N$ relative to that of N. Similar arguments show that the set of rational numbers is not countable. This article suggests that the axiom of choice is a more rigorous technique to prove the existence theorems for connection and metric on the spacetime manifold than the usual application of second-countability.</description>
