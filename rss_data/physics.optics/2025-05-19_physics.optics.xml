      <title>Plasmonic Nanoparticle-in-nanoslit Antenna as Independently Tunable Dual-Resonant Systems for Efficient Frequency Upconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual-band plasmonic nanoantennas, exhibiting two widely separated user-defined resonances, are fundamental building blocks for the investigation and optimization of plasmon-enhanced optical phenomena, including photoluminescence, Raman scattering, and various nonlinear effects such as harmonic generation or sum-frequency generation, parametric down-conversion, etc. The nanoparticle-in-slit (NPiS) or nanoparticle-in-groove (NPiG) is a recently proposed dual-band antenna with independently tunable resonances at mid-infrared and visible wavelengths. It was used to enhance the corresponding sum- and difference-frequency generation processes from optimally located molecules by an estimated $10^{13}$-fold. However, the theoretical understanding of such structures and their eigenmodes remains poor, hindering further optimization and limiting broader applications. Here, we explore a diverse range of nanocavity-like quasi-normal modes (QNMs) supported by NPiS structures, examining the contributions of both their near-field (i.e., giant photonic density of states) and far-field (i.e., spatial radiation patterns) characteristics to frequency upconversion. We identify methods for independently tuning the visible and mid-infrared resonances while conserving a good mode overlap in the near field, which is essential for efficient nonlinear processes. Moreover, through mode analysis, we unveil an experimentally unexplored fundamental resonance with greater field enhancement and much-improved mode overlap with the mid-infrared field, which could, in principle, further boost the mid-infrared upconversion efficiency by 5-fold compared to existing results. This work helps to rationalize and optimize the enhancement of nonlinear effects across a wide spectral range using a flexible and experimentally attractive nanoplasmonic platform.</description>

      <title>Low-loss Sb$_2$S$_3$ Optical Phase Shifter Enabled by Optimizing Sputtering Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10752v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By quantitatively evaluating the atomic concentrations of sputtered Sb$_2$S$_3$ films with different sputtering powers and Ar flows, we reveal that a sputtered Sb$_2$S$_3$ film becomes close to the stoichiometric composition as the sputtering power and Ar flow decrease. We characterize the optical properties of Sb$_2$S$_3$ and show that the lower sputtering power leads to a better figure of merit of Sb$_2$S$_3$ as an optical phase shifter in the near infrared (NIR) range. Based on these results, we achieve a loss per phase shift of 0.33 dB/$\pi$ at a wavelength of 1.55 $\mu$m, one of the lowest losses among Sb$_2$S$_3$ phase shifters in the NIR range.</description>

      <title>Single Vanadium Dioxide Nanoparticle-Enabled Plasmonic switch with Thermal and Electronic Reconfigurability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an integrated switch that combines plasmonic and neuromorphic technologies with a single sub-stoichiometric VO2-x nanoparticle. The presented device acts as a versatile plasmonic switch with dual thermal and electrical reconfigurability leveraging the near-room temperature phase transition of the VO2-x nanoparticles combined with the rapid phase recovery to drive the device. The change in both the optical and electrical properties of the VO2-x nanoparticle enables simultaneous optical and electrical readouts making the plasmonic device suitable as a phase change memory cell which is crucial in the convergence of computing and communication technologies. Our demonstration of reversible electrical switching, evidenced by a 6dB modulation depth and concurrent optical and electrical outputs, signifies a major stride in merging electronic and photonic functionalities within phase-change material devices. This novel strategy not only harmonizes optical communication with electronic computing but also advances the development of sophisticated integrated neuromorphic devices.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the advantage of quantum correlation microscopy using arrays of single-photon detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum correlation microscopy is an emerging technique for improving optical resolution. By taking advantage of the quantum statistics from single-photon fluorophores, more information about the emitters (including number and location) is obtained compared with classical microscopy. Although it is known that the resolution can be improved by increasing detector numbers, as well as using quantum correlation, the quantitative relationship between these two approaches is not immediately clear. Here we explore widefield quantum correlation microscopy using arrays of single-photon detectors. We explicitly compare the use of $N$ detectors used in photon counting mode vs $N/2$ detectors used to measure quantum correlations. i.e., where there are $N/2$ Hanbury Brown and Twiss systems, using the same $N$ detectors, on randomly generated two-emitter systems. We find regimes where $N/2$ Hanbury Brown and Twiss detectors provide improved localisation compared to $N$ photon counting detectors, as a function of emitter position and number of photons sampled.</description>

      <title>Multi-channel electrically tunable varifocal metalens with compact multilayer polarization-dependent metasurfaces and liquid crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an essential module of optical systems, varifocal lens usually consists of multiple mechanically moving lenses along the optical axis. The recent development of metasurfaces with tunable functionalities holds the promise of miniaturizing varifocal lens. However, existing varifocal metalenses are hard to combine electrical tunability with scalable number and range of focal lengths, thus limiting the practical applications. Our previous work shows that the electrically tunable channels could be increased to 2N by cascading N polarization-dependent metasurfaces with liquid crystals (LCs). Here, we demonstrated a compact eight-channel electrically tunable varifocal metalens with three single-layer polarization-multiplexed bi-focal metalens and three LC cells. The total thickness of the device is ~6 mm, while the focal lengths could be switched among eight values within the range of 3.6 to 9.6 mm. The scheme is scalable in number and range of focal lengths and readily for further miniaturization. We believe that our proposal would open new possibilities of miniaturized imaging systems, AR/VR displays, LiDAR, etc.</description>

      <title>Purcell enhanced and tunable single-photon emission at telecom wavelengths from InAs quantum dots in circular photonic crystal resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Embedding semiconductor quantum dots into bullseye resonators has significantly advanced the development of bright telecom quantum light sources for fiber-based quantum networks. To further improve the device flexibility and stability, the bullseye approach should be combined with a pin diode structure to enable Stark tuning, deterministic charging, and enhanced coherence. In this work, we fabricate and characterize photonic structures incorporating hole gratings that efficiently support charge carrier transport while maintaining excellent optical performance. We report bright, Purcell-enhanced single-photon emission in the telecom C-band under above-band and phonon-assisted excitation. Additionally, we present electrically contacted resonators, demonstrating wide range tuneability of quantum dot transitions in the telecom O-band. These results mark significant steps toward scalable and tunable quantum light sources for real-world quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Directional transport and nonlinear localization of light in a one-dimensional driven-dissipative photonic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic lattices facilitate band structure engineering, supporting both localized and extended modes through their geometric design. However, greater control over these modes can be achieved by taking advantage of the interference effect between external drives with precisely tuned phases and photonic modes within the lattice. In this work, we build on this principle to demonstrate optical switching, directed light propagation and site-specific localization in a one-dimensional photonic lattice of coupled microresonators by resonantly driving the system with a coherent field of controlled phase. Importantly, our experimental results provide direct evidence that increased driving power acts as a tuning parameter enabling nonlinear localization at frequencies previously inaccessible in the linear regime. These findings open new avenues for controlling light propagation and localization in lattices with more elaborate band structures.</description>

      <title>Wave turbulence, thermalization and multimode locking in optical fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive overview of recent advances in theory and experiments on complex light propagation phenomena in nonlinear multimode fibers. On the basis of the wave turbulence theory, we derive kinetic equations describing the out-of-equilibrium process of optical thermalization toward the Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) equilibrium distribution. Our theory explains the effect of beam self-cleaning (BSC) in graded-index (GRIN) fibers, whereby a speckled beam transforms into a bell-shaped beam at the fiber output. We theoretically explore the role of random refractive index fluctuations along the fiber, and show how these imperfections can assist the observation of BSC in a practical experimental setting. This conclusion is supported by the derivation of wave turbulence kinetic equations that account for the presence of a time-dependent disorder (random mode coupling). The kinetic theory reveals that a weak disorder accelerates the rate of RJ thermalization and condensation. On the other hand, although strong disorder is expected to suppress wave condensation, the kinetic equation reveals that an out-of-equilibrium process of condensation and RJ thermalization can still occur. The kinetic equations are validated by numerical simulations of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation. We outline a series of recent experiments, which permit to confirm the statistical mechanics approach for describing beam propagation and thermalization. For example, we highlight the demonstration of entropy growth, and point out that there are inherent limits to peak-power scaling in multimode fiber lasers. We conclude by pointing out the experimental observation that BSC is accompanied by an effect of modal phase-locking. From the one hand this explains the observed preservation of the spatial coherence of the beam, but also it points to the need of extending current descriptions in future research.</description>

      <title>Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry with trapped polariton condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the indistinguishability of polaritons in optically trapped Bose Einstein condensates by implementing Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometry and test the limitations of two-polariton interference in the coherent, limit-cycle and thermal statistical regimes. We observe that the HOM dynamics of a circularly polarized condensate follows the condensate coherence time with the characteristic HOM-dip approaching the classical limit. Linearly polarized condensates exhibit a combined effect of polariton bunching and two-polariton interference. Under elliptically polarized excitation, the temporal evolution of the spinor condensate results in the revival of the HOM-dip at the spinor Larmor precession frequency.</description>

      <title>Compact, Large-Scale Photonic Neurons by Modulation-and-Weight Microring Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11369v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabrication imperfections, spatial constraints, and prohibitive costs collectively impede the scalability of neuromorphic photonics. In this work, we introduce a large-scale, compact photonic neuron in which each microring performs modulation and weighting simultaneously. This dual functionality is realized by leveraging both the carrier effect and thermal tunability, thereby merging modulation and weighting to conserve on-chip area, enhancing tuning efficiency, and capitalizing on wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) for scalable implementations. In addition, we investigated a range of configurations for the proposed neuron to better tailor its behavior to various computational tasks. To illustrate the adaptability of the system's tasks, we explore both spatial and temporal domains, highlighting its versatility through two representative tasks: image processing and, for the first time, financial time series analysis, which represents a promising new frontier for neuromorphic photonics. These findings underscore the considerable promise of photonic computing in addressing a breadth of real-world challenges, particularly under escalating demands for both scalability and flexibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental imaging flow cytometer using a 1 {\mu}s temporal resolution event-based CMOS camera, with data processed by adaptive feedforward and recurrent spiking neural networks. Our study classifies PMMA particles (12, 16, 20 {\mu}m) flowing at 0.7 m/s in a microfluidic channel. Processing of experimental data highlighted that spiking recurrent networks, including LSTM and GRU models, achieved 98.4% accuracy by leveraging temporal dependencies. Additionally, adaptation mechanisms in lightweight feedforward spiking networks improved accuracy by 4.3%. This work outlines a technological roadmap for neuromorphic-assisted biomedical applications, enhancing classification performance while maintaining low latency and sparsity.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Integrated Photonic Chips as Dual-Purpose Neuromorphic Accelerators and Physical Unclonable Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we experimentally validate the dual use of a reconfigurable photonic integrated mesh as a neuromorphic accelerator, targeting signal equalization, and as a physical unclonable function offering authentication at the hardware level. The processing node is an optical spectrum slicing self-coherent transceiver targeting the mitigation of dispersion impairments of an intensity detected QPSK signal, after 25 km of transmission at 32 Gbaud. Unavoidable fabrication related imperfections of the nodes, such as waveguide roughness, can act as fingerprints of the device, and, during neuromorphic processing, result in unique weights at the digital back-end during signal equalization. Extracted security metrics offer low false positive/negative probability for the generated responses, confirming un-clonability, whereas bit-error-ratio for the QPSK equalization task was always below the hardware forward error correction limit. The experimental results substantiate the capability of the proposed scheme to simultaneously act as an accelerator and as a security token.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study superconductivitiy under light irradiation based on the Floquet-Magnus expansion in the high-frequency regime. We find that, in spin-singlet superconductors with spin-orbit coupling, triplet superconductivity can be induced in the first-order perturbation for dynamical gap functions and the second-order perturbation for static gap functions. We also show that, in unitary triplet superconductors with altermagnetism, nonunitary triplet superconductivity can emerge in the firstorder perturbation for dynamical gap function and in the second-order perturbation for static gap functions. These results indicate optical generation and control of triplet superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Is diamagnetism really acausal?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diamagnetism, in which the magnetisation in a medium opposes the direction of an applied magnetic field, is a weak but familiar effect in a wide class of materials. Being weak it is also a linear response to any applied field. The problem is that the existence of diamagnetism is in direct conflict with the requirements of causality as embodied in the familiar Kramers-Kronig relations. Nature does not care about our confusion and diamagnetism exists and physics is constrained by the requirements of causality (that effect cannot precede its cause). This puzzle has received intermittent attention from time to time, with a variety of arguments made to resolve the paradox. None of these, no matter how plausible, reveal the mechanism that resolves the existence of diamagnetism without sacrificing causality. The full resolution is presented in this letter.</description>

      <title>Flat band mediated photon-photon interactions in 2D waveguide QED networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a Lieb lattice of quantum emitters coupled to a two-dimensional waveguide network and demonstrate that this system supports an energetically isolated flat band, enabling localization despite the presence of long-range photon-mediated couplings. We then explore the two-excitation dynamics in both the softcore and hardcore interaction regimes, which arise from the nonlinearity of the emitters. In the softcore regime, we observe interaction-induced photon transport within the flat band, mediated by the formation of bound photon pairs. In the hardcore regime, corresponding to the two-level atom limit, we instead find the emergence of metastable exciton-like dressed states involving both flat and dispersive bands. Our findings highlight how the interplay between the collective behavior of emitters and effective photon-photon interactions can provide a platform for studying highly correlated photonic states in flat-band systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced energy gain through higher-order resonances during direct laser acceleration with superluminal phase velocity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10669v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-high intensity laser-plasma interactions can produce ultra-relativistic electrons via direct laser acceleration, assisted by quasi-static plasma magnetic and electric fields. These fields transversely confine electron motion and induce betatron oscillations. The net energy gain is strongly influenced by the interplay between two frequencies: the betatron frequency and the frequency of laser field oscillations experienced by the electron. Prior work has shown that energy gain is enabled by a resonance between the betatron oscillations and the oscillations of the laser field. In particular, higher-order resonances occur when the laser field completes multiple cycles during one betatron oscillation, allowing additional regimes of energy transfer beyond the fundamental (betatron) resonance. In this work, we demonstrate that such resonances become particularly effective when the laser's phase velocity is superluminal. Although the two frequencies generally evolve differently with increasing electron energy, which leads to detuning, a superluminal phase velocity introduces a non-monotonic frequency ratio with a global minimum. This minimum allows sustained frequency matching over a broad energy range, thereby enabling enhanced energy gain. As the phase velocity increases, the betatron resonance becomes ineffective due to premature frequency detuning. At the same time, higher-order resonances become increasingly effective, emerging as the dominant mechanisms for enhanced energy gain in this regime of direct laser acceleration.</description>

      <title>New generation of cavity microscope for quantum simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design and assembly of a cavity microscope for quantum simulations with ultracold atoms. The system integrates a high-finesse optical cavity with a pair of high-numerical aperture lenses sharing a common optical axis, enabling simultaneous operation with light close-to-atomic resonance. The system keeps the advantages of a rigid, single-block structure holding the lenses and cavity together, and improves over existing designs by using most of the solid angle left free by the cavity mode for imaging and atomic manipulation purposes. The cavity has a length of $19.786$mm, a finesse of $2.35\times 10^4$ and operates $214\mu\text{m}$ away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of $0.52$ each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulation of squeezed states via enhanced bosonic encoding in a superconducting quantum processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a fully digital approach for simulating single-mode squeezed states on a superconducting quantum processor using an enhanced bosonic encoding strategy. By mapping up to 2^{n} photonic Fock states onto n qubits, our framework leverages Gray-code-based encodings to reduce gate overhead compared to conventional one-hot or binary mappings. We further optimize resource usage by restricting the simulation on Fock states with even number of photons only, effectively doubling the range of photon numbers that can be represented for a given number of qubits. To overcome noise and finite coherence in current hardware, we employ a variational quantum simulation protocol, which adapts shallow, parameterized circuits through iterative optimization. Implemented on the Zuchongzhi-2 superconducting platform, our method demonstrates squeezed-state dynamics across a parameter sweep from vacuum state preparation (r=0) to squeezing levels exceeding the Fock space truncation limit (r&gt;1.63). Experimental results, corroborated by quantum state tomography and Wigner-function analysis, confirm high-fidelity state preparation and demonstrate the potential of Gray-code-inspired techniques for realizing continuous-variable physics on near-term, qubit-based quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality-dependent electronic and vibrational dynamics in low-dimensional organic-inorganic tin halides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photo-induced dynamics of electronic processes in materials are driven by the coupling between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. Here we construct 1D and 2D organic-inorganic tin halides to investigate the functional role of dimensionality to exciton-phonon coupling (EPC) and exciton self-trapping. The results show that the 1D system has strong EPC leading to excitation-independent self-trapped exciton (STE) emission, while the 2D system exhibits over ten times weaker EPC resulting in free exciton emission. By performing femtosecond transient absorption experiments, we directly resolve the room-temperature vibrational wavepackets in the 1D system, some of which propagate along the STE potential energy surface. A combination of wagging and asymmetric stretching motions (~106 cm-1) in tin iodide is identified as such a mode inducing exciton self-trapping. While no room-temperature wavepackets are observed in the 2D system. These findings uncover the interplay between the dimensionality-dependent EPC and electronic/nuclear dynamics, offering constructive guidance to develop multifunctional organic-inorganic metal halides.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that any $N$-dimensional unitary matrix can be realized using a finite sequence of concatenated identical multiport beamsplitters. Our construction is based on a Lie group theorem and is explicitly demonstrated for the two- and three-dimensional cases. We further establish that the widely used Clements decomposition naturally arises as a special case of this general framework. As an application, we present a reconfigurable linear optical circuit that implements a three-dimensional unitary emerging in the unambiguous discrimination of two nonorthogonal qubit states.</description>

Abstract: We have designed, fabricated and tested a lens with chromatic aberration coefficient (Cc) of 1.0 mm, a 4.0 mm pole-gap and 2.0 mm bore that is wide enough to accommodate an anti-contamination system and an objective aperture. This lens extends the temporal-coherence envelope of the electron microscope beyond 2 Angstrom, using a low-cost Schottky FEG. We hope that this lens design can be used to improve all 100 keV electron microscopes designed for single-particle electron cryomicroscopy (cryoEM).</description>

      <title>Accessing different higher-order modes with nonlinear modal energy transfer under simple realistic tuning of initial conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial conditions in multi-mode fibers pumped by ultrashort laser pulses strongly determine the following nonlinear optical interactions. In this work we firstly compare the detailed spatial mode content of simple initial conditions, transverse offset and tilt. We then show how those initial conditions can both be used to achieve a nonlinear modal energy transfer into higher-order spatial modes of a model graded-index fiber, with their own slight differences and advantages. Going beyond purely spatial initial conditions, we introduce nonlinear modal energy transfer results using spatial chirp at the input facet, whereby the different temporal envelopes of the spatial modes allow for tuning the nonlinear modal energy transfer process. Our results open up investigations into higher-dimensional tuning of nonlinear processes in multi-mode fibers using initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Observation of optical vortex generation via magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exploration of physics involving orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, first recognized in 1992, is essential for deepening our understanding of the interaction between light and matter and that opens up new applications. In systems with rotational symmetry, it is known that OAM can be exchanged between light and matter. One of the most common applications of such a phenomenon is manipulating the optical OAM through the exchange of OAM between light and a nematic liquid crystal-based spatial light modulator (SLM). It is already being used as a tool in many studies related to the optical OAM. However, the operation bandwidth is limited by the response speed 100 Hz of the liquid crystal, which hinders the applications of the optical OAM to spatial division multiplexing, quantum communication, and optical microscopy. The generation of optical vortex beams with the optical OAM in inelastic scattering by elementary excitations with gigahertz-order resonance may solve this problem, although it has not been studied so far. Here, we demonstrate the generation of the optical vortex beams using Brillouin light scattering by magnons without phase singularities. We observe scattering rules in the Brillouin light scattering which can be explained by conservation of total angular momentum including spins and orbits with photons and magnons. This work serves as a starting point for research into the interaction between optical vertices and magnons. It opens up devices with the novel mechanism of optical OAM generation together with high operation bandwidth.</description>

      <title>Non-monotonic radiative heat transfer in the transition from far field to near field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present high precision measurements of the radiative heat transfer of a glass microsphere immersed in a thermal bath in vacuum facing three different planar substrates (SiO2, SiC and Au), which exhibit very different optical behaviors in the infrared region. Using a thermoresistive probe on a cantilever, we show the nonmonotonic behavior of the radiative flux between the microsphere and its environment when the microsphere is brought closer to the substrate in the far-field to near-field transition regime. We demonstrate that this unexpected behavior is related to the singularities of dressed emission mechanisms in this three-body system sphere-substrate-bath with respect to the separation distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a long-standing apparent conflict between the existence of diamagnetism and causality as expressed through the Kramers-Kronig relations. In essence, using causality arguments, along with a small number of seemingly well-justified assumptions, one can show that diamagnetism is impossible. Nature naturally does not mind this, and experiments show diamagnetic responses from magnetic media. We present a resolution to this issue, which also explains the absence of observed dia-electric responses in media. In the process, we expose some of the short-comings in earlier analyses that have kept the paradox alive.</description>

      <title>Discovery of transient topological crystalline order in optically driven SnSe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast optical excitation provides a powerful route for accessing emergent quantum phases far from equilibrium, enabling transient light-induced phenomena such as magnetism, ferroelectricity, and superconductivity. However, extending this approach to induce topological phases, especially in conventional semiconductors, remains challenging. Here, we report the observation of a thermally inaccessible, transient topological crystalline order in the layered semiconductor SnSe, a trivial insulator with a sizable (~ 0.8 eV) band gap, induced by femtosecond above-gap excitation. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy directly reveals the sub-picosecond emergence of Dirac-like linear dispersions within the band gap. Their features, including a high Fermi velocity (~ 2.5x10^5 m/s), multiple Dirac points away from high-symmetry momenta, and independence from probe photon energy, are consistent with mirror-symmetry-protected surface states of a topological crystalline insulator. The observed spectral dynamics, combined with density functional theory calculations, indicate that the femtosecond excitation transiently increases lattice symmetry, enabling topological crystalline order to emerge. Our discovery opens new avenues for ultrafast optical control of topological quantum phases in semiconductors, with potential applications in quantum and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Robust Wave Splitters Based on Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent perfect absorption (CPA) is well-known as a phenomenon where all the energy of a specific injected wavefront is completely absorbed by losses in a system, independent of details. This has applications in wavefront shaping, communication, filtering, wireless power transfer, etc. We have discovered an application of coherent perfect absorption enabling conditions as a tunable splitter that is robust to any change in relative amplitude or phase of an arbitrary injected waveform. We show experimentally that the fixed splitting ratios and output phases at CPA enabling conditions are robust to 100 dB of relative power and 2$\pi$ phase changes of the input waves to a complex non-Hermitian two-port system. We also demonstrate that the splitting power ratio can be tuned by multiple orders of magnitude and the CPA enabling conditions can be tuned to any desired frequency with suitable tunable perturbations embedded in the system. Although this phenomenon is realized in two-port systems, tunable robust splitting can be achieved between any two ports of multiport systems. These results are general to all wave scattering phenomena and hold in generic complex scattering systems.</description>
