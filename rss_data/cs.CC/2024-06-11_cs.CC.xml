      <title>On Kolmogorov Structure Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All strings with low mutual information with the halting sequence will have flat Kolmogorov Structure Functions, in the context of Algorithmic Statistics. Assuming the Independence Postulate, strings with non-negligible information with the halting sequence are purely mathematical constructions, and cannot be found in nature. Thus Algorithmic Statistics does not study strings in the physical world. This leads to the general thesis that two part codes require limitations as shown in the Minimum Description Length Principle. We also discuss issues with set-restricted Kolmogorov Structure Functions.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Target Set Selection in Simple Geometric Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the following model of disease spread in a social network. At first, all individuals are either infected or healthy. Next, in discrete rounds, the disease spreads in the network from infected to healthy individuals such that a healthy individual gets infected if and only if a sufficient number of its direct neighbors are already infected. We represent the social network as a graph. Inspired by the real-world restrictions in the current epidemic, especially by social and physical distancing requirements, we restrict ourselves to networks that can be represented as geometric intersection graphs. We show that finding a minimal vertex set of initially infected individuals to spread the disease in the whole network is computationally hard, already on unit disk graphs. Hence, to provide some algorithmic results, we focus ourselves on simpler geometric graph classes, such as interval graphs and grid graphs.</description>

      <title>Sum-of-Squares &amp; Gaussian Processes I: Certification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new SoS hierarchy for a broad class of average-case problems. The new high-entropy steps (HES) SoS hierarchy certifies properties of input instances only over a certain family of well behaved distributions of possible solutions. This allows the hierarchy to circumvent the oft-cited impossibility of providing a low-degree SoS proof of concentration of measure \cite[Lec.~1.2, Marley Paradigm]{barak2016proofs} by vastly reducing the set of solution concepts they need to be proven over.
  We evaluate the HES SoS hierarchy on a well-studied Gaussian process: the spherical spin-glass, which is a particular ensemble of random low-degree polynomials (LDPs). We prove that, given an instance sampled from the problem distribution, with high probability there exists a HES distribution that achieves value arbitrarily close to the conjectured optimal algorithmic threshold and, at the same time, there are low-degree SoS certificates that no HES distribution can achieve value above a constant factor times this threshold, improving over standard SoS whose certificates are loose by a factor of $n^{\lfloor p/2 - 1\rfloor/2}$ for a degree-$p$ random polynomial \cite{bhattiprolu2017sum, hopkins2017power}. We also give examples of anisotropic modifications to the spherical spin glass problem where there is proof (or strong evidence) that the HES SoS hierarchy does better than the only other known algorithm \cite{subag2021following}. We conjecture that the HES SoS hierarchy can be applied to any LDP approximate Gaussian process to obtain value that is optimal among polynomial-time algorithms.
  The rounding algorithm is introduced and analyzed in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial view of Holant problems on higher domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On the Boolean domain, there is a class of symmetric signatures called ``Fibonacci gates'' for which a beautiful P-time combinatorial algorithm has been designed for the corresponding $\operatorname{Holant}$ problems.
  In this work, I give a combinatorial view for $\operatorname{Holant}(\mathcal{F})$ problems on a domain of size 3 where $\mathcal{F}$ is a set of arity 3 functions with inputs taking values on the domain of size 3 and the functions share some common properties. The combinatorial view can also be extended to the domain of size 4.
  Specifically, I extend the definition of "Fibonacci gates" to the domain of size 3 and the domain of size 4. Moreover, I give the corresponding combinatorial algorithms.</description>

      <title>Guidable Local Hamiltonian Problems with Implications to Heuristic Ans\"atze State Preparation and the Quantum PCP Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study 'Merlinized' versions of the recently defined Guided Local Hamiltonian problem, which we call 'Guidable Local Hamiltonian' problems. Unlike their guided counterparts, these problems do not have a guiding state provided as a part of the input, but merely come with the promise that one exists. We consider in particular two classes of guiding states: those that can be prepared efficiently by a quantum circuit; and those belonging to a class of quantum states we call classically evaluatable, for which it is possible to efficiently compute expectation values of local observables classically. We show that guidable local Hamiltonian problems for both classes of guiding states are $\mathsf{QCMA}$-complete in the inverse-polynomial precision setting, but lie within $\mathsf{NP}$ (or $\mathsf{NqP}$) in the constant precision regime when the guiding state is classically evaluatable.
  Our completeness results show that, from a complexity-theoretic perspective, classical Ans\"atze selected by classical heuristics are just as powerful as quantum Ans\"atze prepared by quantum heuristics, as long as one has access to quantum phase estimation. In relation to the quantum PCP conjecture, we (i) define a complexity class capturing quantum-classical probabilistically checkable proof systems and show that it is contained in $\mathsf{BQP}^{\mathsf{NP}[1]}$ for constant proof queries; (ii) give a no-go result on 'dequantizing' the known quantum reduction which maps a $\mathsf{QPCP}$-verification circuit to a local Hamiltonian with constant promise gap; (iii) give several no-go results for the existence of quantum gap amplification procedures that preserve certain ground state properties; and (iv) propose two conjectures that can be viewed as stronger versions of the NLTS theorem. Finally, we show that many of our results can be directly modified to obtain similar results for the class $\mathsf{MA}$.</description>

      <title>On Computationally Efficient Multi-Class Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a multi-class labelling problem, where the labels can take values in $[k]$, and a predictor predicts a distribution over the labels. In this work, we study the following foundational question: Are there notions of multi-class calibration that give strong guarantees of meaningful predictions and can be achieved in time and sample complexities polynomial in $k$? Prior notions of calibration exhibit a tradeoff between computational efficiency and expressivity: they either suffer from having sample complexity exponential in $k$, or needing to solve computationally intractable problems, or give rather weak guarantees.
  Our main contribution is a notion of calibration that achieves all these desiderata: we formulate a robust notion of projected smooth calibration for multi-class predictions, and give new recalibration algorithms for efficiently calibrating predictors under this definition with complexity polynomial in $k$. Projected smooth calibration gives strong guarantees for all downstream decision makers who want to use the predictor for binary classification problems of the form: does the label belong to a subset $T \subseteq [k]$: e.g. is this an image of an animal? It ensures that the probabilities predicted by summing the probabilities assigned to labels in $T$ are close to some perfectly calibrated binary predictor for that task. We also show that natural strengthenings of our definition are computationally hard to achieve: they run into information theoretic barriers or computational intractability. Underlying both our upper and lower bounds is a tight connection that we prove between multi-class calibration and the well-studied problem of agnostic learning in the (standard) binary prediction setting.</description>

      <title>Models That Prove Their Own Correctness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How can we trust the correctness of a learned model on a particular input of interest? Model accuracy is typically measured *on average* over a distribution of inputs, giving no guarantee for any fixed input. This paper proposes a theoretically-founded solution to this problem: to train *Self-Proving models* that prove the correctness of their output to a verification algorithm $V$ via an Interactive Proof. Self-Proving models satisfy that, with high probability over a random input, the model generates a correct output *and* successfully proves its correctness to $V\!$. The *soundness* property of $V$ guarantees that, for *every* input, no model can convince $V$ of the correctness of an incorrect output. Thus, a Self-Proving model proves correctness of most of its outputs, while *all* incorrect outputs (of any model) are detected by $V$. We devise a generic method for learning Self-Proving models, and we prove convergence bounds under certain assumptions. The theoretical framework and results are complemented by experiments on an arithmetic capability: computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. Our learning method is used to train a Self-Proving transformer that computes the GCD *and* proves the correctness of its answer.</description>
