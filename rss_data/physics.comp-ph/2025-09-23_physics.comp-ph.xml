      <title>Topology optimization of cathode gas channel layout in advanced proton exchange membrane fuel cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) output relies on the transport behavior within the cathode gas channels. Current designs remain inadequate as they often rely on heuristic modifications of existing layouts or designer intuition with suboptimal performance. In this study, topology optimization is proposed to redesign the PEMFC cathode gas channel layout without a priori assumptions. The optimization aims to maximize the reactant concentration and minimize power dissipation along the flow path. The problem is solved within a three-dimensional half-cell model. For computational tractability, a reduced-order, depth-averaged two-dimensional model is also implemented. The optimized topology yields an enhanced current density with lower energy dissipation over the conventional benchmarks. At an inlet velocity of 0.15 m/s, the pressure drop is reduced by 46.7% compared to the serpentine layout, though is 28.2% higher than that of the parallel case. Within the optimized channels, oxygen flows at higher local velocities, which allows a more homogeneous reactant delivery across the domain. Relative to the serpentine layout, the improvement in mean current density reaches 20.9% with 4.9% lower standard deviation. Placing more emphasis on dissipation minimization during optimization produces more intricate, tortuous channel topologies. Such design flexibility enables the discovery of unconventional yet efficient layouts.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The objective of this paper is to derive a method of constructing semi-analytic solutions to the Noh Problem when the equation of state (EoS) is a black box. Such solutions can be used for verification tests of hydrodynamics codes. We present the underlying theory, the method for finding solutions, and several examples of derived semi-analytic solutions. We end by performing a classic convergence test using a non-trivial semi-analytic solution.</description>

      <title>Exponential Spectral Scaling: Robust and Efficient Stellarator Boundary Optimization via Mode-Dependent Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellarator boundary optimization faces a fundamental numerical challenge: the extreme disparity between low- and high-mode amplitudes creates an optimization landscape in which direct full-spectrum approaches typically converge to poor local minima. Traditionally, this challenge has been addressed through a computationally expensive, multi-step Fourier continuation, in which low Fourier modes are optimized first, followed by the gradual incorporation of higher modes. We present Exponential Spectral Scaling (ESS), a technique that applies a mode-dependent exponential scaling factor to each Fourier mode. Our primary implementation uses the $L_{\infty}$ norm to determine the scaling pattern, creating a square spectral decay profile that effectively reduces the dynamic range of optimization variables from $10^{6}$--$10^{7}$ to $10^{2}$--$10^{3}$. This scaling aligns with the natural spectral decay of physically meaningful configurations and enables direct single-step optimization using the full spectrum of boundary Fourier modes. ESS eliminates arbitrary staging decisions and reduces computation time by a factor of $2$ to $5$ in benchmark cases. In addition to accelerating optimization, ESS improves robustness, reducing sensitivity to initial conditions and increasing confidence in avoiding local optima. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ESS across both quasi-axisymmetric (QA) and quasi-helically symmetric (QH) configurations, using two distinct optimization toolkits: SIMSOPT and DESC.</description>

      <title>Transition Frequencies and Dynamic Amplification of Buried Lifelines: A Semi-Analytical Timoshenko Beam on Winkler Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Underground lifelines, such as pipelines and tunnels, are susceptible to ground vibrations from seismic events, traffic, and other dynamic sources. Accurate prediction of their response is essential for ensuring structural safety and operability. This study introduces a semi-analytical model for transverse vibration analysis of buried lifelines, formulated using the Timoshenko beam theory on elastic foundation. The closed-form analytical solutions revealed that the vibration spectrum comprises four parts, separated by three transition frequencies. At each transition, the oscillatory characteristics of the modes change as a function of the system properties, leading to marked variations in dynamic amplification. The model's validity is confirmed through case studies of buried steel pipelines of varying lengths and operating conditions, showing excellent agreement with finite element simulations. A subsequent parametric study quantifies the influence of key factors - including soil stiffness and system length - on dynamic performance. The proposed method provides a computationally efficient and physically transparent framework for capturing complex vibration phenomena beyond simplified travelling-wave approaches, offering valuable guidance for the design and resilience assessment of underground lifeline systems subjected to various dynamic loads.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution reconstruction of turbulent flows from a single Lagrangian trajectory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the reconstruction of turbulent flow fields from trajectory data recorded by actively migrating Lagrangian agents. We propose a deep learning model, Track-to-Flow (T2F), which employs a Vision Transformer as an encoder to capture the spatiotemporal features of a single agent trajectory, and a convolutional neural network as the decoder to reconstruct the flow field. To enhance the physical consistency of the T2F model, we further incorporate a physics-informed loss function inspired by the framework of Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), yielding a variant model referred to as T2F+PINN. We first evaluate both models in a laminar cylinder wake flow at a Reynolds number of $Re = 800$ as a proof-of-concept. The results show that the T2F model achieves velocity reconstruction accuracy comparable to existing flow reconstruction methods, while the T2F+PINN model reduces the normalized error in vorticity reconstruction relative to the T2F model. We then apply the models in a turbulent Rayleigh-B\'{e}nard convection at a Rayleigh number of $Ra = 10^{8}$ and a Prandtl number of $Pr = 0.71$. The results show that the T2F model accurately reconstructs both the velocity and temperature fields, whereas the T2F+PINN model further improves the reconstruction accuracy of gradient-related physical quantities, such as temperature gradients, vorticity, and the $Q$ value, with a maximum improvement of approximately 60\% compared to the T2F model. Overall, the T2F model is better suited for reconstructing primitive flow variables, while the T2F+PINN model provides advantages in reconstructing gradient-related quantities. Our models open a promising avenue for accurate flow reconstruction from a single Lagrangian trajectory.</description>

      <title>Criticality of a stochastic modern Hopfield network model with exponential interaction function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hopfield network (HN) is a classical model of associative memory whose dynamics are closely related to the Ising spin system with 2-body interactions. Stored patterns are encoded as minima of an energy function shaped by a Hebbian learning rule, and retrieval corresponds to convergence towards these minima. Modern Hopfield Networks (MHNs) introduce p-body interactions among neurons with p greater than 2 and, more recently, also exponential interaction functions, which significantly improve network's storing and retrieval capacity. While the criticality of HNs and p-body MHNs were extensively studied since the 1980s, the investigation of critical behavior in exponential MHNs is still in its early stages. Here, we study a stochastic exponential MHN (SMHN) with a multiplicative salt-and-pepper noise. While taking the noise probability p as control parameter, the average overlap parameter Q and a diffusion scaling H are taken as order parameters. In particular, H is related to the time correlation features of the network, with H greater than 0.5 signaling the emergence of persistent time memory. We found the emergence of a critical transition in both Q and H, with the critical noise level weakly decreasing as the load N increases. Notably, for each load N, the diffusion scaling H highlights a transition between a sub- and a super-critical regime, both with short-range correlated dynamics. Conversely, the critical regime, which is found in the range of p around 0.23-0.3, displays a long-range correlated dynamics with highly persistent temporal memory marked by the high value H around 1.3.</description>

      <title>Compact representation of transonic airfoil buffet flows with observable-augmented machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transonic buffet presents time-dependent aerodynamic characteristics associated with shock, turbulent boundary layer, and their interactions. Despite strong nonlinearities and a large degree of freedom, there exists a dominant dynamic pattern of a buffet cycle, suggesting the low dimensionality of transonic buffet phenomena. This study seeks a low-dimensional representation of transonic airfoil buffet at a high Reynolds number with machine learning. Wall-modeled large-eddy simulations of flow over the OAT15A supercritical airfoil at two Mach numbers, $M_\infty = 0.715$ and 0.730, respectively producing non-buffet and buffet conditions, at a chord-based Reynolds number of $Re = 3\times 10^6$ are performed to generate the present datasets. We find that the low-dimensional nature of transonic airfoil buffet can be extracted as a sole three-dimensional latent representation through lift-augmented autoencoder compression. The current low-order representation not only describes the shock movement but also captures the moment when the separation occurs near the trailing edge in a low-order manner. We further show that it is possible to perform sensor-based reconstruction through the present low-dimensional expression while identifying the sensitivity with respect to aerodynamic responses. The present model trained at $Re = 3\times 10^6$ is lastly evaluated at the level of a real aircraft operation of $Re = 3\times 10^7$, exhibiting that the phase dynamics of lift is reasonably estimated from sparse sensors. The current study may provide a foundation toward data-driven real-time analysis of transonic buffet conditions under aircraft operation.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Low and high-Order Methods for the Simulation of Supersonic Jet Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work compares results for different numerical methods in search of alternatives to improve the quality of large-eddy simulations for the problem of supersonic turbulent jet flows. Previous work has analyzed supersonic jet flows using a second-order, finite difference solver based on structured meshes, and the results indicated a shorter potential core of the jet and different levels of velocity fluctuations. In the present work, the results of previous simulations are compared to new results using a high-order, discontinuous Galerkin solver for unstructured meshes. All simulations are performed keeping the total number of degrees of freedom constant. The results of the current simulations present very similar mean velocity distributions and slightly smaller velocity fluctuations, and they seem to correlate better with the experimental data. The present results indicate that additional studies should focus on the jet inlet boundary conditions in order to improve the physical representation of the early stages of the jet development.</description>

      <title>Characterization of boundary layers on isothermal and adiabatic curved surfaces of a supersonic turbine cascade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of adiabatic and isothermal boundary conditions are investigated on the shock-boundary layer interactions (SBLIs) in a supersonic turbine cascade. Special attention is given to the characterization of the incoming boundary layers over the convex and concave walls of the blade and their impact in the SBLIs. Large eddy simulations (LES) are performed for an inlet Mach number of $\mathbf{M_\infty = 2.0}$ and Reynolds number based on the axial chord $\mathbf{Re = 200\,000}$. For the isothermal condition, the wall to inlet temperature ratio is $\mathbf{T_w/T_{\infty}=0.75}$, representing a cooled wall. Different incident shock wave topologies occur on the suction and pressure sides of the airfoil. For the former, an oblique shock impinges on the boundary layer leading to a larger separation bubble. On the other hand, a normal shock from a Mach reflection induces a small separation region near the wall for the pressure side. Results are presented in terms of mean velocity and temperature contours, and the incoming boundary layers are characterized by looking at the Clauser parameter, shape factor, dilatation and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) profiles. Inspection of the shape factors show that the adiabatic wall boundary layers are more prone to separate than the isothermal ones. This is indeed observed in the airfoil suction side, but not on the pressure side, where the flow separates in the same chord position regardless of the thermal boundary condition. This is a topic for investigation in the final version of the paper. An assessment of the dilatation and TKE profiles explains the disparities of the bubble sizes on the pressure and suction sides of the airfoil.</description>

      <title>Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism: An Operational Measure of Objectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the emergence of classical objectivity in quantum systems through the measure of Functional Information in Quantum Darwinism ($FI_{QD}$). The goal is to quantify objectivity as the abundance of environment fragments that independently contain sufficient information about a system's pointer states. The method relies on the Holevo quantity -- an upper bound on accessible information -- and introduces a tolerance criterion called $\delta$-adequacy, where fragments are considered adequate if they retain at least $(1-\delta)H_S$ bits of pointer information. Numerical simulations of a dephasing model with fragment sampling reveal three robust features: (i) an early-time regime where $\log R_\delta(t)$ grows approximately linearly, (ii) capacity-limited plateaus determined by fragment size and environment dimension, and (iii) stability of the onset criterion under different sampling strategies and overlap corrections. These results establish $FI_{QD}$ as a practical and conservative yardstick for operational objectivity. Beyond numerical findings, the analysis links redundancy growth to thermodynamic costs of record formation and interprets $FI_{QD}$ as a resource monotone under noisy dynamics. The study suggests that classical objectivity emerges not as an assumption but as a quantifiable, resource-limited abundance of redundant records.</description>

      <title>Topological Mechanics of Entangled Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entangled networks are ubiquitous in tissues, polymers, and fabrics. However, their mechanics remain insufficiently understood due to the complexity of the topological constraints at the network level. Here, we develop a mathematical framework that models entangled networks as graphs, capturing topological constraints of entanglements. We prove that entanglements reduce system energy by enabling uniform tension along chains crossing entanglements and by redistributing stress through sliding. Under this framework, we study elasticity and fracture, validated by experiments on entangled fabrics and hydrogels. For elasticity, entanglements increase strength by enabling stress homogeneity in the network. For fracture, entanglements enhance toughness by mitigating stress concentration around crack tips. We discover counterintuitive physical laws governing crack-tip stretch during crack opening: stress deconcentration at small deformation, constitutive-law independence at intermediate deformation, and linear scaling at large deformation. This framework establishes fundamental principles of linking topology to mechanics of entangled networks and offers a foundational tool for designing reconfigurable materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to optimally reduce the local Hilbert basis of lattice quantum many-body (QMB) Hamiltonians. The basis truncation exploits the most relevant eigenvalues of the estimated single-site reduced density matrix (RDM). It is accurate and numerically stable across different model phases, even close to quantum phase transitions. We apply this procedure to different models, such as the Sine-Gordon model, the $\varphi^{4}$ theory, and lattice gauge theories, namely Abelian $\mathrm{U}(1)$ and non-Abelian $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, in one and two spatial dimensions. Our results reduce state-of-the-art estimates of computational resources for classical and quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Physically consistent predictive reduced-order modeling by enhancing Operator Inference with state constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of complex multiphysics systems, such as char combustion considered herein, yield numerous state variables that inherently exhibit physical constraints. This paper presents a new approach to augment Operator Inference -- a methodology within scientific machine learning that enables learning from data a low-dimensional representation of a high-dimensional system governed by nonlinear partial differential equations -- by embedding such state constraints in the reduced-order model predictions. In the model learning process, we propose a new way to choose regularization hyperparameters based on a key performance indicator. Since embedding state constraints improves the stability of the Operator Inference reduced-order model, we compare the proposed state constraints-embedded Operator Inference with the standard Operator Inference and other stability-enhancing approaches. For an application to char combustion, we demonstrate that the proposed approach yields state predictions superior to the other methods regarding stability and accuracy. It extrapolates over 200\% past the training regime while being computationally efficient and physically consistent.</description>

      <title>Multi-fidelity learning for interatomic potentials: Low-level forces and high-level energies are all you need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The promise of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) has led to an abundance of public quantum mechanical (QM) training datasets. The quality of an MLIP is directly limited by the accuracy of the energies and atomic forces in the training dataset. Unfortunately, most of these datasets are computed with relatively low-accuracy QM methods, e.g., density functional theory with a moderate basis set. Due to the increased computational cost of more accurate QM methods, e.g., coupled-cluster theory with a complete basis set extrapolation, most high-accuracy datasets are much smaller and often do not contain atomic forces. The lack of high-accuracy atomic forces is quite troubling, as training with force data greatly improves the stability and quality of the MLIP compared to training to energy alone. Because most datasets are computed with a unique level of theory, traditional single-fidelity learning is not capable of leveraging the vast amounts of published QM data. In this study, we apply multi-fidelity learning to train an MLIP to multiple QM datasets of different levels of accuracy, i.e., levels of fidelity. Specifically, we perform three test cases to demonstrate that multi-fidelity learning with both low-level forces and high-level energies yields an extremely accurate MLIP -- far more accurate than a single-fidelity MLIP trained solely to high-level energies and almost as accurate as a single-fidelity MLIP trained directly to high-level energies and forces. Therefore, multi-fidelity learning greatly alleviates the need for generating large and expensive datasets containing high-accuracy atomic forces and allows for more effective training to existing high-accuracy energy-only datasets. Indeed, low-accuracy atomic forces and high-accuracy energies are all that are needed to achieve a high-accuracy MLIP with multi-fidelity learning.</description>

      <title>Mass-Zero constrained molecular dynamics for electrostatic interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal exploitation of supercomputing resources for the evaluation of electrostatic forces remains a challenge in molecular dynamics simulations of very large systems. The most efficient methods are currently based on particle-mesh Ewald sums and achieve semi-logarithmic scaling in the number of particles. These methods solve the problem in reciprocal space, requiring extensive use of Fast Fourier transforms (FFTs). While highly efficient in many contexts, FFTs may encounter scalability challenges at very large processor counts due to their communication requirements. To mitigate these problems, the development and scalable coding of real-space approaches to solve the Poisson equation on a grid is an active field of research. In this work, we introduce a novel real-space approach that provides some advantages over alternatives. Our method exploits an extended Lagrangian in which the values of the field at the grid points are treated as auxiliary variables of zero inertia and the discretized Poisson equation is enforced as a dynamical constraint. The solution of the constraints leads to a linear system - different from those appearing in other real-space approaches - that can be efficiently solved via state-of-the-art iterative methods. The method inherits the numerical scaling of the adopted iterative solver, e.g. linear with a multigrid (MG) approach, but converges with fewer cycles. We analyze this approach considering realistic simulations of molten NaCl that validate its ability to reproduce structural and transport properties. Using this non-trivial benchmark, we demonstrate linear scaling and illustrate some features of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Designing quantum chemistry algorithms with just-in-time compilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09772v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce just-in-time (JIT) compilation to the integral kernels for Gaussian-type orbitals (GTOs) to enhance the efficiency of electron repulsion integral computations. For Coulomb and exchange (JK) matrices, JIT-based algorithms yield a 2x speedup for the small 6-31G* basis set over GPU4PySCF v1.4 on an NVIDIA A100-80G GPU. By incorporating a novel algorithm designed for orbitals with high angular momentum, the efficiency of JK evaluations with the large def2-TZVPP basis set is improved by up to 4x. The core CUDA implementation is compact, comprising only ~1,000 lines of code, including support for single-precision arithmetic. Furthermore, the single-precision implementation achieves a 3x speedup over the previous state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>GPU-acceleration of the Discontinuous Galerkin Shallow Water Equations Model (DG-SWEM) with OpenACC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a porting of {DG-SWEM}, a first-order discontinuous Galerkin solver for storm surge based on the Advanced Circulation Model (ADCIRC), to NVIDIA GPUs. Time-explicit discontinuous Galerkin methods contain a large number of degrees of freedom but have been shown to exhibit a large amount of data parallelism due to the loose coupling between elements, and thus are naturally mapped to the GPU architecture. A previous framework in porting DG-SWEM to GPUs required converting subroutines from Fortran to C++ to be used with CUDA C++. By using OpenACC and Unified Memory, we simplify the porting process and maintain a single codebase for both CPU and GPU versions. We test the code using a large Hurricane Harvey scenario on NVIDIA's Grace Hopper chip, and compare the GPU code's performance on multiple H200 nodes to the CPU version on the same amount of Grace CPU nodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differential equations containing memory terms that depend nonlinearly on past states model a variety of non-Markovian processes. In this study, we present a Markovian embedding procedure for such equations with distributed delay by utilising an exact spectral representation of the nonlinear memory function. This allows us to transform the nonlocal system to an equivalent local-in-time system in an abstract extended space. We demonstrate our embedding procedure for two one-dimensional physical models: (i) the walking droplet and (ii) the single-phase Stefan problem. In addition to providing an alternative representation of the underlying physical system, the local representation finds applications in designing efficient time-integrators with time-independent computational costs for memory-dependent systems which typically suffer from growing-in-time costs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We simulate the coherence of two coupled electron spins interacting with a bath of nuclei using the generalized cluster correlation expansion (gCCE) method. An exchange interaction between the electrons facilitates a family of entangling gates that can be spoiled by nuclear-induced dephasing. Consequently, we study the dephasing of the coherent two-electron system by characterizing the $T_2$ and $T_2^*$ of the two-electron reduced density matrix for various system parameters in the range mimicking magnetic molecules, including magnetic field strength and orientation, exchange interaction strength, distance between the two spins, minimum distance between electron and nuclei and between nuclei, and nuclei density. We find the optimal regime for each parameter in which the coherence time is maximized and provide a physical understanding of it.</description>

      <title>PACMANN: Point Adaptive Collocation Method for Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a tool for approximating the solution of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) in both forward and inverse problems. PINNs minimize a loss function which includes the PDE residual determined for a set of collocation points. Previous work has shown that the number and distribution of these collocation points have a significant influence on the accuracy of the PINN solution. Therefore, the effective placement of these collocation points is an active area of research. Specifically, available adaptive collocation point sampling methods have been reported to scale poorly in terms of computational cost when applied to high-dimensional problems. In this work, we address this issue and present the Point Adaptive Collocation Method for Artificial Neural Networks (PACMANN). PACMANN incrementally moves collocation points toward regions of higher residuals using gradient-based optimization algorithms guided by the gradient of the PINN loss function, that is, the squared PDE residual. We apply PACMANN for forward and inverse problems, and demonstrate that this method matches the performance of state-of-the-art methods in terms of the accuracy/efficiency tradeoff for the low-dimensional problems, while outperforming available approaches for high-dimensional problems. Key features of the method include its low computational cost and simplicity of integration into existing physics-informed neural network pipelines. The code is available at https://github.com/CoenVisser/PACMANN.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-driven conservative-to-primitive conversion in hybrid piecewise polytropic and tabulated equations of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07836v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel machine learning (ML) method to accelerate conservative-to-primitive inversion, focusing on hybrid piecewise polytropic and tabulated equations of state. Traditional root-finding techniques are computationally expensive, particularly for large-scale relativistic hydrodynamics simulations. To address this, we employ feedforward neural networks (NNC2PS and NNC2PL), trained in PyTorch and optimized for GPU inference using NVIDIA TensorRT, achieving significant speedups with minimal accuracy loss. The NNC2PS model achieves $ L_1 $ and $ L_\infty $ errors of $ 4.54 \times 10^{-7} $ and $ 3.44 \times 10^{-6} $, respectively, while the NNC2PL model exhibits even lower error values. TensorRT optimization with mixed-precision deployment substantially accelerates performance compared to traditional root-finding methods. Specifically, the mixed-precision TensorRT engine for NNC2PS achieves inference speeds approximately 400 times faster than a traditional single-threaded CPU implementation for a dataset size of 1,000,000 points. Ideal parallelization across an entire compute node in the Delta supercomputer (Dual AMD 64 core 2.45 GHz Milan processors; and 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 40 GB HBM2 RAM and NVLink) predicts a 25-fold speedup for TensorRT over an optimally-parallelized numerical method when processing 8 million data points. Moreover, the ML method exhibits sub-linear scaling with increasing dataset sizes. We release the scientific software developed, enabling further validation and extension of our findings. This work underscores the potential of ML, combined with GPU optimization and model quantization, to accelerate conservative-to-primitive inversion in relativistic hydrodynamics simulations.</description>

Abstract: We present QuantumToolbox$.$jl, an open-source Julia package for simulating open quantum systems. Designed with a syntax familiar to users of QuTiP (Quantum Toolbox in Python), it harnesses Julia's high-performance ecosystem to deliver fast and scalable simulations. The package includes a suite of time-evolution solvers supporting distributed computing and GPU acceleration, enabling efficient simulation of large-scale quantum systems. We also show how QuantumToolbox$.$jl can integrate with automatic differentiation tools, making it well-suited for gradient-based optimization tasks such as quantum optimal control. Benchmark comparisons demonstrate substantial performance gains over existing frameworks. With its flexible design and computational efficiency, QuantumToolbox$.$jl serves as a powerful tool for both theoretical studies and practical applications in quantum science.</description>

      <title>Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, modeled thus via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the nonreciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the ones resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.</description>

      <title>Resolving Turbulent Magnetohydrodynamics: A Hybrid Operator-Diffusion Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a hybrid machine learning framework that combines Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs) with score-based generative diffusion models to simulate the full spatio-temporal evolution of two-dimensional, incompressible, resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence across a broad range of Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$). The framework leverages the equation-constrained generalization capabilities of PINOs to predict coherent, low-frequency dynamics, while a conditional diffusion model stochastically corrects high-frequency residuals, enabling accurate modeling of fully developed turbulence. Trained on a comprehensive ensemble of high-fidelity simulations with $\mathrm{Re} \in \{100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 3000, 10000\}$, the approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in regimes previously inaccessible to deterministic surrogates. At $\mathrm{Re}=1000$ and $3000$, the model faithfully reconstructs the full spectral energy distributions of both velocity and magnetic fields late into the simulation, capturing non-Gaussian statistics, intermittent structures, and cross-field correlations with high fidelity. At extreme turbulence levels ($\mathrm{Re}=10000$), it remains the first surrogate capable of recovering the high-wavenumber evolution of the magnetic field, preserving large-scale morphology and enabling statistically meaningful predictions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multi-direct-forcing immersed boundary method allows for high accuracy of the no-slip condition in moving-particle problems but suffers from numerical instability if simulation parameters are not carefully chosen. This study investigates the numerical accuracy and stability of the accelerated multidirect-forcing immersed boundary method. An analysis of the discretized equations of body motion in moving boundary problems identifies a critical parameter that solely determines the numerical stability for the body motion. Additionally, numerical simulations reveal the optimal acceleration parameter that minimizes the error in the no-slip condition and is independent of details of the boundary discretisation, the boundary shape, and spatial dimensionality. This study provides a guideline for establishing numerically stable simulations of moving boundary problems at optimal accuracy of the no-slip condition.</description>

      <title>Wallpaper Group-Based Mechanical Metamaterials: Dataset Including Mechanical Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials often exhibit pattern transformations through instabilities, enabling applications in, e.g., soft robotics, sound reduction, and biomedicine. These transformations and their resulting mechanical properties are closely tied to the symmetries in these metamaterials' microstructures, which remain under-explored. Designing such materials is challenging due to the unbounded design space, and while machine learning offers promising tools, they require extensive training data. Here, we present a large dataset of 2D microstructures and their macroscopic mechanical responses in the hyperelastic, finite-strain regime, including buckling. The microstructures are generated using a novel method, which covers all 17 wallpaper symmetry groups and employs B\'ezier curves for a rich parametric space. Mechanical responses are obtained through finite element-based computational homogenization. The dataset includes 1,020 distinct geometries, each subjected to 12 loading trajectories, totaling 12,240 trajectories. Our dataset supports the development and benchmarking of surrogate models, facilitates the study of symmetry-property relationships, and enables investigations into symmetry-breaking during pattern transformations, potentially revealing emergent behavior in mechanical metamaterials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop structure-preserving numerical methods for the compressible Euler equations, employing potential temperature as a prognostic variable. We construct three numerical fluxes designed to ensure the conservation of entropy and total energy within the discontinuous Galerkin framework on general curvilinear meshes. Furthermore, we introduce a generalization for the kinetic energy preservation property and total energy conservation in the presence of a gravitational potential term. To this end, we adopt a flux-differencing approach for the discretization of the source term, treated as non-conservative product. We present well-balanced schemes for different constant background states for both formulations (total energy and potential temperature) on curvilinear meshes. Finally, we validate the methods by comparing the potential temperature formulation with the traditional Euler equations formulation across a range of classical atmospheric scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Because they are likely to accrete substantial amounts of interstellar gas, merging supermassive binary black holes are expected to be strong multimessenger sources, radiating gravitational waves, photons from thermal gas, and photons from relativistic electrons energized by relativistic jets. Here we report on a numerical simulation that covers the late inspiral, merger, and initial postmerger phase of such a system where both black holes have the same mass and spin, and both spin axes are parallel to the orbital angular momentum. The simulation incorporates both 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. The thermal photon power during the late inspiral, merger, and immediate postmerger phases is drawn from strong shocks rather than dissipation of turbulence inside a smoothly structured accretion disk as typically found around accreting single black holes. We find that the thermal photon and jet Poynting flux outputs are closely related in time, and we posit a mechanism that enforces this relation. The power radiated in both photons and jets diminishes gradually as merger is approached, but jumps sharply at merger to a noisy plateau. Such a distinct lightcurve should aid efforts to identify supermassive black hole mergers, with or without accompanying gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Evidential Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Scientific Discovery</title>

Abstract: We present the fundamental theory and implementation guidelines underlying Evidential Physics-Informed Neural Network (E-PINN) -- a novel class of uncertainty-aware PINN. It leverages the marginal distribution loss function of evidential deep learning for estimating uncertainty of outputs, and infers unknown parameters of the PDE via a learned posterior distribution. Validating our model on two illustrative case studies -- the 1D Poisson equation with a Gaussian source and the 2D Fisher-KPP equation, we found that E-PINN generated empirical coverage probabilities that were calibrated significantly better than Bayesian PINN and Deep Ensemble methods. To demonstrate real-world applicability, we also present a brief case study on applying E-PINN to analyze clinical glucose-insulin datasets that have featured in medical research on diabetes pathophysiology.</description>
