      <title>Some Remarks on Gorenstein Projective Precovers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that for a $n$-perfect ring $R$ various classes of relative Gorenstein projective $R$-modules are special precovering, among them including the Gorenstein projectives and Ding projectives. Also we prove that the class of projectively coresolved Gorenstein flat $\mathcal{PGF} (R)$ fulfils the same feature. We also introduce a new class of Gorenstein projective $R$-modules relative to the Auslander class $\\mathcal{A} _{C} (R)$ of a semidualizing $(R,S)$-bimodule $_R C_S$.</description>

      <title>Linkage and Essential $p$-Dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that two cyclically linked $p$-algebras of prime degree become inseparably linked under a prime to $p$ extension if and only if the essential $p$-dimension of the pair is 2. We conclude that the essential $p$-dimension of pairs of cyclically linked $p$-algebras is 3 by constructing an example of a pair that does not become inseparably linked under any prime to $p$ extension.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of two by two symmetric matrices of trace zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the entire structure of the vector space $Sym_2^0$ of all symmetric matrices of size $2$ having trace zero. This is motivated by the geometrical interpretation of any arbitrary element of $Sym_2^0$. We further study the orbits and stable sets of these elements. As an application of the obtained structure of $Sym_2^0$, we obtain the symmetric matrices of size $2$, trace of whose product with any trace zero symmetric matrix is zero. Finally some well known trigonometric formulas are interpreted geometrically incorporating the anatomy of $Sym_2^0$.</description>

      <title>The separativity problem in terms of varieties and diagonal reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide two new formulations of the separativity problem.
  First, it is known that separativity (and strong separativity) in von Neumann regular (and exchange) rings is tightly connected to unit-regularity of certain kinds of elements. By refining this information, we characterize separative regular rings in terms of a special type of inner inverse operation, which is defined via a single identity. This shows that the separative regular rings form a subvariety of the regular rings. The separativity problem reduces to the question of whether every element of the form $(1-aa')bac(1-a'a)$ in a regular ring is unit-regular, where $a'$ is an inner inverse for $a$.
  Second, it is known that separativity in exchange rings is equivalent to regular matrices over corner rings being reducible to diagonal matrices via elementary row and column operations. We show that for $2\times 2$ invertible matrices, four elementary operations are sufficient, and in general also necessary. Dropping the invertibility hypothesis, but specializing to separative regular rings, we show that three elementary row operations together with three elementary column operations are sufficient, and again in general also necessary. The separativity problem can subsequently be reframed in terms of the explicit number of operations needed to diagonally reduce.</description>

      <title>Congruence invariants of matrix mutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent work of R. Casals on binary invariants for matrix mutation, we study the matrix congruence relation on quasi-Cartan matrices. In particular, we obtain a classification and determine normal forms modulo 4. As an application, we obtain new mutation invariants, which include the one obtained by R. Casals.</description>

      <title>Semibrick-cosilting correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Lambda$ be a finite dimensional algebra. In this paper we show that there is a natural bijection between cosilting modules in Mod$\Lambda$ and semibricks in Mod$\Lambda$ satisfying some condition. Also this bijection restricts to a bijection between all semibricks in mod$\Lambda$ and a certain subclass of cosilting modules. These bijections are generalizations of Asai's correspondence [7] between support $\tau^-$-tilting modules and right finite semibricks.</description>

      <title>First-order factors of linear Mahler operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and compare two algorithms for computing first-order right-hand factors in the ring of linear Mahler operators$\ell_r M^r + \dots + \ell_1 M + \ell_0$where $\ell_0, \dots, \ell_r$ are polynomials in~$x$ and $Mx = x^b M$ for some integer $b \geq 2$. In other words, we give algorithms for finding all formal infinite product solutions of linear functional equations$\ell_r(x) f(x^{b^r}) + \dots + \ell_1(x) f(x^b) + \ell_0(x) f(x) = 0$. The first of our algorithms is adapted from Petkov\v{s}ek's classical algorithm forthe analogous problem in the case of linear recurrences. The second one proceeds by computing a basis of generalized power series solutions of the functional equation and by using Hermite-Pad{\'e} approximants to detect those linear combinations of the solutions that correspond to first-order factors. We present implementations of both algorithms and discuss their use in combination with criteria from the literature to prove the differential transcendence of power series solutions of Mahler equations.</description>

      <title>Foxby equivalence relative to $C$-$fp_n$-injective and $C$-$fp_{n}$-flat modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.02277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.02277v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ and $S$ be rings, $C= {}_SC_R$ a (faithfully) semidualizing bimodule, and $n$ a positive integer or $n=\infty$. In this paper, we introduce the concepts of $C$-$fp_n$-injective $R$-modules and $C$-$fp_n$-flat $S$-modules as a common generalization of some known modules such as $C$-$FP_{n}$-injective (resp. $C$-weak injective) $R$-modules and $C$-$FP_{n}$-flat (resp. $C$-weak flat) $S$-modules. Then we investigate $C$-$fp_{n}$-injective and $C$-$fp_{n}$-flat dimensions of modules, where the classes of these modules, namely $Cfp_nI(R)_{\leq k}$ and $Cfp_nF(S)_{\leq k}$, respectively. We study Foxby equivalence relative to these classes, and also the existence of $Cfp_nI(R)_{\leq k}$ and $Cfp_nF(S)_{\leq k}$ preenvelopes and covers. Finally, we study the exchange properties of these classes, as well as preenvelopes (resp. precovers) and Foxby equivalence, under almost excellent extensions of rings.</description>

      <title>GLS homogenization tilde map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the construction of a cluster algebra on the homogeneous coordinate ring of a partial flag variety by Gei{\ss}, Leclerc and Schr{\"{o}}er, they defined a special map denoted by ``tilde". This map lifts each element $f$ of the coordinate ring of a Schubert cell uniquely to an element $\widetilde{f}$ of the (multi-homogeneous) coordinate ring of the corresponding partial flag variety. The significance of this map appears from its essential role; it lifts the cluster algebra of the coordinate ring of a cell to a cluster algebra living in the coordinate ring of the corresponding partial flag variety. This paper takes a closer look at this map and gives an explicit algorithm to calculate it for the \textit{generalized minors}.</description>

      <title>Factorized $A_2$-Leonard pair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of factorized $A_2$-Leonard pair is introduced. It is defined as a rank 2 Leonard pair, with actions in certain bases corresponding to the root system of the Weyl group $A_2$, and with some additional properties. The functions arising as entries of transition matrices are bivariate orthogonal polynomials (of Tratnik type) with bispectral properties. Examples of factorized $A_2$-Leonard pairs are constructed using classical Leonard pairs associated to families of orthogonal polynomials of the ($q$-)Askey scheme. The most general examples are associated to an intricate product of univariate ($q$-)Hahn and dual ($q$-)Hahn polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, first, we introduce a notion of modified Rota-Baxter Lie algebras of weight $\mathrm{\lambda}$ with derivations (or simply modified Rota-Baxter LieDer pairs) and their representations. Moreover, we investigate cohomologies of a modified Rota-Baxter LieDer pairs with coefficients in a suitable representation. As applications, we study formal one-parameter deformations and abelian extensions of modified Rota-Baxter LieDer pairs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider residue structures $R/G$ where $(G,+)$ is an additive subgroup of a ring $(R,+,\cdot)$, not necessarily an ideal. Special instances include Krasner's construction of quotient hyperfields, and Pumpluen's construction of nonassociative algebras. The residue construction, treated formally, satisfies the Noether isomorphism theorems, and also is cast in a broader categorical setting which includes categorical products, sums, and tensor products.</description>
