      <title>A Talenti comparison result for a class of Neumann boundary value problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a comparison principle in terms of Lorentz norms and point-wise inequalities between a positive solution $u$ to the Poisson equation with non-homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions and a specific positive solution $v$ to the Schwartz symmetrized problem, which is related to $u$ through an additional boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Concavity and perturbed concavity for $p$-Laplace equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study convexity properties for quasilinear Lane-Emden-Fowler equations of the type $$ \begin{cases} -\Delta_p u = a(x) u^q &amp; \quad \hbox{ in $\Omega$},\\ u &gt;0 &amp; \quad \hbox{ in $\Omega$}, \\ u =0 &amp; \quad \hbox{ on $\partial \Omega$}, \end{cases} $$ when $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a convex domain. In particular, in the subhomogeneous case $q \in [0,p-1]$, the solution $u$ inherits concavity properties from $a$ whenever assumed, while it is proved to be concave up to an error if $a$ is near to a constant. More general cases are also taken into account, including a wider class of nonlinearities. These results generalize some contained in [Kennington, Indiana Univ. Math. J., 1985] and [Sakaguchi, Ann. Sc. Norm. Super. Pisa, 1987].
  Additionally, some results for the singular case $q \in [-1,0)$ and the superhomogeneous case $q&gt;p-1$, $q \approx p-1$ are obtained. Some properties for the $p$-fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^s_p$, $s\in (0,1)$, $s \approx 1$, are shown as well.
  We highlight that some results are new even in the semilinear case $p=2$; in some of these cases, we deduce also uniqueness (and nondegeneracy) of the critical point of $u$.</description>

      <title>Refined asymptotics for the Cauchy problem for the fast $p$-Laplace evolution equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our focus is on the fast diffusion equation $\partial_t u=\Delta_p u$ with $p&lt;2$ in the whole Euclidean space of dimension $N\geq 2$. The properties of the solutions to the $p$-Laplace Cauchy problem change in several special values of the parameter $p$.
  In the range of $p$ when mass is conserved, non-negative and integrable solutions behave like the Barenblatt (or fundamental) solutions for large times. By making use of the entropy method, we establish the polynomial rates of the convergence in the uniform relative error for a natural class of initial data. The convergence was established in the literature for $p$ close to $2$, but no rates were available. In particular, we allow for the values of $p$, for which the entropy is not displacement convex, as we do not apply the optimal transportation tools.
  We approach the issue of long-term asymptotics of the gradients of solutions. In fact, in the case of the radial initial datum, we provide also polynomial rates of the uniform convergence in the relative error of radial derivatives of solutions for $\frac{2N}{N+2}&lt;p&lt;2$.
  Finally, providing an analysis of needed properties of solutions for the entropy method to work, we open the question on the full description of the basin of attraction of the Bareblatt solutions for $p$ close to $1$.</description>

      <title>Differentiability of solutions for a degenerate fully nonlinear free transmission problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a fully nonlinear free transmission problem in the presence of general degeneracy terms. Under minimal conditions on the degeneracy of the model, we establish the existence of viscosity solutions for the associated Dirichlet problem. Once the existence of solutions has been established, we focus on their regularity estimates. By imposing a Dini-continuity condition on the degeneracy laws involved in the model, we prove that viscosity solutions are locally differentiable.</description>

      <title>Critical Mass Phenomena and Blow-up behavior of Ground States in stationary second order Mean-Field Games systems with decreasing cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of Mean-field Games (MFG) systems in the mass critical exponent case. We firstly establish the optimal Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequality associated with the potential-free MFG system. Then, under some mild assumptions on the potential function, we show that there exists a critical mass $M^*$ such that the MFG system admits a least energy solution if and only if the total mass of population density $M$ satisfies $M&lt;M^*$. Moreover, the blow-up behavior of energy minimizers are captured as $M\nearrow M^*$. In particular, given the precise asymptotic expansions of the potential, we establish the refined blow-up behavior of ground states as $M\nearrow M^*.$ While studying the existence of least energy solutions, we establish new local $W^{2,p}$ estimates of solutions to Hamilton-Jacobi equations with superlinear gradient terms.</description>

      <title>A Convergence result for a Stefan problem with phase relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the model of phase relaxation introduced in [22], where an asymptotic analysis is performed toward an integral formulation of the Stefan problem when the relaxation parameter approaches zero. Assuming the natural physical assumption that the initial condition of the phase is constrained, but taking more general boundary conditions, we prove that the solution of this relaxed model converges in a stronger way to the solution of the classical weak Stefan problem.</description>

      <title>Liouville type theorems for dual nonlocal evolution equations involving Marchaud derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a Liouville type theorem for the homogeneous dual fractional parabolic equation \begin{equation}
  \partial^\alpha_t u(x,t)+(-\Delta)^s u(x,t) = 0\ \ \mbox{in}\ \ \mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R} . \end{equation} where $0&lt;\alpha,s&lt;1$. Under an asymptotic assumption $$\liminf_{|x|\rightarrow\infty}\frac{u(x,t)}{|x|^\gamma}\geq 0 \; ( \mbox{or} \; \leq 0) \,\,\mbox{for some} \;0\leq\gamma\leq 1, $$ in the case $\frac{1}{2}&lt;s &lt; 1$, we prove that all solutions in the sense of distributions of above equation must be constant by employing a method of Fourier analysis. Our result includes the previous Liouville theorems on harmonic functions \cite{ABR} and on $s$-harmonic functions \cite{CDL} as special cases and it is still novel even restricted to one-sided Marchaud fractional equations, and our methods can be applied to a variety of dual nonlocal parabolic problems.
  In the process of deriving our main result, through very delicate calculations, we obtain an optimal estimate on the decay rate of $\left[D_{\rm right}^\alpha+(-\Delta)^s\right] \varphi(x,t)$ for functions in Schwartz space. This sharp estimate plays a crucial role in defining the solution in the sense of distributions and will become a useful tool in the analysis of this family of equations.</description>

      <title>Homogenization in 3D thin domains with oscillating boundaries of different orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an extension of the unfolding operator technique, initially applied to two-dimensional domains, to the realm of three-dimensional thin domains. The advancement of this methodology is pivotal, as it enhances our understanding and analysis of three-dimensional geometries, which are crucial in various practical fields such as engineering and physics. Our work delves into the asymptotic behavior of solutions to a reaction-diffusion equation with Neumann boundary conditions set within such a oscillatory 3-dimensional thin domain. The method introduced enables the deduction of effective problems across all scenarios, tackling the intrinsic complexity of these domains. This complexity is especially pronounced due to the possibility of diverse types of oscillations occurring along their boundaries.</description>

      <title>Elliptic and parabolic problems in thin domains with doubly weak oscillatory boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we consider higher dimensional thin domains with the property that both boundaries, bottom and top, present oscillations of weak type. We consider the Laplace operator with Neumann boundary conditions and analyze the behavior of the solutions as the thin domains shrinks to a fixed domain $\omega\subset \R^n$. We obtain the convergence of the resolvent of the elliptic operators in the sense of compact convergence of operators, which in particular implies the convergence of the spectra. This convergence of the resolvent operators will allow us to conclude the global dynamics, in terms of the global attractors of a reaction diffusion equation in the thin domains. In particular, we show the upper semicontinuity of the attractors and stationary states. An important case treated is the case of a quasiperiodic situation, where the bottom and top oscillations are periodic but with period rationally independent.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness, non-degeneracy, and exact multiplicity of positive solutions for superlinear elliptic problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus our attention on the positive solutions to second-order nonlinear ordinary differential equations of the form $u''+q(t)g(u)=0$, where $q$ is a sign-changing weight and $g$ is a superlinear function. We exploit the classical shooting approach and the comparison theorem to present non-degeneracy and exact multiplicity results for positive solutions. This completes the multiplicity results obtained by Feltrin and Zanolin. Numerical examples and some related open problems are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Comparison Principles for the Finsler Infinity Laplacian with Applications to Minimal Lipschitz Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proves comparison principles for elliptic PDE involving the Finsler infinity Laplacian, a second-order differential operator with discontinuities in the gradient variable arising in $L^{\infty}$-variational problems and tug-of-war games. The core of the paper consists in proving generalized cone comparison principles. Among other consequences, these results imply that, for any Finsler norm $\varphi$ in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, a function $u$ is a $\varphi$-absolutely minimizing Lipschitz extension if and only if it is a viscosity solution of the $\varphi$-infinity Laplace equation, settling a longstanding question in the $L^{\infty}$-calculus of variations. The proofs combine new geometric constructions with classical notions from convex analysis.</description>

      <title>A review on two types of sonic interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, two examples of sonic interfaces are presented. The first example shows the case of sonic interfaces as weak discontinuities in self-similar shock configurations of unsteady Euler system. The second example shows the case of sonic interfaces as regular interfaces in accelerating transonic flows governed by the steady Euler-Poisson system with self-generated electric forces. And, we discuss analytic differences of the two examples, and introduce an open problem on decelerating transonic solution to the steady Euler-Poisson system.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation for indefinite weighted $p$-laplacian problems with slightly subcritical nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a superlinear elliptic boundary value problem involving the $p$-laplacian operator, with changing sign weights. The problem has positive solutions bifurcating from the trivial solution set at the two principal eigenvalues of the corresponding linear weighted boundary value problem. The two principal eigenvalues are bifurcation points from the trivial solution set to positive solutions.
  Drabek's bifurcation result applies when the nonlinearity is of power growth. We extend Drabek's bifurcation result to {\it slightly subcritical} nonlinearities. Compactness in this setting is a delicate issue obtained via Orlicz spaces.</description>

      <title>On the fine structure of the solutions to nonlinear thin two-membrane problems in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a structure theorem for the solutions of nonlinear thin two-membrane problems in dimension two. Using the theory of quasi-conformal maps, we show that the difference of the sheets is topologically equivalent to a solution of the linear thin obstacle problem, thus inheriting its free boundary structure. More precisely, we show that even in the nonlinear case the branching points can only occur in finite number. We apply our methods to one-phase free boundaries approaching a fixed analytic boundary and to the solutions of a one-sided two-phase Bernoulli problem.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity of solutions for mixed local-nonlocal elliptic equations with singular nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will prove multiplicity results for the mixed local-nonlocal elliptic equation of the form \begin{eqnarray} \begin{split} -\Delta_pu+(-\Delta)_p^s u&amp;=\frac{\lambda}{u^{\gamma}}+u^r \text { in } \Omega, \\u&amp;&gt;0 \text{ in } \Omega,\\u&amp;=0 \text { in }\mathbb{R}^n \backslash \Omega; \end{split} \end{eqnarray} where \begin{equation*} (-\Delta )_p^s u(x)= c_{n,s}\operatorname{P.V.}\int_{\mathbb{R}^n}\frac{|u(x)-u(y)|^{p-2}(u(x)-u(y))}{|x-y|^{n+sp}} d y, \end{equation*} and $-\Delta_p$ is the usual $p$-Laplace operator. Under the assumptions that $\Omega$ is a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with regular enough boundary, $p&gt;1$, $n&gt; p$, $s\in(0,1)$, $\lambda&gt;0$ and $r\in(p-1,p^*-1)$ where $p^*$ is the critical Sobolev exponent, we will show there exist at least two weak solutions to our problem for $0&lt;\gamma&lt;1$ and some certain values of $\lambda$. Further, for every $\gamma&gt;0$, assuming strict convexity of $\Omega$, for $p=2$ and $s\in(0,1/2)$, we will show the existence of at least two positive weak solutions to the problem, for small values of $\lambda$, extending the result of \cite{garaingeometric}. Here $c_{n,s}$ is a suitable normalization constant, and $\operatorname{P.V.}$ stands for Cauchy Principal Value.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many isolas of modulational instability for Stokes waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the long-standing conjecture regarding the existence of infinitely many high-frequency modulational instability ``isolas" for a Stokes wave in arbitrary depth $ \mathtt{h} &gt; 0 $, subject to longitudinal perturbations. We completely describe the spectral bands with non-zero real part away from the origin of the $L^2(\mathbb{R})$-spectrum of the water waves system linearized at a Stokes waves of small amplitude $ \epsilon &gt; 0 $. The unstable spectrum is the union of isolas of elliptical shape, parameterized by integers $ \mathtt{p}\geq 2 $, with semiaxis of size $ |\beta_1^{(\mathtt{p})} (\mathtt{h})| \epsilon^\mathtt{p}+ O(\epsilon^{\mathtt{p}+1} )$ where $\beta_1^{( \mathtt{p})} (\mathtt{h})$ is a nonzero analytic function of the depth $ \mathtt{h} $ that depends on the Taylor coefficients of the Stokes waves up to order $\mathtt{p}$.</description>

      <title>On the Effect of Geometry on Scaling Laws for a Class of Martensitic Phase Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study scaling laws for singular perturbation problems associated with a class of two-dimensional martensitic phase transformations and deduce a domain dependence of the scaling law in the singular perturbation parameter. In these settings the respective scaling laws give rise to a selection principle for specific, highly symmetric domain geometries for the associated nucleation microstructure. More precisely, firstly, we prove a general lower bound estimate illustrating that in settings in which the domain and well geometry are incompatible in the sense of the Hadamard-jump condition, then necessarily at least logarithmic losses in the singular perturbation parameter occur in the associated scaling laws. Secondly, for specific phase transformations in two-dimensional settings we prove that this gives rise to a dichotomy involving logarithmic losses in the scaling law for generic domains and optimal linear scaling laws for very specific, highly compatible polygonal domains. In these situations the scaling law thus gives important insight into optimal isoperimetric domains. We discuss both the geometrically linearized and nonlinear settings.</description>

      <title>Quantitative fluid approximation in fractional regimes of transport equations with more invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an extension of results in a previous paper by the first and the last author [PMP, 2022] about macroscopic limits of linear kinetic equations in (potentially) fractional regimes. More precisely, we develop a unified framework inspired by Ellis and Pinsky [J. Math. Pures Appl., 1975] for operators that preserve mass, momentum and energy, and have microscopic equilibrium with heavy tails (typically polynomial). This paper also generalizes one of Hittmeir and Merino [KRM, 2016] in a related framework. The main difficulty, that leads to our main contribution, is the understanding of the spectrum of the generator in the Fourier space, which is significantly complicated by the lack of spectral gap and the fat tails of the equilibrium. Indeed, the scaling of the eigenelements in the suitable macroscopic rescaling is subtle to handle. In particular, our study uncovered an interesting difference in scaling in the fractional regime, where the transversal wave eigenvalues converge faster to zero than the Boussinesq and acoustic wave eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Local minima in Newton's aerodynamical problem and inequalities between norms of partial derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem considered first by I. Newton (1687) consists in finding a surface of the minimal frontal resistance in a parallel flow of non-interacting point particles. The standard formulation assumes that the surface is convex with a given convex base $\Omega$ and a bounded altitude. Newton found the solution for surfaces of revolution. Without this assumption the problem is still unsolved, although many important results have been obtained in the last decades. We consider the problem to characterize the domains $\Omega$ for which the flat surface gives a local minimum. We show that this problem can be reduced to an inequality between $L_2$-norms of partial derivatives for bivariate concave functions on a convex domain that vanish on the boundary. Can the ratio between those norms be arbitrarily large? The answer depends on the geometry of the domain. A complete criterion is derived, which also solves the local minimality problem.</description>

      <title>Topological bifurcations in a mean-field game</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean-field games (MFG) provide a statistical physics inspired modeling framework for decision making in large-populations of strategic, non-cooperative agents. Mathematically, these systems consist of a forward-backward in time system of two coupled nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), namely the Fokker-Plank and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, governing the agent state and control distribution, respectively. In this work, we study a finite-time MFG with a rich global bifurcation structure using a reduced-order model (ROM). The ROM is a 4D two-point boundary value problem obtained by restricting the controlled dynamics to first two moments of the agent state distribution, i.e., the mean and the variance. Phase space analysis of the ROM reveals that the invariant manifolds of periodic orbits around the so-called `ergodic MFG equilibrium' play a crucial role in determining the bifurcation diagram, and impart a topological signature to various solution branches. We show a qualitative agreement of these results with numerical solutions of the full-order MFG PDE system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.01011v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated existence of global weak solutions for a system of chemotaxis type with nonlinear degenerate diffusion, arising in modelling Multiple Sclerosis disease. The model consists of three equations describing the evolution of macrophages ($m$), cytokine ($c$) and apoptotic oligodendrocytes ($d$). The main novelty in our work is the presence of a nonlinear diffusivity $D(m)$, which results to be more appropriate from the modelling point of view. Under suitable assumptions and for sufficiently regular initial data, adapting the strategy in [30,44], we show the existence of global bounded solutions for the model analysed.</description>

      <title>The free boundary for a semilinear non-homogeneous Bernoulli problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the classical homogeneous one-phase Bernoulli-type problem, the free boundary consists of a "regular" part and a "singular" part, as Alt and Caffarelli have shown in their pioneer work (J. Reine Angew. Math., 325, 105-144, 1981) that regular points are $C^{1,\gamma}$ in two-dimensions. Later, Weiss (J. Geom. Anal., 9, 317-326, 1999) first realized that in higher dimensions a critical dimension $d^{*}$ exists so that the singularities of the free boundary can only occur when $d\geqslant d^{*}$.
  In this paper, we consider a non-homogeneous semilinear one-phase Bernoulli-type problem, and we show that the free boundary is a disjoint union of a regular and a singular set. Moreover, the regular set is locally the graph of a $C^{1,\gamma}$ function for some $\gamma\in(0,1)$. In addition, there exists a critical dimension $d^{*}$ so that the singular set is empty if $d&lt;d^{*}$, discrete if $d=d^{*}$ and of locally finite $\mathcal{H}^{d-d^{*}}$ Hausdorff measure if $d&gt;d^{*}$. As a byproduct, we relate the existence of viscosity solutions of a non-homogeneous problem to the Weiss-boundary adjusted energy, which provides an alternative proof to existence of viscosity solutions for non-homogeneous problems.</description>

      <title>Harnack inequalities for kinetic integral equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deal with a wide class of kinetic equations, $$ \big[ \partial_t + v\cdot\nabla_x\big] f = \mathcal{L}_v f. $$ Above, the diffusion term $\mathcal{L}_v$ is an integro-differential operator, whose nonnegative kernel is of fractional order $s\in(0,1)$ having merely measurable coefficients. Amongst other results, we are able to prove that nonnegative weak solutions $f$ do satisfy $$ \sup_{Q^-} f \ \leq \ c\inf_{Q^+} f, $$ where $Q^{\pm}$ are suitable slanted cylinders. No a-priori boundedness is assumed, as usually in the literature, since we are also able to prove a general interpolation inequality in turn giving local boundedness which is valid even for weak subsolutions with no sign assumptions.
  To our knowledge, this is the very first time that a strong Harnack inequality is proven for kinetic integro-differential-type equations.
  A new independent result, a Besicovitch-type covering argument for very general kinetic geometries, is also stated and proved.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the fractional Hardy-H\'enon equation with fractional Brownian noise $$ \partial_t u(t)+(-\Delta)^{\theta/2} u(t)=|x|^{-\gamma} |u(t)|^{p-1}u(t)+\mu \partial_t B^H(t), $$ where $\theta&gt;0$, $p&gt;1$, $\gamma\geq 0$, $\mu \in\mathbb{R}$, and the random forcing $B^H$ is the fractional Brownian motion defined on some complete probability space $(\Omega, \mathcal{F}, \mathbb{P})$ with Hurst parameter $H\in (0,1)$. We obtain the local existence and uniqueness of mild solutions under tailored conditions on the parameters of the equation.</description>

      <title>Unique continuation at the boundary for divergence form elliptic equations on quasiconvex domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ be a quasiconvex Lipschitz domain and $A(x)$ be a $d \times d$ uniformly elliptic, symmetric matrix with Lipschitz coefficients. Assume a nontrivial $u$ solves $-\nabla \cdot (A(x) \nabla u) = 0$ in $\Omega$, and $u$ vanishes on $\Sigma = \partial \Omega \cap B$ for some ball $B$. The main contribution of this paper is to demonstrate the existence of a countable collection of open balls $(B_i)_i$ such that the restriction of $u$ to $B_i \cap \Omega$ maintains a consistent sign. Furthermore, for any compact subset $K$ of $\Sigma$, the set difference $K \setminus \bigcup_i B_i$ is shown to possess a Minkowski dimension that is strictly less than $d - 1 - \epsilon$. As a consequence, we prove Lin's conjecture in quasiconvex domains.</description>

      <title>Sobolev and H\"older Estimates for Homotopy Operators of The $\overline\partial$-Equation on Convex Domains of Finite Multitype</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.15830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct homotopy formulas for the $\overline\partial$-equation on convex domains of finite type that have optimal Sobolev and H\"older estimates. For a bounded smooth finite type convex domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb C^n$ that has $q$-type $m_q$ for $1\le q\le n$, our $\overline\partial$ solution operator $\mathcal H_q$ on $(0,q)$-forms has (fractional) Sobolev boundedness $\mathcal H_q:H^{s,p}\to H^{s+1/m_q,p}$ and H\"older-Zygmund boundedness $\mathcal H_q:\mathscr C^s\to\mathscr C^{s+1/m_q}$ for all $s\in\mathbb R$ and $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$. We also show the $L^p$-boundedness $\mathcal H_q:H^{s,p}\to H^{s,pr_q/(r_q-p)}$ for all $s\in\mathbb R$ and $1&lt;p&lt;r_q$, where $r_q:=(n-q+1)m_q+2q$.</description>

      <title>Regularized Stein Variational Gradient Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.07861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) algorithm is a deterministic particle method for sampling. However, a mean-field analysis reveals that the gradient flow corresponding to the SVGD algorithm (i.e., the Stein Variational Gradient Flow) only provides a constant-order approximation to the Wasserstein Gradient Flow corresponding to the KL-divergence minimization. In this work, we propose the Regularized Stein Variational Gradient Flow, which interpolates between the Stein Variational Gradient Flow and the Wasserstein Gradient Flow. We establish various theoretical properties of the Regularized Stein Variational Gradient Flow (and its time-discretization) including convergence to equilibrium, existence and uniqueness of weak solutions, and stability of the solutions. We provide preliminary numerical evidence of the improved performance offered by the regularization.</description>

      <title>Scattering for the Wave Equation on de Sitter Space in All Even Spatial Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07342v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any $n\geq4$ even, we establish a complete scattering theory for the linear wave equation on the $(n+1)$-dimensional de Sitter space. We prove the existence and uniqueness of scattering states, and asymptotic completeness. Moreover, we construct the scattering map taking asymptotic data at past infinity $\mathscr{I}^-$ to asymptotic data at future infinity $\mathscr{I}^+$. Identifying $\mathscr{I}^-$ and $\mathscr{I}^+$ with $S^n,$ we prove that the scattering map is a Banach space isomorphism on $H^{s+n}(S^n)\times H^{s}(S^n),$ for any $s\geq1.$
  The main analysis is carried out at the level of the model equation obtained by differentiating the linear wave equation $\frac{n}{2}$ times in the time variable. The main result of the paper follows from proving a scattering theory for this equation. In particular, for the model equation we construct a scattering isomorphism from asymptotic data in $H^{s+\frac{1}{2}}(S^n)\times H^s(S^n)\times H^s(S^n)$ to Cauchy initial data in $H^{s+\frac{1}{2}}(S^n)\times H^{s+\frac{1}{2}}(S^n)\times H^{s-\frac{1}{2}}(S^n)$.</description>
