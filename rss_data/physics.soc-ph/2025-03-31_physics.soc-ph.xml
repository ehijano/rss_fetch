      <title>Noise-induced transition to stop-and-go waves in single-file traffic rationalized by an analogy with Kapitza's inverted pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stop-and-go waves in vehicular traffic are commonly explained as a linear collective instability induced by e.g. response delays. We explore an alternative mechanism that more faithfully mirrors oscillation formation in dense single-file traffic. Stochastic noise plays a key role in this model; as it is increased, the base (uniform) flow abruptly switches to stop-and-go dynamics despite its unconditional linear stability. We elucidate the instability mechanism and rationalize it quantitatively by likening the system to a cyclically driven Kapitza pendulum.</description>

      <title>Reputation in public goods cooperation under double Q-learning protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and resolving cooperation dilemmas are key challenges in evolutionary game theory, which have revealed several mechanisms to address them. This paper investigates the comprehensive influence of multiple reputation-related components on public cooperation. In particular, cooperative investments in public goods game are not fixed but simultaneously depend on the reputation of group organizers and the population's cooperation willingness, hence indirectly impacting on the players' income. Additionally, individual payoff can also be directly affected by their reputation via a weighted approach which effectively evaluates the actual income of players. Unlike conventional models, the reputation change of players is non-monotonic, but may transform abruptly due to specific actions. Importantly, a theoretically supported double Q-learning algorithm is introduced to avoid overestimation bias inherent from the classical Q-learning algorithm. Our simulations reveal a significantly improved cooperation level, that is explained by a detailed Q-value analysis. We also observe the lack of massive cooperative clusters in the absence of network reciprocity. At the same time, as an intriguing phenomenon, some actors maintain moderate reputation and are continuously flipping between cooperation and defection. The robustness of our results are validated by mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>Science4Peace: A Plea for Continued Peaceful International Scientific Cooperation (Input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics -- 2026 update)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European Strategy for Particle Physics (ESPP) - 2026 update is taking place in a turbulent international climate. Many of the norms that have governed relations between states for decades are being broken or challenged. The future progress of science in general, and particle physics in particular, will depend on our ability to maintain peaceful international scientific collaboration in the face of political pressures. We plead that the ESPP 2026 update acknowledge explicitly the importance of peaceful international scientific collaboration, not only for the progress of science, but also as a precious bridge between geopolitical blocs.

      <title>Network topology effects on the social circle polls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Election polls play a critical role in political discussions by probing public opinion and enabling political parties to assess their performance before elections. However, traditional polling methods sometimes fail to predict election outcomes accurately, leading researchers to explore new methodologies. One such approach is the "social circle" question, which asks respondents about the voting preferences of their social contacts. This method leverages collective intelligence and has shown promise in improving predictive accuracy. Nevertheless, the influence of the social network's topology on the effectiveness of social circle polls remains unexplored. In this study, we develop a theoretical framework to analyse how social network structure affects polling accuracy. By simulating voter networks with varying levels of polarisation and connectivity, we assess the performance of both standard and social circle polling methods. Our findings indicate that while social circle polls generally outperform traditional approaches, certain network characteristics can introduce biases and undermine their performances, particularly in polarised situations, which are increasingly frequent in the current political landscape. To address these challenges, we propose a new estimator that combines information from both standard and social circle polls, improving election outcome predictions. We demonstrate the applicability of our method using real-world polling data from the 2016 U.S. presidential election, showcasing its practical utility and providing an estimate of the polarisation level in that society. This work establishes a foundation for enhancing polling methodologies by assessing and integrating network features, which has significant implications for social and political research.</description>

      <title>Polarisation in increasingly connected societies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explanations of polarization often rely on one of the three mechanisms: homophily, bounded confidence, and community-based interactions. Models based on these mechanisms consider the lack of interactions as the main cause of polarization. Given the increasing connectivity in modern society, this explanation of polarization may be insufficient. We aim to show that in involvement-based models, society becomes more polarized as its connectedness increases. To this end, we propose a minimal voter-type model (called I-voter) that incorporates involvement as a key mechanism in opinion formation and study its dependence on network connectivity. We describe the steady-state behaviour of the model analytically, at the mean-field and the moment-hierarchy levels.</description>

      <title>Mean field model of contagion processes in urban traffic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence for the emergence of macroscopic epidemic type behavior, in the form of Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) or Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) processes in urban traffic congestion from microscopic network flows is given. Moreover, it's shown that the emergence of SIS/SIR implies a relationship between traffic flow and density, which is consistent with observations of the so called Fundamental Diagram of Traffic, which is a characteristic signature of vehicle movement phenomena that spans multiple scales. Our results provide a plausible explanation for this scale-spanning signature and put in more firm grounds recent findings that indicate that traffic congestion at the aggregate level can be modeled by simple contagion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Mapping the changing structure of science through diachronic periodical embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the changing structure of science over time is essential to elucidating how science evolves. We develop diachronic embeddings of scholarly periodicals to quantify "semantic changes" of periodicals across decades, allowing us to track the evolution of research topics and identify rapidly developing fields. By mapping periodicals within a physical-life-health triangle, we reveal an evolving interdisciplinary science landscape, finding an overall trend toward specialization for most periodicals but increasing interdisciplinarity for bioscience periodicals. Analyzing a periodical's trajectory within this triangle over time allows us to visualize how its research focus shifts. Furthermore, by monitoring the formation of local clusters of periodicals, we can identify emerging research topics such as AIDS research and nanotechnology in the 1980s. Our work offers novel quantification in the science of science and provides a quantitative lens to examine the evolution of science, which may facilitate future investigations into the emergence and development of research fields.</description>

      <title>Detection of an extraterrestrial technical civilisation on the extrasolar planet GJ 1132b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the detection of whisky in the atmosphere of the extrasolar super-Earth planet GJ 1132b from transmission spectroscopic data. It is seen both in atmospheric absorption as well as in chromospheric emission, the latter probably due to the intense heating of the co-rotating planet's day-side surface. This detection cannot be explained using natural sources of alcohol, implying that there must be a technically advanced civilisation -- possibly originating from the neighboring habitable planet GJ 1132c -- that is engaged in massive distilling operations accompanied by high levels of industrial pollution. The reason for the necessarily vast scale of production is either to produce rocket fuel for an interplanetary economy or, more likely, for an unusually high level of personal consumption. The latter hypothesis suggests a novel explanation for the Fermi Paradox (the lack of indirect or direct contact with extraterrestrials): a technically versed civilisation would be incapable of achieving the higher technical levels necessary for the development of a detectable radio signature -- much less interstellar travel -- at the suggested rates of consumption.</description>

      <title>A Swift analysis of the Eras tour set list and implications for astrophysics research (Taylor's version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Popular culture plays a significant role in shaping public interest in science, and Taylor Swift's discography frequently incorporates astrophysics terminology. This study examines the occurrence of astrophysics-related words in her lyrics and their representation in the Eras tour set list. By analyzing the frequency of words in Swift's total discography, we identify that astrophysics is promoted the most within her most recent album, The Tortured Poets Department, whereas songs from Midnights promoted astrophysics the most throughout the Eras tour. We catagorize words into various disciplines of astrophysics and find that multimessenger astronomy is promoted the most, both in Swift's total discography and throughout the Eras tour. We perform Taylor expansion and predict $12 \pm 5$ astrophysical terms in Swift's next album. This analysis offers a unique perspective on the intersection of music and science, revealing how Swift's artistry may unintentionally promote interest in different fields of astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Predicting and Mitigating Agricultural Price Volatility Using Climate Scenarios and Risk Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agricultural price volatility challenges sustainable finance, planning, and policy, driven by market dynamics and meteorological factors such as temperature and precipitation. In India, the Minimum Support Price (MSP) system acts as implicit crop insurance, shielding farmers from price drops without premium payments. We analyze the impact of climate on price volatility for soybean (Madhya Pradesh), rice (Assam), and cotton (Gujarat). Using ERA5-Land reanalysis data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, we analyze historical climate patterns and evaluate two scenarios: SSP2.4.5 (moderate case) and SSP5.8.5 (severe case). Our findings show that weather conditions strongly influence price fluctuations and that integrating meteorological data into volatility models enhances risk-hedging. Using the Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (EGARCH) model, we estimate conditional price volatility and identify cross-correlations between weather and price volatility movements. Recognizing MSP's equivalence to a European put option, we apply the Black-Scholes model to estimate its implicit premium, quantifying its fiscal cost. We propose this novel market-based risk-hedging mechanism wherein the government purchases insurance equivalent to MSP, leveraging Black-Scholes for accurate premium estimation. Our results underscore the importance of meteorological data in agricultural risk modeling, supporting targeted insurance and strengthening resilience in agricultural finance. This climate-informed financial framework enhances risk-sharing, stabilizes prices, and informs sustainable agricultural policy under growing climate uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Energy Needs with Logistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The logistic function is used to forecast energy consumed worldwide and oil production in the U.S. The logistic substitution model is used to describe the energy mix since 1965 presenting a picture significantly different from the one covering the previous 100 years. In the new picture coal gently gains on oil and hydroelectric gains on natural gas even if it is three times smaller. Finally, renewables (wind, geothermal, solar, biomass, and waste) grow exclusively on the expense of nuclear and are poised to overtake it by the late 2030s. By mid-21st century, coal, oil, and natural gas still remain the main players of comparable size. Hydroelectric has almost doubled in size. The only significant substitution is that of renewables having replaced nuclear albeit remaining at less than one-fourth the size of the other three energy sources. U.S. oil produced by fracking is forecasted to cease by mid-21st century, while oil produced by traditional methods should continue on its slowly declining trend. US oil production is likely to represent less than 1% of the oil consumed worldwide by mid-21st century.</description>

      <title>Beyond Group Means and Into the World of Individuals: A Distributional Spotlight for Experimental Effects on Individuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally, experimental effects on humans are investigated at the group level. In this work, we present a distributional ``spotlight'' to investigate experimental effects at the individual level. Specifically, we estimate the effects on individuals through the changes in the probability distributions of their experimental data across conditions. We test this approach on Reaction Time (RT) data from 10 individuals in a visual search task, examining the effects of (1) information set sizes and (2) the presence or absence of a target on their processing speed. The changes in individuals' RT distributions are measured using three approaches: (i) direct measurements of distributional changes are compared against the changes captured by two established models of RT: (ii) the ex-Gaussian distribution and (iii) the Drift-Diffusion model. We find that direct measurement of distributional changes provides the clearest view of the effects on individuals and highlights the presence of two sub-groups based on the effects experienced: one that shows neither effect and the other showing only the target-presence effect. Moreover, the intra-individual changes across conditions (i.e., the experimental effects) appear much smaller than the inter-individual differences (i.e., the random effects). Generally, these results highlight the merits of going beyond group means and examining the effects on individuals, as well as the effectiveness of the distributional spotlight in such pursuits.</description>

      <title>Stability of Zipf's law and occult spatial dependence effects: A study on the OECD countries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate spatial dependence in Zipf's law for cities among the OECD countries. The aim is to identify an upper tail of the distribution that follows a power law (Pareto) but is perturbed by spatial autocorrelation, as indicated by a coefficient with a significant minor or major deviation from a distribution corresponding to a (non-spatial) Zipf law. For that purpose, we augment the usual Pareto model with a spatial weight matrix and apply SEM/SAR regressions. The results for the OECD countries are mixed. In particular, we investigate the rank-size distribution of cities by estimating local Moran-I coefficients (LISA) along the city ranks to locate the causes of spatial dependence. As an example, we demonstrate the approach for Belgium, a medium-sized OECD country.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1407.2515v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uncovering unknown or missing links in social networks is a difficult task because of their sparsity and because links may represent different types of relationships, characterized by different structural patterns. In this paper, we define a simple yet efficient supervised learning-to-rank framework, called RankMerging, which aims at combining information provided by various unsupervised rankings. We illustrate our method on three different kinds of social networks and show that it substantially improves the performances of unsupervised metrics of ranking. We also compare it to other combination strategies based on standard methods. Finally, we explore various aspects of RankMerging, such as feature selection and parameter estimation and discuss its area of relevance: the prediction of an adjustable number of links on large networks.</description>

      <title>Correlation Improves Group Testing: Modeling Concentration-Dependent Test Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.07517v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Population-wide screening is a powerful tool for controlling infectious diseases. Group testing enables such screening despite limited resources. Viral concentration of pooled samples are often positively correlated, either because prevalence and sample collection are influenced by location, or through intentional enhancement via pooling samples according to risk/household. Such correlation is known to improve efficiency under fixed test sensitivity. However, in reality, a test's sensitivity depends on the concentration of the analyte (e.g., viral RNA), as in the so-called dilution effect, where sensitivity decreases for larger pools. We show that concentration-dependent test error alters correlation's effect under the most widely-used group testing procedure, the two-stage Dorfman procedure. We prove that when test sensitivity increases with concentration, pooling correlated samples together (correlated pooling) achieves asymptotically higher sensitivity than independently pooling the samples (naive pooling). In contrast, in the concentration-independent case, correlation does not affect sensitivity. Moreover, with concentration-dependent errors, correlation can degrade test efficiency compared to naive pooling whereas under concentration-independent errors, correlation always improves efficiency. We propose an alternative measure of test resource usage, the number of positives found per test consumed, which we argue is better aligned with infection control, and show that correlated pooling outperforms naive pooling on this measure. In simulation, we show that the effect of correlation under realistic concentration-dependent test error meaningfully differs from correlation's effect assuming fixed sensitivity. Our findings underscore the importance for policy-makers of using models that incorporate naturally-occurring correlation and of considering ways of strengthening this correlation.</description>

      <title>Ranking nodes in bipartite systems with a non-linear iterative map</title>

Abstract: Ranking nodes in networks according to a defined measure of importance is an extensively studied task, with applications in ecology, economic trade networks, and social networks. This paper introduces a method based on a non-linear iterative map to evaluate node relevance in bipartite networks. By tuning a single parameter $\gamma$, the method captures different concepts of node importance, including established measures like degree centrality, eigenvector centrality and the fitness-complexity ranking. The algorithm's flexibility allows for efficient ranking optimization tailored to specific tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art algorithms. We apply this method to ecological mutualistic networks, where ranking quality can be assessed by the extinction area - the rate at which the system collapses when species are removed in a certain order. The map with the optimal $\gamma$ value surpasses existing ranking methods on this task. Additionally, our method excels in evaluating nestedness, another crucial structural property of ecological systems, requiring specific node rankings. Finally, we explore theoretical aspects of the map, revealing a phase transition at a critical $\gamma$ dependent on the data structure that can be characterized analytically for random networks. Near the critical point, the map exhibits unique features and a distinctive "triangular" packing pattern of the incidence matrix.</description>

      <title>Strong localization blurs criticality of time series for spreading phenomena on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01842v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze critical time series of the order parameter generated with active to inactive phase transitions of spreading dynamics running on the top of heterogeneous networks. Different activation mechanisms that govern the dynamics near the critical point were investigated. The time series were analyzed using the visibility graph (VG) method where a disassortative degree correlation of the VG is a signature of criticality. In contrast, assortative correlation is associated with offcritical dynamics. The signature of criticality given by the VG is confirmed for collective activation phenomena, as in the case of homogeneous networks. Similarly, for a localized activation driven by a densely connected set of hubs, identified by a maximum k-core decomposition, critical times series were also successfully identified by the VG method. However, in the case of activation driven by sparsely distributed hubs, the time series criticality is blurred, being observable only for huge systems. In the case of strong structural localization induced by the presence of rare regions, an assortative VG degree correlation, typical of off-critical series, is observed. We conclude that while macroscopic times series remain good proxies for the analysis of criticality for collective or maximum k-core activation, systems under spatial localization can postpone the signatures of or, in case of extreme localization, lead to false negatives for criticality of time series.</description>
