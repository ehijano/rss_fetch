      <title>ELemental abundances of Planets and brown dwarfs Imaged around Stars (ELPIS): II. The Jupiter-like Inhomogeneous Atmosphere of the First Directly Imaged Planetary-Mass Companion 2MASS 1207 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2MASS 1207 b, the first directly imaged planetary-mass companion, has been instrumental in advancing our understanding of exoplanets and brown dwarfs over the past 20 years. We have performed extensive atmospheric retrieval analyses of 2MASS 1207 b's JWST/NIRSpec spectrum using petitRADTRANS and a new atmospheric inhomogeneity framework, which characterizes homogeneous atmospheres, patchy clouds, cloud-free hot spots, or the combination of patchy clouds and spots. Among 24 retrieval runs with various assumptions, the most statistically preferred model corresponds to the patchy cloud scheme, with Teff$=1174^{+4}_{-3}$ K, log(g)=$3.62^{+0.03}_{-0.02}$ dex, and R$=1.399^{+0.008}_{-0.010}$ R$_{\rm Jup}$, along with near-solar atmospheric compositions of [M/H]$=-0.05\pm0.03$ dex and C/O$=0.440\pm0.012$. This model suggests ~9% of 2MASS 1207 b's atmosphere is covered by thin iron clouds, producing L-dwarf-like spectra, while the remaining 91% consists of thick silicate and iron clouds, emitting blackbody-like spectra. These thin-cloud and thick-cloud regions resemble Jupiter's belts and zones, respectively; this scenario is consistently supported by other retrieval runs incorporating inhomogeneous atmospheres. We demonstrate that 2MASS 1207 b's weak CO absorption can be explained by the veiling effects of patchy thick clouds; the absence of 3.3um CH4 absorption is attributed to its hot thermal structure, which naturally leads to a CO-dominant, CH4-deficient atmosphere. The retrieved atmospheric models also match the observed variability amplitudes of 2MASS 1207 b. Our analysis reveals that the inferred atmospheric properties show significant scatter in less statistically preferred retrieval runs but converge to consistent values among the preferred ones. This underscores the importance of exploring diverse assumptions in retrievals to avoid biased interpretations of atmospheres and formation.</description>

      <title>Halting the migration of super-Earths by efficient gap opening in radiative, low viscosity disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While planet migration has been extensively studied for classical viscous disks, planet-disk interaction in nearly inviscid disks has mostly been explored with greatly simplified thermodynamics. In such environments, motivated by models of wind-driven accretion disks, even Earth-mass planets located interior to 1 au can significantly perturb the disk, carving gaps and exciting vortices on their edges. Both processes are influenced by radiative transfer, which can both drive baroclinic forcing and influence gap opening. We perform a set of high-resolution radiation hydrodynamics simulations of planet-disk interaction in the feedback and gap-opening regimes, aiming to understand the role of radiation transport in the migration of super-Earth-mass planets representative of the observed exoplanet population. We find that radiative cooling drives baroclinic forcing during multiple stages of the planet's migration in the feedback regime (~1.5 M_earth), significantly delaying the onset of vortex formation at the gap edge but ultimately resulting in type-III runaway migration episodes. For super-thermal-mass planets (~6.7 M_earth), radiative cooling is fundamentally linked to the gap opening process, with the planet stalling instead of undergoing vortex-assisted migration as expected from isothermal or adiabatic models. This stalling of migration can only be captured when treating radiative effects, and since it affects super-thermal-mass planets its implications for both the final configuration of planetary systems and population synthesis modeling are potentially huge. Combining our findings with previous related studies, we present a map of migration regimes for radiative, nearly-inviscid disks, with the cooling-mediated gap-opening regime playing a central role in determining the planet's orbital properties.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Parameter Determination of Exoplanet through Asteroseismic Host Star Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study develops a robust framework for exoplanet characterization by leveraging asteroseismic constraints on host stars. Using precise photometric data from missions such as \textit{Kepler} and \textit{TESS}, we derive stellar parameters, including mass, radius, and age, with high accuracy through asteroseismic analysis. These stellar parameters are incorporated as priors in a Bayesian framework to refine planetary properties such as mass, radius, and orbital parameters. By applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, we extract posterior distributions of planetary parameters, achieving significant improvements in precision and reliability. This approach is particularly effective for systems with evolved host stars, where precise stellar properties are essential for resolving uncertainties in planetary characterization. The results demonstrate the importance of asteroseismology in bridging stellar astrophysics and exoplanet science, enabling detailed studies of planetary system architectures and their dependence on host star properties. Our methodology underscores the synergy between stellar and planetary studies, paving the way for future research on exoplanet populations. This work provides a foundation for utilizing data from upcoming missions like \textit{PLATO}, ensuring continued advancements in the precision and scope of exoplanet characterization.</description>

      <title>Origin of the lunar inclination from tidal interaction of multiple-moon system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the giant impact theory, the Moon formed through accreting the debris disk produced by Theia colliding with the early Earth and the predicted lunar inclination is about within one degree when Moon formed. However, the current lunar orbital inclination with five degrees requires the Moon's orbital inclination relative to the Earth's equator to be about ten degrees when traced back to the time of lunar formation. Since two moons are also a natural outcome of simulations of lunar formation from a protolunar disk produced a giant impact, here we show that, under solar perturbation, gravitational tidal interaction between Earth and two moons with orbital inclination of one degree relative to Earth's equatorial plane could lead to the merger of one moon with Earth, or the merger of the two moons or the ejection of one moon, resulting that the remaining moon's orbital inclination relative to Earth's equator could be up to 15 degrees. The theory proposed here may provide a way of explaining the initial large lunar inclination relative to the Earth's equator.</description>

      <title>The bolometric Bond albedo and energy balance of Uranus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a newly developed `holistic' atmospheric model of the aerosol structure in Uranus's atmosphere, based upon observations made by HST/STIS, Gemini/NIFS and IRTF/SpeX from 2000 -- 2009, we make a new estimate the bolometric Bond albedo of Uranus during this time of $A^* = 0.338 \pm 0.011$, with a phase integral of $q^* = 1.36 \pm 0.03$. Then, using a simple seasonal model, developed to be consistent with the disc-integrated blue and green magnitude data from the Lowell Observatory from 1950 to 2016, we model how Uranus's reflectivity and heat budget vary during its orbit and determine new orbital-mean average value for the bolometric Bond albedo of $\overline{A^*} = 0.349 \pm 0.016$ and for the absorbed solar flux of $\overline{P_\mathrm{in}}=0.604 \pm 0.027$ W m$^{-2}$. Assuming the outgoing thermal flux to be $\overline{P_\mathrm{out}}=0.693 \pm 0.013$ W m$^{-2}$, as previously determined from Voyager 2 observations, we arrive at a new estimate of Uranus's average heat flux budget of $P_\mathrm{out}/P_\mathrm{in} = 1.15 \pm 0.06$, finding considerable variation with time due to Uranus's significant orbital eccentricity of 0.046. This leads the flux budget to vary from $P_\mathrm{out}/P_\mathrm{in} = 1.03$ near perihelion, to 1.24 near aphelion. We conclude that although $P_\mathrm{out}/P_\mathrm{in}$ is considerably smaller than for the other giant planets, Uranus is not in thermal equilibrium with the Sun.</description>

      <title>The prebiotic pathway from P-bearing iron meteorites to phosphates by DFT modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the biogenic macroelements, phosphorus is the one bringing the most fascinating and unsolved mysteries for what concern its prebiotic history. It possibly landed on Earth as a metal phosphide (Schreibersite, (Fe,Ni)3P), throughout the Heavy Meteor Bombardment during the Archean Era. Its subsequent corrosion by water led to P-oxygenated compounds, which is the subject of this kinetic computational study, thus complementing our previous thermodynamic characterization. The reaction was studied at periodic DFT level, simulating the water corrosion reaction on the reactive Fe2NiP Schreibersite (001)2 surface. Results show that the timescale of the reaction at 350 K is of few hours.</description>

      <title>Unveiling What Makes Saturn Ring: Quantifying the Amplitudes of Saturn's Planetary Normal-Mode Oscillations and Trends in C-Ring Properties Using Kronoseismology (VII)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certain spiral density waves in Saturn's rings are generated through resonances with planetary normal modes, making them valuable probes of Saturn's internal structure. Previous research has primarily focused on the rotation rates of these waves. However, other characteristics of these waves also contain valuable information about the planet's interior. In this work, we investigate the amplitudes of the waves across the C-ring by analyzing high signal-to-noise profiles derived from phase-corrected averages of occultation profiles obtained by Cassini's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS). By fitting these wave profiles to linear density wave models, we estimate the ring's surface mass density, mass extinction coefficient and effective kinematic viscosity at 34 locations in the C-ring, as well as the amplitude of the gravitational potential perturbations associated with 6 satellite resonances and 28 planetary normal mode resonances.
  Our estimates of the C-ring's mass extinction coefficient, indicate that the typical particle mass density is around 0.3 g/cm^3 interior to 84,000 km, but can get as low as 0.03 g/cm^3 exterior to 84,000 km. We also find the ring's viscosity is reduced in the outer C-ring, which is consistent with the exceptionally high porosity of the particles in this region. Meanwhile, we find the amplitudes of Saturn's normal modes are complex functions of frequency, l and m, implying that multiple factors influence how efficiently these modes are excited. This analysis identified two primary sources of these normal-mode oscillations: a deep source located close to Saturn's core, and a shallow source residing near the surface.</description>

      <title>Preliminary Analysis into the Feasibility of Missions to Asteroid 2024 YR$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently discovered asteroid 2024 YR$_4$ has an orbital period of almost exactly 4 years, a descending node located almost exactly 1 au from the Sun, with a perihelion slightly less than that. Its combination of semi-major axis and perihelion renders it a 'Potentially Hazardous Object' (PHO) in the Apollo class. It now has a low chance of colliding with the Earth on 22 December 2032, yet there is the potential for many further close encounters with Earth into the distant future. This paper investigates the feasibility of missions to this object in the short term, up to and including its close encounter in 2032, and exploits the preliminary mission design software known as 'Optimum Interplanetary Trajectory Software' (OITS). Many flyby opportunities are found with launch windows virtually throughout 2028. Sample Returns are also eminently feasible over this period. Rendezvous missions with 'New Horizons' spacecraft (adopted as a convenient reference mission) are available, although these require launches around late 2028 and early 2029, and with much longer flight durations. In summary it is found that 2024 YR$_4$ represents an 'opportunity rich environment' and bodes well for any future attempts by humanity to either examine this object close up, or even to deflect it if necessary.</description>

      <title>Limited hysteresis in the atmospheric dynamics of hot Jupiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, a coherent picture has emerged of the atmospheric dynamics of hot Jupiters from a combination of three-dimensional general circulation models (GCMs) and astronomical observations. This paradigm consists of hot Jupiters being spin-synchronized due to their close-in orbit, with a resulting large day-to-night irradiation gradient driving a day-to-night temperature contrast. This day-to-night temperature contrast in turn raises day-to-night pressure gradients that are balanced by a circulation with wind speeds on the order of km~s$^{-1}$. The dominant feature of this circulation is a superrotating equatorial jet, maintained by eddy-mean flow interactions that pump momentum into the jet. In this work, I explore the dependence of this circulation paradigm on the initial thermal and dynamical conditions in atmospheric circulation models of hot Jupiters. To do so, I conduct MITgcm simulations of the atmospheric circulation of hot Jupiters with both varying initial wind directions and initial temperature profiles. I find that the results are insensitive to the initial conditions, implying that the current paradigm of hot Jupiter circulation exhibits at most limited hysteresis. I demonstrate that there is a single characteristic wind speed of hot Jupiters for given planetary and atmospheric parameters using an idealized scaling theory, and discuss implications for the interpretation of hot Jupiter observations.</description>

      <title>Cross-Model Validation of Coronagraphic Exposure Time Calculators for the Habitable Worlds Observatory: A Report from the Exoplanet Science Yield sub-Working Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the exoplanet scientific productivity of the Habitable Worlds Observatory requires estimating science exposure times. From exoplanet yields to spectral retrievals, exposure times are at the heart of our understanding of the capabilities of this future mission. As such, ensuring accuracy and consistency between different exposure time calculators (ETCs) is critical. We summarize the efforts of the Exoplanet Science Yield sub-Working Group's ETC Calibration Task Group, which conducted a calibration study from March 4 to June 30 of 2024. We compare three commonly-used coronagraphic exposure time calculators. We find that the ETCs use a broad variety of differing methods, assumptions, and inputs that produce variation in the final exposure times at the ~60% level. The causes for the disagreement have largely been identified, flagged for further development efforts, and in some cases retired since the conclusion of this effort. We expect that addressing the flagged efforts will bring the ETCs to within better than ~30% agreement.</description>

      <title>SED Modeling of Young Stellar Objects in the Orion Star Formation Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed a large-scale spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting analysis for young stellar objects (YSOs) in the Orion star formation complex (OSFC) to derive key physical parameters; temperature, luminosity, mass, and age, using SED models. Our goal is to establish a statistically robust characterization of the stellar population and its evolutionary state across the entire complex. We utilize a set of new radiative transfer model SEDs that span a variety of geometries and parameter spaces. These SEDs are fitted to multi-wavelength photometric data from optical to submillimeter wavelengths. We conducted SED fitting on a sample of 15,396 sources. Among these, 5,062 have at least a reliable AllWISE W3 (12~$\mu$m) detection at longer wavelengths, and 63 have sub-millimeter detections in APEX/SABOCA at 350~$\mu$m or APEX/LABOCA at 870~$\mu$m. The resulting physical parameters are cross-referenced with stellar evolutionary tracks to ensure consistency with theoretical predictions. Sources placed on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram show distinct evolutionary sequences. The results are provided with varying levels of completeness and reliability, depending on the available data for each source. The catalog includes quality indicators such as the flux code, which represents the longest detected wavelength for each source, as well as Prob_W3 and Prob_W4 values that quantify the reliability of the AllWISE W3 and W4 detections. All results, including SED fitting outcomes, uncertainty estimates, and source metadata, are publicly available in a comprehensive CDS table. This dataset provides a statistically significant view of the evolutionary processes within the OSFC. The publicly accessible dataset offers a valuable resource for future studies on star and planet formation.</description>

      <title>FAUST-XXII. Deuteration in the VLA1623-2417 protostellar hot-corinos, cavities, and streamers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of deuterium fractionation is a valuable tool for reconstructing our chemical history from the early prestellar stages to the formation of planets. In the context of the ALMA Large Programme FAUST, we observed formaldehyde, H$_2$CO, and its singly and doubly deuterated forms, HDCO and D$_2$CO, towards the protostellar cluster VLA1623-2417, on scales of ~ 2000 - 50 au. Formaldehyde probes the inner envelopes of the protostars VLA1623A, B, and W, the rotating cavities opened by the VLA1623A outflow, and several streamers. The HDCO and D$_2$CO emissions are observed towards VLA1623A, in its outflow cavities, and in one of the streamers. We estimate the gas temperature from the HDCO lines: T~ 125 K towards VLA1623A, indicating hot-corino emission, lower temperatures in the outflow cavities (20 - 40 K), and in the streamers ($\le15$ K). The D$_2$CO lines also trace the flattened envelope of VLA1623A, where H$_2$CO and HDCO are fainter. This may be due to D$_2$CO formation on dust grains in the cold prestellar phase, and subsequent photodesorption caused by the enhanced UV flux from two nearby B stars. We inferred the molecular deuteration: [HDCO]/[H$_2$CO] ~ 0.16, ~ 0.07 - 0.13, and ~ 0.3; [D$_2$CO]/[H$_2$CO] ~ 0.003, ~ 0.05 - 0.13, and ~ 0.03 in the hot corino, in the outflow cavities, and in the streamer, respectively. The spatial distribution of D$_2$CO, which points to formation on dust grains, and the similar values of [HDCO]/[H$_2$CO] and [D$_2$CO]/[H$_2$CO] in the components of the system, suggest that deuterium fractionation occurs at the prestellar stage and is then inherited, mostly unaltered, in the protostellar phase.</description>

      <title>Streamer-like red line diffuse auroras driven by time domain structures and ECH waves associated with a plasma injection and braking ion flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18692</link>

Abstract: Auroral streamers are important meso-scale processes of dynamic magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling, typically studied using imagers sensitive to energetic (&gt;1 keV) electron precipitation, such as all-sky imagers (ASIs). This paper reports streamer-like red-line auroras, representing low-energy (&lt;1 keV) precipitation, observed poleward of a black aurora and an auroral torch. These red-line auroras were associated with a magnetospheric electron injection and braking ion flows. Observations were made using the THEMIS spacecraft and ground-based imagers, including the ASI, REGO, and meridian scanning photometer (MSP) at Fort Smith. We identify plasma sheet electron pitch-angle scattering by time-domain structures (TDSs) and electron cyclotron harmonics (ECH) waves as the driver of these red-line auroras, because of (1) a strong correlation (~0.9) between observed red-line intensities and precipitating fluxes; (2) consistent red-line intensities from auroral transport code forward modeling, and (3) consistent precipitation characteristic energies from MSP optical inference and quasi-linear estimates.</description>

      <title>Disparities in Magnetic Cloud Observations Between Two Spacecraft Having Small Radial and Angular Separations Near 1 AU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18919</link>

Abstract: Studies for inferring the global characteristics of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from its multipoint local in situ observations have been undertaken earlier, but there are limited studies utilizing measurements from multiple spacecraft with sufficiently small radial and angular separations. In the present study, we investigate a magnetic cloud (MC) region of a CME observed in situ during 2023 September 24-26, at STEREO-A and Wind spacecraft near 1 AU, which had radial and angular separations of 0.03 AU and 3.4 degrees, respectively. We examine the disparities in the estimates of the arrival times of CME substructures, the MC axis, and its orientation between the two spacecraft. We also propose an approach for identifying the MC axis's arrival and have compared it with the arrival of the size/time center to understand the non-isotropic compression of the MC along its angular extent. Using minimum variance analysis (MVA), we note that the orientation of the MC is slightly out-of-ecliptic at Wind but not at STEREO-A. We also compare the magnetic field parameters over the start to end of the MC at both spacecraft and note a significant non-coherency in the MC towards its trailing portion. Our analysis confirms that MC has a stronger rear side compression at STEREO-A than at Wind, with its trailing edge arriving later at Wind. Our study highlights substantial differences in CME characteristics even at mesoscales across the angular extent, and therefore, one needs to analyze several such cases to better understand the flux rope structure.</description>

      <title>Secret of Longevity: Protoplanetary Disks as a Source of Gas in Debris Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While protoplanetary disks (PPDs) are generally thought to disperse within several million years, recent observations have revealed gas in their older counterparts, debris disks. The origin of this gas remains uncertain, with one possibility being the unexpectedly long survival of PPDs (the primordial-origin scenario). To explore the plausibility of this scenario, we conduct 1D disk evolution simulations, varying parameters like stellar mass, disk mass, turbulent stress, and the model of magnetohydrodynamic winds, while incorporating stellar evolution to account for time-varying photoevaporation rates. Our focus is on disks where small grains are depleted, as these are potentially long-lived due to reduced far-ultraviolet photoevaporation. Our results show that gas in these disks can survive beyond 10 Myr regardless of the stellar mass, provided they are initially massive ($M_{\mathrm{disk}}\approx 0.1M_*$) with relatively weak turbulent stress ($\alpha \ll 10^{-2}$). The longest lifetimes are consistently found for $M_* = 2 M_{\odot}$ across a wide parameter space, with gas typically persisting at $\sim 10$--$10^3$ au. Roughly estimated CO masses for these disks fall within the observed range for the most massive gas-rich debris disks around early A~stars. These alignments support the plausibility of the primordial-origin scenario. Additionally, our model predicts that accretion persists for as long as the disk survives, which could explain the accretion signatures detected in old disks hosted by low-mass stars, including Peter Pan disks. Our finding also suggests that ongoing accretion may exist in gas-rich debris disks. Thus, searching for accretion signatures could be a key to determining the origins of gas in debris disks.</description>

      <title>TOI-6324b: An Earth-Mass Ultra-Short-Period Planet Transiting a Nearby M Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the confirmation of TOI-6324 b, an Earth-sized (1.059 $\pm$ 0.041 R$_\oplus$) ultra-short-period (USP) planet orbiting a nearby ($\sim$20 pc) M dwarf. Using the newly commissioned Keck Planet Finder (KPF) spectrograph, we have measured the mass of TOI-6324 b 1.17 $\pm$ 0.22 M$_\oplus$. Because of its extremely short orbit of just $\sim$6.7 hours, TOI-6324 b is intensely irradiated by its M dwarf host, and is expected to be stripped of any thick, H/He envelope. We were able to constrain its interior composition and found an iron core mass fraction (CMF = 27$\pm$37%) consistent with that of Earth ($\sim$33%) and other confirmed USPs. TOI-6324 b is the closest to Earth-sized USP confirmed to date. TOI-6324 b is a promising target for JWST phase curve and secondary eclipse observations (Emission Spectroscopy Metric = 25) which may reveal its surface mineralogy, day-night temperature contrast, and possible tidal deformation. From 7 sectors of TESS data, we report a tentative detection of the optical phase curve variation with an amplitude of 42$\pm$28 ppm.</description>

      <title>Peculiar Rainbows in Saturn's E Ring: Uncovering Luminous Bands Near Enceladus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report observations of stripe-like features in Enceladus' plumes captured simultaneously by Cassini's VIMS-IR and ISS NAC instruments during flyby E17, with similar patterns seen in VIMS-IR data from flyby E13 and E19. These parallel stripes, inclined at approximately 16$^{\circ}$ to the ecliptic and 43$^{\circ}$ to Saturn's ring plane, appear continuous across images when projected in the J2000 frame. A bright stripe, most visible at wavelengths around 5 $\mu$m, acts as the zeroth-order diffraction peak of a reflection grating with an estimated groove spacing of 0.12$-$2.60 mm, while adjacent stripes are attributed to higher-order diffraction peaks. We suggest that this light-dispersing phenomenon originates from an inclined periodic structure within Saturn's E ring. This structure, constrained between Saturn's G-ring and Rhea's orbit, likely consists of fresh ice particles supplied by Enceladus' plumes.</description>
