      <title>Large Language Models as Particle Swarm Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization problems often require domain-specific expertise to design problem-dependent methodologies. Recently, several approaches have gained attention by integrating large language models (LLMs) into genetic algorithms. Building on this trend, we introduce Language Model Particle Swarm Optimization (LMPSO), a novel method that incorporates an LLM into the swarm intelligence framework of Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). In LMPSO, the velocity of each particle is represented as a prompt that generates the next candidate solution, leveraging the capabilities of an LLM to produce solutions in accordance with the PSO paradigm. This integration enables an LLM-driven search process that adheres to the foundational principles of PSO. The proposed LMPSO approach is evaluated across multiple problem domains, including the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), heuristic improvement for TSP, and symbolic regression. These problems are traditionally challenging for standard PSO due to the structured nature of their solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that LMPSO is particularly effective for solving problems where solutions are represented as structured sequences, such as mathematical expressions or programmatic constructs. By incorporating LLMs into the PSO framework, LMPSO establishes a new direction in swarm intelligence research. This method not only broadens the applicability of PSO to previously intractable problems but also showcases the potential of LLMs in addressing complex optimization challenges.</description>

      <title>Advancing RFI-Detection in Radio Astronomy with Liquid State Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) from anthropogenic radio sources poses significant challenges to current and future radio telescopes. Contemporary approaches to detecting RFI treat the task as a semantic segmentation problem on radio telescope spectrograms. Typically, complex heuristic algorithms handle this task of `flagging' in combination with manual labeling (in the most difficult cases). While recent machine-learning approaches have demonstrated high accuracy, they often fail to meet the stringent operational requirements of modern radio observatories. Owing to their inherently time-varying nature, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are a promising alternative method to RFI-detection by utilizing the time-varying nature of the spectrographic source data. In this work, we apply Liquid State Machines (LSMs), a class of spiking neural networks, to RFI-detection. We employ second-order Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LiF) neurons, marking the first use of this architecture and neuron type for RFI-detection. We test three encoding methods and three increasingly complex readout layers, including a transformer decoder head, providing a hybrid of SNN and ANN techniques. Our methods extend LSMs beyond conventional classification tasks to fine-grained spatio-temporal segmentation. We train LSMs on simulated data derived from the Hyrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), a known benchmark for RFI-detection. Our model achieves a per-pixel accuracy of 98% and an F1-score of 0.743, demonstrating competitive performance on this highly challenging task. This work expands the sophistication of SNN techniques and architectures applied to RFI-detection, and highlights the effectiveness of LSMs in handling fine-grained, complex, spatio-temporal signal-processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Biology meets Neuromorphic Computing: Towards a bio-inspired Olfactory Perception System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore how the combination of synthetic biology, neuroscience modeling, and neuromorphic electronic systems offers a new approach to creating an artificial system that mimics the natural sense of smell. We argue that a co-design approach offers significant advantages in replicating the complex dynamics of odor sensing and processing. We investigate a hybrid system of synthetic sensory neurons that provides three key features: a) receptor-gated ion channels, b) interface between synthetic biology and semiconductors and c) event-based encoding and computing based on spiking networks. This research seeks to develop a platform for ultra-sensitive, specific, and energy-efficient odor detection, with potential implications for environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and security.</description>

      <title>TinyverseGP: Towards a Modular Cross-domain Benchmarking Framework for Genetic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the years, genetic programming (GP) has evolved, with many proposed variations, especially in how they represent a solution. Being essentially a program synthesis algorithm, it is capable of tackling multiple problem domains. Current benchmarking initiatives are fragmented, as the different representations are not compared with each other and their performance is not measured across the different domains. In this work, we propose a unified framework, dubbed TinyverseGP (inspired by tinyGP), which provides support to multiple representations and problem domains, including symbolic regression, logic synthesis and policy search.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging field that harnesses advances in Quantum Computing (QC) to improve the scalability and efficiency of decentralized Federated Learning (FL) models. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of the emerging problems and solutions when FL meets QC, from research protocol to a novel taxonomy, particularly focusing on both quantum and federated limitations, such as their architectures, Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and privacy preservation, so on. This work explores key developments and integration strategies, along with the impact of quantum computing on FL, keeping a sharp focus on hybrid quantum-classical approaches. The paper offers an in-depth understanding of how the strengths of QC, such as gradient hiding, state entanglement, quantum key distribution, quantum security, and quantum-enhanced differential privacy, have been integrated into FL to ensure the privacy of participants in an enhanced, fast, and secure framework. Finally, this study proposes potential future directions to address the identified research gaps and challenges, aiming to inspire faster and more secure QFL models for practical use.</description>

      <title>Datum-wise Transformer for Synthetic Tabular Data Detection in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing power of generative models raises major concerns about the authenticity of published content. To address this problem, several synthetic content detection methods have been proposed for uniformly structured media such as image or text. However, little work has been done on the detection of synthetic tabular data, despite its importance in industry and government. This form of data is complex to handle due to the diversity of its structures: the number and types of the columns may vary wildly from one table to another. We tackle the tough problem of detecting synthetic tabular data ''in the wild'', i.e. when the model is deployed on table structures it has never seen before. We introduce a novel datum-wise transformer architecture and show that it outperforms existing models. Furthermore, we investigate the application of domain adaptation techniques to enhance the effectiveness of our model, thereby providing a more robust data-forgery detection solution.</description>

      <title>Towards Combinatorial Interpretability of Neural Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce combinatorial interpretability, a methodology for understanding neural computation by analyzing the combinatorial structures in the sign-based categorization of a network's weights and biases. We demonstrate its power through feature channel coding, a theory that explains how neural networks compute Boolean expressions and potentially underlies other categories of neural network computation. According to this theory, features are computed via feature channels: unique cross-neuron encodings shared among the inputs the feature operates on. Because different feature channels share neurons, the neurons are polysemantic and the channels interfere with one another, making the computation appear inscrutable.
  We show how to decipher these computations by analyzing a network's feature channel coding, offering complete mechanistic interpretations of several small neural networks that were trained with gradient descent. Crucially, this is achieved via static combinatorial analysis of the weight matrices, without examining activations or training new autoencoding networks. Feature channel coding reframes the superposition hypothesis, shifting the focus from neuron activation directionality in high-dimensional space to the combinatorial structure of codes. It also allows us for the first time to exactly quantify and explain the relationship between a network's parameter size and its computational capacity (i.e. the set of features it can compute with low error), a relationship that is implicitly at the core of many modern scaling laws.
  Though our initial studies of feature channel coding are restricted to Boolean functions, we believe they provide a rich, controlled, and informative research space, and that the path we propose for combinatorial interpretation of neural computation can provide a basis for understanding both artificial and biological neural circuits.</description>

      <title>Toward Spiking Neural Network Local Learning Modules Resistant to Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has shown the vulnerability of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) under adversarial examples that are nearly indistinguishable from clean data in the context of frame-based and event-based information. The majority of these studies are constrained in generating adversarial examples using Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), a gradient-based method which lacks biological plausibility. In contrast, local learning methods, which relax many of BPTT's constraints, remain under-explored in the context of adversarial attacks. To address this problem, we examine adversarial robustness in SNNs through the framework of four types of training algorithms. We provide an in-depth analysis of the ineffectiveness of gradient-based adversarial attacks to generate adversarial instances in this scenario. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a hybrid adversarial attack paradigm that leverages the transferability of adversarial instances. The proposed hybrid approach demonstrates superior performance, outperforming existing adversarial attack methods. Furthermore, the generalizability of the method is assessed under multi-step adversarial attacks, adversarial attacks in black-box FGSM scenarios, and within the non-spiking domain.</description>

      <title>Shrinkage Initialization for Smooth Learning of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The successes of intelligent systems have quite relied on the artificial learning of information, which lead to the broad applications of neural learning solutions. As a common sense, the training of neural networks can be largely improved by specifically defined initialization, neuron layers as well as the activation functions. Though there are sequential layer based initialization available, the generalized solution to initial stages is still desired. In this work, an improved approach to initialization of neural learning is presented, which adopts the shrinkage approach to initialize the transformation of each layer of networks. It can be universally adapted for the structures of any networks with random layers, while stable performance can be attained. Furthermore, the smooth learning of networks is adopted in this work, due to the diverse influence on neural learning. Experimental results on several artificial data sets demonstrate that, the proposed method is able to present robust results with the shrinkage initialization, and competent for smooth learning of neural networks.</description>

      <title>Spiking Neural Network for Intra-cortical Brain Signal Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding brain signals accurately and efficiently is crucial for intra-cortical brain-computer interfaces. Traditional decoding approaches based on neural activity vector features suffer from low accuracy, whereas deep learning based approaches have high computational cost. To improve both the decoding accuracy and efficiency, this paper proposes a spiking neural network (SNN) for effective and energy-efficient intra-cortical brain signal decoding. We also propose a feature fusion approach, which integrates the manually extracted neural activity vector features with those extracted by a deep neural network, to further improve the decoding accuracy. Experiments in decoding motor-related intra-cortical brain signals of two rhesus macaques demonstrated that our SNN model achieved higher accuracy than traditional artificial neural networks; more importantly, it was tens or hundreds of times more efficient. The SNN model is very suitable for high precision and low power applications like intra-cortical brain-computer interfaces.</description>

Abstract: The recent success of Vision Transformers has generated significant interest in attention mechanisms and transformer architectures. Although existing methods have proposed spiking self-attention mechanisms compatible with spiking neural networks, they often face challenges in effective deployment on current neuromorphic platforms. This paper introduces a novel model that combines vision transformers with the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) to facilitate efficient neuromorphic deployment. Our experiments show that ViT-LCA achieves higher accuracy on ImageNet-1K dataset while consuming significantly less energy than other spiking vision transformer counterparts. Furthermore, ViT-LCA's neuromorphic-friendly design allows for more direct mapping onto current neuromorphic architectures.</description>

      <title>A Benchmarking Environment for Worker Flexibility in Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Production Scheduling, the Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSSP) aims to optimize a sequence of operations and assign each to an eligible machine with varying processing times. For integration of the workforce, each machine also requires a worker to be present to process an operation which additionally affects the processing times. The resulting problem is called Flexible Job Shop Scheduling Problem with Worker Flexibility (FJSSP-W). The FJSSP has been approached with various problem representations, including Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), Constrained Programming (CP), and Simulation-based Optimization (SBO). In the latter area in particular, there exists a large number of specialized Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) or Genetic Algorithms (GA). Yet, the solvers are often developed for single use cases only, and validated on a few selected test instances, let alone compared with results from solvers using other problem representations. While suitable approaches do also exist, the design of the FJSSP-W instances is not standardized and the algorithms are hardly comparable. This calls for a systematic benchmarking environment that provides a comprehensive set of FJSSP(-W) instances and supports targeted algorithm development. It will facilitate the comparison of algorithmic performance in the face of different problem characteristics. The present paper presents a collection of 402 commonly accepted FJSSP instances and proposes an approach to extend these with worker flexibility. In addition, we present a detailed procedure for the evaluation of scheduling algorithms on these problem sets and provide suitable model representations for this purpose. We provide complexity characteristics for all presented instances as well as baseline results of common commercial solvers to facilitate the validation of new algorithmic developments.</description>

      <title>Bridging Evolutionary Multiobjective Optimization and GPU Acceleration via Tensorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20286v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) has made significant strides over the past two decades. However, as problem scales and complexities increase, traditional EMO algorithms face substantial performance limitations due to insufficient parallelism and scalability. While most work has focused on algorithm design to address these challenges, little attention has been given to hardware acceleration, thereby leaving a clear gap between EMO algorithms and advanced computing devices, such as GPUs. To bridge the gap, we propose to parallelize EMO algorithms on GPUs via the tensorization methodology. By employing tensorization, the data structures and operations of EMO algorithms are transformed into concise tensor representations, which seamlessly enables automatic utilization of GPU computing. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to three representative EMO algorithms: NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and HypE. To comprehensively assess our methodology, we introduce a multiobjective robot control benchmark using a GPU-accelerated physics engine. Our experiments show that the tensorized EMO algorithms achieve speedups of up to 1113x compared to their CPU-based counterparts, while maintaining solution quality and effectively scaling population sizes to hundreds of thousands. Furthermore, the tensorized EMO algorithms efficiently tackle complex multiobjective robot control tasks, producing high-quality solutions with diverse behaviors.

      <title>When to Truncate the Archive? On the Effect of the Truncation Frequency in Multi-Objective Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using an archive to store nondominated solutions found during the search of a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is a useful practice. However, as nondominated solutions of a multi-objective optimisation problem can be enormous or infinitely many, it is desirable to provide the decision-maker with only a small, representative portion of all the nondominated solutions in the archive, thus entailing a truncation operation. Then, an important issue is when to truncate the archive. This can be done once a new solution generated, a batch of new solutions generated, or even using an unbounded archive to keep all nondominated solutions generated and truncate it later. Intuitively, the last approach may lead to a better result since we have all the information in hand before performing the truncation. In this paper, we study this issue and investigate the effect of the timing of truncating the archive. We apply well-established truncation criteria that are commonly used in the population maintenance procedure of MOEAs (e.g., crowding distance, hypervolume indicator, and decomposition). We show that, interestingly, truncating the archive once a new solution generated tends to be the best, whereas considering an unbounded archive is often the worst. We analyse and discuss this phenomenon. Our results highlight the importance of developing effective subset selection techniques (rather than employing the population maintenance methods in MOEAs) when using a large archive.</description>

      <title>CatCMA with Margin: Stochastic Optimization for Continuous, Integer, and Categorical Variables</title>

Abstract: This study focuses on mixed-variable black-box optimization (MV-BBO), addressing continuous, integer, and categorical variables. Many real-world MV-BBO problems involve dependencies among these different types of variables, requiring efficient methods to optimize them simultaneously. Recently, stochastic optimization methods leveraging the mechanism of the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy have shown promising results in mixed-integer or mixed-category optimization. However, such methods cannot handle the three types of variables simultaneously. In this study, we propose CatCMA with Margin (CatCMAwM), a stochastic optimization method for MV-BBO that jointly optimizes continuous, integer, and categorical variables. CatCMAwM is developed by incorporating a novel integer handling into CatCMA, a mixed-category black-box optimization method employing a joint distribution of multivariate Gaussian and categorical distributions. The proposed integer handling is carefully designed by reviewing existing integer handlings and following the design principles of CatCMA. Even when applied to mixed-integer problems, it stabilizes the marginal probability and improves the convergence performance of continuous variables. Numerical experiments show that CatCMAwM effectively handles the three types of variables, outperforming state-of-the-art Bayesian optimization methods and baselines that simply incorporate existing integer handlings into CatCMA.</description>

      <title>Contribute to balance, wire in accordance: Emergence of backpropagation from a simple, bio-plausible neuroplasticity rule</title>

Abstract: Backpropagation (BP) has been pivotal in advancing machine learning and remains essential in computational applications and comparative studies of biological and artificial neural networks. Despite its widespread use, the implementation of BP in the brain remains elusive, and its biological plausibility is often questioned due to inherent issues such as the need for symmetry of weights between forward and backward connections, and the requirement of distinct forward and backward phases of computation. Here, we introduce a novel neuroplasticity rule that offers a potential mechanism for implementing BP in the brain. Similar in general form to the classical Hebbian rule, this rule is based on the core principles of maintaining the balance of excitatory and inhibitory inputs as well as on retrograde signaling, and operates over three progressively slower timescales: neural firing, retrograde signaling, and neural plasticity. We hypothesize that each neuron possesses an internal state, termed credit, in addition to its firing rate. After achieving equilibrium in firing rates, neurons receive credits based on their contribution to the E-I balance of postsynaptic neurons through retrograde signaling. As the network's credit distribution stabilizes, connections from those presynaptic neurons are strengthened that significantly contribute to the balance of postsynaptic neurons. We demonstrate mathematically that our learning rule precisely replicates BP in layered neural networks without any approximations. Simulations on artificial neural networks reveal that this rule induces varying community structures in networks, depending on the learning rate. This simple theoretical framework presents a biologically plausible implementation of BP, with testable assumptions and predictions that may be evaluated through biological experiments.</description>

      <title>To Spike or Not to Spike, that is the Question</title>

Abstract: Neuromorphic computing has recently gained momentum with the emergence of various neuromorphic processors. As the field advances, there is an increasing focus on developing training methods that can effectively leverage the unique properties of spiking neural networks (SNNs). SNNs emulate the temporal dynamics of biological neurons, making them particularly well-suited for real-time, event-driven processing. To fully harness the potential of SNNs across different neuromorphic platforms, effective training methodologies are essential. In SNNs, learning rules are based on neurons' spiking behavior, that is, if and when spikes are generated due to a neuron's membrane potential exceeding that neuron's spiking threshold, and this spike timing encodes vital information. However, the threshold is generally treated as a hyperparameter, and incorrect selection can lead to neurons that do not spike for large portions of the training process, hindering the effective rate of learning. This work focuses on the significance of learning neuron thresholds alongside weights in SNNs. Our results suggest that promoting threshold from a hyperparameter to a trainable parameter effectively addresses the issue of dead neurons during training. This leads to a more robust training algorithm, resulting in improved convergence, increased test accuracy, and a substantial reduction in the number of training epochs required to achieve viable accuracy on spatiotemporal datasets such as NMNIST, DVS128, and Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD), with up to 30% training speed-up and up to 2% higher accuracy on these datasets.</description>

      <title>HG2P: Hippocampus-inspired High-reward Graph and Model-Free Q-Gradient Penalty for Path Planning and Motion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09505</link>

Abstract: Goal-conditioned hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) decomposes complex reaching tasks into a sequence of simple subgoal-conditioned tasks, showing significant promise for addressing long-horizon planning in large-scale environments. This paper bridges the goal-conditioned HRL based on graph-based planning to brain mechanisms, proposing a hippocampus-striatum-like dual-controller hypothesis. Inspired by the brain mechanisms of organisms (i.e., the high-reward preferences observed in hippocampal replay) and instance-based theory, we propose a high-return sampling strategy for constructing memory graphs, improving sample efficiency. Additionally, we derive a model-free lower-level Q-function gradient penalty to resolve the model dependency issues present in prior work, improving the generalization of Lipschitz constraints in applications. Finally, we integrate these two extensions, High-reward Graph and model-free Gradient Penalty (HG2P), into the state-of-the-art framework ACLG, proposing a novel goal-conditioned HRL framework, HG2P+ACLG. Experimentally, the results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art goal-conditioned HRL algorithms on a variety of long-horizon navigation tasks and robotic manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>AgentBreeder: Mitigating the AI Safety Impact of Multi-Agent Scaffolds via Self-Improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scaffolding Large Language Models (LLMs) into multi-agent systems often improves performance on complex tasks, but the safety impact of such scaffolds has not been thoroughly explored. We introduce AgentBreeder, a framework for multi-objective self-improving evolutionary search over scaffolds. We evaluate discovered scaffolds on widely recognized reasoning, mathematics, and safety benchmarks and compare them with popular baselines. In 'blue' mode, we see a 79.4% average uplift in safety benchmark performance while maintaining or improving capability scores. In 'red' mode, we find adversarially weak scaffolds emerging concurrently with capability optimization. Our work demonstrates the risks of multi-agent scaffolding and provides a framework for mitigating them. Code is available at https://github.com/J-Rosser-UK/AgentBreeder.</description>

      <title>Algorithm Discovery With LLMs: Evolutionary Search Meets Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering efficient algorithms for solving complex problems has been an outstanding challenge in mathematics and computer science, requiring substantial human expertise over the years. Recent advancements in evolutionary search with large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in accelerating the discovery of algorithms across various domains, particularly in mathematics and optimization. However, existing approaches treat the LLM as a static generator, missing the opportunity to update the model with the signal obtained from evolutionary exploration. In this work, we propose to augment LLM-based evolutionary search by continuously refining the search operator - the LLM - through reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning. Our method leverages evolutionary search as an exploration strategy to discover improved algorithms, while RL optimizes the LLM policy based on these discoveries. Our experiments on three combinatorial optimization tasks - bin packing, traveling salesman, and the flatpack problem - show that combining RL and evolutionary search improves discovery efficiency of improved algorithms, showcasing the potential of RL-enhanced evolutionary strategies to assist computer scientists and mathematicians for more efficient algorithm design.</description>

      <title>Optuna vs Code Llama: Are LLMs a New Paradigm for Hyperparameter Tuning?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing neural network performance, especially as models grow in complexity. This work investigates the viability of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by fine-tuning a parameter-efficient version of Code Llama using LoRA. The adapted LLM is capable of generating accurate and efficient hyperparameter recommendations tailored to diverse neural network architectures. Unlike traditional approaches such as Optuna, which rely on computationally intensive trial-and-error procedures, our method achieves competitive or superior results in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our findings demonstrate that LLM-based optimization not only matches the performance of state-of-the-art techniques like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) but also substantially accelerates the tuning process. This positions LLMs as a promising alternative for rapid experimentation, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and mobile platforms, where computational efficiency is essential. In addition to improved efficiency, the method offers time savings and consistent performance across various tasks, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. All generated hyperparameters are included in the LEMUR Neural Network (NN) Dataset, which is publicly available and serves as an open-source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research.</description>

      <title>Kernel Logistic Regression Learning for High-Capacity Hopfield Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hebbian learning limits Hopfield network storage capacity (pattern-to-neuron ratio around 0.14). We propose Kernel Logistic Regression (KLR) learning. Unlike linear methods, KLR uses kernels to implicitly map patterns to high-dimensional feature space, enhancing separability. By learning dual variables, KLR dramatically improves storage capacity, achieving perfect recall even when pattern numbers exceed neuron numbers (up to ratio 1.5 shown), and enhances noise robustness. KLR demonstrably outperforms Hebbian and linear logistic regression approaches.</description>
