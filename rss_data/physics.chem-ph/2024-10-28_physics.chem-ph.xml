      <title>Hyperfine rovibrational states of H$_3^+$ in a weak external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rovibrational energies, wave functions, and Raman transition moments are reported for the lowest-energy states of the H$_3^+$ molecular ion including the magnetic couplings of the proton spins and molecular rotation in the presence of a weak external magnetic field. The rovibrational-hyperfine-Zeeman Hamiltonian matrix is constructed and diagonalized using the rovibrational eigenstates and the proton spin functions. The developed methodology can be used to compute hyperfine-Zeeman effects also for higher-energy rovibrational excitations of H$_3^+$ and other polyatomic molecules. These developments will guide future experiments extending quantum logic spectroscopy to polyatomic systems.</description>

      <title>Molecular Fingerprints of Ice Surfaces in Sum Frequency Generation Spectra: a First Principles Machine Learning Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the molecular-level structure and dynamics of ice surfaces is crucial for deciphering several chemical, physical, and atmospheric processes. Vibrational sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy is the most prominent tool for probing the molecular-level structure of the air--ice interface as it is a surface-specific technique, but the molecular interpretation of SFG spectra is challenging. This study utilizes a machine-learning potential, along with dipole and polarizability models trained on ab initio data, to calculate the SFG spectrum of the air--ice interface. At temperatures below ice surface premelting, our simulations support the presence of a proton-ordered arrangement at the Ice Ih surface, similar to that seen in Ice XI. Additionally, our simulations provide insight into the assignment of SFG peaks to specific molecular configurations where possible and assess the contribution of subsurface layers to the overall SFG spectrum. These insights enhance our understanding and interpretation of vibrational studies of environmental chemistry at the ice surface.</description>

      <title>Modulation of ionic current rectification in short bipolar nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipolar nanopores, with asymmetric charge distributions, can induce significant ionic current rectification (ICR) at ultra-short lengths, finding potential applications in nanofluidic devices, energy conversion, and other related fields. Here, with simulations, we investigated the characteristics of ion transport and modulation of ICR inside bipolar nanopores. With bipolar nanopores of half-positive and half-negative surfaces, the most significant ICR phenomenon appears at various concentrations. In these cases, ICR ratios are independent of electrolyte types. In other cases where nanopores have oppositely charged surfaces in different lengths, ICR ratios are related to the mobility of anions and cations. The pore length and surface charge density can enhance ICR. As the pore length increases, ICR ratios first increase and then approach their saturation which is determined by the surface charge density. External surface charges of nanopores can promote the ICR phenomenon mainly due to the enhancement of ion enrichment inside nanopores by external surface conductance. The effective width of exterior charged surfaces under various conditions is also explored, which is inversely proportional to the pore length and salt concentration, and linearly related to the pore diameter, surface charge density, and applied voltage. Our results may provide guidance for the design of bipolar porous membranes.</description>

      <title>Excitation Energy Transfer between Porphyrin Dyes on a Clay Surface: A study employing Multifidelity Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural light-harvesting antenna complexes efficiently capture solar energy using chlorophyll, i.e., magnesium porphyrin pigments, embedded in a protein matrix. Inspired by this natural configuration, artificial clay-porphyrin antenna structures have been experimentally synthesized and have demonstrated remarkable excitation energy transfer properties. The study presents the computational design and simulation of a synthetic light-harvesting system that emulates natural mechanisms by arranging cationic free-base porphyrin molecules on an anionic clay surface. We investigated the transfer of excitation energy among the porphyrin dyes using a multiscale quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approach based on the semi-empirical density functional-based tight-binding (DFTB) theory for the ground state dynamics. To improve the accuracy of our results, we incorporated an innovative multifidelity machine learning (MFML) approach, which allows the prediction of excitation energies at the numerically demanding time-dependent density functional theory level with the Def2-SVP basis set. This approach was applied to an extensive dataset of 640K geometries for the 90-atom porphyrin structures, facilitating a thorough analysis of the excitation energy diffusion among the porphyrin molecules adsorbed to the clay surface. The insights gained from this study, inspired by natural light-harvesting complexes, demonstrate the potential of porphyrin-clay systems as effective energy transfer systems.</description>

      <title>Mixed Atomistic-Implicit Quantum/Classical Approach to Molecular Nanoplasmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multiscale QM/classical approach is presented, that is able to model the optical properties of complex nanostructures composed of a molecular system adsorbed on metal nanoparticles. The latter are described by a combined atomistic-continuum model, where the core is described using the implicit boundary element method (BEM) and the surface retains a fully atomistic picture and is treated employing the frequency-dependent fluctuating charge and fluctuating dipole ($\omega$FQF$\mu$) approach. The integrated QM/$\omega$FQF$\mu$-BEM model is numerically compared with state-of-the-art fully atomistic approaches, and the quality of the continuum/core partition is evaluated. The method is then extended to compute Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS) within a Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) framework.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Blurring Diffusion for Hierarchical Molecular Conformer Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can diffusion models process 3D geometries in a coarse-to-fine manner, akin to our multiscale view of the world? In this paper, we address the question by focusing on a fundamental biochemical problem of generating 3D molecular conformers conditioned on molecular graphs in a multiscale manner. Our approach consists of two hierarchical stages: i) generation of coarse-grained fragment-level 3D structure from the molecular graph, and ii) generation of fine atomic details from the coarse-grained approximated structure while allowing the latter to be adjusted simultaneously. For the challenging second stage, which demands preserving coarse-grained information while ensuring SE(3) equivariance, we introduce a novel generative model termed Equivariant Blurring Diffusion (EBD), which defines a forward process that moves towards the fragment-level coarse-grained structure by blurring the fine atomic details of conformers, and a reverse process that performs the opposite operation using equivariant networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EBD by geometric and chemical comparison to state-of-the-art denoising diffusion models on a benchmark of drug-like molecules. Ablation studies draw insights on the design of EBD by thoroughly analyzing its architecture, which includes the design of the loss function and the data corruption process.

      <title>ProtSCAPE: Mapping the landscape of protein conformations in molecular dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic nature of protein structures is essential for comprehending their biological functions. While significant progress has been made in predicting static folded structures, modeling protein motions on microsecond to millisecond scales remains challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, Protein Transformer with Scattering, Attention, and Positional Embedding (ProtSCAPE), which leverages the geometric scattering transform alongside transformer-based attention mechanisms to capture protein dynamics from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. ProtSCAPE utilizes the multi-scale nature of the geometric scattering transform to extract features from protein structures conceptualized as graphs and integrates these features with dual attention structures that focus on residues and amino acid signals, generating latent representations of protein trajectories. Furthermore, ProtSCAPE incorporates a regression head to enforce temporally coherent latent representations.</description>

      <title>Ionic Selectivity of Nanopores: Comparison among Cases under the Hydrostatic Pressure, Electric Field, and Concentration Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ionic selectivity of nanopores is crucial for the energy conversion based on nanoporous membranes. It can be significantly affected by various parameters of nanopores and the applied fields driving ions through porous membranes. Here, with finite element simulations, the selective transport of ions through nanopores is systematically investigated under three common fields, i.e. the electric field (V), hydrostatic pressure (p), and concentration gradient (C). For negatively charged nanopores, through the quantitative comparison of the cation selectivity (t+) under the three fields, the cation selectivity of nanopores follows the order of t+V &gt; t+c &gt; t+p. This is due to the transport characteristics of cations and anions through the nanopores. Because of the strong transport of counterions in electric double layers under electric fields and concentration gradients, the nanopore exhibits a relatively higher selectivity to counterions. We also explored the modulation of t+ on the properties of nanopores and solutions. Under all three fields, t+ is directly proportional to the pore length and surface charge density, and inversely correlated to the pore diameter and salt concentration. Under both the electric field and hydrostatic pressure, t+ has almost no dependence on the applied field strength or ion species, which can affect t+ in the case of the concentration gradient. Our results provide detailed insights into the comparison and regulation of ionic selectivity of nanopores under three fields which can be useful for the design of high-performance devices for energy conversion based on nanoporous membranes.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of uncertainty estimations for Gaussian process regression based machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have seen significant advances as efficient replacement of expensive quantum chemical calculations. Uncertainty estimations for MLIPs are crucial to quantify the additional model error they introduce and to leverage this information in active learning strategies. MLIPs that are based on Gaussian process regression provide a standard deviation as a possible uncertainty measure. An alternative approach are ensemble-based uncertainties. Although these uncertainty measures have been applied to active learning, it has rarely been studied how they correlate with the error, and it is not always clear whether active learning actually outperforms random sampling strategies. We consider GPR models with Coulomb and SOAP representations as inputs to predict potential energy surfaces and excitation energies of molecules. We evaluate, how the GPR variance and ensemble-based uncertainties relate to the error and whether model performance improves by selecting the most uncertain samples from a fixed configuration space. For the ensemble based uncertainty estimations, we find that they often do not provide any information about the error. For the GPR standard deviation, we find that often predictions with an increasing standard deviation also have an increasing systematical bias, which is not captured by the uncertainty. In these cases, selecting training samples with the highest uncertainty leads to a model with a worse test error compared to random sampling. We conclude that confidence intervals, which are derived from the predictive standard deviation, can be highly overconfident. Selecting samples with high GPR standard deviation leads to a model that overemphasizes the borders of the configuration space represented in the fixed dataset. This may result in worse performance in more densely sampled areas but better generalization for extrapolation tasks.</description>

      <title>Design of novel organic proton-transfer acid-base (anti-)ferroelectric salts with crystal structure prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organic molecular ferroelectrics, including organic proton-transfer ferroelectrics and antiferroelectrics, are potentially attractive in organic electronics and have significant chemical tunability. Among these, acid-base proton transfer (PT) salts stand out due to their low coercive fields and the possibility to tune their properties with different acid-base combinations. Using crystal structure prediction, combining small acid and base organic molecular species, we here predict three novel acid-base PT ferroelectric salts with higher polarization than existing materials. We also report two combinations that form antiferroelectric crystal structures. However, some combinations also result in unfavorable packing or the formation of co-crystal or in one case a divalent salt. The protonation state is found to be highly linked to the crystal structure, with cases where salt crystal structures have the same energetic preferability as co-crystals with a different crystalline packing.</description>

      <title>Behavior of water and aqueous LiCl solutions confined in cylindrical silica pores: A wide temperature range molecular dynamics simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report here a molecular dynamics simulation study on water and aqueous LiCl solutions confined in 1.6 nm cylindrical pores of silica to investigate a dynamical cross-over, observed earlier experimentally, wherein LiCl slows down confined water at high temperatures but makes it faster at lower temperatures. The cross-over observed in the experiments is reproduced in the simulations, albeit at lower temperature. Moreover, the cross-over encompasses all aspects of dynamics including translation as well as rotation. Both addition of LiCl and confinement result in a breaking of hydrogen bond network in confined water, eliminating the need for long jumps via exchange of hydrogen bonded partner molecules. This lowers the activation energy for diffusion in the electrolyte solution compared to pure confined water and leads to the dynamical cross-over seen at lower temperatures. Our results thus provide an explanation to the experimentally observed phenomena and provide important insights on the interplay of confinement, temperature and presence of electrolytes on the dynamical behavior of nano-confined water.</description>

      <title>Solid Solubility in Metallic Hydrogen</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen in its metallic form is the most common material in our solar system, found under the extreme pressure and temperature conditions found in giant planets. Such conditions are inaccessible to experiment and consequently, theoretical work has typically led experiment. Many remarkable properties are proposed for metallic hydrogen, which is expected to exist in solid form down to low temperatures. Relevant here is that solid metallic hydrogen is not expected to have a close-packed structure, even at extreme pressures. The predicted crystal structure has a packing fraction of only 0.44 compared with 0.74 for fcc. Alloying with other metallic elements can form compounds with atomic hydrogen and much reduced metallization pressure. Here, we investigate the possible solid solubility of a representative range of elements (Be, B, Mg, S, Fe, La) in metallic atomic hydrogen near 500GPa. Zero point energy is highly significant in all cases. The metallic elements Be, Mg, Fe, and La have a well-defined clathrate-style first neighbour shell at 300K, while the non-metallic B and S have more open arrangements. All the elements considered are soluble, in sites substituting for more than one hydrogen atom. The solid solubility of such a wide range of ambient bonding types: simple metals, covalent materials, transition metals, lanthanides, which gives a strong indication that most elements will dissolve in solid metallic hydrogen.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of piezoelectric response in V doped LiNbO3 films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiNbO3 films doped with vanadium (V) were deposited using RF magnetron sputtering technique. To realize doping with a wider range of V concentration, a 30 mm V metal inlaid target asymmetrically embedded in the 150 mm lithium niobate target was used. The V concentration in the deposited films was a decreasing function of the distance from the V target. The V/Nb ratio decreased from 0.155 to 0.024, corresponding to a change in the composition of thin films from LiNb0.866V0.134O3 to LiNb0.977V0.023O3, respectively. Surface and inner morphology and structure, phase and element composition, microstructure, and ferroelectric properties of the undoped and V doped LiNbO3 films were studied. The measured maximal d33 constant of the LiNb0.935V0.065O3 film was about three times higher than that of the undoped LiNbO3 film, 14 pC/N and 4.76 pC/N, respectively. The optimal composition in the deposition geometry used was within the range of LiNb0.885V0.115O3 to LiNb0.952V0.048O3. Undoped and V doped LiNbO3 thin films were used as bulk acoustic wave ultrasonic transducers deposited on stainless steel plates to generate longitudinal waves and compare their ultrasonic performance.</description>

We propose a classical algorithm to find the optimal stabilizer state by using excitations of the Hartree-Fock state, followed by constructing quantum error-detection codes based on this stabilizer state using codeword-stabilized codes. Through various numerical experiments, we confirm that our method finds the best stabilizer approximations to the true ground states of molecules up to 36 qubits in size. Additionally, we construct generalized stabilizer states that offer a better approximation to the true ground states. Furthermore, for a simple noise model, we demonstrate that both the stabilizer and (some) generalized stabilizer states can be prepared with higher fidelity using the error-detection codes we construct. Our work represents a promising step toward designing algorithms for early fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Separate and Detailed Treatment of Absolute Signal and Noise Enables NMR Under Adverse Circumstances</title>

Abstract: When deploying a spectrometer in an adverse environment, such as during a typical ODNP experiment or experiments that require low-volume low-field measurements, a clear and modern protocol for characterizing and quantifying the absolute signal and noise levels proves essential. This paper provides such a protocol. It also highlights the clarity and insight that comes from (1) discussing NMR signal intensities in (conserved) units of square root instantaneous power that are derived from a theory and notation developed initially for ESR spectroscopy; as well as (2) characterizing the spectral distribution of the noise.
  Crucially, the strategy introduced here applies not only to ODNP measurements, but to all low-field NMR. Low-field NMR offers immense flexibility: it enables integration with other instrumentation and deploys in practical applications not accessible to higher-field instrumentation. More generally, the protocol introduced here should apply to a wide range of instruments, and should prove especially useful in cases subject to design constraints that requires integration with multiple other modules that are not dedicated to NMR but that control other forms of spectroscopy or other crucial aspects of the measurement. However, in the specific case of ODNP, this protocol demonstrates that the absolute signal and noise level can be estimated from the clarified theory presented here, and uses that theory to identify the inefficient distribution of fields in the hairpin loop probe as the main remaining bottleneck for the improvement of low-field low-volume ODNP SNR.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of the Translational Immobilization of Water Molecules Under Nanoscale Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07240v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ODNP (Overhauser Dynamic Nuclear Polarization) detects an experimental measurable associated directly with translational motion of water at the nanoscale, a quantity that few other methods can detect. This study offers a unique insight into the translational diffusion of water inside RMs (reverse micelles). It finds that simply adjusting the "water loading" ($w_0$, i.e. the mole ratio of surfactant to water) to tune the size of the RMs achieves a near-continuous tuning of the translational diffusion of water. Furthermore, (1) water molecules in the core of relatively large RMs ($w_0=10$, diameter of water nanopool $\approx 3.5$ nm) diffuse only as fast as those on the surface of a lipid bilayer and (2) surprisingly, translational diffusion slows to a near-stop for RMs that are small, but still contain hundreds of water molecules in their core. Extrapolation to larger sized water pools implies that in order to recover bulk-like translational dynamics, tens of thousands of water molecules are required. The data from the small RMs also represent a breakthrough as the first example where a spin probe that is completely exposed to water (as opposed to buried inside a macromolecule) observes dramatic slowing of the translational diffusion.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Density Scaling: Coarse-Graining in Space and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure and dynamics of liquids is pivotal for the study of larger spatiotemporal processes, especially in glass-forming materials at low temperatures. Density scaling, observed in many molecular systems through experiments, offers an efficient means for exploring a vast range of time scales along a one-dimensional phase diagram. However, the theoretical foundation provided by isomorph theory is of limited use for molecular systems, since currently no first-principles theory exists that can explain the origins of density scaling or make predictions based on it. In this work, we propose a first-principles framework employing coarse-graining in space and time. Spatial coarse-graining reduces a molecule to a center-of-mass-level description by eliminating fast degrees of freedom, while temporal coarse-graining involves averaging fluctuations or correlation functions over characteristic time scales. We show that both approaches enable ab initio estimation of the density scaling coefficient for ortho-terphenyl, consistent with experimental values. Building on these findings, we employ excess entropy scaling to derive a microscopic theory that underpins density scaling from fully atomistic simulations. Our results illuminate the role of coarse-graining in assessing slow fluctuations in molecules and unravel the microscopic nature of density scaling. Ultimately, our proposed framework enables systematic bottom-up approaches for predicting transport coefficients that are otherwise experimentally inaccessible and computationally prohibitive.</description>

      <title>On the equilibrium limit of liquid stability in pressurized aqueous systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase stability, and the limits thereof, are a central concern of materials thermodynamics. However, the temperature limits of equilibrium liquid stability in chemical systems have only been widely characterized under constant (typically atmospheric) pressure conditions, whereunder the limit is represented by the eutectic. At higher pressures, this limit will shift in both temperature and chemical composition, opening a wide thermodynamic parameter space over which the absolute limit, i.e., the limit under arbitrary values of the thermodynamic forces at play (here pressure and concentration), might exist. In this work, we use isochoric freezing to measure this absolute limit for the first time in several binary aqueous brines, and, nodding to the etymology of "eutectic", we name this limit the "cenotectic" (from Greek " ", "universal-melt"). We observe that when no solute-bearing high-pressure phases exist, the cenotectic occurs consistently 22 +/- 2K below the 1 bar eutectic and at approximately 213 +/- 3 MPa, suggesting domination by the liquidus behaviors of the icy phases present. In charting the T-P evolution of each eutectic configuration, we also encounter several unreported high-pressure hydrates of NaHCO2, MgCl2, and NaCl, and we find that these high-pressure phases can produce complex multi-phase configurations involving the liquid that may remain metastable to significantly lower temperatures. We discuss the implications of these findings for ocean worlds of our solar system and cold ocean exoplanets; estimate thermodynamic limits on ice crust thickness and final ocean depth ("endgame") using the cenotectic pressure; and finally provide a generalized thermodynamic perspective on (and definition for) this fundamental thermodynamic invariant point.</description>

      <title>Simple Fermionic backflow states via a systematically improvable tensor decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an effective ansatz for the wave function of correlated electrons that brings closer the fields of machine learning parameterizations and tensor rank decompositions. We consider a CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor factorization of a general backflow transformation in second quantization for a simple, compact and systematically improvable Fermionic state. This directly encodes $N$-body correlations without the ordering dependence of other tensor decompositions. We consider and explicitly demonstrate various controllable truncations, in the rank and range of the backflow correlations or magnitude of local energy contributions, in order to systematically affect scaling reductions to $\mathcal{O}[N^{3-4}]$. Benchmarking against small Fermi-Hubbard and chemical systems reveals an improvement over other NQS-like models, while extending towards larger strongly correlated ab initio systems demonstrates competitive accuracy with more established DMRG techniques on ab initio 2D hydrogenic lattices with realistic long-range Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>From Memory Traces to Surface Chemistry: Decoding REDOX Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gas and moisture sensing devices leveraging the resistive switching effect in transition metal oxide memristors promise to revolutionize next-generation, nano-scaled, cost-effective, and environmentally sustainable sensor solutions. These sensors encode readouts in resistance state changes based on gas concentration, yet their nonlinear current-voltage characteristics offer richer dynamics, capturing detailed information about REDOX reactions and surface kinetics. Traditional vertical devices fail to fully exploit this complexity. This study demonstrates planar resistive switching devices, moving beyond the Butler-Volmer model. A systematic investigation of the electrochemical processes in Na-doped ZnO with lateral planar contacts reveals intricate patterns resulting from REDOX reactions on the device surface. When combined with advanced algorithms for pattern recognition, allow the analysis of complex switching patterns, including crossings, loop directions, and resistance values, providing unprecedented insights for next-generation complex sensors.</description>
