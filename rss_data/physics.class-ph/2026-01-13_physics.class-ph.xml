      <title>Tunneling of Elastic Waves in a Tapered Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how evanescent modes mediate energy transfer in tapered elastic waveguides is of paramount interest, as it unlocks new strategies for wave control and manipulation. Evanescent modes play a crucial role in energy localization and in the emergence of thickness resonances. We report the first unambiguous experimental evidence of Lamb mode tunneling near turning points, revealing how energy can traverse an evanescent barrier and recover its propagative nature after a finite transit time. Focusing on waveguides with linearly varying thickness, we show that the $S_2$ mode becomes evanescent over a narrow frequency band, enabling a tunnelinglike phenomenon. Our study demonstrates that the barrier width is governed by the elastic properties of the material, particularly the Poisson's ratio, within a confined range bordering the Dirac cone. Numerical results exhibit excellent agreement with predictions from the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation. These findings provide compelling evidence that, for a specific barrier width, evanescent modes mediate energy transfer across regions classically forbidden to propagating waves, revealing the mechanisms governing transmission, localization, and mode conversion in structured or corrugated elastic waveguides.</description>

      <title>A simple ghost free and caustic free mimetic scalar field dark matter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chamseddine and Mukhanov have promoted the concept of mimetic dark matter as alternative dark matter candidate coming from gravitation. Unfortunately although being very interesting, their proposition turned out to have weakness among which ghost and caustic instabilities. In this paper I propose among the simplest ghost free and caustic free scalar field dark matter extension of their model; a proposition capable of challenging $\Lambda$CDM model or even capable of doing better.</description>

      <title>Snapping and Switching of Elastic Arches with Patterned Preferred Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An elastic arch is an archetypal bistable system. Here, we combine elastica theory and photo-mechanical experiments to elucidate the mechanics of an active arch with a spatio-temporally varying preferred curvature $\overline \kappa(s)$. Our shallow-arch theory completely describes any such system via the decomposition of its $\overline \kappa(s)$ into Euler-buckling modes. Intuitively, if $\overline \kappa(s)$ overlaps with the fundamental mode, it snaps the arch up/down. Conversely, non-overlapping $\overline \kappa(s)$ drives a second-order transition to a higher-order shape. Furthermore, the form of $\overline \kappa(s)$ enables control over the instability's character; we find the forms for snapping with maximum energy release and at the lowest stimulation (both binary patterns) and design forms for symmetric and asymmetric switching pathways. Analogous control can also be achieved in boundary-driven instabilities of passive arches by fabricating them with suitable $\overline \kappa(s)$. We thus anticipate our results will improve switchable/snapping elements in MEMS, robotics, and mechanical meta-materials.</description>

      <title>Distinct Berry Phases in a Single Triangular M\"{o}bius Microwave Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07320v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of two distinct Berry phases ($+\frac{2\pi}{3}$ and $-\frac{2\pi}{3}$) generated on the surface of a M\"{o}bius cavity resonator at microwave frequencies supporting the TE$_{1,0,n}$ mode family. This resonator consists of a twisted, mirror-asymmetric prism with a cross-section of the triangular $D_3$ symmetry group, bent around on itself to form a ring. This geometric class supports resonant modes with nonzero electromagnetic helicity (i.e. nonzero $\vec{E}\cdot\vec{B}$ product) at microwave frequencies. There exist modes with three-fold rotational symmetry as well as those that exhibit no rotational symmetry. The latter result in an accumulated Berry phase whilst the former do not, which is determined from the measured frequency shift of the modes when compared to a mirror-symmetric resonator of otherwise equivalent geometry.</description>
