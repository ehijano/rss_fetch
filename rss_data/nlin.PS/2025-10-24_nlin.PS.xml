      <title>Fractional Vegetation-Water Model in Arid and Semi-Arid Environments: Pattern Formation and Numerical Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new fractional mathematical model to describe the dynamics and the interaction between plants and water in arid and semi-arid environments with and without slope. By the Caputo fractional operator, the model allows for simulating the phenomena related to the vegetation migration, which occur in domains with different slopes. By assuming the fractional parameter linked to the slope of the domain, the new fractional model represents a connection between the Klausmeier model, where water advection occurs, to the Klausmeier-Gray-Scott model, where water diffuses. The proposed model describes an anomalous physical phenomenon that changes as the fractional parameter changes, modelling an anomalous water advection. An analytical study of the stability of the Hopf bifurcation demonstrates that the migration speed results to be a function of the fractional parameter, confirming the connection between the fractional parameter and the slope of the domain. The oscillatory solutions and the vegetation pattern formation, obtained numerically, validate the analytical results and confirm the reliability and efficiency of the fractional formulation of the considered model.</description>

      <title>Space-time resonances in the spatiotemporal spectrum of nonlinear dispersive waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In weakly nonlinear dispersive wave systems, long-time dynamics are typically governed by time resonances, where wave phases evolve coherently due to exact frequency matching. Recent advances in spatio-temporal spectrum measurements, however, reveal prominent features that go beyond the predictions of time resonance theory. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to interpret these signatures by identifying and characterizing an alternative mechanism: space resonances. These arise when wave packets share the same group velocity and remain co-located, leading to long-lived interactions. We further show that gauge-breaking terms in the Hamiltonian give rise to space resonances supported on negative frequencies. By combining sea-surface elevation data, numerical simulations, and analytical theory, we derive the leading-order spatio-temporal spectrum for weakly interacting water waves, providing a unified explanation for its observed features.</description>

      <title>Phase-Space Analysis of Elastic Vector Solitons in Flexible Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to propose a revised continuum model from the discrete system introduced in [Deng et.al., PRL, 2017] . Using a Galilean transformation, we obtain an equation governing the soliton solutions in the phase plane - a second-order nonlinear ODE related to the Klein-Gordon equation with quadratic nonlinearity. These admit the well-known $\mathrm{sech}^2$ solutions, which we employ as an ans\"atz following [Deng et.al., PRL, 2017]. The resulting analysis yields soliton amplitudes and velocities that agree closely with numerical simulations, achieving an improvement of exactly 1/9 relative to the benchmark reported by the Harvard group.</description>

      <title>Two Quantum Algorithms for Nonlinear Reaction-Diffusion Equation using Chebyshev Approximation Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present two new quantum algorithms for reaction-diffusion equations that employ the truncated Chebyshev polynomial approximation. This method is employed to numerically solve the ordinary differential equation emerging from the linearization of the associated nonlinear differential equation. In the first algorithm, we use the matrix exponentiation method (Patel et al., 2018), while in the second algorithm, we repurpose the quantum spectral method (Childs et al., 2020). Our main technical contribution is to derive the sufficient conditions for the diagonalization of the Carleman embedding matrix, which is indispensable for designing both quantum algorithms. We supplement this with an efficient iterative algorithm to diagonalize the Carleman matrix.
  Our first algorithm has gate complexity of O(d$\cdot$log(d)+T$\cdot$polylog(T/$\varepsilon$)). Here $d$ is the size of the Carleman matrix, $T$ is the simulation time, and $\varepsilon$ is the approximation error. The second algorithm is polynomial in $log(d)$, $T$, and $log(1/\varepsilon)$ - the gate complexity scales as O(polylog(d)$\cdot$T$\cdot$polylog(T/$\varepsilon$)). In terms of $T$ and $\varepsilon$, this is comparable to the speedup gained by the current best known quantum algorithm for this problem, the truncated Taylor series method (Costa et.al., 2025).
  Our approach has two shortcomings. First, we have not provided an upper bound, in terms of d, on the condition number of the Carleman matrix. Second, the success of the diagonalization is based on a conjecture that a specific trigonometric equation has no integral solution. However, we provide strategies to mitigate these shortcomings in most practical cases.</description>

      <title>Soliton interaction and bound state formation in coupled Kerr resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soliton dynamics in coupled Kerr microcavities is an important aspect of frequency comb technologies, with applications in optical communication and precision metrology. We investigate a minimal system consisting of two nearly identical coupled Kerr microresonators, each operating in the soliton regime and driven by a separate coherent beam, and analyze the mechanisms that govern their soliton interactions. In the weak-coupling regime, the system supports multiple soliton clusters characterized by distinct soliton separations and stability. Numerical simulations indicate that asymmetric perturbations can alter soliton separations or destroy these states, while the imposed pump phase difference plays a key role in cluster selection. Together, these findings highlight previously unexplored regimes of dissipative soliton organization and suggest new strategies for controlling soliton ensembles in integrated photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>A Weakly Nonlinear Theory for Pattern Formation in Structured Models with Localized Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured models, such as PDEs structured by age or phenotype, provide a setting to study pattern formation in heterogeneous populations. Classical tools to quantify the emergence of patterns, such as linear and weakly nonlinear analyses, pose significant mathematical challenges for these models due to sharply peaked or singular steady states. Here, we present a weakly nonlinear framework that extends classical tools to structured PDE models in settings where the base state is spatially uniform, but exponentially localized in the structured variable. Our approach utilizes WKBJ asymptotics and an analysis of the Stokes phenomenon to systematically resolve the solution structure in the limit where the steady state tends to a Dirac-delta function. To demonstrate our method, we consider a chemically structured (nonlocal) model of motile bacteria that interact through quorum sensing. For this example, our analysis yields an amplitude equation that governs the solution dynamics near a linear instability, and predicts a pitchfork bifurcation. From the amplitude equation, we deduce an effective parameter grouping whose sign determines whether the pitchfork bifurcation is subcritical or supercritical. Although we demonstrate our framework for a specific example, our techniques are broadly applicable.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear stage of modulational instability in repulsive two-component Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17083v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modulational instability (MI) is a fundamental phenomenon in the study of nonlinear dynamics, spanning diverse areas such as shallow water waves, optics, and ultracold atomic gases. In particular, the nonlinear stage of MI has recently been a topic of intense exploration, and has been shown to manifest, in many cases, in the generation of dispersive shock waves (DSWs). In this work, we experimentally probe the MI dynamics in an immiscible two-component ultracold atomic gas with exclusively repulsive interactions, catalyzed by a hard-wall-like boundary produced by a repulsive optical barrier. We analytically describe the expansion rate of the DSWs in this system, generalized to arbitrary inter-component interaction strengths and species ratios. We observe excellent agreement among the analytical results, an effective 1D numerical model, full 3D numerical simulations, and experimental data. Additionally, we extend this scenario to the interaction between two counterpropagating DSWs, which leads to the production of Peregrine soliton structures. These results further demonstrate the versatility of atomic platforms towards the controlled realization of DSWs and rogue waves.</description>
