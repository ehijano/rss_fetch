      <title>Run supports and initial algebra supports of weighted automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider weighted automata over words and over trees where the weight algebras are strong bimonoids, i.e., semirings which may lack distributivity. It is well known that, for each such weighted automaton, its run semantics and its initial algebra semantics can be different, due to the presence of nondeterminism and the absence of distributivity. Here we investigate the question under which conditions on the strong bimonoid the support of the run semantics equals the support of the initial algebra semantics. We prove a characterization of this equality in terms of strongly zero-sum-free strong bimonoids (for weighted automata over words) and in terms of bi-strongly zero-sum-free strong bimonoids (for weighted automata over trees). We also consider shortly the images of the two semantics functions.</description>

      <title>Learning Realtime One-Counter Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.09434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.09434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new learning algorithm for realtime one-counter automata. Our algorithm uses membership and equivalence queries as in Angluin's L* algorithm, as well as counter value queries and partial equivalence queries. In a partial equivalence query, we ask the teacher whether the language of a given finite-state automaton coincides with a counter-bounded subset of the target language. We evaluate an implementation of our algorithm on a number of random benchmarks and on a use case regarding efficient JSON-stream validation.</description>

      <title>Subsequences in Bounded Ranges: Matching and Analysis Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a variant of the classical algorithmic problem of checking whether a given word $v$ is a subsequence of another word $w$. More precisely, we consider the problem of deciding, given a number $p$ (defining a range-bound) and two words $v$ and $w$, whether there exists a factor $w[i:i+p-1]$ (or, in other words, a range of length $p$) of $w$ having $v$ as subsequence (i.\,e., $v$ occurs as a subsequence in the bounded range $w[i:i+p-1]$). We give matching upper and lower quadratic bounds for the time complexity of this problem. Further, we consider a series of algorithmic problems in this setting, in which, for given integers $k$, $p$ and a word $w$, we analyse the set $p$-Subseq$_{k}(w)$ of all words of length $k$ which occur as subsequence of some factor of length $p$ of $w$. Among these, we consider the $k$-universality problem, the $k$-equivalence problem, as well as problems related to absent subsequences. Surprisingly, unlike the case of the classical model of subsequences in words where such problems have efficient solutions in general, we show that most of these problems become intractable in the new setting when subsequences in bounded ranges are considered. Finally, we provide an example of how some of our results can be applied to subsequence matching problems for circular words.</description>

      <title>Submonoid Membership in n-dimensional lamplighter groups and S-unit equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07077v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Submonoid Membership is decidable in n-dimensional lamplighter groups $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}) \wr \mathbb{Z}^n$ for any prime $p$ and integer $n$. More generally, we show decidability of Submonoid Membership in semidirect products of the form $\mathcal{Y} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}^n$, where $\mathcal{Y}$ is any finitely presented module over the Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_p[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_n^{\pm}]$. Combined with a result of Shafrir (2024), this gives the first example of a group $G$ and a finite index subgroup $\widetilde{G} \leq G$, such that Submonoid Membership is decidable in $\widetilde{G}$ but undecidable in $G$.
  To obtain our decidability result, we reduce Submonoid Membership in $\mathcal{Y} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}^n$ to solving S-unit equations over $\mathbb{F}_p[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_n^{\pm}]$-modules. We show that the solution set of such equations is effectively $p$-automatic, extending a result of Adamczewski and Bell (2012). As an intermediate result, we also obtain that the solution set of the Knapsack Problem in $\mathcal{Y} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}^n$ is effectively $p$-automatic.</description>
