      <title>Interacting Holographic dark energy with matter creation: A dynamical system analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An interacting Holographic dark energy (HDE) with different infra-red (IR) cutoffs (Hubble horizon and future event horizon) is investigated in the background dynamics of flat Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker (FLRW) universe where gravitational particle creation effects via different form of particle creation rates (1) $\Gamma=3\beta H$ and (2) $\Gamma=3\alpha H_{0}+3\beta H$ are considered. The created particles are considered to be pressureless Dark Matter (DM) which interacts with the HDE through a phenomenological choice of interaction term $Q=3\gamma H \rho_{m}$. We obtain an analytic solution of the cosmological dynamics with Hubble horizon as IR cutoff when the creation rate is taken as $\Gamma=3 \beta H$. We find that the interacting HDE from the Hubble horizon as the IR cutoff can give the late-time acceleration and non-interacting cannot give. On the other hand, employing the Hubble horizon and the future event as IR cutoffs for the model of HDE does not provide the analytic solution when the creation rate is taken as $\Gamma=3\alpha H_{0}+3\beta H$. We then analyze the model separately using the dynamical systems theory. From the analysis, the model (with Hubble horizon as IR cutoff) provides two sets of critical points. One can give a late-time accelerated universe evolving in quintessence, the cosmological constant, or the phantom era. But, it does not show any matter-dominated era. On the other hand, by applying the future event as an IR cutoff, the model provides the complete evolution of the universe. It also exhibits the late-time scaling attractor gives the possible solution of the coincidence problem. Global dynamics of the model are investigated by defining the appropriate Lyapunov function. Finally, the adiabatic sound speeds of all the models have been calculated and plotted numerically to find the stability of the models.</description>

      <title>Height-function-based 4D reference metrics for hyperboloidal evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperboloidal slices are spacelike slices that reach future null infinity. Their asymptotic behaviour is different from Cauchy slices, which are traditionally used in numerical relativity simulations. This work uses free evolution of the formally-singular conformally compactified Einstein equations in spherical symmetry. One way to construct gauge conditions suitable for this approach relies on building the gauge source functions from a time-independent background spacetime metric. This background reference metric is set using the height function approach to provide the correct asymptotics of hyperboloidal slices of Minkowski spacetime. The present objective is to study the effect of different choices of height function on hyperboloidal evolutions via the reference metrics used in the gauge conditions. A total of 10 reference metrics for Minkowski are explored, identifying some of their desired features. They include 3 hyperboloidal layer constructions, evolved with the non-linear Einstein equations for the first time. Focus is put on long-term numerical stability of the evolutions, including small initial gauge perturbations. The results will be relevant for future (puncture-type) hyperboloidal evolutions, 3D simulations and the development of coinciding Cauchy and hyperboloidal data, among other applications.</description>

      <title>Phase time and Ehrenfest's theorem in relativistic quantum mechanics and quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the concept of phase time, which has been previously proposed as a solution to the problem of time in quantum gravity. Concretely, we show how the geometry of configuration space together with the phase of the wave function of the universe can, under certain conditions, lead to the definition of a positive-definite inner product from which probabilities can be defined. The norm is conserved under time evolution, and we obtain a version of Ehrenfest's theorem that is analogous to the one in ordinary quantum mechanics. We address how the present approach avoids some difficulties that were encountered in previous attempts at defining an Ehrenfest theorem relative to phase time in the context of relativistic quantum mechanics and canonical quantum gravity, and how it is connected to a notion of gauge fixing the inner product. We conclude with a brief outlook.</description>

      <title>Theory-agnostic searches for non-gravitational modes in black hole ringdown</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In any extension of General Relativity (GR), extra fundamental degrees of freedom couple to gravity. Besides deforming GR forecasts in a theory-dependent way, this coupling generically introduces extra modes in the gravitational-wave signal. We propose a novel theory-agnostic test of gravity to search for these nongravitational modes in black hole merger ringdown signals. To leading order in the GR deviations, their frequencies and damping times match those of a test scalar or vector field in a Kerr background, with only amplitudes and phases as free parameters. This test will be highly valuable for future detectors, which will achieve signal-to-noise ratios higher than 100 (and as high as 1000 for space-based detectors such as LISA). Such sensitivity will allow measurement of these modes with amplitude ratios as low as 0.05 for ground-based detectors (and as low as 0.008 for LISA), relative to the fundamental mode, enabling stringent agnostic constraints or detection of scalar/vector modes. By applying this test to GW150914, GW190521, and GW200129, we find that the current evidence for an extra mode is comparable to that for the first gravitational overtone, but its inclusion modifies the inferred remnant spin.</description>

      <title>General analysis of Noether symmetries in Horndeski gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore Noether symmetries of Horndeski gravity, extending the classification of general scalar-tensor theories. Starting from the minimally coupled scalar field and the first-generation scalar-tensor gravity, the discussion is generalised to kinetic gravity braiding and Horndeski gravity. We highlight the main findings by focusing on the non-minimally coupled Gauss-Bonnet term and the extended cuscuton model. Finally, we discuss how the presence of matter can influence Noether symmetries. It turns out that the selected Horndeski functions are unchanged with respect to the vacuum case.</description>

      <title>Geodesics structure and deflection angle of electrically charged black holes in gravity with a background Kalb-Ramond field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates the geodesic structure and deflection angle of charged black holes in the presence of a nonzero vacuum expectation value background of the Kalb-Ramond field. Topics explored include null and timelike geodesics, energy extraction by collisions, and the motion of charged particles. The photon sphere radius is calculated and plotted to examine the effects of both the black hole charge ($Q$) and the Lorentz-violating parameter ($b$) on null geodesics. The effective potential for timelike geodesics is analyzed, and second-order analytical orbits are derived. We further show that the combined effects of Lorentz-violating parameter and electric charge can mimic a Kerr black hole spin parameter up to its maximum values, i.e., $a/M \sim 1$ thus suggesting that the current precision of measurements of highly spinning black hole candidates may not rule out the effect of Lorentz-violating parameter. The center of mass energy of colliding particles is also considered, demonstrating a decrease with increasing Lorentz-violating parameter. Circular orbiting particles of charged particles are discovered, with the minimum radius for a stable circular orbit decreasing as both $b$ and $Q$ increase. Results show that this circular orbit is particularly sensitive to changes in the Lorentz-violating parameter. Additionally, a timelike particle trajectory is demonstrated as a consequence of the combined effects of parameters $b$ and $Q$. Finally, the light deflection angle is analyzed using the weak field limit approach to determine the Lorentz-breaking effect, employing the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for computation. Findings are visualized with appropriate plots and thoroughly discussed.</description>

      <title>Stationary Scalar Clouds around Kerr-Newman Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates scalar clouds around Kerr-Newman black holes within the Einstein-Maxwell-scalar model. Tachyonic instabilities are identified as the driving mechanism for scalar cloud formation. Employing the spectral method, we numerically compute wave functions and parameter space existence domains for both fundamental and excited scalar cloud modes. Our analysis demonstrates that black hole spin imposes an upper limit on the existence of scalar clouds, with excited modes requiring stronger tachyonic instabilities for their formation. These findings lay the groundwork for exploring the nonlinear dynamics and astrophysical implications of scalar clouds.</description>

      <title>Gravitational spin Hall effect of electrons in Schwarzschild metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we derive the non-relativistic Hamiltonian for electrons within the Schwarzschild metric from covariant Dirac equations, using both the weak field approximation and the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. This Hamiltonian incorporates a gravitational spin-orbit coupling term, resulting in the gravitational spin Hall effect (SHE), which separates electrons by their spin. By solving the Schr\"odinger equation for these electrons, we investigate the gravitational SHE as they orbit a non-rotating gravitational source. Our findings reveal that the spin-dependent separation of electrons increases in proportion to their orbital periods, significantly improving the detectability of gravitational SHE. Specifically, for electrons in a low Earth orbit, the separation is estimated to be $3.0\times 10^{-12}\, \text{m}$ annually. These results indicate the practicality of detecting the gravitational SHE in electrons orbiting Earth, especially with prolonged orbital durations, underscoring the potential for quantum test of the Weak Equivalence Principle.</description>

      <title>Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture Cannot be Violated in Gedanken Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We innovate a systematic investigation of the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) using gedanken experiments involving black hole perturbations by test particles. We classify various WCCC violation scenarios proposed in recent decades, including Hubeny, mixed, and the latest Sorce-Wald (SW). We provide general formulae in each case, and resolve contradictions in numerous studies. Following SW type, our analysis reveals that WCCC depends on the sign choice of the parameter $W\equiv \big(\frac{\partial S}{\partial T}\big)_{Q_i; T=0}$ of the extremal black holes. $W &gt; 0$ preserves WCCC and $W &lt; 0$ would indicate potential violation. We show explicitly that $W&gt;0$ for spherically-symmetric and static black holes, and for general case, we argue that it is protected by the black hole no-hair theorem. We also consider asymptotically-(A)dS black holes and argue that there can be no violation either.</description>

      <title>Black hole thermodynamics from an ensemble-averaged theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The path integral approach to a quantum theory of gravity is widely regarded as an indispensable strategy. However, determining what additional elements, beyond black hole or AdS spacetime, should be incorporated into the path integral remains crucial yet perplexing. We argue that the spacetime with a conical singularity in its Euclidean counterpart should be the most important ingredient to append to the path integral. Therefore, physical quantities should be ensemble-averaged over all geometries since they are described by the same Lorentzian metric. When the ensemble average is introduced, the Hawking-Page transition for the Schwarzschild-AdS black hole and the small-large black hole transition for the Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS black hole naturally arise as semi-classical approximations, when the size of the black hole system is much larger than the Planck length. Away from the semi-classical limit, the system is a superposition of different geometries, and the averaged quantities would deviate from the black hole thermodynamics. Expanding around the classical saddles, the subleading order of Newton's constant contributions can be derived, which are both half of the Hawking temperature for the Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. The result may imply a universal structure. The subsubleading terms and more intriguing physics that diverge from black hole thermodynamics are revealed. The ensemble-averaged theory provides a new way of studying subleading effects and extending the traditional AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>Weak field deflection angle and analytical parameter estimation of the Lorentz-violating Bumblebee parameter through the black hole shadow using EHT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a way to explore the potential consequences of Lorentz symmetry breaking on gravitational and cosmological phenomena, the Bumblebee model was proposed as a type of modified gravity theory that incorporates spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking, achieved by a Bumblebee vector field acquiring a non-zero vacuum expectation value in some preferred direction. In this paper, we explored how the Lorentz symmetry breaking parameter $\ell$ affects the Reissner-Nordst\"{o}m BH solution in the context of weak field deflection angle, and the black hole shadow. We aim to derive the general expression for the weak deflection angle using the non-asymptotic version of the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, and we presented a way to simplify the calculations under the assumption that the distance of the source and the receiver are the same. We also studied the black hole shadow in an analytic way, where we applied the EHT results under the far approximation in obtaining an estimate expression for $\ell$. We have found out that the theory always restricts the geometrical mass and the observer's distance to being equal. Using the realistic values of the black hole mass and observer distance for Sgr. A* and M87*, it was shown that $M/r_{\rm o} \neq 1$ is satisfied, implying the relevance and potential promise of the spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking parameter's role on the shadow radius uncertainties as measured by the EHT.</description>

      <title>Second-Order Moment Quantum Fluctuations and Quantum Equivalence Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second-order moment quantum fluctuations or uncertainties are mass-dependent, the incompatibility between the quantum uncertainty principle and the equivalence principle is at the second-order moment (variation) level, but the first-order moment (mean) level. To reconcile the two fundamental principles, we find that the second-order moment quantum fluctuations are actually distinguished into two parts: a dynamic part and a geometric part. The dynamic part is indeed mass-dependent and governed by a non-zero Hamiltonian in a non-general-covariant inertial frame, and the geometric part is mass-independent and comes from coarse-graining and/or geometric effects. The dynamic part is coordinate dependent, it can be canceled away by a coordinate transformation, and hence it plays no role in general covariant theories whose Hamiltonian automatically vanishes. However, the geometric part is valid for general coordinate, and it can not be eliminated by a coordinate transformation. On the contrary, the geometric part of second-order moment fluctuation of quantum spacetime leads to coordinate transformation anomaly, which induces an effective Einstein's gravity theory. The geometric part is mass-independent and universal, so it is only this part measures the universal second-order moment quantum fluctuation of the spacetime, while the dynamic part plays no role in the general covariant description. The observation generalizes the classical equivalence principle to the quantum level. And according to the principle, a general covariant theory with only geometric part quantum fluctuation, i.e. a non-linear sigma model, is proposed as a theory of a material quantum reference frame system. The effects of the universal second-order moment quantum fluctuations in the material quantum reference system and its implications to an effective gravity theory are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Isotropic and Anisotropic Radiating Gravastars with Various Matter Types of Thin Shell and Interior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate models of radiating gravastars with both isotropic and anisotropic interiors, incorporating various types of thin shell matter. For the isotropic interior case, we consider a thin spherical shell characterized by an equation of state in which its pressure is proportional to its mass density, enclosing a de Sitter spacetime and surrounded by Vaidya exterior spacetime. Our analysis reveals that stable gravastars can form under specific scenarios of radiative mechanisms and for certain thin shell matter types. In addition, we also show and discuss in brief the possibility of existence of stable radiating anti-de Sitter gravastar formation. For the anisotropic interior, we use an anisotropic dark energy model with a Tolman-Matese-Whitman (TMW) mass function. We explore several thin shell matter types: standard, dark energy, and repulsive phantom. Our findings indicate that stable gravastars can also emerge in this context, particularly with standard and repulsive phantom thin shells. Furthermore, our results suggest that the density of black holes is consistently higher than that of gravastars and normal stars, regardless of the type of matter in the thin shell. This observation supports the notion that gravastars and black holes are distinct entities, reinforcing the theoretical distinction between these two types of compact objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of solutions to Tolman-Openheimer-Volkoff equation with linear equation of state modeling relativistic cloud of interacting particles is proved for mass parameter below certain threshold. For the intermediate values of mass parameters multiplicity result holds. For the small mass parameter the uniqueness is guaranteed. Moreover, there is a threshold value of the mass, which can not be exceeded. It is achieved by considering the related dynamical system in the rescaled mass-density variables which is governed by the global Lyapunov function with sink. Some preliminary extensions to nonlinear equation of state are discussed with numerical density profiles.</description>

      <title>Evolution of fluctuations in energy at the horizon and in the volume enclosed by it, in an expanding universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the statistical fluctuations in energy on the Hubble horizon and the Komar energy, which represents the total gravitational energy within the horizon, as the universe expands. Our analysis reveals that these fluctuations generally decrease over time but experience a pronounced spike during the universe's transition into its later accelerated expansion phase. In the framework of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, the evolution of these fluctuations shows similar behaviour, eventually stabilising at a constant minimum value. We also find that these fluctuations are holographically connected, provided the universe ends in a de Sitter phase. This holographic connection suggests that in the final de Sitter epoch, the relative fluctuations of the horizon energy and the Komar energy are equivalent, and satisfies, $\sigma_H^2/\left&lt;E_H\right&gt;^2=1/N_{surf}=1/N_{bulk} = \sigma_V^2/\left&lt;E_V\right&gt;^2.$</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Topology of Quantum Corrected AdS-Reissner-Nordstrom Black Holes in Kiselev Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve into the intricate thermodynamic topology of quantum-corrected Anti-de Sitter-Reissner-Nordstrm (AdS-RN) black hole within the framework of Kiselev spacetime. By employing the generalized off-shell Helmholtz free energy approach, we meticulously compute the thermodynamic topology of these selected black holes. Furthermore, we establish their topological classifications. Our findings reveal that quantum correction terms influence the topological charges of black holes in Kiselev spacetime, leading to novel insights into topological classifications. Our research findings elucidate that, in contrast to the scenario in which $\omega=0$ and $a=0.7$ with total topological charge $W=0$ and $\omega=-4/3$ with total topological charge $W=-1$, in other cases, the total topological charge for the black hole under consideration predominantly stabilizes at +1. This stabilization occurs with the significant influence of the parameters a, c, and $\omega$ on the number of topological charges. Specifically, when $\omega$ assumes the values of $\omega=-1/3$, $\omega=-2/3$ , $\omega=-1$, the total topological charge consistently be to W = +1.</description>

      <title>Clock synchronization and light-travel-time estimation for space-based gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA, record interferometric measurements on widely separated satellites. Their clocks are not synced actively. Instead, clock synchronization is performed in on-ground data processing. It relies on measurements of the so-called pseudoranges, which entangle the interspacecraft light travel times with the clock desynchronizations between emitting and receiving spacecraft. For interspacecraft clock synchronization, we need to isolate the differential clock desynchronizations, i.e., disentangle the pseudoranges. This further yields estimates for the interspacecraft light travel times, which are required as delays for the laser frequency noise suppression via time-delay interferometry. Previous studies on pseudorange disentanglement apply various simplifications in the pseudorange modeling and the data simulation. In contrast, this article derives an accurate pseudorange model in the barycentric celestial reference system, complemented by realistic state-of-the-art LISA data simulations. Concerning pseudorange disentanglement, this leads to an a priori under-determined system. We demonstrate how on-ground orbit determinations, as well as onboard transmission and on-ground reception time tags of the telemetry data, can be used to resolve this degeneracy. We introduce an algorithm for pseudorange disentanglement based on a nonstandard Kalman filter specially designed for clock synchronization in systems where pseudorange measurements are conducted in different time frames. This algorithm achieves interspacecraft clock synchronization and light travel time estimation with submeter accuracy, thus fulfilling the requirements of time-delay interferometry.</description>

      <title>Newtonian Gravity and Galaxy Rotation Curves: An Axisymmetric Green's Function Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard proposal within the context of General relativity and its weak field Newtonian limit for the nature of dark matter is that it consists of dark matter particles of unknown type. In the present work and specifically for spiral galaxy rotation curves, an alternative possibility is explored, in the form of an axially symmetric vortex mass distribution of finite extent threading the centre of the galaxy and perpendicular to its disk. Some general considerations are developed and characteristic properties are identified, pointing to the potential interest of such an alternative to be studied in earnest.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from extreme mass ratio inspirals in Kerr-MOG spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work elaborates on a detailed analysis of the novel characteristics of gravitational waves (GWs) generated by extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) within the framework of modified gravity (MOG). Our study begins by exploring the geometrical and dynamical properties of the Kerr-MOG spacetime. We employ the numerical kludge (NK) method for waveform simulations and reveal that the parameter $\alpha$, representing deviations from general relativity (GR), significantly impacts the frequencies of geodesic orbits and, consequently, the EMRI waveforms. However, the waveform confusion problem remains mainly unresolved, posing a challenge in distinguishing between the underlying gravitational theories based on the observed EMRI waveforms. Notably, by incorporating the effects of radiation reaction, we observe a substantial reduction in the waveform overlap over time. This reduction could enhance our ability to discern between different waveforms over an extended period.</description>

      <title>Black holes in Lorentz gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole solutions are explored in the Lorentz gauge theory of gravity. The fields of the theory are the gauge potential in the adjoint and a scalar in the fundamental representation of the Lorentz group, a metric tensor then emerging as a composite field in a symmetry-broken phase. Three distinct such phases of the theory are considered. In an SO(3) phase, the fundamental field is identified with a generalised Painlev\'e-Gullstrand-Lema\^itre coordinate time. In the static spherically symmetric case it is a stealth scalar, and the general vacuum solution is then parameterised by two constants, one related to the black hole mass and the other to an observer. Also, formulations of pregeometric first order electromagnetism are considered in order to construct a consistent realisation of a charged black hole. In an SO(1,2) phase of the theory, the Schwarzschild solution is realised as a configuration wherein the fundamental field is real outside and imaginary inside the horizon. In this phase the field can be associated with an effective radial pressure resulting in additional singularities and asymptotic non-flatness. Finally, a symmetry-broken phase which would correspond to solutions in an alternative attempt at a Lorentz gauge theory is shown to be incompatible with black holes.</description>

      <title>A novel probe of graviton dispersion relations at nano-Hertz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalise Phinney's 'practical theorem' to account for modified graviton dispersion relations motivated by certain cosmological scenarios. Focusing on specific examples, we show how such modifications can induce characteristic localised distortions, bumps, in the frequency profile of the stochastic gravitational wave background emitted from distant binary sources. We concentrate on gravitational waves at nano-Hertz frequencies probed by pulsar timing arrays, and we forecast the capabilities of future experiments to accurately probe parameters controlling modified dispersion relations. Our predictions are based on properties of gravitational waves emitted in the first inspiral phase of the binary process, and do not rely on assumptions of non-linear effects occurring during the binary merging phase</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A relativistic model of geometrically thin and optically thick accretion disks is worked out for a class of magnetically charged black holes, which are solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory with a dilaton-coupled Euler-Heisenberg correction. Constraints on black hole parameters are derived from subextremality condition and energy conditions. The Keplerian orbits, the time-averaged energy flux, the local temperature, the specific luminosity and the conversion efficiency of accreting mass into radiation are obtained and compared with Schwarzschild and Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger black holes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational radiation and dynamical degrees of freedom in DGP gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to the study of gravitational radiation in the DGP model of gravity. It includes a detailed analysis of dynamical degrees of freedom of tensionless DGP and their comparison with other related theories. We develop a procedure for constructing the effective energy-momentum tensor of the gravitational field on the brane from the non-local effective action of the DGP model based on the Noether method used to determine the conservation laws corresponding to the symmetries of the action. Using it we construct the effective energy-momentum tensor of the dynamical degrees of freedom of DGP gravity on the brane and obtain the effective four-dimensional gravitational radiation energy flux. We then obtain an analog of the quadrupole formula for the effective gravitational radiation power of an arbitrary non-relativistic source on the brane. We also discuss the possibility of detecting the effect of leakage of gravitational waves into the extra dimension resulting from the metastable character of the effective graviton on the brane. In particular, in accordance with the infrared transparency of the bulk of DGP model, we find that the frequency of gravitational-wave signal controls the effective crossover radius, beyond which the leakage of gravitational waves manifests itself.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of hybrid foreground removal on CHIME data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main challenge of 21 cm cosmology experiments is astrophysical foregrounds which are difficult to separate from the signal due to telescope systematics. An earlier study has shown that foreground residuals induced by antenna gain errors can be estimated and subtracted using the hybrid foreground residual subtraction (HyFoReS) technique which relies on cross-correlating linearly filtered data. In this paper, we apply a similar technique to the CHIME stacking analysis to subtract beam-induced foreground contamination. Using a linear high-pass delay filter for foreground suppression, the CHIME collaboration reported a $11.1\sigma$ detection in the 21 cm signal stacked on eBOSS quasar locations, despite foreground residual contamination mostly due to the instrument chromatic transfer function. We cross-correlate the foreground-dominated data at low delay with the contaminated signal at high delay to estimate residual foregrounds and subtract them from the signal. We find foreground residual subtraction can improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the stacked 21 cm signal by $ 10 - 20\%$ after the delay foreground filter, although some of the improvement can also be achieved with an alternative flagging technique. We have shown that it is possible to use HyFoReS to reduce beam-induced foreground contamination, benefiting the analysis of the HI auto power spectrum with CHIME and enabling the recovery of large scale modes.</description>

Abstract: The interplay between cosmology and strongly coupled dynamics can yield transient spectral features that vanish at late times, but which may leave behind phenomenological signatures in the spectrum of primordial fluctuations. Of particular interest are strongly coupled extensions of the standard model featuring approximate conformal invariance. In flat space, the spectral density for a scalar operator in a conformal field theory is characterized by a continuum with scaling law governed by the dimension of the operator, and is otherwise featureless. AdS/CFT arguments suggest that for large $N$, in an inflationary background with Hubble rate $H$, this continuum is gapped. We demonstrate that there can be additional peak structures that become sharp and particle-like at phenomenologically interesting regions in parameter space, and we estimate their contribution to cosmological observables. We find phenomena that are potentially observable in future experiments that are unique to these models, including displaced oscillatory features in the squeezed limit of the bi-spectrum. These particles can be either fundamental, and localized to a UV brane, or composite at the Hubble scale, $H$, and bound to a horizon in the bulk of the 5D geometry. We comment on how stabilization of conformal symmetry breaking vacua can be correlated with these spectral features and their phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Dark Energy from Lattice Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the behavior of the vacuum in Euclidean dynamical triangulations (EDT). Algorithmic improvements and better lattice spacing determinations allow us to test the properties of the emergent de Sitter geometries of our simulations to higher precision than previously possible. Although the agreement with de Sitter is good, the improved precision reveals deviations that can be interpreted as non-trivial vacuum dynamics, well-described by a cosmological constant that runs with scale. The simulations show that the dominant running is quadratic and that the scale can be identified with the Hubble rate. Several key cross-checks support this picture, including consistent results across multiple lattice spacings and the fact that covariant energy conservation is maintained. The parameters of the running are fully determined by simulations, enabling predictions when extrapolated to the scales relevant for our universe. This leads to a model for dark energy that is compatible with current observations, but which predicts deviations from $\Lambda$CDM at the ${\cal O}(10^{-3})$ level in cosmological observables that could be tested with future improvements in precision measurements.</description>

      <title>New purely damped pairs of quasinormal modes in a hot and dense strongly-coupled plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Perturbed black holes exhibit damped oscillations whose eigenfrequencies define their quasinormal modes (QNMs). In the case of asymptotically AdS black holes, the spectra of QNMs are related to the near-equilibrium behavior of specific strongly interacting quantum field theories via the holographic gauge-gravity duality. In the present work, we numerically obtain the spectra of homogeneous non-hydrodynamic QNMs of a top-down holographic construction describing a hot and dense strongly-coupled plasma. The main result is the discovery of a new structure of pairs of purely imaginary QNMs. Those new purely damped QNMs dominate the late time equilibration of the strongly-coupled plasma at large values of the chemical potential, while at lower values the fundamental QNMs are instead ordinary poles with imaginary and real parts describing oscillatory decaying perturbations. We also observe a new phenomenon of asymptotic pole fusion for different pairs of purely imaginary QNMs at asymptotically large values of the chemical potential. This phenomenon corresponds to the asymptotic merging of the two poles within each pair of purely imaginary QNMs, indicating that characteristic equilibration times for the plasma develop upper bounds that cannot be surpassed by further doping the medium with increasing values of the chemical potential.</description>

Abstract: In four dimensions, 't Hooft symbols offer a compact and powerful framework for describing the self-dual structures fundamental to instanton physics. Extending this to six dimensions, the six-dimensional 't Hooft symbols can be constructed using the isomorphism between the Lorentz group $Spin(6)$ and the unitary group $SU(4)$. We demonstrate that the six-dimensional self-dual structures governed by the Hermitian Yang-Mills equations can be elegantly organized using these generalized 't Hooft symbols. We also present a systematic method for constructing Hermitian Yang-Mills instantons from spin connections on six-dimensional manifolds using the generalized 't Hooft symbols. We provide a thorough analysis of the topological invariants such as instanton and Euler numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some of the extensions to general relativity and to the Standard Model of particle physics predict families of hypothetical compact objects, collectively known as exotic compact objects (ECOs). This category can be defined to encompass non-Kerr black holes both within and beyond general relativity, as well as horizonless compact objects such as boson stars. In order to model observational signatures and identify possible detections, it is crucial to understand the interaction between these objects and their surrounding medium, usually plasmas described by the equations of general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). To this end, we review the existent literature on GRMHD simulations of accretion onto these objects. These cover a variety of objects and accretion patterns. We conclude by listing possible directions to continue exploring this relatively young field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over a decade before the modern formulation of AdS/CFT duality, Duff et al. had observed a candidate microscopic explanation by identifying the CFT fields with fluctuations of probe p-branes stretched out in parallel near the horizon of their own black brane incarnation. A profound way to characterize these and more general probe p-brane configurations, especially for M5-branes, is expected to be as "super-embeddings" of their super-worldvolumes into target super-spacetime - but no concrete example of these had appeared in the literature.
  Here we fill this gap by constructing the explicit holographic super-embedding of probe M5-branes and M2-branes into their corresponding super-AdS backgrounds. The result seems to be novel and shows that the holographic M-probes, static with respect to the Poincar\'e chart, must sit exactly at the throat radius.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\delta N$ formalism is a powerful approach to compute non-linearly the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation $\zeta$. It assumes a set of FLRW patches that evolve independently, but in doing so, all the gradient terms are discarded, which are not negligibly small in models beyond slow-roll. In this paper, we extend the formalism to capture these gradient corrections by encoding them in a homogeneous-spatial-curvature contribution assigned to each FLRW patch. For a concrete example, we apply this formalism to the ultra-slow-roll inflation, and find that it can correctly describe the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation from the horizon exit. We also briefly discuss non-Gaussianities in this context.</description>

      <title>On the mechanism of black hole energy reduction in the Blandford-Znajek process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Blandford-Znajek (BZ) process is electromagnetic energy release from rotating black holes (BHs) along magnetic field lines threading them and widely believed to drive relativistic jets. This process is successfully demonstrated in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations with the coordinate system regular on the event horizon, by which one can estimate the outward Poynting flux, although the direct energy release through the horizon shown in the simulations does not provide an intuitive picture. We revisit the mechanism of BH energy reduction by utilizing the coordinate system singular on the horizon, in which the falling membrane of past accreted matter should exist above the horizon. We find that the Poynting flux is produced at the boundary between the falling membrane and the magnetically-dominated inflow, and the front of the inflow creates the negative electromagnetic energy, which reduces the rotational energy of spacetime. We also clarify that the poloidal electric current does not form a closed circuit within the magnetically-dominated flow. Previous interpretations of the BZ process and possibilities of the ideal MHD violation and BH charging are also discussed.</description>

      <title>From Low- to High-Frequency QPOs around the Non-Rotating Hairy Horndeski Black Hole: Microquasar GRS 1915+105</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on the Horndeski black hole, associated with the scalar hairy parameter, offers insights into enigmatic cosmic phenomena such as dark matter. Additionally, the numerical study of the GRS 1915+105 source, which exhibits continuous variability in X-ray observations, along with its physical properties and mechanisms behind Quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) frequencies, can contribute to observational studies. Motivated by this, we examine the variations in physical mechanisms around the non-rotating Horndeski black hole with Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton (BHL) accretion related to the scalar hair parameter and the resulting QPO frequencies. With a decrease in the scalar hair parameter, the shock cone opening angle narrows due to the influence of the scalar field potential, and the stagnation point within the cone moves closer to the black hole horizon. With the changing scalar hair parameter, the simultaneous formation of the shock cone and bow shock is observed. Due to the intense increase in scalar potential, both the shock cone and bow shock disappeared, and a cavity surrounding the black hole forms in the area where the shock cone was. Additionally, QPO oscillations induced by the physical mechanisms observed in relation to the hair parameter are revealed through numerical simulations. A broad range of QPO frequencies is observed, from low to high frequencies, with resonance states like 3:2 occurring. Lastly, we define the potential range of the spin parameter for the GRS 1915+105 source based on the agreement between observational and numerical results. It has also been found that for most of the QPOs obtained from numerical calculations to be consistent with observations, h/M should be greater than -0.5.</description>

      <title>The NANOGrav 15 yr Data Set: Running of the Spectral Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The NANOGrav 15-year data provides compelling evidence for a stochastic gravitational-wave (GW) background at nanohertz frequencies. The simplest model-independent approach to characterizing the frequency spectrum of this signal consists in a simple power-law fit involving two parameters: an amplitude A and a spectral index \gamma. In this paper, we consider the next logical step beyond this minimal spectral model, allowing for a running (i.e., logarithmic frequency dependence) of the spectral index, \gamma_run(f) = \gamma + \beta \ln(f/f_ref). We fit this running-power-law (RPL) model to the NANOGrav 15-year data and perform a Bayesian model comparison with the minimal constant-power-law (CPL) model, which results in a 95% credible interval for the parameter \beta consistent with no running, \beta \in [-0.80,2.96], and an inconclusive Bayes factor, B(RPL vs. CPL) = 0.69 +- 0.01. We thus conclude that, at present, the minimal CPL model still suffices to adequately describe the NANOGrav signal; however, future data sets may well lead to a measurement of nonzero \beta. Finally, we interpret the RPL model as a description of primordial GWs generated during cosmic inflation, which allows us to combine our results with upper limits from big-bang nucleosynthesis, the cosmic microwave background, and LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA.</description>

      <title>Paradoxes before the paradox: surface gravity and the information loss problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.13939v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The information loss paradox is widely regarded as one of the biggest open problems in theoretical physics. Several classical and quantum features must be present to enable its formulation. First, an event horizon is needed to justify the objective status of tracing out degrees of freedom inside the black hole. Second, evaporation must be completed (or nearly completed) in finite time according to a distant observer, and thus the formation of the black hole should also occur in finite time. In spherical symmetry these requirements constrain the possible metrics strongly enough to obtain a unique black hole formation scenario and match their parameters with the semiclassical results. However, the two principal generalizations of surface gravity, the quantity that determines the Hawking temperature, do not agree with each other on the dynamical background. Neither can correspond to the emission of nearly-thermal radiation. We infer from this that the information loss problem cannot be consistently posed in its standard form.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of the bumblebee black holes with a global monopole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute quasinormal modes of test fields around spherically symmetric black holes with a global monopole in bumblebee gravity. The frequency of oscillation and the damping rate exhibit significant decreasing as the global monopole parameter is increased. An intriguing observation arises in the extreme limit, where the quasinormal modes manifest a form of universal behavior: the actual oscillation frequency remains unaltered despite variations in the Lorentz symmetry breaking (LSB) parameter. Our calculations are conducted through two distinct methods, both of which yield results that align remarkably well. Furthermore, we derive an analytical formula for quasinormal modes within the eikonal approximation and beyond it. In the limits of either vanishing deficit angle or bumblebee parameters, the compact and sufficiently accurate analytic expressions for quasinormal modes are obtained.</description>

      <title>Proof of the Einstein quadrupole formula for solutions of the Einstein-Vlasov system close to Minkowski spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We rigorously derive the quadrupole formula within the context of the Einstein-Vlasov system. The main contribution of this work is an estimate of the remainder terms, derived from well-defined assumptions, with explicitly stated error terms that depend on the solution's boundedness and decay properties, and the distance to the source. The assumptions are linked to established properties of global solutions of the Einstein-Vlasov system as in \cite{LT}. Prior derivations of the quadrupole formula have relied on post-Newtonian analysis and lacked comparisons with global solution properties. The importance of the no-incoming-radiation condition is emphasized underscoring the need for solutions satisfying this condition. This work thus addresses the limitations of existing results and provides motivation for further research on global solution properties of the Einstein-Vlasov system.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in high-energy and high-peak-power laser systems have opened up new possibilities for fundamental physics research. In this work, the potential of twisted light for the generation of gravitational waves in the high frequency regime is explored for the first time. Focusing on Bessel beams, novel analytic expressions and numerical computations for the generated metric perturbations and associated powers are presented. Compelling evidence is provided that the properties of the generated gravitational waves, such as frequency, polarisation states and direction of emission, are controllable by the laser pulse parameters and optical arrangements.</description>

      <title>Topology of black hole thermodynamics via R\'enyi statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the topological numbers of the four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole, $d$-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole, $d$-dimensional singly rotating Kerr black hole and five-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet black hole via the R\'enyi statistics. We find that the topological number calculated via the R\'enyi statistics is different from that obtained from the Gibbs-Boltzmann (GB) statistics. However, what is interesting is that the topological classifications of different black holes are consistent in both the R\'enyi and GB statistics: the four-dimensional RN black hole, four-dimensional and five-dimensional singly rotating Kerr black holes, five-dimensional charged and uncharged Gauss-Bonnet black holes belong to the same kind of topological class, and the four-dimensional Schwarzschild black hole and $d(&gt;5)$-dimensional singly rotating Kerr black holes belong to another kind of topological class. In addition, our results suggest that the topological numbers calculated via the R\'enyi statistics in asymptotically flat spacetime background are equal to those calculated from the standard GB statistics in asymptotically AdS spacetime background, which provides more evidence for the connection between the nonextensivity of the R\'enyi parameter $\lambda$ and the cosmological constant $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Logamediate inflation on the Swiss-cheese brane with varying cosmological constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15186v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of Schwarzchild black holes in the structure of Swiss-cheese brane-world led to the conclusion that this specific brane-world scenario is more realistic than the FLRW branes. In this paper, we show that a Logamediate inflation on the Swiss-cheese brane with time-dependent cosmological constant $\Lambda(H)$ leads to a positive kinetic term and a negative potential with AdS minimum. The cosmic pressure $p$ is always positive but the energy density $\rho$ starts to get negative after a finite time. However, there is a time interval where they both are positive. Although this behavior of $\rho$ can be considered as a drawback of Swiss-cheese brane where positive energy dominates the present universe, it has been suggested that the presence of some source of negative energy could have played a significant role in early cosmic expansion. The model suffers from the eternal inflation problem which appears from the evolution of the first slow-roll parameter $\epsilon$. Due to the existence of $\rho^2$ term, we have tested the new nonlinear energy conditions. The slow-roll parameters have been investigated and compared to Planck 15 results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06329v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the formation of type II primordial black holes (PBHs) resulting from extremely large amplitudes of initial fluctuations in a radiation-dominated universe. We find that, for a sufficiently large initial amplitude, the configuration of trapping horizons shows characteristic structure due to the existence of bifurcating trapping horizons. We call this type of configuration of the trapping horizons type II-B PBH, while the structure without a bifurcating trapping horizon type II-A PBH. In Ref. [1], in the dust-dominated universe, the type B PBH can be realized by the type II initial fluctuation, which is characterized by a non-monotonic areal radius as a function of the radial coordinate (throat structure) in contrast with the standard case, type A PBH with a monotonic areal radius (type I fluctuation). Our research reveals that a type II fluctuation does not necessarily result in a type B PBH in the radiation-dominated case. We also find that for an initial amplitude well above the threshold value, the resulting PBH mass may either increase or decrease with the initial amplitude, depending on its specific profile rather than its fluctuation type.</description>

Abstract: Our motivation in this work is due to the great importance of relativistic boson stars as fierce competitors of black holes which from theoretical perspective they described by some KG complex scalar waves interacting with curved background in general form. To do so we use the Einstein-Klein Gordon (KG) scalar tensor gravity in presence of Coleman-Weinberg (CW) self-interaction potential to study possible of formation of a spherically symmetric boson star and situation of its stability. As we know the CW potential plays an important role in description of cosmic inflation and so we encourage to check its effects in formation of a relativistic boson star.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the $N$-body system in energy-momentum squared gravity: Equations of motion to the first post-Newtonian order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the energy-momentum squared gravity (EMSG), the matter energy-momentum tensor is not conserved due to nonminimal interaction between the usual and modified matter fields. For this reason, the $N$-body acceleration may host the EMSG effects that can be probed at the solar scale by the perihelion shift of the planets and experimental tests of the Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP). To clarify this point, in this paper, we introduce the $N$-body equations of motion in the weak-field limit of the EMSG theory. To do so, the post-Newtonian (PN) hydrodynamic equations, the viral identities, as well as the corresponding equilibrium conditions are introduced in this theory. Armed with these relations, we derive the dynamics of the $N$-body system and its PN inter-body metric. It is shown that the EMSG theory is not ruled out by the classical test, the perihelion advance of Mercury, and the test of SEP. In other words, in the first PN order, it is not possible to constrain the free parameter of this theory and even distinguish it from GR using these local tests.</description>

      <title>GLANCE -- Gravitational Lensing Authenticator using Non-Modelled Cross-Correlation Exploration of Gravitational Wave Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03982v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing is the phenomenon where the presence of matter (called a lens) bends the path of light-like trajectories travelling nearby. Similar to the geometric optics limit of electromagnetic waves, gravitational lensing of gravitational waves (GWs) can occur in geometric optics condition when GW wavelength is much smaller than the Schwarzschild radius of the lens i.e. $\lambda_{GW} \ll$ R$^{\rm s}_{\rm lens}$. This is known as the strong-lensing regime for which a multiple-image system with different magnifications and phase-shifts is formed. We developed $\texttt{GLANCE}$, Gravitational Lensing Authenticator using Non-modelled Cross-correlation Exploration, a novel technique to detect strongly lensed GW signals. We demonstrate that cross-correlation between two noisy reconstruction of polarized GW signals shows a non-zero value when the signals are lensed counterparts. The relative strength between the signal cross-correlation and noise cross-correlation can quantify the significance of the event(s) being lensed. Since lensing biases the inference of source parameters, primarily the luminosity distance, a joint parameter estimation of the source and lens-induced parameters is incorporated using a Bayesian framework. We applied $\texttt{GLANCE}$ to synthetic strong lensing data and showed that it can detect lensed GW signals and correctly constrain the injected source and lens parameters, even when one of the signals is below match-filtered threshold signal-to-noise ratio. This demonstrates $\texttt{GLANCE}'$s capability as a robust detection technique for strongly lensed GW signals and can distinguish between lensed and unlensed events.</description>

      <title>Optimized Search for a Binary Black Hole Merger Population in LIGO-Virgo O3 Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10439v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Maximizing the number of detections in matched filter searches for compact binary coalescence (CBC) gravitational wave (GW) signals requires a model of the source population distribution. In previous searches using the PyCBC framework, sensitivity to the population of binary black hole (BBH) mergers was improved by restricting the range of filter template mass ratios and use of a simple one-dimensional population model. However, this approach does not make use of our full knowledge of the population and cannot be extended to a full parameter space search. Here, we introduce a new ranking method, based on kernel density estimation (KDE) with adaptive bandwidth, to accurately model the probability distributions of binary source parameters over a template bank, both for signals and for noise events. We demonstrate this ranking method by conducting a search over LIGO-Virgo O3 data for BBH with unrestricted mass ratio, using a signal model derived from previous significant detected events. We achieve over 10% increase in sensitive volume for a simple power-law simulated signal population, compared to the previous BBH search. Correspondingly, with the new ranking, 8 additional candidate events above an inverse false alarm rate (IFAR) threshold 0.5 yr are identified.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the inconsistency of the Proca theory with non-minimal coupling to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the degrees of freedom of the Proca theory, non-minimally coupled to gravity. In the Minkowski background, this theory propagates five degrees of freedom - a massive longitudinal mode, two massive vector ones, and two massless tensor modes. At first sight, the non-linear coupling between the metric perturbations and the vector field indicates that both longitudinal and tensor modes become strongly coupled, at the same scale. This would imply that no matter how small the photon mass is if non-minimal coupling is taken into account, gravitational waves would necessarily be strongly coupled. We show that the way out of this inconsistency is through the introduction of the disformal coupling to the metric perturbations that resemble the vector-type disformal transformations. This way, the unphysical coupling between the two types of modes can be avoided, rendering the model consistent. As a result, we show that only the longitudinal modes enter a strong coupling regime, while both tensor and transverse modes remain weakly coupled at all scales up to the Planck length. Finally, we show how this cures recently reported runaway modes in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Early dark energy and scalarization in a scalar-tensor model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model in which the Gauss-Bonnet invariant holds the quintessence at a fixed point, respecting an initial $Z_2$ symmetry in the radiation-dominated era. This results in an early dark energy that becomes significant around the matter-radiation equality era. However, due to $Z_2$ symmetry breaking, scalarization occurs, leading to a rapid reduction in the early dark energy density. The model then quickly behaves like the $\Lambda$CDM model. This scenario may also explain the reduction of sound horizon and aligns with the assumption that the gravitational wave speed is infinitesimally close to the speed of light.</description>

      <title>Revisiting quantum field theory in Rindler spacetime with superselection rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum field theory (QFT) in Rindler spacetime is a gateway to understanding unitarity and information loss paradoxes in curved spacetime. Rindler coordinates map Minkowski spacetime onto regions with horizons, effectively dividing accelerated observers into causally disconnected sectors. Employing standard quantum field theory techniques and Bogoliubov transformations between Minkowski and Rindler coordinates yields entanglement between states across these causally separated regions of spacetime. This results in a breakdown of unitarity, implying that information regarding the entangled partner may be irretrievably lost beyond the Rindler horizon. As a consequence, one has a situation of pure states evolving into mixed states. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for comprehending this phenomenon using a recently proposed formulation of direct-sum quantum field theory (DQFT), which is grounded in superselection rules formulated by the parity and time reversal ($\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$) symmetry of Minkowski spacetime. In the context of DQFT applied to Rindler spacetime, we demonstrate that each Rindler observer can, in principle, access pure states within the horizon, thereby restoring unitarity. However, our analysis also reveals the emergence of a thermal spectrum of Unruh radiation. This prompts a reevaluation of entanglement in Rindler spacetime, where we propose a novel perspective on how Rindler observers may reconstruct complementary information beyond the horizon. Furthermore, we revisit the implications of the Reeh-Schlieder theorem within the framework of DQFT. Lastly, we underscore how our findings contribute to ongoing efforts aimed at elucidating the role of unitarity in quantum field theory within the context of de Sitter and black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>The Hadamard condition on a Cauchy surface and the renormalized stress-energy tensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a Cauchy surface in a curved spacetime and a suitably defined quantum state on the CCR algebra of the Klein Gordon quantum field on that surface, we show, by expanding the squared spacetime geodesic distance and the '$U$' and '$V$' Hadamard coefficients (and suitable derivatives thereof) in sufficiently accurate covariant Taylor expansions on the surface that the renormalized expectation value of the quantum stress-energy tensor on the surface is determined by the geometry of the surface and the first 4 time derivatives of the metric off the surface, in addition to the Cauchy data for the field's two-point function. This result has been anticipated in and is motivated by a previous investigation by the authors on the initial value problem in semiclassical gravity, for which the geometric initial data corresponds {\it a priori} to the metric on the surface and up to 3 time derivatives off the surface, but where it was argued that the fourth derivative can be obtained with aid of the field equations on the initial surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum electrodynamics, Schwinger showed in 1951 that in a uniform electric field the vacuum may spontaneously produce electron-positron pairs. For this to occur, the required electric field is exceptionally large, $\sim 10^{18}$ N/C. In the Electromagnetically Accelerating Universe (EAU) model, such an electric field would be undesirable because it discharges the Primoridal Extemely Massive Naked Singularities (PEMNSs) whose mutual repulsion causes the acceleration. This leads to a constraints on the charges and masses of the PEMNSs which must be satisfied in an EAU model.</description>

      <title>Clarifying Kasner dynamics inside anisotropic black hole with vector hair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the internal dynamics of hairy black holes in the Einstein-Maxwell-vector theory. The development of the charged vector hair necessarily removes the inner Cauchy horizon and results in an anisotropic black hole ending at a spacelike singularity. The far interior evolution is characterized by the chaotic alternations among different Kasner epochs. We show that those late interior time dynamics of bounces and epochs can be captured analytically. In particular, we obtain three distinct types of transformation laws for the alternation of Kasner epochs analytically, including the Kasner inversion, Kasner transition, and Kasner reflection. Our analytical approach is corroborated by numerical solutions to the full equations of motion. Moreover, we provide a clear explanation of the alternation of Kasner epochs found numerically in the literature.</description>

      <title>On the KG-constrained general disformal transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although with great successes in explaining phenomena and natural behaviour involving the Universe or a part thereof, the General Theory of Relativity is far from a complete theory. There are plenty of avenues to investigate its extensions or generalisations that, in the future, could pave the way for a much deeper understanding and possibly solutions of current problems involving the Universe; e.g., dark matter, dark energy, fine-tuning, etc. Focusing on its extension within the framework of scalar tensor theory, we investigate the transformation of the Einstein-Hilbert action under the general disformal transformation coupled with set of triple KG constraints. The idea is that the general disformal transformation leads to an extremely complicated action necessitating a set of constraints to tame the resulting form. Motivated by previous studies on the invertibility and invariance of the massless Klein-Gordon equation under the general disformal transformation, we identify three constraints that significantly simplifies the transformed Einstein-Hilbert action. In four spacetime dimensions, we find that the transformed action is a sum of the original action and a disformal contribution involving a six-term Lagrangian that includes the Ricci tensor coupled to a sum of derivatives of scalar fields and kinetic terms. In three spacetime dimensions, the disformal contribution becomes a five-term Lagrangian. Lastly, in two spacetime dimensions, the Einstein-Hilbert action is invariant under the constrained disformal transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we advance the understanding of thermodynamic properties and phase transitions in rotating anti-de Sitter (AdS) black holes by applying the Kaniadakis(KD) entropy framework. This framework represents a non-extensive generalization of classical statistical mechanics, inspired by the symmetries of relativity and offering a novel perspective on black hole thermodynamics. Our focus is on investigating how Kaniadakis entropy modifies the thermodynamic phase space of rotating AdS black holes. To achieve this, we analyze three prominent rotating AdS black hole systems: the Kerr AdS black hole, the Kerr-Sen AdS black hole, and the Kerr-Newman AdS black hole. We assess their thermodynamic quantities, phase transitions, thermodynamic topology and thermodynamic geometry within the Kaniadakis statistical framework. Our analysis reveals notable deviations from the behaviour predicted by traditional Gibbs-Boltzmann(GB) statistics.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations have just started probing the properties of black hole binary merger populations. The observation of binaries with very massive black holes and significantly asymmetric masses motivates the study of dense star clusters as astrophysical environments which can produce such events dynamically. In this paper we present Rapster (for "Rapid cluster evolution"), a new code designed to rapidly model binary black hole population synthesis and the evolution of massive star clusters based on simple, yet realistic prescriptions. We also perform a thorough comparison with the Cluster Monte Carlo code and find generally good agreement. The code can be used to generate large populations of dynamically formed binary black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06534v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the decoherence induced by the primordial graviton, using the influence functional method, to show whether this method is still effective in detecting graviton if the initial state is not a Bunch-Davies vacuum but rather a minimum uncertainty state. This minimum uncertainty condition allows the initial state of the primordial graviton to be an entanglement state between the polarization or, more generally, a superposition state between a vacuum and that entanglement. Both of those states have a non-classical correlation between the two polarization modes. We found that this method is still effective for detecting gravitons if the density matrix of the initial state does not have non-diagonal elements, where the maximum decoherence time is about 20 seconds, and the dimensions of the interferometer could be reduced if the total graviton increases.</description>

Abstract: We study the classical dynamics of spinning particles using scattering amplitudes and eikonal exponentiation. We show that observables are determined by a simple algorithm. A wealth of complexity arises in perturbation theory as positions, momenta and spins must be iteratively corrected at each order. Even though we restrict ourselves to one-loop computations at quadratic order in spin, nevertheless we encounter and resolve a number of subtle effects. Finally, we clarify the links between our work and various other eikonal approaches to spinning observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the phenomenon of quantum superposition of gravitational fields induced by massive quantum particles is an important starting point for quantum gravity. The purpose of this study is to deepen our understanding of the phenomenon of quantum superposition of gravitational fields. To this end, we consider a trade-off relation of entanglement (monogamy relation) in a tripartite system consisting of two massive particles and a gravitational field that may be entangled with each other. Consequently, if two particles cannot exchange information mutually, they are in a separable state, and the particle and gravitational field are always entangled. Furthermore, even when two particles can send information to each other, there is a trade-off between the two particles and the gravitational field. We also investigate the behavior of the quantum superposition of the gravitational field using quantum discord. We find that quantum discord increases depending on the length scale of the particle superposition. Our results may help understand the relationship between the quantization of the gravitational field and the meaning of the quantum superposition of the gravitational field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators hold the key to high-energy physics as they probe the earliest moments of our Universe, and conceal hidden mathematical structures. However, even at tree-level, perturbative calculations are limited by technical difficulties absent in flatspace Feynman diagrammatics. In this paper, we introduce CosmoFlow: a new accurate open source Python code that computes tree-level cosmological correlators by tracing their time flow. This code is specifically designed to offer a simple, intuitive and flexible coding environment to theorists, primordial and late-time cosmologists. It can typically serve to complement analytical computations, to provide physical intuition when studying various inflationary theories, and to obtain exact results in regimes that are analytically out of reach. This paper presents the basic structure of CosmoFlow, leads the reader through an in-depth user-guide, and illustrates how it can be used with a series of worked examples. Our hope is that this first building block sets the stage for a bank of theoretical data, which can be nurtured and enhanced collaboratively by the community. CosmoFlow is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since galaxy distribution reconstruction effectively reduces non-Gaussian terms in the power spectrum covariance matrix, it has attracted interest not only for Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) signals but also for various cosmological signal analyses. To this end, this paper presents a novel theoretical model that addresses infrared (IR) effects in the post-reconstruction galaxy power spectrum, including 1-loop corrections. In particular, we discuss the importance of incorporating non-perturbative effects arising from IR contributions into the displacement vector $\vec{s}$ used for reconstruction. Consequently, post-reconstruction nonlinear damping of BAO can be described by a single two-dimensional Gaussian function. This is a phenomenon not observed when $\vec{s}$ is considered to at a linear order in the Zel'dovich approximation. Furthermore, we confirm that the cross-power spectrum of the pre- and post-reconstruction density fluctuations lacks IR effect cancellations, and shows an exponential decay in both the cross-power spectrum and the associated shot-noise term.

      <title>Dark Branes for Dark Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06276v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a setup for the origin of dark matter based on spacetime with a warped extra dimension and three branes: the Planck brane, the TeV brane, at a (few) TeV scale $\rho_T$, and a dark brane, at a (sub)-GeV scale $\rho_1\lesssim 100$ GeV $\ll\rho_T$. The Standard Model is localized in the TeV brane, thus solving the Higgs hierarchy problem, while the dark matter $\chi$, a Dirac fermion with mass $m_\chi&lt;\rho_1$, is localized in the dark brane. The radion, with mass $m_r&lt;m_\chi$, interacts strongly ($\sim m_\chi/\rho_1\sim\mathcal O(1)$) with dark matter and very weakly ($\sim m_{f}\rho_1/\rho_T^2\ll 1$) with the Standard Model matter $f$. The generic conflict between the bounds on its detection signatures and its proper relic abundance is avoided as dark matter annihilation is $p$-wave suppressed. The former is determined by its very weak interactions with the SM and the latter by its much stronger annihilation into radions. Therefore, there is a vast range in the Dark Matter's parameter space where the correct relic abundance is achieved consistently with the existing bounds. Moreover, for the dark brane with $\rho_1\lesssim 3$ GeV, a confinement/deconfinement first order phase transition, where the radion condensates, produces a stochastic gravitational waves background at the nanoHz frequencies, which can be identified with the signal detected by the Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) experiments. In the PTA window, for $0.15 \textrm{ GeV}\lesssim m_\chi\lesssim 2$ GeV the relic abundance is reproduced and all constraints are satisfied.</description>

      <title>No time to derive: unraveling total time derivatives in in-in perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The in-in formalism provides a way to systematically organize the calculation of primordial correlation functions. Although its theoretical foundations are now firmly settled, the treatment of total time derivative interactions, incorrectly trivialized as ``boundary terms'', has been the subject of intense discussions and conceptual mistakes. In this work, we demystify the use of total time derivatives -- as well as terms proportional to the linear equations of motion -- and show that they can lead to artificially large contributions cancelling at different orders of the in-in operator formalism. We discuss the treatment of total time derivative interactions in the Lagrangian path integral formulation of the in-in perturbation theory, and we showcase the importance of interaction terms proportional to linear equations of motion. We then provide a new route to the calculation of primordial correlation functions, which avoids the generation of total time derivatives, by working directly at the level of the full Hamiltonian in terms of phase-space variables. Instead of integrating by parts, we perform canonical transformations to simplify interactions. We explain how to retrieve correlation functions of the initial phase-space variables from the knowledge of the ones after canonical transformations. As an important first application, we find the explicit sizes of Hamiltonian cubic interactions in single-field inflation with canonical kinetic terms and for any background evolution [...]. Our results are important for performing complete calculations of exchange diagrams in inflation, such as the (scalar and tensor) exchange trispectrum and the one-loop power spectrum. Being already written in a form amenable to characterize quantum properties of primordial fluctuations, they also promise to shed light on the non-linear dynamics of quantum states during inflation.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the solutions of three-dimensional gravity obtained by gluing two copies of a spacetime across a junction constituted of a tensile string are in one-to-one correspondence with the solutions of the Nambu-Goto equation in the same spacetime up to a finite number of rigid deformations related to worldsheet and spacetime isometries. The non-linear Nambu-Goto equation satisfied by the average of the embedding coordinates of the junction emerges directly from the junction conditions along with the rigid deformations and corrections due to the tension. Therefore, the equivalence principle generalizes non-trivially to the string. Our results are valid both in three-dimensional flat and AdS spacetimes. In the context of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, our setup could be used to describe a class of interfaces in the conformal field theory featuring relative time reparametrization at the interface which encodes the solution of the Nambu-Goto equation corresponding to the bulk junction.</description>

      <title>From area metric backgrounds to the cosmological constant and corrections to the Polyakov action</title>

Abstract: Area metrics and area metric backgrounds provide a unified framework for quantum gravity. They encode physical degrees of freedom beyond those of a metric. These non-metric degrees of freedom must be suppressed by a potential at sufficiently high energy scales to ensure that in the infrared regime classical gravity is recovered. On this basis, we first study necessary and sufficient algebraic conditions for an area metric to be induced by a metric. Second, we consider candidate potentials for the area metric and point out a possible connection between the reduction of area metric geometry to metric geometry on the one hand, and the smallness of the cosmological constant on the other. Finally, we consider modifications of the Nambu-Goto action for a string, from a metric background to an area metric background. We demonstrate that area metric perturbations introduce an interaction corresponding to a singular vertex operator in the classically equivalent Polyakov action. The implications of these types of vertex operators for the quantum theory remain to be understood.</description>

      <title>Do high redshift QSOs and GRBs corroborate JWST?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is reporting unexpectedly massive high redshift galaxies that appear challenging from the $\Lambda$CDM perspective. Interpreted as a problem of cosmological origin, this necessitates Planck underestimating either matter density $\Omega_m$ or physical matter density $\Omega_m h^2$ at higher redshifts. Through standard frequentist profile likelihoods, we identify corroborating quasar (QSO) and gamma-ray burst (GRB) data sets where $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift $z_{\textrm{eff}}$, with $\Omega_m$ remaining anomalously large at higher redshifts. While the variation of $\Omega_m$ with $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ is at odds with the $\Lambda$CDM model, demarcating frequentist confidence intervals through differences in $\chi^2$ in profile likelihoods, the prevailing technique in the literature, points to $3.9 \sigma$ and $7.9 \sigma$ tensions between GRBs and QSOs, respectively, and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. We explain the approximations inherent in the existing profile likelihood literature, and highlight fresh methodology that generalises the prescription. We show that alternative methods, including Bayesian approaches, lead to similar tensions. Finally, in the large sample limit, we show that Feldman-Cousins prescription for frequentist confidence intervals in the presence of a boundary (prior) leads to confidence intervals that are bounded above by Wilks' theorem.</description>

      <title>Polarization Patterns of Non-Circular Hotspots around Kerr Black Holes: A Preliminary Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multi-wavelength polarized light signals from supermassive black holes have sparked many studies on polarized images of accretion disks and hotspots. However, the polarization patterns within the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) region remain to be explored. In this study, we focus on two specific types of orbits, namely the plunging geodesics inward from the ISCO and homoclinic geodesics, to uncover the polarization features associated with non-circular motion in a Kerr spacetime. For an on-axis observer, we specifically develop an approximate function to describe gravitational lensing along the azimuthal direction and establish a simplified synchrotron emission model. Based on these, we analyze the polarized patterns of hotspots accumulated over time and their Stokes parameters. Moreover, we explore the polarized image of the plunging region within a thin accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Obviating PBH overproduction for SIGWs generated by Pulsar Timing Arrays in loop corrected EFT of bounce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18976v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to unravel the present situation of the PBH overproduction problem, our study emphasizes the critical role played by the equation of state (EoS) parameter $w$ within the framework of effective field theory (EFT) of non-singular bounce. Our analysis focuses on a wide range of EoS parameter values that are still optimal for explaining the latest data from the pulsar timing array (PTA). As a result of our study, the most advantageous window, $0.31 \leq w \leq 1/3$, is identified as the location of a substantial PBH abundance, $f_{\rm PBH} \in (10^{-3},1)$ with large mass PBHs, $M_{\rm PBH}\sim {\cal O}(10^{-7}-10^{-3})M_{\odot}$, in the SIGW interpretation of the PTA signal. When confronted with PTA, we find that the overproduction avoiding circumstances are between $1\sigma-2\sigma$, while the EoS parameter lies inside the narrow window, $0.31&lt;w\leq 1/3$. We propose a regularized-renormalized-resummed (RRR) scalar power spectrum that is large enough to produce EoS dependent scalar generated gravitational waves compatible with PTA evidence, while satisfying the perturbativity, causality, and unitarity criteria, within the range of $0.88 \leq c_{s} \leq 1$.</description>

      <title>Single-photon interference over 8.4 km urban atmosphere: towards testing quantum effects in curved spacetime with photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of quantum mechanics and general relativity has transformed our understanding of the natural world significantly. However, integrating these two theories presents immense challenges, and their interplay remains untested. Recent theoretical studies suggest that the single-photon interference covering huge space can effectively probe the interface between quantum mechanics and general relativity. We developed an alternative design using unbalanced Michelson interferometers to address this and validated its feasibility over an 8.4 km free-space channel. Using a high-brightness single-photon source based on quantum dots, we demonstrated single-photon interference along this long-distance baseline. We achieved a phase measurement precision of 16.2 mrad, which satisfied the measurement requirements for a gravitational redshift at the geosynchronous orbit by five times the standard deviation. Our results confirm the feasibility of the single-photon version of the Colella-Overhauser-Werner experiment for testing the quantum effects in curved spacetime.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity of thermal state in early universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our work, we perform a detailed study of the Krylov complexity of the thermal state across the entire early universe, encompassing the inflation, radiation-dominated period, and matter-dominated period, which is for the single field inflation. We utilize both the closed system's method and open system's method to achieve this goal. To accurately calculate the Krylov complexity, we purified the thermal state, resulting in a pure state with two modes. Our analysis with both methods indicates that the Krylov complexity will increase during inflation, but will saturate at constant values during the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods, where the generation of particles via preheating leads to this evolution. Furthermore, our findings reveal that inflation behaves as a strong dissipative system, while the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods act as weak dissipative systems. The chaotic feature during these periods follows a similar trend to the Krylov complexity. This research has the potential to provide new insights into the exploration of Krylov complexity in cosmology.</description>

      <title>A holographic model of magnetohydrodynamics with fortuitous SO(3) symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study magnetohydrodynamics using holography. The gravity model is closely related to the STU supergravity in five dimensions and admits an analytical black brane solution carrying the conserved charge dual to the magnetic 1-form symmetry of the magnetohydrodynamic system. The black brane solution features a fortuitous SO(3) symmetry, providing a new symmetry principle for describing the magnetohydrodynamics. Since the bulk theory contains multiple 2-form gauge fields, the resistivity becomes matrix-valued. We find that the antisymmetric part of the resistivity matrix exhibits novel features depending on the UV cut-off of the theory. We also compute the shear and bulk viscosities and find that the bulk viscosity is proportional to the shear viscosity. Remarkably, the proportionality constant is exactly what is required for conformality, despite the zeroth-order energy-momentum tensor not being trace-free.</description>
