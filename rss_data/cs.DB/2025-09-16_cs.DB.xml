      <title>ScaleDoc: Scaling LLM-based Predicates over Large Document Collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicates are foundational components in data analysis systems. However, modern workloads increasingly involve unstructured documents, which demands semantic understanding, beyond traditional value-based predicates. Given enormous documents and ad-hoc queries, while Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate powerful zero-shot capabilities, their high inference cost leads to unacceptable overhead. Therefore, we introduce \textsc{ScaleDoc}, a novel system that addresses this by decoupling predicate execution into an offline representation phase and an optimized online filtering phase. In the offline phase, \textsc{ScaleDoc} leverages a LLM to generate semantic representations for each document. Online, for each query, it trains a lightweight proxy model on these representations to filter the majority of documents, forwarding only the ambiguous cases to the LLM for final decision. Furthermore, \textsc{ScaleDoc} proposes two core innovations to achieve significant efficiency: (1) a contrastive-learning-based framework that trains the proxy model to generate reliable predicating decision scores; (2) an adaptive cascade mechanism that determines the effective filtering policy while meeting specific accuracy targets. Our evaluations across three datasets demonstrate that \textsc{ScaleDoc} achieves over a 2$\times$ end-to-end speedup and reduces expensive LLM invocations by up to 85\%, making large-scale semantic analysis practical and efficient.</description>

      <title>Exploring Distributed Vector Databases Performance on HPC Platforms: A Study with Qdrant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector databases have rapidly grown in popularity, enabling efficient similarity search over data such as text, images, and video. They now play a central role in modern AI workflows, aiding large language models by grounding model outputs in external literature through retrieval-augmented generation. Despite their importance, little is known about the performance characteristics of vector databases in high-performance computing (HPC) systems that drive large-scale science. This work presents an empirical study of distributed vector database performance on the Polaris supercomputer in the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. We construct a realistic biological-text workload from BV-BRC and generate embeddings from the peS2o corpus using Qwen3-Embedding-4B. We select Qdrant to evaluate insertion, index construction, and query latency with up to 32 workers. Informed by practical lessons from our experience, this work takes a first step toward characterizing vector database performance on HPC platforms to guide future research and optimization.</description>

      <title>AMAZe: A Multi-Agent Zero-shot Index Advisor for Relational Databases</title>

Abstract: Index recommendation is one of the most important problems in database management system (DBMS) optimization. Given queries and certain index-related constraints, traditional methods rely on heuristic optimization or learning-based models to select effective indexes and improve query performance. However, heuristic optimization suffers from high computation time, and learning-based models lose generalisability due to training for different workloads and database schemas. With the recent rapid development of large language models (LLMs), methods using prompt tuning have been proposed to enhance the efficiency of index selection. However, such methods still can not achieve the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, and preparing the index selection demonstrations is also resource-intensive. To address these issues, we propose AMAZe, a zero-shot LLM-based index advisor with a multi-agent framework. We decompose the index recommendation problem into sub-steps, including planning, selection, combination, revision, and reflection. A set of LLM-embedded agents is designed to handle each one of the different sub-steps. Our method utilizes high-level agents to control the index selection process and low-level agents to select and revise indexes. Through extensive experiments, we show that our proposed AMAZe not only achieves the SOTA performance compared to the heuristic methods, but also outperforms learning-based and prompt-based methods with higher efficiency and better zero-shot inference ability.</description>

      <title>Reviewing Uses of Regulatory Compliance Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10362v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organizations need to manage numerous business processes for delivering their services and products to customers. One important consideration thereby lies in the adherence to regulations such as laws, guidelines, or industry standards. In order to monitor adherence of their business processes to regulations -- in other words, their regulatory compliance -- organizations make use of various techniques that draw on process execution data of IT systems that support these processes. Previous research has investigated conformance checking, an operation of process mining, for the domains in which it is applied, its operationalization of regulations, the techniques being used, and the presentation of results produced. However, other techniques for regulatory compliance monitoring, which we summarize as compliance checking techniques, have not yet been investigated regarding these aspects in a structural manner. To this end, this work presents a systematic literature review on uses of regulatory compliance monitoring of business processes, thereby offering insights into the various techniques being used, their application and the results they generate. We highlight commonalities and differences between the approaches and find that various steps are performed manually; we also provide further impulses for research on compliance monitoring and its use in practice.</description>
