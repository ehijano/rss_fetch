      <title>WavePulse: Real-time Content Analytics of Radio Livestreams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio remains a pervasive medium for mass information dissemination, with AM/FM stations reaching more Americans than either smartphone-based social networking or live television. Increasingly, radio broadcasts are also streamed online and accessed over the Internet. We present WavePulse, a framework that records, documents, and analyzes radio content in real-time. While our framework is generally applicable, we showcase the efficacy of WavePulse in a collaborative project with a team of political scientists focusing on the 2024 Presidential Elections. We use WavePulse to monitor livestreams of 396 news radio stations over a period of three months, processing close to 500,000 hours of audio streams. These streams were converted into time-stamped, diarized transcripts and analyzed to track answer key political science questions at both the national and state levels. Our analysis revealed how local issues interacted with national trends, providing insights into information flow. Our results demonstrate WavePulse's efficacy in capturing and analyzing content from radio livestreams sourced from the Web.

      <title>Time-Probability Dependent Knowledge Extraction in IoT-enabled Smart Building</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart buildings incorporate various emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications for comprehensive management of energy efficiency, human comfort, automation, and security. However, the development of a knowledge extraction framework is fundamental. Currently, there is a lack of a unified and practical framework for modeling heterogeneous sensor data within buildings. In this paper, we propose a practical inference framework for extracting status-to-event knowledge within smart building. Our proposal includes IoT-based API integration, ontology model design, and time probability dependent knowledge extraction methods. The Building Topology Ontology (BOT) was leveraged to construct spatial relations among sensors and spaces within the building. We utilized Apache Jena Fuseki's SPARQL server for storing and querying the RDF triple data. Two types of knowledge could be extracted: timestamp-based probability for abnormal event detection and time interval-based probability for conjunction of multiple events. We conducted experiments (over a 78-day period) in a real smart building environment. The data of light and elevator states has been collected for evaluation. The evaluation revealed several inferred events, such as room occupancy, elevator trajectory tracking, and the conjunction of both events. The numerical values of detected event counts and probability demonstrate the potential for automatic control in the smart building.</description>

      <title>Prompt Tuning for Item Cold-start Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The item cold-start problem is crucial for online recommender systems, as the success of the cold-start phase determines whether items can transition into popular ones. Prompt learning, a powerful technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to address zero- or few-shot problems, has been adapted for recommender systems to tackle similar challenges. However, existing methods typically rely on content-based properties or text descriptions for prompting, which we argue may be suboptimal for cold-start recommendations due to 1) semantic gaps with recommender tasks, 2) model bias caused by warm-up items contribute most of the positive feedback to the model, which is the core of the cold-start problem that hinders the recommender quality on cold-start items. We propose to leverage high-value positive feedback, termed pinnacle feedback as prompt information, to simultaneously resolve the above two problems. We experimentally prove that compared to the content description proposed in existing works, the positive feedback is more suitable to serve as prompt information by bridging the semantic gaps. Besides, we propose item-wise personalized prompt networks to encode pinnaclce feedback to relieve the model bias by the positive feedback dominance problem. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, PROMO has been successfully deployed on a popular short-video sharing platform, a billion-user scale commercial short-video application, achieving remarkable performance gains across various commercial metrics within cold-start scenarios</description>

      <title>BRIDGE: Bundle Recommendation via Instruction-Driven Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bundle recommendation aims to suggest a set of interconnected items to users. However, diverse interaction types and sparse interaction matrices often pose challenges for previous approaches in accurately predicting user-bundle adoptions. Inspired by the distant supervision strategy and generative paradigm, we propose BRIDGE, a novel framework for bundle recommendation. It consists of two main components namely the correlation-based item clustering and the pseudo bundle generation modules. Inspired by the distant supervision approach, the former is to generate more auxiliary information, e.g., instructive item clusters, for training without using external data. This information is subsequently aggregated with collaborative signals from user historical interactions to create pseudo `ideal' bundles. This capability allows BRIDGE to explore all aspects of bundles, rather than being limited to existing real-world bundles. It effectively bridging the gap between user imagination and predefined bundles, hence improving the bundle recommendation performance. Experimental results validate the superiority of our models over state-of-the-art ranking-based methods across five benchmark datasets.</description>

      <title>From Pairwise to Ranking: Climbing the Ladder to Ideal Collaborative Filtering with Pseudo-Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intuitively, an ideal collaborative filtering (CF) model should learn from users' full rankings over all items to make optimal top-K recommendations. Due to the absence of such full rankings in practice, most CF models rely on pairwise loss functions to approximate full rankings, resulting in an immense performance gap. In this paper, we provide a novel analysis using the multiple ordinal classification concept to reveal the inevitable gap between a pairwise approximation and the ideal case. However, bridging the gap in practice encounters two formidable challenges: (1) none of the real-world datasets contains full ranking information; (2) there does not exist a loss function that is capable of consuming ranking information. To overcome these challenges, we propose a pseudo-ranking paradigm (PRP) that addresses the lack of ranking information by introducing pseudo-rankings supervised by an original noise injection mechanism. Additionally, we put forward a new ranking loss function designed to handle ranking information effectively. To ensure our method's robustness against potential inaccuracies in pseudo-rankings, we equip the ranking loss function with a gradient-based confidence mechanism to detect and mitigate abnormal gradients. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that PRP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Hidden Treasures: Enhancing Recommendations with Unlabeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative filtering (CF) stands as a cornerstone in recommender systems, yet effectively leveraging the massive unlabeled data presents a significant challenge. Current research focuses on addressing the challenge of unlabeled data by extracting a subset that closely approximates negative samples. Regrettably, the remaining data are overlooked, failing to fully integrate this valuable information into the construction of user preferences. To address this gap, we introduce a novel positive-neutral-negative (PNN) learning paradigm. PNN introduces a neutral class, encompassing intricate items that are challenging to categorize directly as positive or negative samples. By training a model based on this triple-wise partial ranking, PNN offers a promising solution to learning complex user preferences. Through theoretical analysis, we connect PNN to one-way partial AUC (OPAUC) to validate its efficacy. Implementing the PNN paradigm is, however, technically challenging because: (1) it is difficult to classify unlabeled data into neutral or negative in the absence of supervised signals; (2) there does not exist any loss function that can handle set-level triple-wise ranking relationships. To address these challenges, we propose a semi-supervised learning method coupled with a user-aware attention model for knowledge acquisition and classification refinement. Additionally, a novel loss function with a two-step centroid ranking approach enables handling set-level rankings. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that, when combined with PNN, a wide range of representative CF models can consistently and significantly boost their performance. Even with a simple matrix factorization, PNN can achieve comparable performance to sophisticated graph neutral networks.</description>

      <title>Molar: Multimodal LLMs with Collaborative Filtering Alignment for Enhanced Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) systems have evolved significantly over the past decade, transitioning from traditional collaborative filtering to deep learning approaches and, more recently, to large language models (LLMs). While the adoption of LLMs has driven substantial advancements, these models inherently lack collaborative filtering information, relying primarily on textual content data neglecting other modalities and thus failing to achieve optimal recommendation performance. To address this limitation, we propose Molar, a Multimodal large language sequential recommendation framework that integrates multiple content modalities with ID information to capture collaborative signals effectively. Molar employs an MLLM to generate unified item representations from both textual and non-textual data, facilitating comprehensive multimodal modeling and enriching item embeddings. Additionally, it incorporates collaborative filtering signals through a post-alignment mechanism, which aligns user representations from content-based and ID-based models, ensuring precise personalization and robust performance. By seamlessly combining multimodal content with collaborative filtering insights, Molar captures both user interests and contextual semantics, leading to superior recommendation accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that Molar significantly outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines, highlighting its strength in utilizing multimodal data and collaborative signals for sequential recommendation tasks.

      <title>Efficient Long Context Language Model Retrieval with Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long Context Language Models (LCLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm to perform Information Retrieval (IR), which enables the direct ingestion and retrieval of information by processing an entire corpus in their single context, showcasing the potential to surpass traditional sparse and dense retrieval methods. However, processing a large number of passages within in-context for retrieval is computationally expensive, and handling their representations during inference further exacerbates the processing time; thus, we aim to make LCLM retrieval more efficient and potentially more effective with passage compression. Specifically, we propose a new compression approach tailored for LCLM retrieval, which is trained to maximize the retrieval performance while minimizing the length of the compressed passages. To accomplish this, we generate the synthetic data, where compressed passages are automatically created and labeled as chosen or rejected according to their retrieval success for a given query, and we train the proposed Compression model for Long context Retrieval (CoLoR) with this data via preference optimization while adding the length regularization loss on top of it to enforce brevity. Through extensive experiments on 9 datasets, we show that CoLoR improves the retrieval performance by 6% while compressing the in-context size by a factor of 1.91.</description>

      <title>An Automatic Graph Construction Framework based on Large Language Models for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as state-of-the-art methods to learn from graph-structured data for recommendation. However, most existing GNN-based recommendation methods focus on the optimization of model structures and learning strategies based on pre-defined graphs, neglecting the importance of the graph construction stage. Earlier works for graph construction usually rely on speciffic rules or crowdsourcing, which are either too simplistic or too labor-intensive. Recent works start to utilize large language models (LLMs) to automate the graph construction, in view of their abundant open-world knowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, they generally suffer from two limitations: (1) invisibility of global view (e.g., overlooking contextual information) and (2) construction inefficiency. To this end, we introduce AutoGraph, an automatic graph construction framework based on LLMs for recommendation. Specifically, we first use LLMs to infer the user preference and item knowledge, which is encoded as semantic vectors. Next, we employ vector quantization to extract the latent factors from the semantic vectors. The latent factors are then incorporated as extra nodes to link the user/item nodes, resulting in a graph with in-depth global-view semantics. We further design metapath-based message aggregation to effectively aggregate the semantic and collaborative information. The framework is model-agnostic and compatible with different backbone models. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy and efffciency of AutoGraph compared to existing baseline methods. We have deployed AutoGraph in Huawei advertising platform, and gain a 2.69% improvement on RPM and a 7.31% improvement on eCPM in the online A/B test. Currently AutoGraph has been used as the main trafffc model, serving hundreds of millions of people.</description>

      <title>RaSeRec: Retrieval-Augmented Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although prevailing supervised and self-supervised learning (SSL)-augmented sequential recommendation (SeRec) models have achieved improved performance with powerful neural network architectures, we argue that they still suffer from two limitations: (1) Preference Drift, where models trained on past data can hardly accommodate evolving user preference; and (2) Implicit Memory, where head patterns dominate parametric learning, making it harder to recall long tails. In this work, we explore retrieval augmentation in SeRec, to address these limitations. To this end, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Sequential Recommendation framework, named RaSeRec, the main idea of which is to maintain a dynamic memory bank to accommodate preference drifts and retrieve relevant memories to augment user modeling explicitly. It consists of two stages: (i) collaborative-based pre-training, which learns to recommend and retrieve; (ii) retrieval-augmented fine-tuning, which learns to leverage retrieved memories. Extensive experiments on three datasets fully demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of RaSeRec.</description>

      <title>Contrastive Representation for Interactive Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive Recommendation (IR) has gained significant attention recently for its capability to quickly capture dynamic interest and optimize both short and long term objectives. IR agents are typically implemented through Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), because DRL is inherently compatible with the dynamic nature of IR. However, DRL is currently not perfect for IR. Due to the large action space and sample inefficiency problem, training DRL recommender agents is challenging. The key point is that useful features cannot be extracted as high-quality representations for the recommender agent to optimize its policy. To tackle this problem, we propose Contrastive Representation for Interactive Recommendation (CRIR). CRIR efficiently extracts latent, high-level preference ranking features from explicit interaction, and leverages the features to enhance users' representation. Specifically, the CRIR provides representation through one representation network, and refines it through our proposed Preference Ranking Contrastive Learning (PRCL). The key insight of PRCL is that it can perform contrastive learning without relying on computations involving high-level representations or large potential action sets. Furthermore, we also propose a data exploiting mechanism and an agent training mechanism to better adapt CRIR to the DRL backbone. Extensive experiments have been carried out to show our method's superior improvement on the sample efficiency while training an DRL-based IR agent.</description>

      <title>Joint Knowledge Editing for Information Enrichment and Probability Promotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge stored in large language models requires timely updates to reflect the dynamic nature of real-world information. To update the knowledge, most knowledge editing methods focus on the low layers, since recent probes into the knowledge recall process reveal that the answer information is enriched in low layers. However, these probes only and could only reveal critical recall stages for the original answers, while the goal of editing is to rectify model's prediction for the target answers. This inconsistency indicates that both the probe approaches and the associated editing methods are deficient. To mitigate the inconsistency and identify critical editing regions, we propose a contrast-based probe approach, and locate two crucial stages where the model behavior diverges between the original and target answers: Information Enrichment in low layers and Probability Promotion in high layers. Building upon the insights, we develop the Joint knowledge Editing for information Enrichment and probability Promotion (JEEP) method, which jointly edits both the low and high layers to modify the two critical recall stages. Considering the mutual interference and growing forgetting due to dual modifications, JEEP is designed to ensure that updates to distinct regions share the same objectives and are complementary. We rigorously evaluate JEEP by editing up to thousands of facts on various models, i.e., GPT-J (6B) and LLaMA (7B), and addressing diverse editing objectives, i.e., adding factual and counterfactual knowledge. In all tested scenarios, JEEP achieves best performances, validating the effectiveness of the revealings of our probe approach and the designs of our editing method. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Eric8932/JEEP.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Topic Matching: Quantifying Thematic Overlap Between Corpora Through Topic Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces Bidirectional Topic Matching (BTM), a novel method for cross-corpus topic modeling that quantifies thematic overlap and divergence between corpora. BTM is a flexible framework that can incorporate various topic modeling approaches, including BERTopic, Top2Vec, and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). BTM employs a dual-model approach, training separate topic models for each corpus and applying them reciprocally to enable comprehensive cross-corpus comparisons. This methodology facilitates the identification of shared themes and unique topics, providing nuanced insights into thematic relationships. Validation against cosine similarity-based methods demonstrates the robustness of BTM, with strong agreement metrics and distinct advantages in handling outlier topics. A case study on climate news articles showcases BTM's utility, revealing significant thematic overlaps and distinctions between corpora focused on climate change and climate action. BTM's flexibility and precision make it a valuable tool for diverse applications, from political discourse analysis to interdisciplinary studies. By integrating shared and unique topic analyses, BTM offers a comprehensive framework for exploring thematic relationships, with potential extensions to multilingual and dynamic datasets. This work highlights BTM's methodological contributions and its capacity to advance discourse analysis across various domains.</description>

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation systems rely on effective document retrieval capabilities. By design, conventional sparse or dense retrievers face challenges in multi-hop retrieval scenarios. In this paper, we present GeAR, which advances RAG performance through two key innovations: (i) graph expansion, which enhances any conventional base retriever, such as BM25, and (ii) an agent framework that incorporates graph expansion. Our evaluation demonstrates GeAR's superior retrieval performance on three multi-hop question answering datasets. Additionally, our system achieves state-of-the-art results with improvements exceeding 10% on the challenging MuSiQue dataset, while requiring fewer tokens and iterations compared to other multi-step retrieval systems.</description>

      <title>LLMTreeRec: Unleashing the Power of Large Language Models for Cold-Start Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The lack of training data gives rise to the system cold-start problem in recommendation systems, making them struggle to provide effective recommendations. To address this problem, Large Language Models (LLMs) can model recommendation tasks as language analysis tasks and provide zero-shot results based on their vast open-world knowledge. However, the large scale of the item corpus poses a challenge to LLMs, leading to substantial token consumption that makes it impractical to deploy in real-world recommendation systems. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a tree-based LLM recommendation framework LLMTreeRec, which structures all items into an item tree to improve the efficiency of LLM's item retrieval. LLMTreeRec achieves state-of-the-art performance under the system cold-start setting in two widely used datasets, which is even competitive with conventional deep recommendation systems that use substantial training data. Furthermore, LLMTreeRec outperforms the baseline model in A/B testing on Huawei industrial systems. Consequently, LLMTreeRec demonstrates its effectiveness as an industry-friendly solution that has been successfully deployed online.

      <title>Deep Adaptive Interest Network: Personalized Recommendation with Context-Aware Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In personalized recommendation systems, accurately capturing users' evolving interests and combining them with contextual information is a critical research area. This paper proposes a novel model called the Deep Adaptive Interest Network (DAIN), which dynamically models users' interests while incorporating context-aware learning mechanisms to achieve precise and adaptive personalized recommendations. DAIN leverages deep learning techniques to build an adaptive interest network structure that can capture users' interest changes in real-time while further optimizing recommendation results by integrating contextual information. Experiments conducted on several public datasets demonstrate that DAIN excels in both recommendation performance and computational efficiency. This research not only provides a new solution for personalized recommendation systems but also offers fresh insights into the application of context-aware learning in recommendation systems.</description>

      <title>Subtopic-aware View Sampling and Temporal Aggregation for Long-form Document Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-form document matching aims to judge the relevance between two documents and has been applied to various scenarios. Most existing works utilize hierarchical or long context models to process documents, which achieve coarse understanding but may ignore details. Some researchers construct a document view with similar sentences about aligned document subtopics to focus on detailed matching signals. However, a long document generally contains multiple subtopics. The matching signals are heterogeneous from multiple topics. Considering only the homologous aligned subtopics may not be representative enough and may cause biased modeling. In this paper, we introduce a new framework to model representative matching signals. First, we propose to capture various matching signals through subtopics of document pairs. Next, We construct multiple document views based on subtopics to cover heterogeneous and valuable details. However, existing spatial aggregation methods like attention, which integrate all these views simultaneously, are hard to integrate heterogeneous information. Instead, we propose temporal aggregation, which effectively integrates different views gradually as the training progresses. Experimental results show that our learning framework is effective on several document-matching tasks, including news duplication and legal case retrieval.</description>

      <title>TableRAG: Million-Token Table Understanding with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have notably enhanced their ability to reason with tabular data, primarily through program-aided mechanisms that manipulate and analyze tables. However, these methods often require the entire table as input, leading to scalability challenges due to the positional bias or context length constraints. In response to these challenges, we introduce TableRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework specifically designed for LM-based table understanding. TableRAG leverages query expansion combined with schema and cell retrieval to pinpoint crucial information before providing it to the LMs. This enables more efficient data encoding and precise retrieval, significantly reducing prompt lengths and mitigating information loss. We have developed two new million-token benchmarks from the Arcade and BIRD-SQL datasets to thoroughly evaluate TableRAG's effectiveness at scale. Our results demonstrate that TableRAG's retrieval design achieves the highest retrieval quality, leading to the new state-of-the-art performance on large-scale table understanding.</description>

      <title>RAGONITE: Iterative Retrieval on Induced Databases and Verbalized RDF for Conversational QA over KGs with RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conversational question answering (ConvQA) is a convenient means of searching over RDF knowledge graphs (KGs), where a prevalent approach is to translate natural language questions to SPARQL queries. However, SPARQL has certain shortcomings: (i) it is brittle for complex intents and conversational questions, and (ii) it is not suitable for more abstract needs. Instead, we propose a novel two-pronged system where we fuse: (i) SQL-query results over a database automatically derived from the KG, and (ii) text-search results over verbalizations of KG facts. Our pipeline supports iterative retrieval: when the results of any branch are found to be unsatisfactory, the system can automatically opt for further rounds. We put everything together in a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) setup, where an LLM generates a coherent response from accumulated search results. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed system over several baselines on a knowledge graph of BMW automobiles.</description>
