      <title>Inverse-design topology optimization of magnonic devices using level-set method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inverse design approach in magnonics exploits the wave nature of magnons and machine learning to develop novel logical devices with unique functionalities that exceed the capabilities of analytical methods. Despite its potential in analog, Boolean, and neuromorphic computing, existing implementations are limited by memory usage, restricting computational depth and the design of complex devices. This study introduces a level-set parameterization approach for topology optimization, coupled with an adjoint-state method for memory-efficient solution of magnetization dynamics equations. The simulation platform employed is $\texttt{neuralmag}$, a GPU-accelerated micromagnetic software that features a unique nodal finite-difference discretization scheme integrated with automatic differentiation tools. To validate the proposed inverse design method, we first addressed a magnetic nanoparticle shape optimization task, demonstrating how additional constraints on the objective function can control the design solution space and govern the optimization process. Subsequently, the functionality of a magnonic demultiplexer was realized using a 300-nm-wide yttrium iron garnet conduit. This device achieves spatial frequency-selective separation of spin waves into distinct outputs. This task demonstrates the algorithm's efficiency in identifying local minima of the objective function across various initial topologies, establishing its effectiveness as a versatile inverse design tool for creating magnonic logic device designs.</description>

      <title>Charge transfer induced cubic gauche nitrogen from azides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cubic gauche nitrogen (cg-N) with a three-dimensional network of N-N single bonds attracted lots of attentions in last decades, since it theoretically has five times larger energy than TNT. While, extreme environments of high pressure or plasma treatment were required in traditional routes. Quite recently, in vacuum or protective gas environments, a one-step synthesis route relying solely on heating is reported giving the highest cg-N content. However, corresponding mechanism is missing, which hinders the improvement of yield and the development of simpler methods. Here, by treating KN3 in different gas environments, we find that moisture can prevent the transition from KN3 to cg-N. In a dry air environment at 260 ~ 300{\deg}C, KN3 decomposes into K and N2, and charge transfer from K to KN3 can induce cg-N. Furthermore, by grinding or loading pressure on the mixture of KN3 with Li, Na, K, Cs, Ca, Mg and Al, we find that elements with higher electronegativity, higher pressure and temperature conditions are needed to induce cg-N, while grinding alone is sufficient for alkali metals even without heating, thus confirming the charge-transfer mechanism. These findings provide guidance for the synthesis of cg-N under ambient conditions through metal-catalyzed polymerization of various azides.</description>

      <title>Mathematical analysis of a Mu\~noz-Delgado model for cigar-shaped Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present mathematical analysis of one-dimensional effective models proposed in [\cite{MunozDelgado}] concerning Bose-Einstein condensates in the presence of harmonic confinement. Among the demonstrated properties, we can mention: existence, uniqueness, orbital stability, symmetry and gaussian asymptotic decay of ground-state solutions in the repulsive case. We also report formul\ae\ for the minimal energy $E_{\mn}$ and the associate chemical potential $\mu$ as functions of a parameter $\lambda$, which is related to $N$ (the number of atoms) and/or $a$ (the s-wave scattering length). By considering Taylor's development of the non-quadratic therm of the energy and using appropriate gaussian functions as approximations for the ground state, we present some numerical experiments to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Review on spin-wave RF applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review explores the progress of spin-wave technology, emphasizing magnonics as a potential solution to modern challenges in radio frequency (RF) communication systems. To ensure clarity, the first two sections of the review reiterate premises of the magnonics, outline key milestones in spin-wave research, briefly review the state-of-the-art for technology and materials, as well as highlight potential directions for future developments. The third section is dedicated to spin-wave RF applications developed over the past 50 years, focusing on selected passive fundamental devices (filters, power limiters, delay lines, phase shifters, directional couplers, resonators, etc) and their operating principles. In the last section, the review further discusses the main advantages of spin-waves for RF applications while highlighting potential concerns, such as insertion losses, linearity and power capacity. Finally, potential solutions to address these challenges are proposed.</description>

      <title>Numerical Calculation of Electric Field Enhancement in Neutron Traps with Rough Walls Coated with Superfluid Helium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A film of liquid helium on the surface of material traps for ultracold neutrons protects the neutrons from being absorbed by the trap walls. By using surface roughness and an electrostatic field, it is possible to maintain a helium film of sufficient thickness throughout the height of the trap. The field distribution near the tip of such wall roughness of the trap was calculated, and the effect of this field on holding the helium film was estimated.</description>

      <title>Transition to strong wave turbulence in Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study numerically wave turbulence in a Bose-Einstein condensate in the forced and dissipated inverse cascade settings. We observe that when the forcing rate is increased, the turbulence spectrum gradually transitions from the weak-wave turbulence Kolmogorov-Zakharov cascade to a critical balance state characterised by a range of scales with balanced linear and nonlinear dynamic timescales. Further forcing increase leads to emergence of a coherent condensate component superimposed with Bogolyubov-type acoustic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Neural information processing and time-series prediction with only two dynamical memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Memristive devices are commonly benchmarked by the multi-level programmability of their resistance states. Neural networks utilizing memristor crossbar arrays as synaptic layers largely rely on this feature. However, the dynamical properties of memristors, such as the adaptive response times arising from the exponential voltage dependence of the resistive switching speed remain largely unexploited. Here, we propose an information processing scheme which fundamentally relies on the latter. We realize simple dynamical memristor circuits capable of complex temporal information processing tasks. We demonstrate an artificial neural circuit with one nonvolatile and one volatile memristor which can detect a neural spike pattern in a very noisy environment, fire a single voltage pulse upon successful detection and reset itself in an entirely autonomous manner. Furthermore, we implement a circuit with only two nonvolatile memristors which can learn the operation of an external dynamical system and perform the corresponding time-series prediction with high accuracy.</description>

      <title>Motion-driven quantum dissipation in an open electronic system with nonlocal interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study excitations and dissipation in two infinite parallel metallic plates with relative motion. We model the degrees of freedom of the electrons in both plates using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field and select a nonlocal potential to describe the interaction between the two plates. The internal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, assuming one plate slides relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the system and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a perturbative method. The numerical plots show that, as a function of momentum the vacuum occupation number is isotropic for a motion speed v = 0 and anisotropic for nonzero v. Due to energy transfer between the plates, the process of relative motion induces on-shell excitations, similar to the dissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Therefore, we can study the motion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces via quantum action. The numerical results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the quantum action for the motion boost and the dissipative force have a threshold as a function of v, and both are positively correlated with v.</description>
