      <title>Operational Accelerator Tuning via Model-Coupled Optics and Bayesian Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an on-line tuning strategy for the ISAC post-accelerator that pre-sets machine optics with a digital twin and then performs Bayesian optimization for steering under online operation with beam. The model computes end-to-end tunes in seconds and interfaces with the control system under device bounds, slew-rate limits, and loss interlocks. We report three experimental case studies demonstrating that decoupling optics from steering yields faster and more reliable convergence than a fully Bayesian optics-plus-steering baseline under identical conditions. Across these cases, iterations to high transmission tunes are reduced by a factor of 4-6, with final average transmissions in the mid- to high-90% range. By factorizing optics from steering, the dimensionality of the parameter space is reduced, convergence becomes more predictable, and operational safeguards are easier to enforce.</description>

      <title>Driver-delay chicanes for a multistage plasma-based accelerator facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SPARTA project aims to design a medium-sized accelerator facility that facilitates new experiments in strong-field quantum electrodynamics using plasma-based accelerators. For this, we need several plasma stages and, therefore, several drivers. Drivers can be either an ultra-relativistic charged particle beam or a high-intensity laser beam. In case we use particle beams, we need a method of distributing these beams from a radio-frequency accelerator to the different plasma stages. A central part of this is a delay scheme that ensures temporal synchronization of the drivers. In this paper, we demonstrate how to achieve a 2 ns delay in $\sim$12 m, while keeping the first-order beam parameters periodic.</description>

      <title>Conceptual Design of Highly-Constrained Splitters for the FFA@CEBAF Energy Upgrade Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF) at Jefferson Lab is investigating a significant energy upgrade utilizing Fixed-Field Alternating-gradient (FFA) recirculating arcs. This upgrade requires the design of complex horizontal beam splitters to manage up to six concurrent beam passes. This paper presents the conceptual design of these splitters, which are subject to severe physical constraints imposed by the existing accelerator tunnel and multifaceted beam dynamics requirements for matching into the permanent-magnet FFA arcs. The design methodology, centered on multi-pass simulations in the Bmad toolkit, is detailed from the initial geometric layout through the advanced optics matching. Key results include a robust geometric arrangement that fits within the spatial boundaries and the development of multiple, flexible optics matching solutions. Furthermore, the design integrates a viable scheme for extracting high-energy beams for the experimental halls, a critical operational requirement. This work establishes a comprehensive and viable conceptual design, forming a baseline for future engineering and performance optimization studies.</description>

      <title>A Low Cost Picoseconds Precision Timing and Synchronization Over A Hundred Kilometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale systems, such as very large accelerators used for fundamental research, require the implementation of precise timing and synchronization systems over distances of several tens of kilometers. A very high precision has been demonstrated by the use of costly and complex clock distribution systems. However, many devices, such as accelerator diagnostics or large-scale detectors, only require picosecond precision. An approach exploiting the CERN White Rabbit protocol, deployed and enhanced on an electronic system capable of generating arbitrary frequencies with Hertz precision, is proposed here. Results of performance tests for the synchronization of a laser system, typically employed as a diagnostic for electron/positron beam polarimetry in accelerators, are provided in this Paper. We demonstrate that without implementing corrections for environmental changes, as temperature drifts, the system can synchronize a pulsed laser with picoseconds precision over a hundred kilometers, exhibiting drifts of a few picoseconds. This work paves the way for a low-cost implementation of picosecond synchronization of accelerator components and large-scale detectors.</description>

      <title>Deuterium-Tritium Levitated Dipole Fusion Power Plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Levitated dipole reactors offer an attractive path towards economic fusion power generation. The intrinsic decoupling of the confining magnetic field-generating REBCO magnets and the vacuum vessel offer unparalleled accessibility and maintainability, allowing for high plant duty factors and theoretically low electricity prices. In order to achieve rapid deployment of fusion power to the grid, the use of the Deuterium-Tritium (DT) fuel cycle is required due to its lower required plasma triple products. Historically, designs of levitated dipole fusion power plants have targeted advanced fuels as a DT device was seen to be infeasible due to the high fluxes of 14.1 MeV neutrons on the superconducting core magnet. This study presents high level designs for two feasible first-of-a-kind (FOAK) DT levitated dipole fusion power plants, the larger of which produces 667 MW of fusion power and is predicted to produce 208 MW of net electric power. Both designs consist of a heavily neutron-shielded, high-field REBCO core magnet capable of producing peak magnetic field strengths of 23 T while keeping peak mechanical strains below 0.4%. The neutron shielding is comprised of a layered structure of tungsten and boron carbide, which allows for 92% of the heat deposited in the neutron shield to be radiated out to the first wall while still providing sufficient neutron attenuation to give adequate REBCO conductor lifetimes. The core magnet REBCO coil is comprised of a small "sacrificial" section and a larger semi-permanent section. The sacrificial section, comprising ~20% of the coil, will have a neutron damage limited lifetime of ~1 year, after which the core magnet will be quickly removed from the vacuum vessel and replaced. This allows the damaged core magnet to be refurbished and reused, reducing cost and allowing for economic fusion power generation from a DT levitated dipole reactor.</description>
