      <title>On the expressivity of deep Heaviside networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that deep Heaviside networks (DHNs) have limited expressiveness but that this can be overcome by including either skip connections or neurons with linear activation. We provide lower and upper bounds for the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimensions and approximation rates of these network classes. As an application, we derive statistical convergence rates for DHN fits in the nonparametric regression model.</description>

      <title>Inference for max-linear Bayesian networks with noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Max-Linear Bayesian Networks (MLBNs) provide a powerful framework for causal inference in extreme-value settings; we consider MLBNs with noise parameters with a given topology in terms of the max-plus algebra by taking its logarithm. Then, we show that an estimator of a parameter for each edge in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is distributed normally. We end this paper with computational experiments with the expectation and maximization (EM) algorithm and quadratic optimization.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning with Continuous Actions Under Unmeasured Confounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of offline policy learning in reinforcement learning with continuous action spaces when unmeasured confounders are present. While most existing research focuses on policy evaluation within partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and assumes discrete action spaces, we advance this field by establishing a novel identification result to enable the nonparametric estimation of policy value for a given target policy under an infinite-horizon framework. Leveraging this identification, we develop a minimax estimator and introduce a policy-gradient-based algorithm to identify the in-class optimal policy that maximizes the estimated policy value. Furthermore, we provide theoretical results regarding the consistency, finite-sample error bound, and regret bound of the resulting optimal policy. Extensive simulations and a real-world application using the German Family Panel data demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.</description>

      <title>Statistical Learning for Heterogeneous Treatment Effects: Pretraining, Prognosis, and Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects is a fundamental challenge for optimal decision-making in domains ranging from personalized medicine to educational policy. In recent years, predictive machine learning has emerged as a valuable toolbox for causal estimation, enabling more flexible effect estimation. However, accurately estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATE) remains a major challenge, particularly in the presence of many covariates. In this article, we propose pretraining strategies that leverages a phenomenon in real-world applications: factors that are prognostic of the outcome are frequently also predictive of treatment effect heterogeneity. In medicine, for example, components of the same biological signaling pathways frequently influence both baseline risk and treatment response. Specifically, we demonstrate our approach within the R-learner framework, which estimates the CATE by solving individual prediction problems based on a residualized loss. We use this structure to incorporate "side information" and develop models that can exploit synergies between risk prediction and causal effect estimation. In settings where these synergies are present, this cross-task learning enables more accurate signal detection: yields lower estimation error, reduced false discovery rates, and higher power for detecting heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Hypothesis-free discovery from epidemiological data by automatic detection and local inference for tree-based nonlinearities and interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In epidemiological settings, Machine Learning (ML) is gaining popularity for hypothesis-free discovery of risk (or protective) factors. Although ML is strong at discovering non-linearities and interactions, this power is currently compromised by a lack of reliable inference. Although local measures of feature effect can be combined with tree ensembles, uncertainty quantifications for these measures remain only partially available and oftentimes unsatisfactory. We propose RuleSHAP, a framework for using rule-based, hypothesis-free discovery that combines sparse Bayesian regression, tree ensembles and Shapley values in a one-step procedure that both detects and tests complex patterns at the individual level. To ease computation, we derive a formula that computes marginal Shapley values more efficiently for our setting. We demonstrate the validity of our framework on simulated data. To illustrate, we apply our machinery to data from an epidemiological cohort to detect and infer several effects for high cholesterol and blood pressure, such as nonlinear interaction effects between features like age, sex, ethnicity, BMI and glucose level.</description>

      <title>Bayes-Optimal Fair Classification with Multiple Sensitive Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing theoretical work on Bayes-optimal fair classifiers usually considers a single (binary) sensitive feature. In practice, individuals are often defined by multiple sensitive features. In this paper, we characterize the Bayes-optimal fair classifier for multiple sensitive features under general approximate fairness measures, including mean difference and mean ratio. We show that these approximate measures for existing group fairness notions, including Demographic Parity, Equal Opportunity, Predictive Equality, and Accuracy Parity, are linear transformations of selection rates for specific groups defined by both labels and sensitive features. We then characterize that Bayes-optimal fair classifiers for multiple sensitive features become instance-dependent thresholding rules that rely on a weighted sum of these group membership probabilities. Our framework applies to both attribute-aware and attribute-blind settings and can accommodate composite fairness notions like Equalized Odds. Building on this, we propose two practical algorithms for Bayes-optimal fair classification via in-processing and post-processing. We show empirically that our methods compare favorably to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Surplus Electricity: Profitability of Bitcoin Mining as a National Strategy in South Korea</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines the feasibility and profitability of utilizing surplus electricity for Bitcoin mining. Surplus electricity refers to the remaining electricity after net metering, which can be repurposed for Bitcoin mining to improve Korea Electric Power Corporation's (KEPCO) energy resource efficiency and alleviate its debt challenges. Net metering (or net energy metering) is an electricity billing mechanism that allows consumers who generate some or all of their own electricity to use that electricity when they want, rather than when it is produced. Using the latest Bitcoin miner, the Antminer S21 XP Hyd, the study evaluates daily Bitcoin mining when operating at 30,565 and 45,439 units, incorporating Bitcoin network hash rates to assess profitability. To examine profitability, the Random Forest Regressor and Long Short-Term Memory models were used to predict the Bitcoin price. The analysis shows that the use of excess electricity for Bitcoin mining not only generates economic revenue, but also minimizes energy loss, reduces debt, and resolves unsettled payment issues for KEPCO. This study empirically investigates and analyzes the integration of electricity surplus in South Korea with bitcoin mining for the first time. The findings highlight the potential to strengthen the financial stability of KEPCO and demonstrate the feasibility of Bitcoin mining. In addition, this research serves as a foundational resource for future advancements in the Bitcoin mining industry and the efficient use of energy resources.</description>

      <title>Do global forecasting models require frequent retraining?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an era of increasing computational capabilities and growing environmental consciousness, organizations face a critical challenge in balancing the accuracy of forecasting models with computational efficiency and sustainability. Global forecasting models, lowering the computational time, have gained significant attention over the years. However, the common practice of retraining these models with new observations raises important questions about the costs of forecasting. Using ten different machine learning and deep learning models, we analyzed various retraining scenarios, ranging from continuous updates to no retraining at all, across two large retail datasets. We showed that less frequent retraining strategies maintain the forecast accuracy while reducing the computational costs, providing a more sustainable approach to large-scale forecasting. We also found that machine learning models are a marginally better choice to reduce the costs of forecasting when coupled with less frequent model retraining strategies as the frequency of the data increases. Our findings challenge the conventional belief that frequent retraining is essential for maintaining forecasting accuracy. Instead, periodic retraining offers a good balance between predictive performance and efficiency, both in the case of point and probabilistic forecasting. These insights provide actionable guidelines for organizations seeking to optimize forecasting pipelines while reducing costs and energy consumption.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Causal Calibration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01933v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimates of heterogeneous treatment effects such as conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) and conditional quantile treatment effects (CQTEs) play an important role in real-world decision making. Given this importance, one should ensure these estimates are calibrated. While there is a rich literature on calibrating estimators of non-causal parameters, very few methods have been derived for calibrating estimators of causal parameters, or more generally estimators of quantities involving nuisance parameters. In this work, we develop general algorithms for reducing the task of causal calibration to that of calibrating a standard (non-causal) predictive model.
  Throughout, we study a notion of calibration defined with respect to an arbitrary, nuisance-dependent loss $\ell$, under which we say an estimator $\theta$ is calibrated if its predictions cannot be changed on any level set to decrease loss. For losses $\ell$ satisfying a condition called universal orthogonality, we present a simple algorithm that transforms partially-observed data into generalized pseudo-outcomes and applies any off-the-shelf calibration procedure. For losses $\ell$ satisfying a weaker assumption called conditional orthogonality, we provide a similar sample splitting algorithm the performs empirical risk minimization over an appropriately defined class of functions. Convergence of both algorithms follows from a generic, two term upper bound of the calibration error of any model. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our results in experiments on both observational and synthetic data. Our results are exceedingly general, showing that essentially any existing calibration algorithm can be used in causal settings, with additional loss only arising from errors in nuisance estimation.</description>

      <title>Geometry-aware Active Learning of Spatiotemporal Dynamic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rapid developments in advanced sensing and imaging have significantly enhanced information visibility, opening opportunities for predictive modeling of complex dynamic systems. However, sensing signals acquired from such complex systems are often distributed across 3D geometries and rapidly evolving over time, posing significant challenges in spatiotemporal predictive modeling. This paper proposes a geometry-aware active learning framework for modeling spatiotemporal dynamic systems. Specifically, we propose a geometry-aware spatiotemporal Gaussian Process (G-ST-GP) to effectively integrate the temporal correlations and geometric manifold features for reliable prediction of high-dimensional dynamic behaviors. In addition, we develop an adaptive active learning strategy to strategically identify informative spatial locations for data collection and further maximize the prediction accuracy. This strategy achieves the adaptive trade-off between the prediction uncertainty in the G-ST-GP model and the space-filling design guided by the geodesic distance across the 3D geometry. We implement the proposed framework to model the spatiotemporal electrodynamics in a 3D heart geometry. Numerical experiments show that our framework outperforms traditional methods lacking the mechanism of geometric information incorporation or effective data collection.</description>

      <title>Introduction to Online Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.09619v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This text presents an introduction to an emerging paradigm in control of dynamical systems and differentiable reinforcement learning called online nonstochastic control. The new approach applies techniques from online convex optimization and convex relaxations to obtain new methods with provable guarantees for classical settings in optimal and robust control.
  The primary distinction between online nonstochastic control and other frameworks is the objective. In optimal control, robust control, and other control methodologies that assume stochastic noise, the goal is to perform comparably to an offline optimal strategy. In online nonstochastic control, both the cost functions as well as the perturbations from the assumed dynamical model are chosen by an adversary. Thus the optimal policy is not defined a priori. Rather, the target is to attain low regret against the best policy in hindsight from a benchmark class of policies.
  This objective suggests the use of the decision making framework of online convex optimization as an algorithmic methodology. The resulting methods are based on iterative mathematical optimization algorithms, and are accompanied by finite-time regret and computational complexity guarantees.</description>

      <title>Learning Against Distributional Uncertainty: On the Trade-off Between Robustness and Specificity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.13565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trustworthy machine learning aims at combating distributional uncertainties in training data distributions compared to population distributions. Typical treatment frameworks include the Bayesian approach, (min-max) distributionally robust optimization (DRO), and regularization. However, three issues have to be raised: 1) the prior distribution in the Bayesian method and the regularizer in the regularization method are difficult to specify; 2) the DRO method tends to be overly conservative; 3) all the three methods are biased estimators of the true optimal cost. This paper studies a new framework that unifies the three approaches and addresses the three challenges above. The asymptotic properties (e.g., consistencies and asymptotic normalities), non-asymptotic properties (e.g., generalization bounds and unbiasedness), and solution methods of the proposed model are studied. The new model reveals the trade-off between the robustness to the unseen data and the specificity to the training data. Experiments on various real-world tasks validate the superiority of the proposed learning framework.</description>

      <title>Accelerated First-Order Optimization under Nonlinear Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00316v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exploit analogies between first-order algorithms for constrained optimization and non-smooth dynamical systems to design a new class of accelerated first-order algorithms for constrained optimization. Unlike Frank-Wolfe or projected gradients, these algorithms avoid optimization over the entire feasible set at each iteration. We prove convergence to stationary points even in a nonconvex setting and we derive accelerated rates for the convex setting both in continuous time, as well as in discrete time. An important property of these algorithms is that constraints are expressed in terms of velocities instead of positions, which naturally leads to sparse, local and convex approximations of the feasible set (even if the feasible set is nonconvex). Thus, the complexity tends to grow mildly in the number of decision variables and in the number of constraints, which makes the algorithms suitable for machine learning applications. We apply our algorithms to a compressed sensing and a sparse regression problem, showing that we can treat nonconvex $\ell^p$ constraints ($p&lt;1$) efficiently, while recovering state-of-the-art performance for $p=1$.</description>

      <title>Infinite-dimensional Diffusion Bridge Simulation via Operator Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diffusion bridge, which is a diffusion process conditioned on hitting a specific state within a finite period, has found broad applications in various scientific and engineering fields. However, simulating diffusion bridges for modeling natural data can be challenging due to both the intractability of the drift term and continuous representations of the data. Although several methods are available to simulate finite-dimensional diffusion bridges, infinite-dimensional cases remain under explored. This paper presents a method that merges score matching techniques with operator learning, enabling a direct approach to learn the infinite-dimensional bridge and achieving a discretization equivariant bridge simulation. We conduct a series of experiments, ranging from synthetic examples with closed-form solutions to the stochastic nonlinear evolution of real-world biological shape data. Our method demonstrates high efficacy, particularly due to its ability to adapt to any resolution without extra training.</description>

      <title>Decision Making in Hybrid Environments: A Model Aggregation Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work by Foster et al. (2021, 2022, 2023b) and Xu and Zeevi (2023) developed the framework of decision estimation coefficient (DEC) that characterizes the complexity of general online decision making problems and provides a general algorithm design principle. These works, however, either focus on the pure stochastic regime where the world remains fixed over time, or the pure adversarial regime where the world arbitrarily changes over time. For the hybrid regime where the dynamics of the world is fixed while the reward arbitrarily changes, they only give pessimistic bounds on the decision complexity. In this work, we propose a general extension of DEC that more precisely characterizes this case. Besides applications in special cases, our framework leads to a flexible algorithm design where the learner learns over subsets of the hypothesis set, trading estimation complexity with decision complexity, which could be of independent interest. Our work covers model-based learning and model-free learning in the hybrid regime, with a newly proposed extension of the bilinear classes (Du et al., 2021) to the adversarial-reward case. In addition, our method improves the best-known regret bounds for linear Q*/V* MDPs in the pure stochastic regime.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-aware Bayesian machine learning modelling of land cover classification</title>

Abstract: Land cover classification involves the production of land cover maps, which determine the type of land through remote sensing imagery. Over recent years, such classification is being performed by machine learning classification models, which can give highly accurate predictions on land cover per pixel using large quantities of input training data. However, such models do not currently take account of input measurement uncertainty, which is vital for traceability in metrology. In this work we propose a Bayesian classification framework using generative modelling to take account of input measurement uncertainty. We take the specific case of Bayesian quadratic discriminant analysis, and apply it to land cover datasets from Copernicus Sentinel-2 in 2020 and 2021. We benchmark the performance of the model against more popular classification models used in land cover maps such as random forests and neural networks. We find that such Bayesian models are more trustworthy, in the sense that they are more interpretable, explicitly model the input measurement uncertainty, and maintain predictive performance of class probability outputs across datasets of different years and sizes, whilst also being computationally efficient.</description>

      <title>Locally minimax optimal and dimension-agnostic discrete argmin inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper tackles a fundamental inference problem: given $n$ observations from a $d$ dimensional vector with unknown mean $\boldsymbol{\mu}$, we must form a confidence set for the index (or indices) corresponding to the smallest component of $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. By duality, we reduce this to testing, for each $r$ in $1,\ldots,d$, whether $\mu_r$ is the smallest. Based on the sample splitting and self-normalization approach of Kim and Ramdas (2024), we propose "dimension-agnostic" tests that maintain validity regardless of how $d$ scales with $n$, and regardless of arbitrary ties in $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. Notably, our validity holds under mild moment conditions, requiring little more than finiteness of a second moment, and permitting possibly strong dependence between coordinates. In addition, we establish the local minimax separation rate for this problem, which adapts to the cardinality of a confusion set, and show that the proposed tests attain this rate. Furthermore, we develop robust variants that continue to achieve the same minimax rate under heavy-tailed distributions with only finite second moments. Empirical results on simulated and real data illustrate the strong performance of our approach in terms of type I error control and power compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Whence Is A Model Fair? Fixing Fairness Bugs via Propensity Score Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17066v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fairness-aware learning aims to mitigate discrimination against specific protected social groups (e.g., those categorized by gender, ethnicity, age) while minimizing predictive performance loss. Despite efforts to improve fairness in machine learning, prior studies have shown that many models remain unfair when measured against various fairness metrics. In this paper, we examine whether the way training and testing data are sampled affects the reliability of reported fairness metrics. Since training and test sets are often randomly sampled from the same population, bias present in the training data may still exist in the test data, potentially skewing fairness assessments. To address this, we propose FairMatch, a post-processing method that applies propensity score matching to evaluate and mitigate bias. FairMatch identifies control and treatment pairs with similar propensity scores in the test set and adjusts decision thresholds for different subgroups accordingly. For samples that cannot be matched, we perform probabilistic calibration using fairness-aware loss functions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can (a) precisely locate subsets of the test data where the model is unbiased, and (b) significantly reduce bias on the remaining data. Overall, propensity score matching offers a principled way to improve both fairness evaluation and mitigation, without sacrificing predictive performance.</description>
