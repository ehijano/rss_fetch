      <title>Odd-parity Magnetism Driven by Antiferromagnetic Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing odd-parity, time-reversal-preserving, non-relativistic spin splitting is a central goal for spintronics applications. We propose a group-theory-based microscopic framework to induce odd-parity spin splitting from coplanar antiferromagnetic (AFM) states without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We develop phenomenological models for 421 conventional period-doubling AFM systems in non-symmorphic space groups and construct minimal microscopic models for 119 of these. We find that these AFM states can attain three possible competing ground states. These ground states all break symmetries in addition to those broken by the usual AFM order. Specifically, they give rise to either odd-parity spin-splitting, nematic order, or scalar odd-parity order related to multiferroicity. Our microscopic theories reveal that the odd-parity spin-splitting energy scale is generically large and further reveal that the scalar odd-parity order gives a non-zero Berry curvature dipole without SOC. We identify 67 materials in the Magndata database for which our theory applies. We provide DFT calculations on FeSe that reveal an $h$-wave spin splitting consistent with our symmetry arguments and apply our microscopic model to determine the non-relativistic Edelstein response for CeNiAsO.</description>

      <title>Spiral Spin Liquid State in the Corrugated Honeycomb Lattice of CaMn$_2$P$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CaMn$_2$P$_2$ exemplifies the realization of a frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg model of a corrugated honeycomb magnetic lattice. Previous studies show that below the N\'eel temperature ($T_{\rm N}$), the system forms a cycloidal $6\times 6$ $ab$-plane magnetic unit cell that conforms with various magnetic space groups. Here, we present single-crystal neutron-diffraction studies across expansive reciprocal-space volumes, confirming the cycloidal magnetic structure while uncovering further distinctive features. We find evidence for three magnetic domains, the analysis of which narrows the possible magnetic model structures. At $T_{\rm N}$, the insulator exhibits a sharp phase transition, above which the spin structure transforms into a spiral spin liquid state, evident via a continuous ring of scattering with degenerate wavevectors corresponding to a collection of short-range spiral spin configurations. These degenerate states emerge as thermal fluctuations effectively reduce the $J_3$ interaction. The integration of experimental, theoretical, and real-space simulation results reveals the intricate balance of exchange interactions ($J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$) that stabilizes the ground-state magnetic structure and drives the emergence of a sought-after $U$(1)-symmetric spiral spin-liquid state with easy-plane anisotropy above the transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional Supersolids in Luther-Emery Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supersolid is a long-sought phase in condensed matter physics, characterized by the coexistence of density wave and superfluid orders. This phase is counterintuitive, as different symmetry-breaking orders typically compete with one another. A deeper understanding of how such a state forms in condensed matter systems remains an open question, especially in quasi-one-dimensional correlated systems. In this work, we investigate the emergence of supersolids in Luttinger-Emery liquids using a variational method. As the system consists of coupled Luttinger-Emery liquid chains, we refer to this phase as a quasi-one-dimensional supersolid. Notably, we demonstrate that the quasi-one-dimensional supersolid phase is energetically favorable in chains with finite size or short-range order. Furthermore, we investigate the collective dynamics of these coexisting charge density waves and superconducting states, identifying a quasi-Goldstone mode. Our theory provides valuable insights into both the ground state and the dynamic properties of supersolids in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>High Temperature Superconductivity in the Cuprates: Phenomena from a Theorist's Point of View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a selection of experimental results on metallic cuprates, both above the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ (often called the strange metal state) and in the superconducting state. It highlights this still poorly understood part of the physical world. After an introduction, I talk briefly about the pseudogap regime and about the unusual linear resistivity phenomenon. Several empirical correlations between observed quantities are mentioned, e.g. $T_c$ and superfluid density (Uemura), $T_c$ and next nearest neighbour hopping, slope of the linear resistivity and $T_c$. In the belief that a comprehensive explanation may need an understanding of the extremely strongly correlated metal, a few initial steps in this direction are outlined.</description>

      <title>Interacting topological magnons in the Kitaev-Heisenberg honeycomb ferromagnet with the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the Heisenberg-Kitaev honeycomb ferromagnets has recently drawn attention because of their rich topological properties. Topological phase transitions may arise when there exist two or more distinct topological phases, and they are often revealed by a gap-closing phenomenon. In this work, we investigate the magnonic properties of honeycomb ferromagnets exhibiting Kitaev and DMI interactions in the presence of a Heisenberg exchange and magnetocrystalline anisotropy exposed to a magnetic field. We employ the Self-Consistent Renormalization (SCR) spin wave theory to investigate the effects of magnon-magnon interactions (MMIs) and thermal fluctuations on the properties of magnons. Our findings demonstrate that the magnon system undergoes topological phase transitions driven by temperature and magnetic fields, which are attributed to MMIs. Specifically, as the temperature rises, the magnon band gap at the Dirac points closes and reopens at the critical temperature Tc , which is below the Curie temperature. By showing that the Chern numbers of the magnonic bands are distinct above and below Tc , we confirm that the gap-closing phenomenon is indeed a signature for the topological phase transitions. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the thermal Hall conductivity in the magnonic system exhibits a sign reversal at Tc , which can serve as an experimental probe of its topological nature.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Magnetotransport in the Paramagnetic State of a Magnetic Kagome Metal EuTi\textsubscript{3}Bi\textsubscript{4}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electrical transport properties of a magnetic kagome metal EuTi\textsubscript{3}Bi\textsubscript{4}, which undergoes magnetic ordering below $T_\mathrm{C}=10.5$ K. Unlike typical magnets showing anomalous magnetotransport in their ordered states, EuTi\textsubscript{3}Bi\textsubscript{4} exhibits unusual magnetotransport behaviors in its paramagnetic phase. Specifically, the magnetoconductivity shows a linear dependence on magnetic field at low fields below $\sim 1$ T, and the Hall conductivity undergoes a sign change below about 2 T. These behaviors resemble those observed in the charge density wave (CDW) phase of kagome metals \textit{A}V\textsubscript{3}Sb\textsubscript{5} (\textit{A} = K, Rb, Cs). The anomalous magnetotransport in \textit{A}V\textsubscript{3}Sb\textsubscript{5} has commonly been attributed to the possible emergence of a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral CDW order. However, given the absence of CDW in EuTi\textsubscript{3}Bi\textsubscript{4} and its manifestation exclusively in the paramagnetic state, the anomalous magnetotransport observed in EuTi\textsubscript{3}Bi\textsubscript{4} is likely associated with multiband transport and/or the van Hove singularities near the Fermi level.</description>

      <title>Colour symmetry and non-collinear altermagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formalism based on colour symmetry to analyse the momentum-space spin textures of non-collinear magnets. We show that, out of the spin textures allowed by the magnetic point group, one can extract an `altermagnetic' component that is invariant by general rotations in spin space, and can exist in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. We demonstrate this approach in the case of three complex, non-collinear magnets, Mn$_3$Ir(Ge,Si), Pb$_2$MnO$_4$ and Mn$_3$GaN. For Mn$_3$GaN, we also show that the predictions of colour-symmetry analysis are consistent with density functional theory calculations performed on the same system both with and without spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Exploring strong electronic correlations in the breathing kagome metal Fe$_3$Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome metals have emerged as pivotal materials in condensed matter physics due to their unique geometric arrangement and intriguing electronic properties. Understanding the origin of magnetism in these materials, particularly in iron rich Fe-Sn binary compounds like Fe$_3$Sn, holds a significant importance, as they represent potential candidates for permanent magnets with a high Curie temperature and a strong magnetic anisotropy. In the present study, we employ density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory to analyze the electronic structure and magnetic properties of Fe$_3$Sn. Our investigation reveals the presence of several nearly-flat bands and Weyl nodes at low excitation energies. The inclusion of local correlation effects is shown to push these features even closer to the Fermi energy, which may be important for their manipulation via external stimuli. Regarding magnetism, the Hubbard-like interaction leads to an increase of orbital polarization at the expenses of a minor reduction of the spin moment. The magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits a strong dependence on the particular choice of the Coulomb interaction parameters. Additionally, our detailed analysis of the interatomic exchange interactions indicates a significant contribution from the antisymmetric exchange, i.e. the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, which showcases the existence of magnetic chirality in the system. Overall, our investigation highlights a strong interplay between the flat bands near the Fermi level, the local Coulomb interaction and the triangular geometry of the lattice, which plays a crucial role in driving the magnetic properties of this material.</description>

      <title>Multivalued Wess-Zumino-Novikov Functional and Chiral Anomaly in Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19909v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hydrodynamic framework derived from the action of a perfect fluid, modified by the hydrodynamic analog of Novikov's multivalued functional. This modification introduces spin degrees of freedom into the fluid. The structure closely resembles the Abelian version of the Wess-Zumino functional, commonly applied in field theories with chiral anomalies. The deformation incorporates the transport properties of Weyl fermions and exhibits the chiral anomaly in the case of a charged fluid. It is also consistent with Onsager's semiclassical quantization of circulation. Additionally, we discuss the hydrodynamic analog of instantons and related topological invariants.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric effect in van der Waals magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetoelectric (ME) effect is a fundamental concept in modern condensed matter physics and represents the electrical control of magnetic polarisations or vice versa. Two-dimensional (2D) van-der-Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a new class of materials and exhibit novel ME effects with diverse manifestations. This review emphasizes some important recent discoveries unique to vdW magnets: multiferroicity on two dimensions, spin-charge correlation, atomic ME effect and current-induced intrinsic spin-orbit torque, and electrical gating control and magnetic control of their electronic properties. We also highlight the promising route of utilizing quantum magnetic hetero- or homo-structures to engineer the ME effect and corresponding spintronic and optoelectronic device applications. Due to the intrinsic two-dimensionality, vdW magnets with those ME effects are expected to form a new, exciting research direction.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and causality constraints on Fermi liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate symmetry and causality constraints on interacting Fermi liquids. Whereas Galilean or Lorentz boost symmetry leads to a well-known constraint on the first Landau parameter $F_1$, we show that scale invariance similarly constrains $F_0$. In the case of conformal Fermi liquids, we show that causality constraints on the particle-hole continuum and on zero sound strongly restrict the available parameter space for interacting Fermi liquids. We also consider nonlinear response, which we show is sensitive to additional ``generalized Landau parameters'' even at lowest orders in the long wavelength limit. We impose Galilean, Lorentz and scale symmetry on these generalized Landau parameters, obtaining further nonlinear constraints. We test our constraints in several microscopic models that enter a Fermi liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Strong superconducting pairing strength and pseudogap features in a putative multiphase heavy-fermion superconductor CeRh2As2 by soft point-contact spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CeRh2As2 is a newly discovered candidate of multiphase heavy-fermion superconductor (Tc=0.3 K) with intriguing physical properties. Here, we employ soft point-contact spectroscopy to investigate its energy gap behaviors in both the normal and superconducting states. The differential conductance below Tc reveals an estimated superconducting energy gap of 2{\Delta}SC=0.24 meV and thus an extremely strong superconducting pairing strength 2{\Delta}SC/kBTc=8.8, which is comparable to those of cuprates and iron-based high-Tc superconductors as well as infinite-layer nickelates. Above Tc, a well-defined pseudogap feature is manifested as a V-shaped dip in the differential conductance spanning an energy scale of 2{\Delta}g=0.95-3.0 meV. The pseudogap feature persists to the highest characteristic temperature of Tg=8-9 K and is gradually suppressed by magnetic field of Bg=9.0T regardless of its direction relative to the crystallographic axes. The observation of pseudogap features prior to the superconducting phase transition enriches the phase diagram of CeRh2As2 and provides a novel platform to study the interplay of unconventional superconductivity and pseudogap phenomena.</description>

      <title>High-temperature field-free superconducting diode effect in high-Tc cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is defined by the difference in the magnitude of critical currents applied in opposite directions. It has been observed in various superconducting systems and attracted high research interests. However, the operating temperature of the SDE is typically low and/or the sample structure is rather complex. For the potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, efficient superconducting diodes working in zero magnetic field with high operating temperatures and a simple configuration are highly desired. Here, we report the observation of a SDE under zero magnetic field with operating temperatures up to 72 K and efficiency as high as 22% at 53 K in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) flake devices. The rectification effect persists beyond two hundred sweeping cycles, confirming the stability of the superconducting diode. Our results offer promising developments for potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, and provide insights into the mechanism of field-free SDE and symmetry breakings in high-Tc superconductors.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal symmetry breaking fractional quantum spin Hall insulator in moir\'e MoTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which support flat Chern bands with enhanced interaction effects, realize a platform for fractional Chern insulators and fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) insulators. A recent experiment has reported the emergence of a FQSH insulator protected by spin-Sz conservation at a moir\'e lattice filling factor {\nu}=3 in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2. Theoretical studies have proposed both time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric ground states as possible candidates for the observed FQSH insulator, but the nature of the state remains unexplored. Here we report the observation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at generic fillings in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2 from {\nu}&lt;1 all the way to {\nu}&gt;6 except at {\nu}=2, 4, and 6. Although zero Hall response is observed at {\nu}=3 for magnetic fields higher than 20 mT, a finite anomalous Hall response accompanied by a magnetic hysteresis is observed at lower magnetic fields, demonstrating spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work shows the tendency towards ferromagnetism by doping the first three pairs of conjugate Chern bands in the material; it also sheds light on the nature of the FQSH insulator at {\nu}=3.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Quantum Metrology Singularity through Sequential Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simultaneous estimation of multiple unknown parameters is the most general scenario in quantum sensing. Quantum multi-parameter estimation theory provides fundamental bounds on the achievable precision of simultaneous estimation. However, these bounds can become singular (no finite bound exists) in multi-parameter sensing due to parameter interdependencies, limited probe accessibility, and insufficient measurement outcomes. Here, we address the singularity issue in quantum sensing through a simple mechanism based on a sequential measurement strategy. This sensing scheme overcomes the singularity constraint and enables the simultaneous estimation of multiple parameters with a local and fixed measurement throughout the sensing protocol. This is because sequential measurements, involving consecutive steps of local measurements followed by probe evolution, inherently produce correlated measurement data that grows exponentially with the number of sequential measurements. Finally, through two different examples, namely a strongly correlated probe and a light-matter system, we demonstrate how such singularities are reflected when inferring the unknown parameters through Bayesian estimation.</description>

      <title>Topology meets time-reversal symmetry breaking in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$ superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) in magnetic topological insulators induces a Dirac gap in the topological surface state (TSS), leading to exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Yet, the interplay between TRSB and topology in superconductors remains underexplored due to limited suitable materials. Here we employ zero-field muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) as a sensitive probe of TRSB to map out the electronic phase diagrams of iron-chalcogenide superconductors FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$. For the Te composition $x=0.64$ with the highest superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}=14.5$ K, which is known to host a TSS and Majorana zero modes within vortices, we detect spontaneous magnetic fields below $T_{\rm c}$ distinct from a magnetic order. This signifies a TRSB superconducting state in the bulk, revealing the convergence of unconventional TRSB superconductivity with topologically nontrivial electronic structures in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_{x}$. Given the relatively high $T_{\rm c}$ and the tunability of the Fermi level through chemical substitution, iron-chalcogenide superconductors offer an intriguing platform for investigating the synergy between topological superconductivity and TRSB.</description>

      <title>The importance of shear on the collective charge transport in CDWs revealed by an XFEL source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge transport in materials has an impact on a wide range of devices based on semiconductor, battery or superconductor technology. Charge transport in sliding Charge Density Waves (CDW) differs from all others in that the atomic lattice is directly involved in the transport process. To obtain an overall picture of the structural changes associated to the collective transport, the large coherent X-ray beam generated by an X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) source was used. The CDW phase can be retrieved over the entire sample from diffracted intensities using a genetic algorithm. For currents below threshold, increasing shear deformation is observed in the central part of the sample while longitudinal deformation appears above threshold when shear relaxes. Shear thus precedes longitudinal deformation, with relaxation of one leading to the appearance of the other. Moreover, strain accumulates on surface steps in the sliding regime, demonstrating the strong pinning character of these surface discontinuities. The sliding process of nanometric CDW is based on an impressive spatial coherence involving the macroscopic sample dimensions.</description>

      <title>$\eta$ invariant of massive Wilson Dirac operator and the index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the lattice index theorem in the perspective of $K$-theory. The standard definition given by the overlap Dirac operator equals to the $\eta$ invariant of the Wilson Dirac operator with a negative mass. This equality is not coincidental but reflects a mathematically profound significance known as the suspension isomorphism of $K$-groups. Specifically, we identify the Wilson Dirac operator as an element of the $K^1$ group, which is characterized by the $\eta$-invariant. Furthermore, we prove that, at sufficiently small but finite lattice spacings, this $\eta$-invariant equals to the index of the continuum Dirac operator. Our results indicate that the Ginsparg-Wilson relation and the associated exact chiral symmetry are not essential for understanding gauge field topology in lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Universality in quantum critical flow of charge and heat in ultra-clean graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Close to the Dirac point, graphene is expected to exist in quantum critical Dirac fluid state, where the flow of both charge and heat can be described with a dc electrical conductivity $\sigma_\mathrm{Q}$, and thermodynamic variables such as the entropy and enthalpy densities. Although the fluid-like viscous flow of charge is frequently reported in state-of-the-art graphene devices, the value of $\sigma_\mathrm{Q}$, predicted to be quantized and determined only by the universality class of the critical point, has not been established experimentally so far. Here we have discerned the quantum critical universality in graphene transport by combining the electrical ($\sigma$) and thermal ($\kappa_\mathrm{e}$) conductivities in very high-quality devices close to the Dirac point. We find that $\sigma$ and $\kappa_\mathrm{e}$ are inversely related, as expected from relativistic hydrodynamics, and $\sigma_\mathrm{Q}$ converges to $\approx (4\pm 1)\times e^2/h$ for multiple devices, where $e$ and $h$ are the electronic charge and the Planck's constant, respectively. We also observe, (1) a giant violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law where the effective Lorentz number exceeds the semiclassical value by more than 200 times close to the Dirac point at low temperatures, and (2) the effective dynamic viscosity ($\eta_\mathrm{th}$) in the thermal regime approaches the holographic limit $\eta_\mathrm{th}/s_\mathrm{th} \rightarrow \hbar/4\pi k_\mathrm{B}$ within a factor of four in the cleanest devices close to the room temperature, where $s_\mathrm{th}$ and $k_\mathrm{B}$ are the thermal entropy density and the Boltzmann constant, respectively. Our experiment addresses the missing piece in the potential of high-quality graphene as a testing bed for some of the unifying concepts in physics.</description>

      <title>Exhaustive Characterization of Quantum Many-Body Scars using Commutant Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Quantum Many-Body Scars (QMBS) in the language of commutant algebras, which are defined as symmetry algebras of families of local Hamiltonians. This framework explains the origin of dynamically disconnected subspaces seen in models with exact QMBS, i.e., the large "thermal" subspace and the small "non-thermal" subspace, which are attributed to the existence of unconventional non-local conserved quantities in the commutant; hence this unifies the study of conventional symmetries and weak ergodicity breaking phenomena into a single framework. Furthermore, this language enables us to use the von Neumann Double Commutant Theorem (DCT) to formally write down the exhaustive algebra of all Hamiltonians with a desired set of QMBS, which demonstrates that QMBS survive under large classes of local perturbations. We illustrate this using several standard examples of QMBS, including the spin-1/2 ferromagnetic, AKLT, spin-1 XY $\pi$-bimagnon, and the electronic $\eta$-pairing towers of states; and in each of these cases we explicitly write down a set of generators for the full algebra of Hamiltonians with these QMBS.Understanding this hidden structure in QMBS Hamiltonians also allows us to recover results of previous "brute-force" numerical searches for such Hamiltonians. In addition, this language clearly demonstrates the equivalence of several unified formalisms for QMBS proposed in the literature, and also illustrates the connection between two apparently distinct classes of QMBS Hamiltonians -- those that are captured by the so-called Shiraishi-Mori construction, and those that lie beyond. Finally, we show that this framework motivates a precise definition for QMBS that automatically implies that they violate the conventional Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH), and we discuss its implications to dynamics.</description>

      <title>Heavy-fermions in frustrated Hund's metal with portions of incipient flat-bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat-bands induced by destructive interference of hoppings in frustrated lattices such as kagome metals, have been extensively studied in recent years. However, such flat-bands usually appear in small portions of Brillouin zone and are away from Fermi level in the non-interacting limit (dubbed as ``incipient"). Whether such incipient flat-band portions can induce very strong electron correlations is an open question. Recently, such incipient flat-bands are found in frustrated kagome CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ and triangular CrB$_2$, which show moderately heavy-fermion behaviors and unconventional superconductivity. Here, by density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory calculations, we show that both compounds are typical Hund's metals. The incipient flat-band portions induce dips in hybridization functions, which further enhance the Kondo-like effect of Hund's metal, resulting in moderately heavy-fermion behaviors. This explains the origin of the heavy-fermion behaviors and pave the way for understanding the unconventional superconductivity in CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$ and CrB$_2$. Our work demonstrates a flexible route for generating $d$-electron heavy-fermion and for inducing unconventional superconductivity based on frustrated Hund's metals with portions of incipient flat-bands. A large family of materials with kagome, triangular, pyrochlore lattices consisting of Cr (d$^4$), Ru (d$^4$), Fe (d$^6$) ions are promising candidates.</description>

      <title>Massive Higher-Spin Fields in the Fractional Quantum Hall Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incompressibility plays a key role in the geometric description of fractional quantum Hall fluids. It is naturally related to quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms and the underlying Girvin-MacDonald-Plazman algebra, which gives rise to an emergent non-relativistic massive spin-2 mode propagating in the bulk. The corresponding metric tensor can be identified with a nematic order parameter for the bulk states. In the linearised regime with a flat background, it has been shown that this mode can be described by a spin-2 Schroedinger action. However, quantum area-preserving diffeomorphisms also suggest the existence of higher-spin modes that cannot be described through nematic fractional quantum Hall states. Here, we consider p-atic Hall phases, in which the corresponding p-atic order parameters are related to higher-rank symmetric tensors. We then show that in this framework, non-relativistic massive chiral higher-spin fields naturally emerge and that their dynamics is described by higher-spin Schroedinger actions. We finally show that these effective actions can be derived from relativistic massive higher-spin theories in 2+1 dimensions after taking a non-relativistic limit.</description>

Abstract: We present a detailed theoretical study of Pt3Sn2S2 a layered kagome type material inspired by recent investigation of Co3Sn2S2 reported in [Nature Communication 11, 3985 (2020) whose physical properties remain largely unexplored. Thermodynamic stability was confirmed via formation energy calculations while mechanical stability was evaluated using Voigt Reuss Hill approximation and elastic stability condition. Dynamical and thermal stability were validated through Phonon dispersion and Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics simulations with Pughs criterion classifying the material as ductile. Spin orbit coupling induced band splitting, giving rise to Weyl points and a Weyl semimetal phase accompanied by a SOC driven transition from non relativistic band touching to relativistic band touching making a topological phase shift. Under applied pressure, the coupling of spin and valley degrees of freedom generates spin valley intertwined Dirac cones enabling tunable electronic properties for spintronic and valleytronic applications. Boltzman transport calculations using AMSET reveal a high Seebeck coefficient with SOC and low thermal conductivity highlighting its potential for high performance thermoelectric devices.</description>

Abstract: The multi-scale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA) is a hierarchical class of tensor network states motivated by the real-space renormalization group. It is used to simulate strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. For prominent MERA structures in one and two spatial dimensions and different optimization strategies, we determine the optimal scaling of contraction costs as well as corresponding contraction sequences and algorithmic phase diagrams. This is motivated by recent efforts to employ MERA in hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, where the MERA tensors are Trotterized, i.e., chosen as circuits of quantum gates, and observables as well as energy gradients are evaluated by sampling causal-cone states. We investigate whether tensor Trotterization and/or variational Monte Carlo (VMC) sampling can lead to quantum-inspired classical MERA algorithms that perform better than the traditional optimization of full MERA based on the exact evaluation of energy gradients. Algorithmic phase diagrams indicate the best MERA method depending on the scaling of the energy accuracy and the optimal number of Trotter steps with the bond dimension. The results suggest substantial gains due to VMC for two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an approach for evaluating Wannier functions, offering an alternative perspective on their role in many-body systems. Unlike traditional methods, such as the maximally localized Wannier functions approach, which focuses on minimizing the function tails, our approach emphasizes these tails. Using perturbative analytical approximations and extensive numerical simulations on an exactly solvable model, we address nonstandard Hubbard terms and demonstrate their critical influence on many-body dynamics. Specifically, we study tunneling dynamics in arbitrary double-well potentials, moving beyond the standard Hubbard model to include nonstandard terms such as density-induced tunneling and pair tunneling. Our results reveal that these terms significantly modify the dynamics predicted by the standard Hubbard model: density-induced tunneling modifies the single-particle tunneling parameter $\Omega_0$, while pair tunneling enables coherent propagation not captured by the standard model. We show that the discrepancies between the standard and nonstandard Hubbard models grow with increasing interaction strength, potentially leading to novel transport behaviors. However, at lower interaction strengths, both models converge, as nonstandard terms become negligible. These findings have important implications for phenomena such as superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene and metal-insulator transitions. Our model aligns well with numerical simulations of lowest-band parameters and is strongly supported by experimental observations of second-order atom tunneling in optical double-well potentials. This strong agreement with experimental data highlights the accuracy and potential of our approach in providing a more comprehensive framework for describing complex many-body systems than the standard Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Fractional Quantum Hall Effect Based on Weyl Orbits</title>

Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect is a well-known demonstration of strongly correlated topological phases in two dimensions. However, the extension of this phenomenon into a three-dimensional context has yet to be achieved. Recently, the three-dimensional integer quantum Hall effect based on Weyl orbits has been experimentally observed in a topological semimetallic material under a magnetic field. This motivates us to ask whether the Weyl orbits can give rise to the fractional quantum Hall effect when their Landau level is partially filled in the presence of interactions. Here we theoretically demonstrate that the fractional quantum Hall states based on Weyl orbits can emerge in a Weyl semimetal when a Landau level is one-third filled. Using concrete models for Weyl semimetals in magnetic fields, we project the Coulomb interaction onto a single Landau level from the Weyl orbit and find that the ground state of the many-body Hamiltoian is triply degenerate. We further show that the ground states exhibit the many-body Chern number of $1/3$ and the uniform occupation of electrons in both momentum and real space, implying that they are the fractional quantum Hall states. In contrast to the two-dimensional case, the states are spatially localized on two surfaces hosting Fermi arcs. Additionally, our findings suggest that the excitation properties of these states resemble those of the Laughlin state in two dimensions, as inferred from the particle entanglement spectrum of the ground states.</description>

      <title>Topological superconductivity in a spin-orbit coupled Kondo lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the effect of spin-orbit coupling on a two-dimensional Kondo Lattice model, in which conduction electrons are antiferromagnetically coupled to a Yao-Lee spin liquid. When a Rashba spin-orbit interaction and a nearest-neighbor Kondo interaction is introduced, the low-energy Majorana bands become gapped and develop Chern numbers, protecting unidirectionally propagating Majorana edge modes. Our model describes a chiral topological superconductor with fractionalized charge-$e$ order parameter and spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry, which may be of interest for certain heavy fermion superconductors, such as UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Boundary Criticality in the 2d Random Quantum Ising Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The edge of a quantum critical system can exhibit multiple distinct types of boundary criticality. We use a numerical real-space renormalization group (RSRG) to study the boundary criticality of a 2d quantum Ising model with random exchange couplings and transverse fields, whose bulk exhibits an infinite randomness critical point. This approach enables an asymptotically numerically exact extraction of universal scaling data from very large systems with many thousands of spins that cannot be efficiently simulated directly. We identify three distinct classes of boundary criticality, and extract key scaling exponents governing boundary-boundary and boundary-bulk correlations and dynamics. We anticipate that this approach can be generalized to studying a broad class of (disordered) boundary criticality, including symmetry-enriched criticality and edge modes of gapless symmetry-protected topological states, in contexts were other numerical methods are restricted to one-dimensional chains.</description>

      <title>Machine learning with tree tensor networks, CP rank constraints, and tensor dropout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks developed in the context of condensed matter physics try to approximate order-$N$ tensors with a reduced number of degrees of freedom that is only polynomial in $N$ and arranged as a network of partially contracted smaller tensors. As we have recently demonstrated in the context of quantum many-body physics, computation costs can be further substantially reduced by imposing constraints on the canonical polyadic (CP) rank of the tensors in such networks [arXiv:2205.15296]. Here, we demonstrate how tree tensor networks (TTN) with CP rank constraints and tensor dropout can be used in machine learning. The approach is found to outperform other tensor-network-based methods in Fashion-MNIST image classification. A low-rank TTN classifier with branching ratio $b=4$ reaches a test set accuracy of 90.3\% with low computation costs. Consisting of mostly linear elements, tensor network classifiers avoid the vanishing gradient problem of deep neural networks. The CP rank constraints have additional advantages: The number of parameters can be decreased and tuned more freely to control overfitting, improve generalization properties, and reduce computation costs. They allow us to employ trees with large branching ratios, substantially improving the representation power.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02763v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent development of logical quantum processors marks a pivotal transition from the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era to the fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) era. These devices have the potential to address classically challenging problems with polynomial computational time using quantum properties. However, they remain susceptible to noise, necessitating noise resilient algorithms. We introduce Quantum Zeno Monte Carlo (QZMC), a classical-quantum hybrid algorithm that demonstrates resilience to device noise and Trotter errors while showing polynomial computational cost for a gapped system. QZMC computes static and dynamic properties without requiring initial state overlap or variational parameters, offering reduced quantum circuit depth.</description>

      <title>Chiral Virasoro algebra from a single wavefunction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chiral edges of 2+1D systems can have very robust emergent conformal symmetry. When the edge is purely chiral, the Hilbert space of low-energy edge excitations can form a representation of a single Virasoro algebra. We propose a method to systematically extract the generators of the Virasoro algebra from a single ground state wavefunction, using entanglement bootstrap and an input from the edge conformal field theory. We corroborate our construction by numerically verifying the commutation relations of the generators. We also study the unitary flows generated by these operators, whose properties (such as energy and state overlap) are shown numerically to agree with our analytical predictions.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Nonlinear Responses in Moving Charge Density Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The incommensurate charge density wave states (CDWs) can exhibit steady motion in the flow limit after depinning, behaving as a nonequilibrium system with time-dependent states. Since the moving CDW, like an electric current, breaks both time-reversal and inversion symmetries, one may speculate the emergence of nonreciprocal nonlinear responses from such motion. However, the moving CDW order parameter is intrinsically time-dependent in the lab frame, and it is known to be challenging to evaluate the responses of such a time-varying system. In this work, following the principle of Galilean relativity, we resolve this time-dependent hard problem in the lab frame by mapping the system to the comoving frame with static CDW states through the Galilean transformation. We explicitly show that the nonreciprocal nonlinear responses would be generated by the movement of CDW states through violating Galilean relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19411v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multiscalar theories with $\text{O}(N) \times \text{O}(2)$ symmetry. These models have a stable fixed point in $d$ dimensions if $N$ is greater than some critical value $N_c(d)$. Previous estimates of this critical value from perturbative and non-perturbative renormalization group methods have produced mutually incompatible results. We use numerical conformal bootstrap methods to constrain $N_c(d)$ for $3 \leq d &lt; 4$. Our results show that $N_c&gt; 3.78$ for $d = 3$. This favors the scenario that the physically relevant models with $N = 2,3$ in $d=3$ do not have a stable fixed point, indicating a first-order transition. Our result exemplifies how conformal windows can be rigorously constrained with modern numerical bootstrap algorithms.</description>

      <title>Random unitaries in extremely low depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that random quantum circuits on any geometry, including a 1D line, can form approximate unitary designs over $n$ qubits in $\log n$ depth. In a similar manner, we construct pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) in 1D circuits in $\text{poly}(\log n)$ depth, and in all-to-all-connected circuits in $\text{poly}(\log \log n)$ depth. In all three cases, the $n$ dependence is optimal and improves exponentially over known results. These shallow quantum circuits have low complexity and create only short-range entanglement, yet are indistinguishable from unitaries with exponential complexity. Our construction glues local random unitaries on $\log n$-sized or $\text{poly}(\log n)$-sized patches of qubits to form a global random unitary on all $n$ qubits. In the case of designs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing constructions of approximate unitary $k$-designs, and hence also inherit an optimal scaling in $k$. In the case of PRUs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing PRU constructions. Applications of our results include proving that classical shadows with 1D log-depth Clifford circuits are as powerful as those with deep circuits, demonstrating superpolynomial quantum advantage in learning low-complexity physical systems, and establishing quantum hardness for recognizing phases of matter with topological order.</description>

      <title>Exact projected entangled pair ground states with topological Euler invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on a class of gapped projected entangled pair states (PEPS) with non-trivial Euler topology motivated by recent progress in band geometry. In the non-interacting limit, these systems have optimal conditions relating to saturation of quantum geometrical bounds, allowing for parent Hamiltonians whose lowest bands are completely flat and which have the PEPS as unique ground states. Protected by crystalline symmetries, these states evade restrictions on capturing tenfold-way topological features with gapped PEPS. These PEPS thus form the first tensor network representative of a non-interacting, gapped two-dimensional topological phase, similar to the Kitaev chain in one dimension. Using unitary circuits, we then formulate interacting variants of these PEPS and corresponding gapped parent Hamiltonians. We reveal characteristic entanglement features shared between the free-fermionic and interacting states with Euler topology. Our results hence provide a rich platform of PEPS models that have, unexpectedly, a finite topological invariant, forming the basis for new spin liquids, quantum Hall physics, and quantum information pursuits.</description>

      <title>Flat Bands and Compact Localised States: A Carrollian roadmap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how Carrollian symmetries become important in the construction of one-dimensional fermionic systems with all flat-band spectra from first principles. The key ingredient of this construction is the identification of Compact Localised States (CLSs), which appear naturally by demanding $\textit{supertranslation}$ invariance of the system. We use CLS basis states, with inherent $\textit{ultra-local}$ correlations, to write down an interacting theory which shows a non-trivial phase structure and an emergent Carroll conformal symmetry at the gapless points. We analyze this theory in detail for both zero and finite chemical potential.</description>
