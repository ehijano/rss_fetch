      <title>AnyMatch -- Efficient Zero-Shot Entity Matching with a Small Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entity matching (EM) is the problem of determining whether two records refer to same real-world entity, which is crucial in data integration, e.g., for product catalogs or address databases. A major drawback of many EM approaches is their dependence on labelled examples. We thus focus on the challenging setting of zero-shot entity matching where no labelled examples are available for an unseen target dataset. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results for zero-shot EM, but their low throughput and high deployment cost limit their applicability and scalability.
  We revisit the zero-shot EM problem with AnyMatch, a small language model fine-tuned in a transfer learning setup. We propose several novel data selection techniques to generate fine-tuning data for our model, e.g., by selecting difficult pairs to match via an AutoML filter, by generating additional attribute-level examples, and by controlling label imbalance in the data.
  We conduct an extensive evaluation of the prediction quality and deployment cost of our model, in a comparison to thirteen baselines on nine benchmark datasets. We find that AnyMatch provides competitive prediction quality despite its small parameter size: it achieves the second-highest F1 score overall, and outperforms several other approaches that employ models with hundreds of billions of parameters. Furthermore, our approach exhibits major cost benefits: the average prediction quality of AnyMatch is within 4.4% of the state-of-the-art method MatchGPT with the proprietary trillion-parameter model GPT-4, yet AnyMatch requires four orders of magnitude less parameters and incurs a 3,899 times lower inference cost (in dollars per 1,000 tokens).</description>

      <title>Towards Privacy-Preserving Relational Data Synthesis via Probabilistic Relational Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic relational models provide a well-established formalism to combine first-order logic and probabilistic models, thereby allowing to represent relationships between objects in a relational domain. At the same time, the field of artificial intelligence requires increasingly large amounts of relational training data for various machine learning tasks. Collecting real-world data, however, is often challenging due to privacy concerns, data protection regulations, high costs, and so on. To mitigate these challenges, the generation of synthetic data is a promising approach. In this paper, we solve the problem of generating synthetic relational data via probabilistic relational models. In particular, we propose a fully-fledged pipeline to go from relational database to probabilistic relational model, which can then be used to sample new synthetic relational data points from its underlying probability distribution. As part of our proposed pipeline, we introduce a learning algorithm to construct a probabilistic relational model from a given relational database.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Topic Classification of Column Headers: Leveraging LLMs for Metadata Enrichment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional dataset retrieval systems rely on metadata for indexing, rather than on the underlying data values. However, high-quality metadata creation and enrichment often require manual annotations, which is a labour-intensive and challenging process to automate. In this study, we propose a method to support metadata enrichment using topic annotations generated by three Large Language Models (LLMs): ChatGPT-3.5, GoogleBard, and GoogleGemini. Our analysis focuses on classifying column headers based on domain-specific topics from the Consortium of European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA), a Linked Data controlled vocabulary. Our approach operates in a zero-shot setting, integrating the controlled topic vocabulary directly within the input prompt. This integration serves as a Large Context Windows approach, with the aim of improving the results of the topic classification task.
  We evaluated the performance of the LLMs in terms of internal consistency, inter-machine alignment, and agreement with human classification. Additionally, we investigate the impact of contextual information (i.e., dataset description) on the classification outcomes. Our findings suggest that ChatGPT and GoogleGemini outperform GoogleBard in terms of internal consistency as well as LLM-human-agreement. Interestingly, we found that contextual information had no significant impact on LLM performance.
  This work proposes a novel approach that leverages LLMs for topic classification of column headers using a controlled vocabulary, presenting a practical application of LLMs and Large Context Windows within the Semantic Web domain. This approach has the potential to facilitate automated metadata enrichment, thereby enhancing dataset retrieval and the Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) of research data on the Web.</description>
