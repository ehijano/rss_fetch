      <title>A Python Toolkit for Plotting Double Star Observations with 1:1 Aspect Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate visualization of double star astrometric data is essential for effective analysis and interpretation. This article presents a Python toolkit designed for astronomers who need to plot measurements from diverse sources -- historical, Gaia DR3, and the Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) network -- while maintaining a 1:1 aspect ratio to avoid visually distorting the data. The toolkit is composed of three scripts: one that handles polar coordinates (P.A., separation), one for Cartesian (X, Y) coordinates, and another with the option to include predicted theoretical points. This paper describes the purpose, functionality, and usage of these scripts, including example figures, installation guides, and licensing information.
  This toolkit has been used by the author and collaborators in published and submitted research on double star systems, demonstrating its versatility for both professional and student-driven investigations.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of EAS directions based on TAIGA HiSCORE data using fully connected neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direction of extensive air showers can be used to determine the source of gamma quanta and plays an important role in estimating the energy of the primary particle. The data from an array of non-imaging Cherenkov detector stations HiSCORE in the TAIGA experiment registering the number of photoelectrons and detection time can be used to estimate the shower direction with high accuracy. In this work, we use artificial neural networks trained on Monte Carlo-simulated TAIGA HiSCORE data for gamma quanta to obtain shower direction estimates. The neural networks are multilayer perceptrons with skip connections using partial data from several HiSCORE stations as inputs; composite estimates are derived from multiple individual estimates by the neural networks. We apply a two-stage algorithm in which the direction estimates obtained in the first stage are used to transform the input data and refine the estimates. The mean error of the final estimates is less than 0.25 degrees. The approach will be used for multimodal analysis of the data from several types of detectors used in the TAIGA experiment.</description>

      <title>A crude but efficient pipeline for JWST MIRI imager : the case of sn1987A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most of the space projects or large observatories do have official tools like simulators, end-to-end pipelines developed during years by a large team of contributors. They are like {\em cathedrals}. In this paper, we show that very simplistic code using basic operators provided by high level language like GDL allows to write quickly high quality code to process raw data into scientifically validated outputs. This is {\em bazaar}.
  In this paper we argument why we consider large infrastructure should be designed to allow small ones to benefit from it and allow to graft better alternative processing at very low cost.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a TES-based Anti-Coincidence Detector for Future Large Field-of-View X-ray Calorimetry Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microcalorimeter instruments aboard future X-ray observatories will require an anti-coincidence (anti-co) detector to veto charged particle events and reduce the non-X-ray background. We have developed a large-format, TES-based prototype anti-coincidence detector that is particularly suitable for use with spatially-extended (~ 10 cm^2}) TES microcalorimeter arrays, as would be used for a future large field-of-view X-ray missions. This prototype was developed in the context of the Line Emission Mapper (LEM) probe concept, which required a ~ 14 cm^2 anti-co detector with &gt; 95% live time and a low-energy threshold below 20 keV. Our anti-co design employs parallel networks of quasiparticle-trap-assisted electrothermal feedback TESs (QETs) to detect the athermal phonon signal produced in the detector substrate by incident charged particles. We developed multiple prototype anti-co designs featuring 12 channels and up to 6300 QETs. Here we focus on a design utilizing tungsten TESs and present characterization results. Broad energy range measurements have been performed (4.1 keV -- 5.5 MeV). Based on noise and responsivity measurements, the implied low-energy threshold is &lt; 1 keV and a live time fraction of &gt; 96% can be achieved up to 5.5 MeV. We also find evidence of mm-scale-or-better spatial resolution and discuss the potential utility of this for future missions. Finally, we discuss the early development of a soild-state physics model of the anti-co towards understanding phonon propagation and quasiparticle production in the detector.</description>

      <title>NGC 3259: A Signal for an Untapped Population of Slowly Accreting Intermediate-Mass Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-mass active galactic nuclei (AGNs) can provide important constraints on the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a central challenge in modern cosmology. To date only small samples of intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs, $M_{BH}&lt;10^5M_{\odot}$) and 'lesser' supermassive black holes (LSMBHs, $M_{BH}&lt;10^6M_{\odot}$) have been identified. Our present study of NGC 3259 at D=27 Mpc with the Binospec integral field unit spectrograph complemented with Keck Echelle Spectrograph and Imager observations demonstrates the need for and the power of the spectroscopic follow-up. NGC 3259 hosts a black hole with a mass of $M_{BH}=(1.7-4.1)\times10^5M_{\odot}$, inferred from multi-epoch spectroscopic data, that accretes at 1% of the Eddington limit as suggested by the analysis of archival XMM-Newton observations. It is the second nearest low-mass AGN after the archetypal galaxy NGC 4395. The spectroscopic data reveals a variable broad $H\alpha$ profile that is likely the result of asymmetrically distributed broad-line region (BLR) clouds or BLR outflow events. X-ray observations and the absence of an optical power-law continuum suggest partial obscuration of the accretion disk and hot corona by a dust torus. We estimate that the Sloan Digital Sky Survey could only detect similar objects to D=35 Mpc. A detailed photometric analysis of NGC 3259 using HST images provides a central spheroid stellar mass estimate 25 times lower than expected from the $M_{BH}-M^*_{sph}$ relation, making this galaxy a strong outlier. This discrepancy suggests divergent growth pathways for the central black hole and spheroid, potentially influenced by the presence of a bar in the galaxy. Finally, we demonstrate that the DESI and 4MOST surveys will detect low-accretion rate IMBHs and LSMBHs and the sensitivity of future X-ray instruments (such as AXIS and Athena) will secure their classification.</description>

      <title>Astrometry, orbit determination, and thermal inertia of the Tianwen-2 target asteroid (469219) Kamo`oalewa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. (469219) Kamo`oalewa is a small near-Earth asteroid, which is currently a quasi-satellite of the Earth. Lightcurve measurements also reveal a rotation period of only about 30 minutes. This asteroid has been selected as the target of the Tianwen-2 sample-return mission of the China National Space Administration.
  Aims. The first goal of this paper is to observe and improve the orbit determination of (469219) Kamo`oalewa, and better determine the Yarkovsky effect acting on it. The second goal is to estimate the thermal inertia of the asteroid, taking advantage of an improved Yarkovsky effect determination.
  Methods. Our observational campaign imaged the asteroid from the Loiano Astronomical Station and from the Calar Alto Observatory, in March 2024. We also accurately re-measured a precovery detection from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey from 2004. New astrometry was later used in a 7-dimensional orbit determination, aimed at estimating both the orbital elements and the Yarkovsky effect. Thermal inertia is later studied by using the ASTERIA, a new method that is suitable to estimate thermal inertia of small asteroids.
  Results. We detected a semi-major axis drift of $(-67.35 \pm 4.70) \times 10^{-4}$ au My$^{-1}$ due to the Yarkovsky effect, with a high signal-to-noise ratio of 14. The new orbit solution also significantly reduced the position uncertainty for the arrival of the Tianwen-2 spacecraft. By using different models for the physical parameters of Kamo`oalewa, the ASTERIA model estimated the thermal inertia at $\Gamma = 150^{+90}_{-45}$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$ or $\Gamma = 181^{+95}_{-60}$ J m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ s$^{-1/2}$.</description>

      <title>SEW: A full-spectrum linear fitting with stellar population synthesis method Based on "Equivalent Widths spectrum"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a full-spectrum linear fitting method, SEW, for stellar population synthesis based on equivalent widths (EWs) to extract galaxy properties from observed spectra. This approach eliminates the need for prior assumptions about dust attenuation curves, which are instead derived as outputs of the fitting process. By leveraging the invariance of EWs and employing the Discrete Penalised Least Squares (DPLS) method to extract EWs, we address the nonlinear aspects of the fitting process by linearising the matrix equations. This enables accurate recovery of key parameters, stellar age, metallicity and dust attenuation, even under systematic calibration biases and varying attenuation conditions. Rigorous testing with mock spectra across signal-to-noise ratios (S/N = 5-30) and calibration biases demonstrates the robustness of method. The derived attenuation curves align closely with input models, and stellar population parameters are recovered with minimal bias. To facilitate adoption, we implement this method as a Python extension package for \texttt{pPXF} (\texttt{pPXF-SEW}). Our work addresses critical degeneracies in traditional spectral fitting and enhances the reliability of extragalactic studies.</description>

      <title>The T16 Project: Image Subtraction Light Curves from TESS Cycle 1 Full-Frame Images for Stars with T &lt; 16</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present 83,717,159 light curves for 56,401,549 stars with T &lt; 16 mag observed in the Full-Frame Images (FFIs) of Cycle 1 of the NASA TESS mission. These light curves were extracted from subtracted images produced by the Cluster Difference Imaging Survey (CDIPS; Bouma et al. 2019). We make public the raw image subtraction light curves, together with light curves detrended against instrumental systematics. We compare the light curves to other publicly available light curves from the TESS FFIs, finding that for a substantial fraction of stars with T &lt; 16, the T16 project provides the highest precision FFI light curves available. We demonstrate that the detrended T16 light curves are generally as good as, or better than, the light curves from other projects for the known TOIs. We also show that the un-detrended light curves can be used to study high amplitude variable stars. The light curves are being made available through the NASA Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST). Light curve production is underway for additional TESS Cycles.</description>

      <title>PINN ME: A Physics-Informed Neural Network Framework for Accurate Milne-Eddington Inversions of Solar Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectropolarimetric inversions of solar observations are fundamental for the estimation of the magnetic field in the solar atmosphere. However, instrumental noise, computational requirements, and varying levels of physical realism make it challenging to derive reliable solar magnetic field estimates. In this study, we present a novel approach for spectropolarimetric inversions based on Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to infer the photospheric magnetic field under the Milne-Eddington approximation (PINN ME). Our model acts as a representation of the parameter space, mapping input coordinates (t, x, y) to the respective spectropolarimetric parameters, which are used to synthesize the corresponding stokes profiles. By iteratively sampling coordinate points, synthesizing profiles, and minimizing the deviation from the observed stokes profiles, our method can find the set of Milne-Eddington parameters that best fit the observations. In addition, we directly include the point-spread-function to account for instrumental effects. We use a predefined parameter space as well as synthetic profiles from a radiative MHD simulation to evaluate the performance of our method and to estimate the impact of instrumental noise. Our results demonstrate that PINN ME achieves an intrinsic spatio-temporal coupling, which can largely mitigate observational noise and provides a memory-efficient inversion even for extended fields-of-view. Finally, we apply our method to observations and show that our method provides a high spatial coherence and can resolve small-scale features both in strong- and weak-field regions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Peer Review in Astronomy: A Machine Learning and Optimization Approach to Reviewer Assignments for ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing volume of papers and proposals that undergo peer review emphasizes the pressing need for greater automation to effectively manage the growing scale. In this study, we present the deployment and evaluation of machine learning and optimization techniques to assign proposals to reviewers that were developed for the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) during the Cycle 10 Call for Proposals issued in 2023. Using topic modeling algorithms, we identify the proposal topics and assess reviewers' expertise based on their previous ALMA proposal submissions. We then apply an adapted version of the assignment optimization algorithm from PeerReview4All (Stelmakh et al. 2021) to maximize the alignment between proposal topics and reviewer expertise. Our evaluation shows a significant improvement in matching reviewer expertise: the median similarity score between the proposal topic and reviewer expertise increased by 51 percentage points compared to the previous cycle, and the percentage of reviewers reporting expertise in their assigned proposals rose by 20 percentage points. Furthermore, the assignment process proved highly effective in that no proposals required reassignment due to significant mismatches, resulting in a savings of 3 to 5 days of manual effort.</description>

      <title>Machine-assisted classification of potential biosignatures in earth-like exoplanets using low signal-to-noise ratio transmission spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for atmospheric biosignatures in Earth-like exoplanets is one of the most pressing challenges in observational astrobiology. Detecting biogenic gases in terrestrial planets requires high-resolution observations and long integration times. In this work, we developed and tested a general machine-learning methodology designed to classify transmission spectra with low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) according to their potential to contain biosignatures or bioindicators. To achieve this, we trained a set of models capable of classifying noisy transmission spectra (including stellar contamination) as containing methane, ozone, and/or water (multilabel classification), or simply as being interesting for follow-up observations (binary classification). The models were trained using $\sim10^7$ synthetic spectra of planets similar to TRAPPIST-1 e, generated with the package MultiREx. The trained algorithms correctly classified most of the test planets with transmission spectra having an SNR as low as 4, containing methane and/or ozone at mixing ratios similar to those of modern and Proterozoic Earth. Tests on realistic synthetic spectra, based on the current Earth's atmosphere, indicate that some of our models would classify most inhabited terrestrial planets observed with JWST/NIRSpec PRISM around M-dwarfs at distances similar to or smaller than that of TRAPPIST-1 e as likely to contain bioindicators, using 4 to 10 transits. These results have significant implications for the design of observing programs and future campaigns. Machine-assisted strategies, such as the one presented here, could greatly optimize the use of JWST resources for biosignature and bioindicator searches, while maximizing the chances of a real discovery through dedicated follow-up observations of promising candidates.</description>

      <title>ExoMiner++ on TESS with Transfer Learning from Kepler: Transit Classification and Vetting Catalog for 2-min Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present ExoMiner++, an enhanced deep learning model that builds on the success of ExoMiner to improve transit signal classification in 2-minute TESS data. ExoMiner++ incorporates additional diagnostic inputs, including periodogram, flux trend, difference image, unfolded flux, and spacecraft attitude control data, all of which are crucial for effectively distinguishing transit signals from more challenging sources of false positives. To further enhance performance, we leverage transfer learning from high-quality labeled data from the Kepler space telescope, mitigating the impact of TESS's noisier and more ambiguous labels. ExoMiner++ achieves high accuracy across various classification and ranking metrics, significantly narrowing the search space for follow-up investigations to confirm new planets. To serve the exoplanet community, we introduce new TESS catalogs containing ExoMiner++ classifications and confidence scores for each transit signal. Among the 147,568 unlabeled TCEs, ExoMiner++ identifies 7,330 as planet candidates, with the remainder classified as false positives. These 7,330 planet candidates correspond to 1,868 existing TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs), 69 Community TESS Objects of Interest (CTOIs), and 50 newly introduced CTOIs. 1,797 out of the 2,506 TOIs previously labeled as planet candidates in ExoFOP are classified as planet candidates by ExoMiner++. This reduction in plausible candidates combined with the excellent ranking quality of ExoMiner++ allows the follow-up efforts to be focused on the most likely candidates, increasing the overall planet yield.</description>
