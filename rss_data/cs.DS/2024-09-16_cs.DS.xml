      <title>An efficient heuristic for approximate maximum flow computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several concepts borrowed from graph theory are routinely used to better understand the inner workings of the (human) brain. To this end, a connectivity network of the brain is built first, which then allows one to assess quantities such as information flow and information routing via shortest path and maximum flow computations. Since brain networks typically contain several thousand nodes and edges, computational scaling is a key research area. In this contribution, we focus on approximate maximum flow computations in large brain networks. By combining graph partitioning with maximum flow computations, we propose a new approximation algorithm for the computation of the maximum flow with runtime O(|V||E|^2/k^2) compared to the usual runtime of O(|V||E|^2) for the Edmonds-Karp algorithm, where $V$ is the set of vertices, $E$ is the set of edges, and $k$ is the number of partitions. We assess both accuracy and runtime of the proposed algorithm on simulated graphs as well as on graphs downloaded from the Brain Networks Data Repository (https://networkrepository.com).</description>

      <title>A Simple 4-Approximation Algorithm for Maximum Agreement Forests on Multiple Unrooted Binary Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple 4-approximation algorithm for computing a maximum agreement forest of multiple unrooted binary trees. This algorithm applies LP rounding to an extension of a recent ILP formulation of the maximum agreement forest problem on two trees by Van Wersch al. We achieve the same approximation ratio as the algorithm of Chen et al. but our algorithm is extremely simple. We also prove that no algorithm based on the ILP formulation by Van Wersch et al. can achieve an approximation ratio of $4 - \varepsilon$, for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, even on two trees. To this end, we prove that the integrality gap of the ILP approaches 4 as the size of the two input trees grows.</description>

      <title>Vertex identification to a forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a graph class and $k\in\mathbb{N}$. We say a graph $G$ admits a \emph{$k$-identification to $\mathcal{H}$} if there is a partition $\mathcal{P}$ of some set $X\subseteq V(G)$ of size at most $k$ such that after identifying each part in $\mathcal{P}$ to a single vertex, the resulting graph belongs to $\mathcal{H}$. The graph parameter ${\sf id}_{\mathcal{H}}$ is defined so that ${\sf id}_{\mathcal{H}}(G)$ is the minimum $k$ such that $G$ admits a $k$-identification to $\mathcal{H}$, and the problem of \textsc{Identification to $\mathcal{H}$} asks, given a graph $G$ and $k\in\mathbb{N}$, whether ${\sf id}_{\mathcal{H}}(G)\le k$. If we set $\mathcal{H}$ to be the class $\mathcal{F}$ of acyclic graphs, we generate the problem \textsc{Identification to Forest}, which we show to be {\sf NP}-complete. We prove that, when parameterized by the size $k$ of the identification set, it admits a kernel of size $2k+1$. For our kernel we reveal a close relation of \textsc{Identification to Forest} with the \textsc{Vertex Cover} problem. We also study the combinatorics of the \textsf{yes}-instances of \textsc{Identification to $\mathcal{H}$}, i.e., the class $\mathcal{H}^{(k)}:=\{G\mid {\sf id}_{\mathcal{H}}(G)\le k\}$, {which we show to be minor-closed for every $k$} when $\mathcal{H}$ is minor-closed. We prove that the minor-obstructions of $\mathcal{F}^{(k)}$ are of size at most $2k+4$. We also prove that every graph $G$ such that ${\sf id}_{\mathcal{F}}(G)$ is sufficiently big contains as a minor either a cycle on $k$ vertices, or $k$ disjoint triangles, or the \emph{$k$-marguerite} graph, that is the graph obtained by $k$ disjoint triangles by identifying one vertex of each of them into the same vertex.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Local PageRank Estimation on Undirected Graphs: Simple and Optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a simple and optimal algorithm, BackMC, for local PageRank estimation in undirected graphs: given an arbitrary target node $t$ in an undirected graph $G$ comprising $n$ nodes and $m$ edges, BackMC accurately estimates the PageRank score of node $t$ while assuring a small relative error and a high success probability. The worst-case computational complexity of BackMC is upper bounded by $O\left(\frac{1}{d_{\mathrm{min}}}\cdot \min\left(d_t, m^{1/2}\right)\right)$, where $d_{\mathrm{min}}$ denotes the minimum degree of $G$, and $d_t$ denotes the degree of $t$, respectively. Compared to the previously best upper bound of $ O\left(\log{n}\cdot \min\left(d_t, m^{1/2}\right)\right)$ (VLDB '23), which is derived from a significantly more complex algorithm and analysis, our BackMC improves the computational complexity for this problem by a factor of $\Theta\left(\frac{\log{n}}{d_{\mathrm{min}}}\right)$ with a much simpler algorithm. Furthermore, we establish a matching lower bound of $\Omega\left(\frac{1}{d_{\mathrm{min}}}\cdot \min\left(d_t, m^{1/2}\right)\right)$ for any algorithm that attempts to solve the problem of local PageRank estimation, demonstrating the theoretical optimality of our BackMC. We conduct extensive experiments on various large-scale real-world and synthetic graphs, where BackMC consistently shows superior performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Driven by applications in the natural, social and computer sciences several algorithms have been proposed to enumerate all sets $X$ of vertices of a graph $G$ that induce a connected subgraph. Our algorithm AllMetricSets enumerates all $X$'s that induce (more exquisite) metric subgraphs. Here "metric" means that any distinct $s,t\in X$ are joined by a globally shortest $s-t$ path.</description>

      <title>Consistent Strong Triadic Closure in Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social network users are commonly connected to hundreds or even thousands of other users. However, these ties are not all of equal strength; for example, we often are connected to good friends or family members as well as acquaintances. Inferring the tie strengths is an essential task in social network analysis. Common approaches classify the ties into strong and weak edges based on the network topology using the strong triadic closure (STC). The STC states that if for three nodes, $\textit{A}$, $\textit{B}$, and $\textit{C}$, there are strong ties between $\textit{A}$ and $\textit{B}$, as well as $\textit{A}$ and $\textit{C}$, there has to be a (weak or strong) tie between $\textit{B}$ and $\textit{C}$. Moreover, a variant of the STC called STC+ allows adding new weak edges to obtain improved solutions. Recently, the focus of social network analysis has been shifting from single-layer to multilayer networks due to their ability to represent complex systems with multiple types of interactions or relationships in multiple social network platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, or X (formerly Twitter). However, straightforwardly applying the STC separately to each layer of multilayer networks usually leads to inconsistent labelings between layers. Avoiding such inconsistencies is essential as they contradict the idea that tie strengths represent underlying, consistent truths about the relationships between users. Therefore, we adapt the definitions of the STC and STC+ for multilayer networks and provide ILP formulations to solve the problems exactly. Solving the ILPs is computationally costly; hence, we additionally provide an efficient 2-approximation for the STC and a 6-approximation for the STC+ minimization variants. The experiments show that, unlike standard approaches, our new highly efficient algorithms lead to consistent strong/weak labelings of the multilayer network edges.</description>

      <title>Fast DCT+: A Family of Fast Transforms Based on Rank-One Updates of the Path Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops fast graph Fourier transform (GFT) algorithms with O(n log n) runtime complexity for rank-one updates of the path graph. We first show that several commonly-used audio and video coding transforms belong to this class of GFTs, which we denote by DCT+. Next, starting from an arbitrary generalized graph Laplacian and using rank-one perturbation theory, we provide a factorization for the GFT after perturbation. This factorization is our central result and reveals a progressive structure: we first apply the unperturbed Laplacian's GFT and then multiply the result by a Cauchy matrix. By specializing this decomposition to path graphs and exploiting the properties of Cauchy matrices, we show that Fast DCT+ algorithms exist. We also demonstrate that progressivity can speed up computations in applications involving multiple transforms related by rank-one perturbations (e.g., video coding) when combined with pruning strategies. Our results can be extended to other graphs and rank-k perturbations. Runtime analyses show that Fast DCT+ provides computational gains over the naive method for graph sizes larger than 64, with runtime approximately equal to that of 8 DCTs.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Fast Estimation of Temporal Motifs using Path Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counting the number of small subgraphs, called motifs, is a fundamental problem in social network analysis and graph mining. Many real-world networks are directed and temporal, where edges have timestamps. Motif counting in directed, temporal graphs is especially challenging because there are a plethora of different kinds of patterns. Temporal motif counts reveal much richer information and there is a need for scalable algorithms for motif counting.
  A major challenge in counting is that there can be trillions of temporal motif matches even with a graph with only millions of vertices. Both the motifs and the input graphs can have multiple edges between two vertices, leading to a combinatorial explosion problem. Counting temporal motifs involving just four vertices is not feasible with current state-of-the-art algorithms.
  We design an algorithm, TEACUPS, that addresses this problem using a novel technique of temporal path sampling. We combine a path sampling method with carefully designed temporal data structures, to propose an efficient approximate algorithm for temporal motif counting. TEACUPS is an unbiased estimator with provable concentration behavior, which can be used to bound the estimation error. For a Bitcoin graph with hundreds of millions of edges, TEACUPS runs in less than 1 minute, while the exact counting algorithm takes more than a day. We empirically demonstrate the accuracy of TEACUPS on large datasets, showing an average of 30$\times$ speedup (up to 2000$\times$ speedup) compared to existing GPU-based exact counting methods while preserving high count estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>The Better Solution Probability Metric: Optimizing QAOA to Outperform its Warm-Start Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a numerical simulation investigation of the Warm-Start Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) as proposed by Tate et al. [1], focusing on its application to 3-regular Max-Cut problems. Our study demonstrates that Warm-Start QAOA consistently outperforms theoretical lower bounds on approximation ratios across various tilt angles, highlighting its potential in practical scenarios beyond worst-case predictions. Despite these improvements, Warm-Start QAOA with traditional parameters optimized for expectation value does not exceed the performance of the initial classical solution. To address this, we introduce an alternative parameter optimization objective, the Better Solution Probability (BSP) metric. Our results show that BSP-optimized Warm-Start QAOA identifies solutions at non-trivial tilt angles that are better than even the best classically found warm-start solutions with non-vanishing probabilities. These findings underscore the importance of both theoretical and empirical analyses in refining QAOA and exploring its potential for quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Maximum $k$- vs. $\ell$-colourings of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00440v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present polynomial-time SDP-based algorithms for the following problem: For fixed $k \leq \ell$, given a real number $\epsilon&gt;0$ and a graph $G$ that admits a $k$-colouring with a $\rho$-fraction of the edges coloured properly, it returns an $\ell$-colouring of $G$ with an $(\alpha \rho - \epsilon)$-fraction of the edges coloured properly in polynomial time in $G$ and $1 / \epsilon$. Our algorithms are based on the algorithms of Frieze and Jerrum [Algorithmica'97] and of Karger, Motwani and Sudan [JACM'98].
  When $k$ is fixed and $\ell$ grows large, our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of $\alpha = 1 - o(1 / \ell)$. When $k, \ell$ are both large, our algorithm achieves an approximation ratio of $\alpha = 1 - 1 / \ell + 2 \ln \ell / k \ell - o(\ln \ell / k \ell) - O(1 / k^2)$; if we fix $d = \ell - k$ and allow $k, \ell$ to grow large, this is $\alpha = 1 - 1 / \ell + 2 \ln \ell / k \ell - o(\ln \ell / k \ell)$.
  By extending the results of Khot, Kindler, Mossel and O'Donnell [SICOMP'07] to the promise setting, we show that for large $k$ and $\ell$, assuming Khot's Unique Games Conjecture (\UGC), it is \NP-hard to achieve an approximation ratio $\alpha$ greater than $1 - 1 / \ell + 2 \ln \ell / k \ell + o(\ln \ell / k \ell)$, provided that $\ell$ is bounded by a function that is $o(\exp(\sqrt[3]{k}))$. For the case where $d = \ell - k$ is fixed, this bound matches the performance of our algorithm up to $o(\ln \ell / k \ell)$. Furthermore, by extending the results of Guruswami and Sinop [ToC'13] to the promise setting, we prove that it is \NP-hard to achieve an approximation ratio greater than $1 - 1 / \ell + 8 \ln \ell / k \ell + o(\ln \ell / k \ell)$, provided again that $\ell$ is bounded as before (but this time without assuming the \UGC).</description>

      <title>An approximation algorithm for Maximum DiCut vs. Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Goemans and Williamson designed a 0.878-approximation algorithm for Max-Cut in undirected graphs [JACM'95]. Khot, Kindler, Mosel, and O'Donnel showed that the approximation ratio of the Goemans-Williamson algorithm is optimal assuming Khot's Unique Games Conjecture [SICOMP'07]. In the problem of maximum cuts in directed graphs (Max-DiCut), in which we seek as many edges going from one particular side of the cut to the other, the situation is more complicated but the recent work of Brakensiek, Huang, Potechin, and Zwick showed that their 0.874-approximation algorithm is tight under the Unique Games Conjecture (up to a small delta)[FOCS'23].
  We consider a promise version of the problem and design an SDP-based algorithm which, if given a directed graph G that has a directed cut of value rho, finds an undirected cut in G (ignoring edge directions) with value at least \rho.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of Efficient Sortation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A crucial challenge arising in the design of large-scale logistical networks is to optimize parcel sortation for routing. We study this problem under the recent graph-theoretic formalization of Van Dyk, Klause, Koenemann and Megow (IPCO 2024). The problem asks - given an input digraph D (the fulfillment network) together with a set of commodities represented as source-sink tuples - for a minimum-outdegree subgraph H of the transitive closure of D that contains a source-sink route for each of the commodities. Given the underlying motivation, we study two variants of the problem which differ in whether the routes for the commodities are assumed to be given, or can be chosen arbitrarily.
  We perform a thorough parameterized analysis of the complexity of both problems. Our results concentrate on three fundamental parameterizations of the problem: (1) When attempting to parameterize by the target outdegree of H, we show that the problems are paraNP-hard even in highly restricted cases; (2) When parameterizing by the number of commodities, we utilize Ramsey-type arguments and color-coding techniques to obtain parameterized algorithms for both problems; (3) When parameterizing by the structure of D, we establish fixed-parameter tractability for both problems w.r.t. treewidth, maximum degree and the maximum routing length. We combine this with lower bounds which show that omitting any of the three parameters results in paraNP-hardness.</description>

Abstract: The tolerance of an element of a combinatorial optimization problem with respect to a given optimal solution is the maximum change, i.e., decrease or increase, of its cost, such that this solution remains optimal. The bottleneck path problem, for given an edge-capacitated graph, a source, and a target, is to find the $\max$-$\min$ value of edge capacities on paths between the source and the target. For this problem and a network with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, there is known the Ramaswamy-Orlin-Chakravarty's algorithm to compute all tolerances in $O(m+n\log n)$ time. In this paper, for any in advance given sample of the problem with pairwise distinct edge capacities, we present a constant-time algorithm for computing both tolerances of an arbitrary edge with a preprocessing time $O\big(m \alpha(m,n)\big)$, where $\alpha(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the inverse Ackermann function. For given $k$ source-target pairs, our solution yields an $O\big((\alpha(m,n)+k)m\big)$-time algorithm to find tolerances of all edges with respect to optimal paths between the sources and targets, while the known algorithm takes $O\big(k(m+n\log n)\big)$ time to find them.</description>

      <title>Subsequences in Bounded Ranges: Matching and Analysis Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.09201v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a variant of the classical algorithmic problem of checking whether a given word $v$ is a subsequence of another word $w$. More precisely, we consider the problem of deciding, given a number $p$ (defining a range-bound) and two words $v$ and $w$, whether there exists a factor $w[i:i+p-1]$ (or, in other words, a range of length $p$) of $w$ having $v$ as subsequence (i.\,e., $v$ occurs as a subsequence in the bounded range $w[i:i+p-1]$). We give matching upper and lower quadratic bounds for the time complexity of this problem. Further, we consider a series of algorithmic problems in this setting, in which, for given integers $k$, $p$ and a word $w$, we analyse the set $p$-Subseq$_{k}(w)$ of all words of length $k$ which occur as subsequence of some factor of length $p$ of $w$. Among these, we consider the $k$-universality problem, the $k$-equivalence problem, as well as problems related to absent subsequences. Surprisingly, unlike the case of the classical model of subsequences in words where such problems have efficient solutions in general, we show that most of these problems become intractable in the new setting when subsequences in bounded ranges are considered. Finally, we provide an example of how some of our results can be applied to subsequence matching problems for circular words.</description>

      <title>Fast Marching based Rendezvous Path Planning for a Team of Heterogeneous Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a formulation for deterministically calculating optimized paths for a multiagent system consisting of heterogeneous vehicles. The key idea is the calculation of the shortest time for each agent to reach every grid point from its known initial position. Such arrival time map is efficiently computed using the Fast Marching Method (FMM), a computational algorithm originally designed for solving boundary value problems of the Eikonal equation. By leveraging the FMM, we demonstrate that the minimal time rendezvous point and paths for all member vehicles can be uniquely determined with minimal computational overhead. The scalability and adaptability of the present method during online execution are investigated, followed by a comparison with a baseline method that highlights the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Then, the potential of the present method is showcased through a virtual rendezvous scenario involving the coordination of a ship, an underwater vehicle, an aerial vehicle, and a ground vehicle, all converging at the optimal location within the Tampa Bay area in minimal time. The results show that the developed framework can efficiently construct continuous paths of heterogeneous vehicles by accommodating operational constraints via an FMM algorithm</description>

      <title>Improved Hardness Results of the Cardinality-Based Minimum s-t Cut Problem in Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In hypergraphs an edge that crosses a cut can be split in several ways, depending on how many nodes are placed on each side of the cut. A cardinality-based splitting function assigns a nonnegative cost of $w_i$ for each cut hyperedge $e$ with exactly $i$ nodes on the side of the cut that contains the minority of nodes from $e$. The cardinality-based minimum $s$-$t$ cut aims to find an $s$-$t$ cut with minimum total cost. Assuming the costs $w_i$ are polynomially bounded by the input size and $w_0=0$ and $w_1=1$, we show that the problem becomes NP-hard outside the submodular region found by Veldt et al. Our result also holds for $k$-uniform hypergraphs with $k \geq 4$. Specifically for $4$-uniform hypergraphs we show that the problem is NP-hard for all $w_2&gt;2$, and additionally prove that the \textsc{No-Even-Split} problem is NP-hard.</description>
