      <title>Two-photon-excited fluorescence spectroscopy of Rb atoms in a magneto-optical trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of two-photon-excited fluorescence (TPEF) measurements of the $5\mathrm{S}_{1/2} \rightarrow 5\mathrm{D}_{1/2}$ transition of $^{85}$Rb and $^{87}$Rb cooled in a magneto-optical trap (MOT). We observe TPEF at excitation powers as low as 1 $\mu$W or fluxes as low as $4.30 \pm 0.22 \times 10^{18}\ \text{photons}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ ($^{85}$Rb) and $5.17 \pm 0.26 \times 10^{18}\ \text{photons}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\,\text{s}^{-1}$ ($^{87}$Rb). Our results show that Rb, with additional benefits due to its ability to be optically cooled to the point where Doppler-broadening is negligible, is a promising platform for observing sensitive two-photon spectral signatures at low photon fluxes.</description>

      <title>Sub-hertz optical transitions in excited Yb$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the observation of three semi-forbidden transitions in singly-ionized ytterbium from the metastable $^{2}\mathrm{F}^o_{7/2}$ state. Owing to the long lifetimes of both the upper and lower states involved, these transitions are narrow and complement those already frequently used in this atom for quantum information and searches for new physics. We report the absolute frequencies of these electric quadrupole transitions, their isotope shifts, hyperfine structure, and measurements of the quadrupole transition moments. We find that the spontaneous lifetimes of these excited states are limited by slow magnetic dipole emission to lower-lying, odd-parity states, the lowest of which is accessible by laser excitation from ${}^2\mathrm{F}_{7/2}^o$ and is an attractive candidate for hosting a long-lived qubit.</description>

      <title>Hidden Kinematics and Dual Quantum References in Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin resonance phenomena are conventionally described using transition probabilities formulated in a rotating frame, whose physical meaning implicitly depends on the choice of quantum reference standard. In this Colloquium, we show that a spin in a rotating magnetic field constitutes a configuration involving two quantum descriptions that share a common quantization operator but differ in their kinematic and dynamical roles. The transition probability therefore emerges as a relational quantity between quantum reference standards rather than an intrinsic property of a single evolving spin state. By incorporating the kinematic motion of the spin vector together with the dynamical evolution, this framework restores consistent energy accounting and reveals the dual-reference structure underlying spin dynamics in rotating magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Engineering a Bound State in the Continuum via Quantum Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanical interaction potentials typically support either localized bound states below the dissociation threshold or delocalized scattering states above it. While bound states are energetically isolated, scattering states embed a quantum system in a continuum of environmental modes, making dissipation and loss intrisic features of open quantum systems. A striking exception are bound states in the continuum (BICs), which remain localized despite lying within the scattering continuum due to destructive interference. It was predicted that such states can arise from the interference of two Feshbach resonances coupled to a common continuum, yet this mechanism has remained experimentally inaccessible in genuine quantum systems. Here we demonstrate the formation of such an interference-stabilized state in ultracold collisions of ${}^6$Li atoms by coherently coupling two tunable Feshbach resonances using Floquet engineering. At a critical parameter point, both elastic and inelastic coupling to the continuum vanish, yielding a molecular state above the dissociation threshold. Loss spectroscopy, quench dynamics, and rf-photoassociation directly reveal the resulting decoupling from scattering states. Our observations are quantitatively captured by full coupled-channel calculations and a minimal non-Hermitian model, identifying a Friedrich-Wintgen BIC. Our results establish quantum interference as a powerful mechanism for controlling openness in quantum matter and for engineering non-Hermitian Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>A building block of quantum repeaters for scalable quantum networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networks, integrating quantum communication, quantum metrology, and distributed quantum computing, could provide secure and efficient information transfer, high-resolution sensing, and an exponential speed-up in information processing. Deterministic entanglement distribution over long distances is a prerequisite for scalable quantum networks, enabling the utilization of device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) and quantum teleportation to achieve secure and efficient information transfer. However, the exponential photon loss in optical fibres prohibits efficient and deterministic entanglement distribution. Quantum repeaters, incorporating entanglement swapping and entanglement purification with quantum memories, offer the most promising means to overcome this limitation in fibre-based quantum networks. Despite numerous pioneering efforts toward realizing quantum repeaters, a critical bottleneck remains, as remote memory-memory entanglement suffers from decoherence more rapidly than it can be established and purified over long distances. We overcome this by developing long-lived trapped-ion memories, an efficient telecom interface, and a high-visibility single-photon entanglement protocol. This allows us to establish and maintain memory-memory entanglement over a 10 km fibre within the average entanglement establishment time for the same distance. As a direct application, we demonstrate metropolitan-scale DI-QKD, distilling 1,917 secret keys out of 4.05*10^5 Bell pairs over 10 km. We further report a positive key rate over 101 km in the asymptotic limit, extending the achievable distance by more than two orders of magnitude. Our work provides a critical building block for quantum repeaters and marks an important step toward scalable quantum networks.</description>

Abstract: Schiff moments of atomic nuclei are of considerable interest to experiments searching for undiscovered new physics that breaks time-reversal symmetry. I develop a simple picture of the Schiff moment of a charge distribution, and discuss the interaction of the Schiff moment of a nucleus with the field produced by an electron in an atom.</description>

      <title>Probing Cosmic Neutrino Background through Parametric Fluorescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out that relic neutrinos from the Big Bang may induce the parametric fluorescence in atomic or molecular systems, which offers a novel way to discover cosmic neutrino background. By coherently scattering with molecular energy levels, a massive neutrino can spontaneously ``decay" into a lighter neutrino and an infrared signal photon, i.e., $\nu^{}_{i} + M \to \nu^{}_{j} + \gamma^{}_{\rm S} + M$, where the molecular state $M$ remains unchanged after the scattering. Because the amplitudes of different radiants are matched in phase, the rate is coherently enhanced and proportional to the squared density of ambient dipoles. When the energy transfer from neutrinos coincides with the energy-level difference, the fluorescence will be on resonance. Near the resonance, the rate is proportional to the square of the coherence time $T^{}_{\rm c}$ of the ensemble. For a nominal target volume of $5~{\rm m^3}$ (or $5~{\rm cm^3}$), the signal rate can reach $1~{\rm yr}^{-1}$ for $T^{}_{\rm c} = 10~{\rm ns}$ (or $T^{}_{\rm c} = 10~{\rm \mu s}$). This event rate appears to be very promising in consideration of an even longer coherence time that is achievable in solid systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum-memory-assisted on-demand microwave-optical transduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Microwave-optical transducers and quantum memories are fundamental components of quantum repeaters, essential for developing a quantum internet in which solid-state quantum computers serve as nodes interconnected by optical fibers for data transmission. Although both technologies have made significant advancements, the integration of microwave-optical conversion and quantum memory functionalities remains a challenge. Here, we theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a memoryenhanced quantum microwave-optical transduction using a Rydberg ensemble. By utilizing a cascaded electromagnetically induced transparency process, we store microwave photons in a highly excited collective state and subsequently convert them into optical photons during the retrieval process. Taking advantage of the optical depth with order of millions for microwave photons in Rydberg ensemble, combined with a minimal storage dephasing rate at the single-photon level, the transducer achieves an areanormalized storage efficiency greater than 90%, a bandwidth of 2.1 MHz, and a noise equivalent temperature as low as 26 K, even in cavity-free conditions. Our findings pave the way for the practical implementation of quantum repeaters based on atomic ensembles in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of Thermal Reservoirs with Tunable Temperature in a Trapped-Ion Spin-Boson Simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08689v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate an experimental scheme to engineer thermal baths with independently tunable temperatures and dissipation rates for the motional modes of a trapped-ion system. This approach enables robust thermal-state preparation and quantum simulations of open-system dynamics in bosonic and spin-boson models at well-controlled finite temperatures. We benchmark our protocol by experimentally realizing out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a charge-transfer model at different temperatures. We observe that, when the process occurs at a higher temperature, the transfer rate spectrum broadens, with reduced rates at small donor-acceptor energy gaps and enhanced rates at large gaps. We then employ our scheme to study local-temperature effects in a two-mode vibrationally assisted exciton transfer system, where we observe thermally activated interference pathways for excitation transfer.</description>

      <title>Bending strain induced thermal conductivity suppression in freestanding BaTiO3 and SrTiO3 membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Freestanding perovskite oxide membranes provide a novel platform for elastic strain engineering, enabling the manipulation of phonon transport free from substrate clamping. In this work, we investigate the thermal transport properties of strontium titanate (SrTiO3) and barium titanate (BaTiO3) membranes subjected to self-formed crease induced inhomogeneous strain. By integrating spatially resolved Frequency-Domain Thermoreflectance (FDTR) with micro-Raman spectroscopy, we observe a sharp, localized suppression of thermal conductivity (k) in high-curvature regions. Specifically, k is reduced from 4.43 to 3.62 W/(m K) in SrTiO3 and from 2.27 to 1.81 W/(m K) in BaTiO3 at the crease centers, directly correlating with the local strain distribution. First-principles calculations reveal that, unlike uniform strain, the symmetry breaking induced by strain gradients significantly broadens phonon dispersion and enhances scattering rates. These findings not only elucidate the microscopic mechanisms governing phonon-strain coupling but also demonstrate the potential of inhomogeneous strain fields as a potent tool for designing dynamic solid-state thermal switches and active thermal management devices.</description>
