      <title>The Simplicial Loop Space of a Simplicial Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a simplicial complex $X$, we construct a simplicial complex $\Omega X$ that may be regarded as a combinatorial version of the based loop space of a topological space. Our construction explicitly describes the simplices of $\Omega X$ directly in terms of the simplices of $X$. Working at a purely combinatorial level, we show two main results that confirm the (combinatorial) algebraic topology of our $\Omega X$ behaves like that of the topological based loop space. Whereas our $\Omega X$ is generally a disconnected simplical complex, each component of $\Omega X$ has the same edge group, up to isomorphism. We show an isomorphism between the edge group of $\Omega X$ and the combinatorial second homotopy group of $X$ as it has been defined in separate work (arxiv:2503.23651). Finally, we enter the topological setting and, relying on prior work of Stone, show a homotopy equivalence between the spatial realization of our $\Omega X$ and the based loop space of the spatial realization of $X$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this short note we adapt a proof by Bucher and Neofytidis to prove that the simplicial volume of 4-manifolds admitting an open book decomposition vanishes. In particular this shows that Quinns signature invariant, which detects the existence of an open book decomposition in dimensions above 4, is insufficient to characterize open books in dimension 4, even if one allows arbitrary stabilizations via connected sums.</description>

      <title>Braiding vineyards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vineyards are a common way to study persistence diagrams of a data set which is changing, as strong stability means that it is possible to pair points in ``nearby'' persistence diagrams, yielding a family of point sets which connect into curves when stacked. Recent work has also studied monodromy in the persistent homology transform, demonstrating some interesting connections between an input shape and monodromy in the persistent homology transform for 0-dimensional homology embedded in $\mathbb{R}^2$. In this work, we re-characterize monodromy in terms of periodicity of the associated vineyard of persistence diagrams.
  We construct a family of objects in any dimension which have non-trivial monodromy for $l$-persistence of any periodicity and for any $l$. More generally we prove that any knot or link can appear as a vineyard for a shape in $\mathbb{R}^d$, with $d\geq 3$. This shows an intriguing and, to the best of our knowledge, previously unknown connection between knots and persistence vineyards. In particular this shows that vineyards are topologically as rich as one could possibly hope.</description>

      <title>Interval Decomposition of Persistence Modules over a Principal Ideal Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07971v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of persistent homology has contributed new insights and perspectives into a variety of interesting problems in science and engineering. Work in this domain relies on the result that any finitely-indexed persistence module of finite-dimensional vector spaces admits an interval decomposition -- that is, a decomposition as a direct sum of simpler components called interval modules. This result fails if we replace vector spaces with modules over more general coefficient rings.
  We introduce an algorithm to determine whether a persistence module of pointwise free and finitely-generated modules over a principal ideal domain (PID) splits as a direct sum of interval submodules. If one exists, our algorithm outputs an interval decomposition. When considering persistence modules with coefficients in $\Z$ or $\Q[x]$, our algorithm computes an interval decomposition in polynomial time. This is the first algorithm with these properties of which we are aware.
  We also show that a persistence module of pointwise free and finitely-generated modules over a PID splits as a direct sum of interval submodules if and only if the cokernel of every structure map is free. This result underpins the formulation of our algorithm. It also complements prior findings by Obayashi and Yoshiwaki regarding persistent homology, including a criterion for field independence and an algorithm to decompose persistence homology modules of simplex-wise filtrations.</description>

      <title>Super-Polynomial Growth of the Generalized Persistence Diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Generalized Persistence Diagram (GPD) for multi-parameter persistence naturally extends the classical notion of persistence diagram for one-parameter persistence. However, unlike its classical counterpart, computing the GPD remains a significant challenge. The main hurdle is that, while the GPD is defined as the M\"obius inversion of the Generalized Rank Invariant (GRI), computing the GRI is intractable due to the formidable size of its domain, i.e., the set of all connected and convex subsets in a finite grid in $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d \geq 2$. This computational intractability suggests seeking alternative approaches to computing the GPD.
  In order to study the complexity associated to computing the GPD, it is useful to consider its classical one-parameter counterpart, where for a filtration of a simplicial complex with $n$ simplices, its persistence diagram contains at most $n$ points. This observation leads to the question: 'Given a $d$-parameter simplicial filtration, could the cardinality of its GPD (specifically, the support of the GPD) also be bounded by a polynomial in the number of simplices in the filtration?' This is the case for $d=1$, where we compute the persistence diagram directly at the simplicial filtration level. If this were also the case for $d\geq2$, it might be possible to compute the GPD directly and much more efficiently without relying on the GRI.
  We show that the answer to the question above is negative, demonstrating the inherent difficulty of computing the GPD. More specifically, we construct a sequence of $d$-parameter simplicial filtrations where the cardinalities of their GPDs are not bounded by any polynomial in the the number of simplices. Furthermore, we show that several commonly used methods for constructing multi-parameter filtrations can give rise to such "wild" filtrations.</description>

      <title>Barcoding Invariants and Their Equivalent Discriminating Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The persistence barcode (equivalently, the persistence diagram), which can be obtained from the interval decomposition of a persistence module, plays a pivotal role in applications of persistent homology. For multi-parameter persistent homology, which lacks a complete discrete invariant, and where persistence modules are no longer always interval decomposable, many alternative invariants have been proposed. Many of these invariants are akin to persistence barcodes, in that they assign (possibly signed) multisets of intervals. Furthermore, to any interval decomposable module, those invariants assign the multiset of intervals that correspond to its summands. Naturally, identifying the relationships among invariants of this type, or ordering them by their discriminating power, is a fundamental question. To address this, we formalize the notion of barcoding invariants and compare their discriminating powers. Notably, this formalization enables us to prove that all barcoding invariants with the same basis possess equivalent discriminating power. One implication of our result is that introducing a new barcoding invariant does not add any value in terms of its generic discriminating power, even if the new invariant is distinct from the existing barcoding invariants. This suggests the need for a more flexible and adaptable comparison framework for barcoding invariants. Along the way, we generalize several recent results on the discriminative power of invariants for poset representations within our unified framework.</description>

      <title>Properadic coformality of spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a properad that encodes $n$-pre-Calabi-Yau algebras with vanishing copairing. These algebras include chains on the based loop space of any space $X$ endowed with a fundamental class $[X]$ such that $(X,[X])$ satisfies Poincar\'e duality with local system coefficients, such as oriented manifolds. We say that such a pair $(X,[X])$ is coformal when $C_*(\Omega X)$ is formal as an $n$-pre-Calabi-Yau algebra with vanishing copairing. Using a refined version of properadic Kaledin classes, we establish the intrinsic coformality of all spheres in characteristic zero. Furthermore, we prove that intrinsic formality fails for even-dimensional spheres in characteristic two.</description>

      <title>Anti-Vietoris--Rips metric thickenings and Borsuk graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $X$ a metric space and $r\ge 0$, the anti-Vietoris-Rips metric thickening $\mathrm{AVR^m}(X;r)$ is the space of all finitely supported probability measures on $X$ whose support has spread at least $r$, equipped with an optimal transport topology. We study the anti-Vietoris-Rips metric thickenings of spheres. We have a homeomorphism $\mathrm{AVR^m}(S^n;r) \cong S^n$ for $r &gt; \pi$, a homotopy equivalence $\mathrm{AVR^m}(S^n;r) \simeq \mathbb{RP}^{n}$ for $\frac{2\pi}{3} &lt; r \le \pi$, and contractibility $\mathrm{AVR^m}(S^n;r) \simeq *$ for $r=0$. For an $n$-dimensional compact Riemannian manifold $M$, we show that the covering dimension of $\mathrm{AVR^m}(M;r)$ is at most $(n+1)p-1$, where $p$ is the packing number of $M$ at scale $r$. Hence the $k$-dimensional \v{C}ech cohomology of $\mathrm{AVR^m}(M;r)$ vanishes in all dimensions $k\geq (n+1)p$. We prove more about the topology of $\mathrm{AVR^m}(S^n;\frac{2\pi}{3})$, which has vanishing cohomology in dimensions $2n+2$ and higher. We explore connections to chromatic numbers of Borsuk graphs, and in particular we prove that for $k&gt;n$, no graph homomorphism $\mathrm{Bor}(S^k;r) \to \mathrm{Bor}(S^n;\alpha)$ exists when $\alpha &gt; \frac{2\pi}{3}$.</description>

Abstract: We develop an obstruction theory for Hirsch extensions of cbba's with twisted coefficients. This leads to a variety of applications, including a structural theorem for minimal cbba's, a construction of relative minimal models with twisted coefficients, as well as a proof of uniqueness. These results are further employed to study automorphism groups of minimal cbba's and to characterize formality in terms of grading automorphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.13911v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that Grothendieck-Witt spaces of Poincar\'e categories are, in many cases, group completions of certain moduli spaces of hermitian forms. This, in particular, identifies Karoubi's classical hermitian and quadratic K-groups with the genuine Grothendieck-Witt groups from our joint work with Calm\`es, Dotto, Harpaz, Land, Moi, Nardin and Nikolaus, and thereby completes our solution of several conjectures in hermitian K-theory. The method of proof is abstracted from work of Galatius and Randal-Williams on cobordism categories of manifolds using the identification of the Grothendieck-Witt space of a Poincar\'e category as the homotopy type of the associated cobordism category.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using virtual localization in Witt sheaf cohomology, we show that the generating series of quadratic Donaldson-Thomas invariants of $(\mathbb{P}^1)^3$, valued in the Witt ring of $\mathbb{R}$, $W(\mathbb{R})\cong \mathbb{Z}$, is equal to $M(q^2)^{-8}$, where $M(q)$ is the MacMahon function. This confirms a modified version of a conjecture of Viergever. We also show that a localized version of this conjecture holds for certain iterated blow-ups of $(\mathbb{P}^1)^3$ and other related smooth proper toric varieties.</description>
