      <title>Rapid and accurate mosquito abundance forecasting with Aedes-AI neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method to convert weather data into probabilistic forecasts of Aedes aegypti abundance. The approach, which relies on the Aedes-AI suite of neural networks, produces weekly point predictions with corresponding uncertainty estimates. Once calibrated on past trap and weather data, the model is designed to use weather forecasts to estimate future trap catches. We demonstrate that when reliable input data are used, the resulting predictions have high skill. This technique may therefore be used to supplement vector surveillance efforts or identify periods of elevated risk for vector-borne disease outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Transformations to simplify phylogenetic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolutionary relationships between species are typically represented in the biological literature by rooted phylogenetic trees. However, a tree fails to capture ancestral reticulate processes, such as the formation of hybrid species or lateral gene transfer events between lineages, and so the history of life is more accurately described by a rooted phylogenetic network. Nevertheless, phylogenetic networks may be complex and difficult to interpret, so biologists sometimes prefer a tree that summarises the central tree-like trend of evolution. In this paper, we formally investigate methods for transforming an arbitrary phylogenetic network into a tree (on the same set of leaves) and ask which ones (if any) satisfy a simple consistency condition. This consistency condition states that if we add additional species into a phylogenetic network (without otherwise changing this original network) then transforming this enlarged network into a rooted phylogenetic tree induces the same tree on the original set of species as transforming the original network. We show that the LSA (lowest stable ancestor) tree method satisfies this consistency property, whereas several other commonly used methods (and a new one we introduce) do not. We also briefly consider transformations that convert arbitrary phylogenetic networks to another simpler class, namely normal networks.</description>

      <title>Individual or collective treatments: how to target antimicrobial use to limit the spread of respiratory pathogens among beef cattle?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The overuse of antibiotics has become a major global concern due to its role in diminishing treatment effectiveness and positively selecting antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains. This issue is particularly important in the beef cattle sector, where Bovine Respiratory Diseases (BRD) impose significant economic and welfare burdens. BRD are complex, multifactorial conditions primarily affecting young calves and feedlot cattle, caused by a combination of viral and bacterial pathogens, environmental factors, and stressors. Despite efforts to reduce antimicrobial use (AMU), the cattle production system remains heavily reliant on antibiotics to control BRD, often through the implementation of collective treatments to prevent outbreaks. This study aimed at evaluating the impact of various treatment practices on the spread of BRD, specifically focusing on criteria for implementing collective treatments. Using a mechanistic stochastic model, we simulated the spread of \textit{Mannheimia haemolytica} in a multi-pen fattening operation under sixteen different scenarios, considering pen composition, individual risk levels, and treatment strategies. Our findings suggest that an alternative criterion for collective treatments based on the speed of the disease spread, could reduce BRD incidence and AMU more effectively than conventional methods. This research highlights the importance of responsible treatment practices and the potential benefits of novel criteria for collective treatment strategies in improving animal health. Moreover, it emphasizes the need for transparency on the exposure to risk factors along the production chain.</description>

      <title>Mutant fate in spatially structured populations on graphs: connecting models to experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In nature, most microbial populations have complex spatial structures that can affect their evolution. Evolutionary graph theory predicts that some spatial structures modelled by placing individuals on the nodes of a graph affect the probability that a mutant will fix. Evolution experiments are beginning to explicitly address the impact of graph structures on mutant fixation. However, the assumptions of evolutionary graph theory differ from the conditions of modern evolution experiments, making the comparison between theory and experiment challenging. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by using our new model of spatially structured populations. This model considers connected subpopulations that lie on the nodes of a graph, and allows asymmetric migrations. It can handle large populations, and explicitly models serial passage events with migrations, thus closely mimicking experimental conditions. We analyze recent experiments in light of this model. We suggest useful parameter regimes for future experiments, and we make quantitative predictions for these experiments. In particular, we propose experiments to directly test our recent prediction that the star graph with asymmetric migrations suppresses natural selection and can accelerate mutant fixation or extinction, compared to a well-mixed population.</description>

      <title>Constant-selection evolutionary dynamics on weighted networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The population structure often impacts evolutionary dynamics. In constant-selection evolutionary dynamics between two types, amplifiers of selection are networks that promote the fitter mutant to take over the entire population, and suppressors of selection do the opposite. It has been shown that most undirected and unweighted networks are amplifiers of selection under a common updating rule and initial condition. Here, we extensively investigate how edge weights influence selection on undirected networks. We show that random edge weights make small networks less amplifying than the corresponding unweighted networks in a majority of cases and also make them suppressors of selection (i.e., less amplifying than the complete graph, or equivalently, the Moran process) in many cases. Qualitatively, the same result holds true for larger empirical networks. These results suggest that amplifiers of selection are not as common for weighted networks as for unweighted counterparts.</description>

      <title>Institutions of public judgment established by social contract and taxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity is a plausible mechanism for sustaining cooperation: people cooperate with those who have a good reputation, which can be acquired by helping others. However, this mechanism requires the population to agree on who has good or bad moral standing. Consensus can be provided by a central institution that monitors and broadcasts reputations. But how might such an institution be maintained, and how can a population ensure that it is effective and incorruptible? Here we explore a simple mechanism to sustain an institution of reputational judgment: a compulsory contribution from each member of the population, i.e., a tax. We analyze the maximum possible tax rate that individuals will rationally pay to sustain an institution of judgment, which provides a public good in the form of information, and we derive necessary conditions for individuals to resist the temptation to evade their tax payment. We also consider the possibility that institution members may be corrupt and subject to bribery, and we analyze how often an institution must be audited to prevent bribery. Our analysis has implications for the establishment of robust public institutions that provide social information to support cooperation in large populations--and the potential negative consequences associated with wealth or income inequality.</description>
