      <title>CFlow: Supporting Semantic Flow Analysis of Students' Code in Programming Problems at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high demand for computer science education has led to high enrollments, with thousands of students in many introductory courses. In such large courses, it can be overwhelmingly difficult for instructors to understand class-wide problem-solving patterns or issues, which is crucial for improving instruction and addressing important pedagogical challenges. In this paper, we propose a technique and system, CFlow, for creating understandable and navigable representations of code at scale. CFlow is able to represent thousands of code samples in a visualization that resembles a single code sample. CFlow creates scalable code representations by (1) clustering individual statements with similar semantic purposes, (2) presenting clustered statements in a way that maintains semantic relationships between statements, (3) representing the correctness of different variations as a histogram, and (4) allowing users to navigate through solutions interactively using semantic filters. With a multi-level view design, users can navigate high-level patterns, and low-level implementations. This is in contrast to prior tools that either limit their focus on isolated statements (and thus discard the surrounding context of those statements) or cluster entire code samples (which can lead to large numbers of clusters -- for example, if there are n code features and m implementations of each, there can be m^n clusters). We evaluated the effectiveness of CFlow with a comparison study, found participants using CFlow spent only half the time identifying mistakes and recalled twice as many desired patterns from over 6,000 submissions.</description>

      <title>Shaping Realities: Enhancing 3D Generative AI with Fabrication Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI tools are becoming more prevalent in 3D modeling, enabling users to manipulate or create new models with text or images as inputs. This makes it easier for users to rapidly customize and iterate on their 3D designs and explore new creative ideas. These methods focus on the aesthetic quality of the 3D models, refining them to look similar to the prompts provided by the user. However, when creating 3D models intended for fabrication, designers need to trade-off the aesthetic qualities of a 3D model with their intended physical properties. To be functional post-fabrication, 3D models have to satisfy structural constraints informed by physical principles. Currently, such requirements are not enforced by generative AI tools. This leads to the development of aesthetically appealing, but potentially non-functional 3D geometry, that would be hard to fabricate and use in the real world. This workshop paper highlights the limitations of generative AI tools in translating digital creations into the physical world and proposes new augmentations to generative AI tools for creating physically viable 3D models. We advocate for the development of tools that manipulate or generate 3D models by considering not only the aesthetic appearance but also using physical properties as constraints. This exploration seeks to bridge the gap between digital creativity and real-world applicability, extending the creative potential of generative AI into the tangible domain.</description>

      <title>Epigraphics: Message-Driven Infographics Authoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The message a designer wants to convey plays a pivotal role in directing the design of an infographic, yet most authoring workflows start with creating the visualizations or graphics first without gauging whether they fit the message. To address this gap, we propose Epigraphics, a web-based authoring system that treats an "epigraph" as the first-class object, and uses it to guide infographic asset creation, editing, and syncing. The system uses the text-based message to recommend visualizations, graphics, data filters, color palettes, and animations. It further supports between-asset interactions and fine-tuning such as recoloring, highlighting, and animation syncing that enhance the aesthetic cohesiveness of the assets. A gallery and case studies show that our system can produce infographics inspired by existing popular ones, and a task-based usability study with 10 designers show that a text-sourced workflow can standardize content, empower users to think more about the big picture, and facilitate rapid prototyping.</description>

      <title>How Users Experience Closed Captions on Live Television: Quality Metrics Remain a Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a mixed methods study on how deaf, hard of hearing and hearing viewers perceive live TV caption quality with captioned video stimuli designed to mirror TV captioning experiences. To assess caption quality, we used four commonly-used quality metrics focusing on accuracy: word error rate, weighted word error rate, automated caption evaluation (ACE), and its successor ACE2. We calculated the correlation between the four quality metrics and viewer ratings for subjective quality and found that the correlation was weak, revealing that other factors besides accuracy affect user ratings. Additionally, even high-quality captions are perceived to have problems, despite controlling for confounding factors. Qualitative analysis of viewer comments revealed three major factors affecting their experience: Errors within captions, difficulty in following captions, and caption appearance. The findings raise questions as to how objective caption quality metrics can be reconciled with the user experience across a diverse spectrum of viewers.</description>

      <title>CO-oPS: A Mobile App for Community Oversight of Privacy and Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smartphone users install numerous mobile apps that require access to different information from their devices. Much of this information is very sensitive, and users often struggle to manage these accesses due to their lack of tech expertise and knowledge regarding mobile privacy. Thus, they often seek help from others to make decisions regarding their mobile privacy and security. We embedded these social processes in a mobile app titled "CO-oPS'' ("Community Oversight for Privacy and Security"). CO-oPS allows trusted community members to review one another's apps installed and permissions granted to those apps. Community members can provide feedback to one another regarding their privacy behaviors. Users are also allowed to hide some of their mobile apps that they do not like others to see, ensuring their personal privacy.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Writing in Education: Ecosystem Risks and Mitigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the excitement around the capabilities of technological advancements is giving rise to new AI-based writing assistants, the overarching ecosystem plays a crucial role in how they are adopted in educational practice. In this paper, we point to key ecological aspects for consideration. We draw insights from extensive research integrated with practice on a writing feedback tool over 9 years at a university, and we highlight potential risks when these are overlooked. It informs the design of educational writing support tools to be better aligned within broader contexts to balance innovation with practical impact.</description>

      <title>The Dearth of the Author in AI-Supported Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We diagnose and briefly discuss the dearth of the author: a condition that arises when AI-based creativity support tools for writing allow users to produce large amounts of text without making a commensurate number of creative decisions, resulting in output that is sparse in expressive intent. We argue that the dearth of the author helps to explain a number of recurring difficulties and anxieties around AI-based writing support tools, but that it also suggests an ambitious new goal for AI-based CSTs.</description>

      <title>CanvasPic: An Interactive Tool for Freely Generating Facial Images Based on Spatial Layout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world usage, existing GAN image generation tools come up short due to their lack of intuitive interfaces and limited flexibility. To overcome these limitations, we developed CanvasPic, an innovative tool for flexible GAN image generation. Our tool introduces a novel 2D layout design that allows users to intuitively control image attributes based on real-world images. By interacting with the distances between images in the spatial layout, users are able to conveniently control the influence of each attribute on the target image and explore a wide range of generated results. Considering practical application scenarios, a user study involving 24 participants was conducted to compare our tool with existing tools in GAN image generation. The results of the study demonstrate that our tool significantly enhances the user experience, enabling more effective achievement of desired generative results.</description>

      <title>Synthetic vs Human Emotional Faces: What Changes in Humans' Decoding Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considered the increasing use of assistive technologies in the shape of virtual agents, it is necessary to investigate those factors which characterize and affect the interaction between the user and the agent, among these emerges the way in which people interpret and decode synthetic emotions, i.e., emotional expressions conveyed by virtual agents. For these reasons, an article is proposed, which involved 278 participants split in differently aged groups (young, middle-aged, and elders). Within each age group, some participants were administered a naturalistic decoding task, a recognition task of human emotional faces, while others were administered a synthetic decoding task, namely emotional expressions conveyed by virtual agents. Participants were required to label pictures of female and male humans or virtual agents of different ages (young, middle-aged, and old) displaying static expressions of disgust, anger, sadness, fear, happiness, surprise, and neutrality. Results showed that young participants showed better recognition performances (compared to older groups) of anger, sadness, and neutrality, while female participants showed better recognition performances(compared to males) ofsadness, fear, and neutrality; sadness and fear were better recognized when conveyed by real human faces, while happiness, surprise, and neutrality were better recognized when represented by virtual agents. Young faces were better decoded when expressing anger and surprise, middle-aged faces were better decoded when expressing sadness, fear, and happiness , while old faces were better decoded in the case of disgust; on average, female faces where better decoded compared to male ones.</description>

      <title>BDAN: Mitigating Temporal Difference Across Electrodes in Cross-Subject Motor Imagery Classification via Generative Bridging Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Because of "the non-repeatability of the experiment settings and conditions" and "the variability of brain patterns among subjects", the data distributions across sessions and electrodes are different in cross-subject motor imagery (MI) studies, eventually reducing the performance of the classification model. Systematically summarised based on the existing studies, a novel temporal-electrode data distribution problem is investigated under both intra-subject and inter-subject scenarios in this paper. Based on the presented issue, a novel bridging domain adaptation network (BDAN) is proposed, aiming to minimise the data distribution difference across sessions in the aspect of the electrode, thus improving and enhancing model performance. In the proposed BDAN, deep features of all the EEG data are extracted via a specially designed spatial feature extractor. With the obtained spatio-temporal features, a special generative bridging domain is established, bridging the data from all the subjects across sessions. The difference across sessions and electrodes is then minimized using the customized bridging loss functions, and the known knowledge is automatically transferred through the constructed bridging domain. To show the effectiveness of the proposed BDAN, comparison experiments and ablation studies are conducted on a public EEG dataset. The overall comparison results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed BDAN compared with the other advanced deep learning and domain adaptation methods.</description>

      <title>A Longitudinal Study of Child Wellbeing Assessment via Online Interactions with a Social Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Socially Assistive Robots are studied in different Child-Robot Interaction settings. However, logistical constraints limit accessibility, particularly affecting timely support for mental wellbeing. In this work, we have investigated whether online interactions with a robot can be used for the assessment of mental wellbeing in children. The children (N=40, 20 girls and 20 boys; 8-13 years) interacted with the Nao robot (30-45 mins) over three sessions, at least a week apart. Audio-visual recordings were collected throughout the sessions that concluded with the children answering user perception questionnaires pertaining to their anxiety towards the robot, and the robot's abilities. We divided the participants into three wellbeing clusters (low, med and high tertiles) using their responses to the Short Moods and Feelings Questionnaire (SMFQ) and further analysed how their wellbeing and their perceptions of the robot changed over the wellbeing tertiles, across sessions and across participants' gender. Our primary findings suggest that (I) online mediated-interactions with robots can be effective in assessing children's mental wellbeing over time, and (II) children's overall perception of the robot either improved or remained consistent across time. Supplementary exploratory analyses have also revealed that gender affected the children's wellbeing assessments as well as their perceptions of the robot.</description>

      <title>Navigating the Serious Game Design Landscape: A Comprehensive Reference Document</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the evolving field of digital intervention, serious games emerge as promising tools for evidence-based interventions. Research indicates that gamified therapy, whether employed independently or in conjunction with online psychoeducation or traditional programs, proves more efficacious in delivering care to patients. As we navigate the intricate realm of serious game design, bridging the gap between therapeutic approaches and creative design proves complex. Professionals in clinical and research roles demonstrate innovative thinking yet face challenges in executing engaging therapeutic serious games due to the lack of specialized design skills and knowledge. Thus, a larger question remains: How might we aid and educate professionals in clinical and research roles the importance of game design to support their innovative therapeutic approaches? This study examines potential solutions aimed at facilitating the integration of gamification design principles into clinical study protocols, a pivotal aspect for aligning therapeutic practices with captivating narratives in the pursuit of innovative interventions. We propose two solutions, a flow chart framework for serious games or a comprehensive reference document encompassing gamification design principles and guidelines for best design practices. Through an examination of literature reviews, it was observed that selected design decisions varied across studies. Thus, we propose that the second solution, a comprehensive reference design guide, is more versatile and adaptable.</description>

      <title>PD-Insighter: A Visual Analytics System to Monitor Daily Actions for Parkinson's Disease Treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People with Parkinson's Disease (PD) can slow the progression of their symptoms with physical therapy. However, clinicians lack insight into patients' motor function during daily life, preventing them from tailoring treatment protocols to patient needs. This paper introduces PD-Insighter, a system for comprehensive analysis of a person's daily movements for clinical review and decision-making. PD-Insighter provides an overview dashboard for discovering motor patterns and identifying critical deficits during activities of daily living and an immersive replay for closely studying the patient's body movements with environmental context. Developed using an iterative design study methodology in consultation with clinicians, we found that PD-Insighter's ability to aggregate and display data with respect to time, actions, and local environment enabled clinicians to assess a person's overall functioning during daily life outside the clinic. PD-Insighter's design offers future guidance for generalized multiperspective body motion analytics, which may significantly improve clinical decision-making and slow the functional decline of PD and other medical conditions.</description>

      <title>Attention-Aware Visualization: Tracking and Responding to User Perception Over Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the notion of Attention-Aware Visualizations (AAVs) that track the user's perception of a visual representation over time and feed this information back to the visualization. Such context awareness is particularly useful for ubiquitous and immersive analytics where knowing which embedded visualizations the user is looking at can be used to make visualizations react appropriately to the user's attention: for example, by highlighting data the user has not yet seen. We can separate the approach into three components: (1) measuring the user's gaze on a visualization and its parts; (2) tracking the user's attention over time; and (3) reactively modifying the visual representation based on the current attention metric. In this paper, we present two separate implementations of AAV: a 2D data-agnostic method for web-based visualizations that can use an embodied eyetracker to capture the user's gaze, and a 3D data-aware one that uses the stencil buffer to track the visibility of each individual mark in a visualization. Both methods provide similar mechanisms for accumulating attention over time and changing the appearance of marks in response. We also present results from a qualitative evaluation studying visual feedback and triggering mechanisms for capturing and revisualizing attention.</description>

      <title>EyeFormer: Predicting Personalized Scanpaths with Transformer-Guided Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a visual perception perspective, modern graphical user interfaces (GUIs) comprise a complex graphics-rich two-dimensional visuospatial arrangement of text, images, and interactive objects such as buttons and menus. While existing models can accurately predict regions and objects that are likely to attract attention ``on average'', so far there is no scanpath model capable of predicting scanpaths for an individual. To close this gap, we introduce EyeFormer, which leverages a Transformer architecture as a policy network to guide a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that controls gaze locations. Our model has the unique capability of producing personalized predictions when given a few user scanpath samples. It can predict full scanpath information, including fixation positions and duration, across individuals and various stimulus types. Additionally, we demonstrate applications in GUI layout optimization driven by our model. Our software and models will be publicly available.</description>

Abstract: Building embodied AI systems that can follow arbitrary language instructions in any 3D environment is a key challenge for creating general AI. Accomplishing this goal requires learning to ground language in perception and embodied actions, in order to accomplish complex tasks. The Scalable, Instructable, Multiworld Agent (SIMA) project tackles this by training agents to follow free-form instructions across a diverse range of virtual 3D environments, including curated research environments as well as open-ended, commercial video games. Our goal is to develop an instructable agent that can accomplish anything a human can do in any simulated 3D environment. Our approach focuses on language-driven generality while imposing minimal assumptions. Our agents interact with environments in real-time using a generic, human-like interface: the inputs are image observations and language instructions and the outputs are keyboard-and-mouse actions. This general approach is challenging, but it allows agents to ground language across many visually complex and semantically rich environments while also allowing us to readily run agents in new environments. In this paper we describe our motivation and goal, the initial progress we have made, and promising preliminary results on several diverse research environments and a variety of commercial video games.</description>

      <title>SoK (or SoLK?): On the Quantitative Study of Sociodemographic Factors and Computer Security Behaviors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Researchers are increasingly exploring how gender, culture, and other sociodemographic factors correlate with user computer security and privacy behaviors. To more holistically understand relationships between these factors and behaviors, we make two contributions. First, we broadly survey existing scholarship on sociodemographics and secure behavior (151 papers) before conducting a focused literature review of 47 papers to synthesize what is currently known and identify open questions for future research. Second, by incorporating contemporary social and critical theories, we establish guidelines for future studies of sociodemographic factors and security behaviors that address how to overcome common pitfalls. We present a case study to demonstrate our guidelines in action, at-scale, that conduct a measurement study of the relationships between sociodemographics and de-identified, aggregated log data of security and privacy behaviors among 16,829 users on Facebook across 16 countries. Through these contributions, we position our work as a systemization of a lack of knowledge (SoLK). Overall, we find contradictory results and vast unknowns about how identity shapes security behavior. Through our guidelines and discussion, we chart new directions to more deeply examine how and why sociodemographic factors affect security behaviors.</description>

      <title>Impostor Syndrome in Final Year Computer Science Students: An Eye Tracking and Biometrics Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imposter syndrome is a psychological phenomenon that affects individuals who doubt their skills and abilities, despite possessing the necessary competencies. This can lead to a lack of confidence and poor performance. While research has explored the impacts of imposter syndrome on students and professionals in various fields, there is limited knowledge on how it affects code comprehension in software engineering. In this exploratory study, we investigate the prevalence of imposter syndrome among final-year undergraduate computer science students and its effects on their code comprehension cognition using an eye tracker and heart rate monitor. Key findings demonstrate that students identifying as male exhibit lower imposter syndrome levels when analyzing code, and higher imposter syndrome is associated with increased time reviewing a code snippet and a lower likelihood of solving it correctly. This study provides initial data on this topic and establishes a foundation for further research to support student academic success and improve developer productivity and mental well-being.</description>

      <title>AniFrame: A Programming Language for 2D Drawing and Frame-Based Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Creative coding is an experimentation-heavy activity that requires translating high-level visual ideas into code. However, most languages and libraries for creative coding may not be adequately intuitive for beginners. In this paper, we present AniFrame, a domain-specific language for drawing and animation. Designed for novice programmers, it (i) features animation-specific data types, operations, and built-in functions to simplify the creation and animation of composite objects, (ii) allows for fine-grained control over animation sequences through explicit specification of the target object and the start and end frames, (iii) reduces the learning curve through a Python-like syntax, type inferencing, and a minimal set of control structures and keywords that map closely to their semantic intent, and (iv) promotes computational expressivity through support for common mathematical operations, built-in trigonometric functions, and user-defined recursion. Our usability test demonstrates AniFrame's potential to enhance readability and writability for multiple creative coding use cases. AniFrame is open-source, and its implementation and reference are available at https://github.com/memgonzales/aniframe-language.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Learning: Assessing the Transformative Impact of Generative AI on Higher Education</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) models such as ChatGPT have experienced a surge in popularity, attracting 100 million active users in 2 months and generating an estimated 10 million daily queries. Despite this remarkable adoption, there remains a limited understanding to which extent this innovative technology influences higher education. This research paper investigates the impact of GAI on university students and Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). The study adopts a mixed-methods approach, combining a comprehensive survey with scenario analysis to explore potential benefits, drawbacks, and transformative changes the new technology brings. Using an online survey with 130 participants we assessed students' perspectives and attitudes concerning present ChatGPT usage in academics. Results show that students use the current technology for tasks like assignment writing and exam preparation and believe it to be a effective help in achieving academic goals. The scenario analysis afterwards projected potential future scenarios, providing valuable insights into the possibilities and challenges associated with incorporating GAI into higher education. The main motivation is to gain a tangible and precise understanding of the potential consequences for HEIs and to provide guidance responding to the evolving learning environment. The findings indicate that irresponsible and excessive use of the technology could result in significant challenges. Hence, HEIs must develop stringent policies, reevaluate learning objectives, upskill their lecturers, adjust the curriculum and reconsider examination approaches.</description>

      <title>Learning Symbolic Task Representation from a Human-Led Demonstration: A Memory to Store, Retrieve, Consolidate, and Forget Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a symbolic learning framework inspired by cognitive-like memory functionalities (i.e., storing, retrieving, consolidating and forgetting) to generate task representations to support high-level task planning and knowledge bootstrapping. We address a scenario involving a non-expert human, who performs a single task demonstration, and a robot, which online learns structured knowledge to re-execute the task based on experiences, i.e., observations. We consider a one-shot learning process based on non-annotated data to store an intelligible representation of the task, which can be refined through interaction, e.g., via verbal or visual communication. Our general-purpose framework relies on fuzzy Description Logic, which has been used to extend the previously developed Scene Identification and Tagging algorithm. In this paper, we exploit such an algorithm to implement cognitive-like memory functionalities employing scores that rank memorised observations over time based on simple heuristics. Our main contribution is the formalisation of a framework that can be used to systematically investigate different heuristics for bootstrapping hierarchical knowledge representations based on robot observations. Through an illustrative assembly task scenario, the paper presents the performance of our framework to discuss its benefits and limitations.</description>

      <title>What are human values, and how do we align AI to them?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an emerging consensus that we need to align AI systems with human values (Gabriel, 2020; Ji et al., 2024), but there is very little work on what that means and how we actually do it. We split the problem of "aligning to human values" into three parts: first, eliciting values from people; second, reconciling those values into an alignment target for training ML models; and third, actually training the model. In this paper, we focus on the first two parts, and ask the question: what are "good" ways to synthesize diverse human inputs about values into a target for aligning language models? To answer this question, we first define a set of 6 criteria that we believe must be satisfied for an alignment target to shape model behavior in accordance with human values. We then propose a process for eliciting and reconciling values called Moral Graph Elicitation (MGE), which uses a large language model to interview participants about their values in particular contexts; our approach is inspired by the philosophy of values advanced by Taylor (1977), Chang (2004), and others. We trial MGE with a representative sample of 500 Americans, on 3 intentionally divisive prompts (e.g. advice about abortion). Our results demonstrate that MGE is promising for improving model alignment across all 6 criteria. For example, almost all participants (89.1%) felt well represented by the process, and (89%) thought the final moral graph was fair, even if their value wasn't voted as the wisest. Our process often results in "expert" values (e.g. values from women who have solicited abortion advice) rising to the top of the moral graph, without defining who is considered an expert in advance.</description>

      <title>Cross-Language Evolution of Divergent Collective Memory Around the Arab Spring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Arab Spring was a historic set of protests beginning in 2011 that toppled governments and led to major conflicts. Collective memories of events like these can vary significantly across social contexts in response to political, cultural, and linguistic factors. While Wikipedia plays an important role in documenting both historic and current events, little attention has been given to how Wikipedia articles, created in the aftermath of major events, continue to evolve over years or decades. Using the archived content of Arab Spring-related topics across the Arabic and English Wikipedias between 2011 and 2024, we define and evaluate multilingual measures of event salience, deliberation, contextualization, and consolidation of collective memory surrounding the Arab Spring. Our findings about the temporal evolution of the Wikipedia articles' content similarity across languages has implications for theorizing about online collective memory processes and evaluating linguistic models trained on these data.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Linear Models for Fast Online Adaptation in Human-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agents that assist people need to have well-initialized policies that can adapt quickly to align with their partners' reward functions. Initializing policies to maximize performance with unknown partners can be achieved by bootstrapping nonlinear models using imitation learning over large, offline datasets. Such policies can require prohibitive computation to fine-tune in-situ and therefore may miss critical run-time information about a partner's reward function as expressed through their immediate behavior. In contrast, online logistic regression using low-capacity models performs rapid inference and fine-tuning updates and thus can make effective use of immediate in-task behavior for reward function alignment. However, these low-capacity models cannot be bootstrapped as effectively by offline datasets and thus have poor initializations. We propose BLR-HAC, Bootstrapped Logistic Regression for Human Agent Collaboration, which bootstraps large nonlinear models to learn the parameters of a low-capacity model which then uses online logistic regression for updates during collaboration. We test BLR-HAC in a simulated surface rearrangement task and demonstrate that it achieves higher zero-shot accuracy than shallow methods and takes far less computation to adapt online while still achieving similar performance to fine-tuned, large nonlinear models.

      <title>A Systematic Survey of the Gemini Principles for Digital Twin Ontologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ontologies are widely used for achieving interoperable Digital Twins (DTws), yet competing DTw definitions compound interoperability issues. Semantically linking these differing twins is feasible through ontologies and Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTws). However, it is often unclear how ontology use bolsters broader DTw advancements. This article presents a systematic survey following the PRISMA method, to explore the potential of ontologies to support DTws to meet the Centre for Digital Built Britain's Gemini Principles and aims to link progress in ontologies to this framework. The Gemini Principles focus on common DTw requirements, considering: Purpose for 1) Public Good, 2) Value Creation, and 3) Insight; Trustworthiness with sufficient 4) Security, 5) Openness, and 6) Quality; and appropriate Functionality of 7) Federation, 8) Curation, and 9) Evolution. This systematic literature review examines the role of ontologies in facilitating each principle. Existing research uses ontologies to solve DTw challenges within these principles, particularly by connecting DTws, optimising decisionmaking, and reasoning governance policies. Furthermore, analysing the sectoral distribution of literature found that research encompassing the crossover of ontologies, DTws and the Gemini Principles is emerging, and that most innovation is predominantly within manufacturing and built environment sectors. Critical gaps for researchers, industry practitioners, and policymakers are subsequently identified.</description>

Abstract: Among the seventeen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) proposed within the 2030 Agenda and adopted by all the United Nations member states, the Fifth SDG is a call for action to turn Gender Equality into a fundamental human right and an essential foundation for a better world. It includes the eradication of all types of violence against women. Within this context, the UC3M4Safety research team aims to develop Bindi. This is a cyber-physical system which includes embedded Artificial Intelligence algorithms, for user real-time monitoring towards the detection of affective states, with the ultimate goal of achieving the early detection of risk situations for women. On this basis, we make use of wearable affective computing including smart sensors, data encryption for secure and accurate collection of presumed crime evidence, as well as the remote connection to protecting agents. Towards the development of such system, the recordings of different laboratory and into-the-wild datasets are in process. These are contained within the UC3M4Safety Database. Thus, this paper presents and details the first release of WEMAC, a novel multi-modal dataset, which comprises a laboratory-based experiment for 47 women volunteers that were exposed to validated audio-visual stimuli to induce real emotions by using a virtual reality headset while physiological, speech signals and self-reports were acquired and collected. We believe this dataset will serve and assist research on multi-modal affective computing using physiological and speech information.</description>

      <title>From Parental Control to Joint Family Oversight: Can Parents and Teens Manage Mobile Online Safety and Privacy as Equals?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our research aims to highlight and alleviate the complex tensions around online safety, privacy, and smartphone usage in families so that parents and teens can work together to better manage mobile privacy and security-related risks. We developed a mobile application ("app") for Community Oversight of Privacy and Security ("CO-oPS") and had parents and teens assess whether it would be applicable for use with their families. CO-oPS is an Android app that allows a group of users to co-monitor the apps installed on one another's devices and the privacy permissions granted to those apps. We conducted a study with 19 parent-teen (ages 13-17) pairs to understand how they currently managed mobile safety and app privacy within their family and then had them install, use, and evaluate the CO-oPS app. We found that both parents and teens gave little consideration to online safety and privacy before installing new apps or granting privacy permissions. When using CO-oPS, participants liked how the app increased transparency into one another's devices in a way that facilitated communication, but were less inclined to use features for in-app messaging or to hide apps from one another. Key themes related to power imbalances between parents and teens surfaced that made co-management challenging. Parents were more open to collaborative oversight than teens, who felt that it was not their place to monitor their parents, even though both often believed parents lacked the technological expertise to monitor themselves. Our study sheds light on why collaborative practices for managing online safety and privacy within families may be beneficial but also quite difficult to implement in practice. We provide recommendations for overcoming these challenges based on the insights gained from our study.</description>

      <title>Co-designing Community-based Sharing of Smarthome Devices for the Purpose of Co-monitoring In-home Emergencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conducted 26 co-design interviews with 50 smarthome device owners to understand the perceived benefits, drawbacks, and design considerations for developing a smarthome system that facilitates co-monitoring with emergency contacts who live outside of one's home. Participants felt that such a system would help ensure their personal safety, safeguard from material loss, and give them peace of mind by ensuring quick response and verifying potential threats. However, they also expressed concerns regarding privacy, overburdening others, and other potential threats, such as unauthorized access and security breaches. To alleviate these concerns, participants designed for flexible and granular access control and fail-safe back-up features. Our study reveals why peer-based co-monitoring of smarthomes for emergencies may be beneficial but also difficult to implement. Based on the insights gained from our study, we provide recommendations for designing technologies that facilitate such co-monitoring while mitigating its risks.</description>

Abstract: We conducted a user study with 19 parent-teen dyads to understand the perceived benefits and drawbacks of using a mobile app that allows them to co-manage mobile privacy, safety, and security within their families. While the primary goal of the study was to understand the use case as it pertained to parents and teens, an emerging finding from our study was that participants found value in extending app use to other family members (siblings, cousins, and grandparents). Participants felt that it would help bring the necessary expertise into their immediate family network and help protect the older adults and children of the family from privacy and security risks. However, participants expressed that co-monitoring by extended family members might cause tensions in their families, creating interpersonal conflicts. To alleviate these concerns, participants suggested more control over the privacy features to facilitate sharing their installed apps with only trusted family members.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact of Community Oversight for Managing Mobile Privacy and Security</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mobile privacy and security can be a collaborative process where individuals seek advice and help from their trusted communities. To support such collective privacy and security management, we developed a mobile app for Community Oversight of Privacy and Security ("CO-oPS") that allows community members to review one another's apps installed and permissions granted to provide feedback. We conducted a four-week-long field study with 22 communities (101 participants) of friends, families, or co-workers who installed the CO-oPS app on their phones. Measures of transparency, trust, and awareness of one another's mobile privacy and security behaviors, along with individual and community participation in mobile privacy and security co-management, increased from pre- to post-study. Interview findings confirmed that the app features supported collective considerations of apps and permissions. However, participants expressed a range of concerns regarding having community members with different levels of technical expertise and knowledge regarding mobile privacy and security that can impact motivation to participate and perform oversight. Our study demonstrates the potential and challenges of community oversight mechanisms to support communities to co-manage mobile privacy and security.</description>

      <title>Automatic Macro Mining from Interaction Traces at Scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Macros are building block tasks of our everyday smartphone activity (e.g., "login", or "booking a flight"). Effectively extracting macros is important for understanding mobile interaction and enabling task automation. These macros are however difficult to extract at scale as they can be comprised of multiple steps yet hidden within programmatic components of mobile apps. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically extract semantically meaningful macros from both random and user-curated mobile interaction traces. The macros produced by our approach are automatically tagged with natural language descriptions and are fully executable. We conduct multiple studies to validate the quality of extracted macros, including user evaluation, comparative analysis against human-curated tasks, and automatic execution of these macros. These experiments and analyses show the effectiveness of our approach and the usefulness of extracted macros in various downstream applications.</description>

      <title>Qlarify: Recursively Expandable Abstracts for Directed Information Retrieval over Scientific Papers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.07581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigating the vast scientific literature often starts with browsing a paper's abstract. However, when a reader seeks additional information, not present in the abstract, they face a costly cognitive chasm during their dive into the full text. To bridge this gap, we introduce recursively expandable abstracts, a novel interaction paradigm that dynamically expands abstracts by progressively incorporating additional information from the papers' full text. This lightweight interaction allows scholars to specify their information needs by quickly brushing over the abstract or selecting AI-suggested expandable entities. Relevant information is synthesized using a retrieval-augmented generation approach, presented as a fluid, threaded expansion of the abstract, and made efficiently verifiable via attribution to relevant source-passages in the paper. Through a series of user studies, we demonstrate the utility of recursively expandable abstracts and identify future opportunities to support low-effort and just-in-time exploration of long-form information contexts through LLM-powered interactions.</description>

      <title>Large Language User Interfaces: Voice Interactive User Interfaces powered by LLMs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) has showcased remarkable capacities for logical reasoning and natural language comprehension. These capabilities can be leveraged in solutions that semantically and textually model complex problems. In this paper, we present our efforts toward constructing a framework that can serve as an intermediary between a user and their user interface (UI), enabling dynamic and real-time interactions. We employ a system that stands upon textual semantic mappings of UI components, in the form of annotations. These mappings are stored, parsed, and scaled in a custom data structure, supplementary to an agent-based prompting backend engine. Employing textual semantic mappings allows each component to not only explain its role to the engine but also provide expectations. By comprehending the needs of both the user and the components, our LLM engine can classify the most appropriate application, extract relevant parameters, and subsequently execute precise predictions of the user's expected actions. Such an integration evolves static user interfaces into highly dynamic and adaptable solutions, introducing a new frontier of intelligent and responsive user experiences.</description>

      <title>Towards Mixed Reality as the Everyday Computing Paradigm: Challenges &amp; Design Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research presents a proof-of-concept prototype of an all-in-one mixed reality application platform, developed to investigate the needs and expectations of users from mixed reality systems. The study involved an extensive user study with 1,052 participants, including the collection of diaries from 6 users and conducting interviews with 15 participants to gain deeper insights into their experiences. The findings from the interviews revealed that directly porting current user flows into 3D environments was not well-received by the target users. Instead, users expressed a clear preference for alternative 3D interactions along with the continued use of 2D interfaces. This study provides insights for understanding user preferences and interactions in mixed reality systems, and design recommendations to facilitate the mass adoption of MR systems.</description>

      <title>Re-Ranking News Comments by Constructiveness and Curiosity Significantly Increases Perceived Respect, Trustworthiness, and Interest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online commenting platforms have commonly developed systems to address online harms by removing and down-ranking content. An alternative, under-explored approach is to focus on up-ranking content to proactively prioritize prosocial commentary and set better conversational norms. We present a study with 460 English-speaking US-based news readers to understand the effects of re-ranking comments by constructiveness, curiosity, and personal stories on a variety of outcomes related to willingness to participate and engage, as well as perceived credibility and polarization in a comment section. In our rich-media survey experiment, participants across these four ranking conditions and a control group reviewed prototypes of comment sections of a Politics op-ed and Dining article. We found that outcomes varied significantly by article type. Up-ranking curiosity and constructiveness improved a number of measures for the Politics article, including perceived Respect, Trustworthiness, and Interestingness of the comment section. Constructiveness also increased perceptions that the comments were favorable to Republicans, with no condition worsening perceptions of partisans. Additionally, in the Dining article, personal stories and constructiveness rankings significantly improved the perceived informativeness of the comments. Overall, these findings indicate that incorporating prosocial qualities of speech into ranking could be a promising approach to promote healthier, less polarized dialogue in online comment sections.</description>

      <title>Youth as Peer Auditors: Engaging Teenagers with Algorithm Auditing of Machine Learning Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) applications become more pervasive in youth lives, supporting them to interact, design, and evaluate applications is crucial. This paper positions youth as auditors of their peers' ML-powered applications to better understand algorithmic systems' opaque inner workings and external impacts. In a two-week workshop, 13 youth (ages 14-15) designed and audited ML-powered applications. We analyzed pre/post clinical interviews in which youth were presented with auditing tasks. The analyses show that after the workshop all youth identified algorithmic biases and inferred dataset and model design issues. Youth also discussed algorithmic justice issues and ML model improvements. Furthermore, youth reflected that auditing provided them new perspectives on model functionality and ideas to improve their own models. This work contributes (1) a conceptualization of algorithm auditing for youth; and (2) empirical evidence of the potential benefits of auditing. We discuss potential uses of algorithm auditing in learning and child-computer interaction research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16360v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although remote working is increasingly adopted during the pandemic, many are concerned by the low-efficiency in the remote working. Missing in text-based communication are non-verbal cues such as facial expressions and body language, which hinders the effective communication and negatively impacts the work outcomes. Prevalent on social media platforms, emojis, as alternative non-verbal cues, are gaining popularity in the virtual workspaces well. In this paper, we study how emoji usage influences developer participation and issue resolution in virtual workspaces. To this end, we collect GitHub issues for a one-year period and apply causal inference techniques to measure the causal effect of emojis on the outcome of issues, controlling for confounders such as issue content, repository, and author information. We find that emojis can significantly reduce the resolution time of issues and attract more user participation. We also compare the heterogeneous effect on different types of issues. These findings deepen our understanding of the developer communities, and they provide design implications on how to facilitate interactions and broaden developer participation.</description>

      <title>Joining Forces for Pathology Diagnostics with AI Assistance: The EMPAIA Initiative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, artificial intelligence (AI) methods in pathology have advanced substantially. However, integration into routine clinical practice has been slow due to numerous challenges, including technical and regulatory hurdles in translating research results into clinical diagnostic products and the lack of standardized interfaces. The open and vendor-neutral EMPAIA initiative addresses these challenges. Here, we provide an overview of EMPAIA's achievements and lessons learned. EMPAIA integrates various stakeholders of the pathology AI ecosystem, i.e., pathologists, computer scientists, and industry. In close collaboration, we developed technical interoperability standards, recommendations for AI testing and product development, and explainability methods. We implemented the modular and open-source EMPAIA platform and successfully integrated 14 AI-based image analysis apps from 8 different vendors, demonstrating how different apps can use a single standardized interface. We prioritized requirements and evaluated the use of AI in real clinical settings with 14 different pathology laboratories in Europe and Asia. In addition to technical developments, we created a forum for all stakeholders to share information and experiences on digital pathology and AI. Commercial, clinical, and academic stakeholders can now adopt EMPAIA's common open-source interfaces, providing a unique opportunity for large-scale standardization and streamlining of processes. Further efforts are needed to effectively and broadly establish AI assistance in routine laboratory use. To this end, a sustainable infrastructure, the non-profit association EMPAIA International, has been established to continue standardization and support broad implementation and advocacy for an AI-assisted digital pathology future.</description>

      <title>Overconfident and Unconfident AI Hinder Human-AI Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AI transparency is a central pillar of responsible AI deployment and effective human-AI collaboration. A critical approach is communicating uncertainty, such as displaying AI's confidence level, or its correctness likelihood (CL), to users. However, these confidence levels are often uncalibrated, either overestimating or underestimating actual CL, posing risks and harms to human-AI collaboration. This study examines the effects of uncalibrated AI confidence on users' trust in AI, AI advice adoption, and collaboration outcomes. We further examined the impact of increased transparency, achieved through trust calibration support, on these outcomes. Our results reveal that uncalibrated AI confidence leads to both the misuse of overconfident AI and disuse of unconfident AI, thereby hindering outcomes of human-AI collaboration. Deficiency of trust calibration support exacerbates this issue by making it harder to detect uncalibrated confidence, promoting misuse and disuse of AI. Conversely, trust calibration support aids in recognizing uncalibration and reducing misuse, but it also fosters distrust and causes disuse of AI. Our findings highlight the importance of AI confidence calibration for enhancing human-AI collaboration and suggest directions for AI design and regulation.</description>

      <title>Human-in-the-Loop Segmentation of Multi-species Coral Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Broad-scale marine surveys performed by underwater vehicles significantly increase the availability of coral reef imagery, however it is costly and time-consuming for domain experts to label images. Point label propagation is an approach used to leverage existing image data labeled with sparse point labels. The resulting augmented ground truth generated is then used to train a semantic segmentation model. Here, we first demonstrate that recent advances in foundation models enable generation of multi-species coral augmented ground truth masks using denoised DINOv2 features and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), without the need for any pre-training or custom-designed algorithms. For extremely sparsely labeled images, we propose a labeling regime based on human-in-the-loop principles, resulting in significant improvement in annotation efficiency: If only 5 point labels per image are available, our proposed human-in-the-loop approach improves on the state-of-the-art by 17.3% for pixel accuracy and 22.6% for mIoU; and by 10.6% and 19.1% when 10 point labels per image are available. Even if the human-in-the-loop labeling regime is not used, the denoised DINOv2 features with a KNN outperforms the prior state-of-the-art by 3.5% for pixel accuracy and 5.7% for mIoU (5 grid points). We also provide a detailed analysis of how point labeling style and the quantity of points per image affects the point label propagation quality and provide general recommendations on maximizing point label efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Architected materials with their unique topology and geometry offer the potential to modify physical and mechanical properties. Machine learning can accelerate the design and optimization of these materials by identifying optimal designs and forecasting performance. This work presents LatticeML, a data-driven application for predicting the effective Young's Modulus of high-temperature graph-based architected materials. The study considers eleven graph-based lattice structures with two high-temperature alloys, Ti-6Al-4V and Inconel 625. Finite element simulations were used to compute the effective Young's Modulus of the 2x2x2 unit cell configurations. A machine learning framework was developed to predict Young's Modulus, involving data collection, preprocessing, implementation of regression models, and deployment of the best-performing model. Five supervised learning algorithms were evaluated, with the XGBoost Regressor achieving the highest accuracy (MSE = 2.7993, MAE = 1.1521, R-squared = 0.9875). The application uses the Streamlit framework to create an interactive web interface, allowing users to input material and geometric parameters and obtain predicted Young's Modulus values.</description>
