      <title>Downscaling with AI reveals the large role of internal variability in fine-scale projections of climate extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational cost of dynamical downscaling limits ensemble sizes in regional downscaling efforts. We present a newly developed generative-AI approach to greatly expand the scope of such downscaling, enabling fine-scale future changes to be characterised including rare extremes that cannot be addressed by traditional approaches. We test this approach for New Zealand, where strong regional effects are anticipated. At fine scales, the forced (predictable) component of precipitation and temperature extremes for future periods (2080--2099) is spatially smoother than changes in individual simulations, and locally smaller. Future changes in rarer (10-year and 20-year) precipitation extremes are more severe and have larger internal variability spread than annual extremes. Internal variability spread is larger at fine scales that at the coarser scales simulated in climate models. Unpredictability from internal variability dominates model uncertainty and, for precipitation, its variance increases with warming, exceeding the variance across emission scenarios by fourfold for annual and tenfold for decadal extremes. These results indicate that fine-scale changes in future precipitation are less predictable than widely assumed and require much larger ensembles to assess reliably than changes at coarser scales.</description>

      <title>Compressibility of Confined Fluids from Volume Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When fluids are confined in nanopores, many of their properties deviate from bulk. These include bulk modulus, or compressibility, which determines the mechanical properties of fluid-saturated porous solids. Such properties are of importance for exploration and recovery of coal-bed methane and shale gas. We developed a new molecular simulation method for calculating compressibility of confined fluids, and applied it to methane in carbon nanopores. The method is based on volume fluctuations in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble, made possible through integrated potentials. Our method is one order of magnitude faster than the Monte Carlo approach, and allows calculations for pore sizes up to 100 nm. Our simulations predicted an increase in the fluid bulk modulus by a factor of 4 in 3 nm slit pores, and showed a gradual decrease with the increase of the pore size, so that at 100 nm, the deviation from the bulk is less than 5%.</description>

      <title>Calibration of the strain amplitude recorded with DAS using a strainmeter array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The power of distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) lies in its ability to sample deformation signals along an optical fiber at hundreds of locations with only one interrogation unit (IU). While the IU is calibrated to record 'fiber strain', the properties of the cable and its coupling to the rock control the 'strain transfer rate' and hence how much of 'rock strain' is represented in the recorded signal. We use DAS recordings in an underground installation near an array of strainmeters in order to calibrate the 'strain transfer rate' in situ, using earthquake signals between 0.05 Hz and 0.1 Hz. A tight-buffered cable and a standard loose-tube telecommunication cable (running in parallel) are used, where a section of both cables loaded down by loose sand and sand bags is compared to a section, where cables are just unreeled on the floor. The 'strain transfer rate' varies between 0.13 and 0.53 depending on cable and installation type. The sandbags show no obvious effect and the tight-buffered cable generally provides a larger 'strain transfer rate'. Calibration of the 'strain transfer rate' with respect to the strainmeter does not depend on wave propagation parameters. Hence it is applicable to the large amplitude surface wave signal in a strain component almost perpendicular to the great-circle direction for which a waveform comparison with seismometer data does not work. The noise background for 'rock strain' in the investigated band is found at about an rms-amplitude of 0.1 nstrain in 1/6 decade for the tight-buffered cable. This allows a detection of marine microseisms at times of high microseism amplitude.</description>

      <title>EFKAN: A KAN-Integrated Neural Operator For Efficient Magnetotelluric Forward Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetotelluric (MT) forward modeling is fundamental for improving the accuracy and efficiency of MT inversion. Neural operators (NOs) have been effectively used for rapid MT forward modeling, demonstrating their promising performance in solving the MT forward modeling-related partial differential equations (PDEs). Particularly, they can obtain the electromagnetic field at arbitrary locations and frequencies. In these NOs, the projection layers have been dominated by multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), which may potentially reduce the accuracy of solution due to they usually suffer from the disadvantages of MLPs, such as lack of interpretability, overfitting, and so on. Therefore, to improve the accuracy of MT forward modeling with NOs and explore the potential alternatives to MLPs, we propose a novel neural operator by extending the Fourier neural operator (FNO) with Kolmogorov-Arnold network (EFKAN). Within the EFKAN framework, the FNO serves as the branch network to calculate the apparent resistivity and phase from the resistivity model in the frequency domain. Meanwhile, the KAN acts as the trunk network to project the resistivity and phase, determined by the FNO, to the desired locations and frequencies. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves higher accuracy in obtaining apparent resistivity and phase compared to the NO equipped with MLPs at the desired frequencies and locations but also outperforms traditional numerical methods in terms of computational speed.</description>
