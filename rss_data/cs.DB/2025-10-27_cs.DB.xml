      <title>World-POI: Global Point-of-Interest Data Enriched from Foursquare and OpenStreetMap as Tabular and Graph Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Foursquare released a global dataset with more than 100 million points of interest (POIs), each representing a real-world business on its platform. However, many entries lack complete metadata such as addresses or categories, and some correspond to non-existent or fictional locations. In contrast, OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers a rich, user-contributed POI dataset with detailed and frequently updated metadata, though it does not formally verify whether a POI represents an actual business. In this data paper, we present a methodology that integrates the strengths of both datasets: Foursquare as a comprehensive baseline of commercial POIs and OSM as a source of enriched metadata. The combined dataset totals approximately 1 TB. While this full version is not publicly released, we provide filtered releases with adjustable thresholds that reduce storage needs and make the data practical to download and use across domains. We also provide step-by-step instructions to reproduce the full 631 GB build. Record linkage is achieved by computing name similarity scores and spatial distances between Foursquare and OSM POIs. These measures identify and retain high-confidence matches that correspond to real businesses in Foursquare, have representations in OSM, and show strong name similarity. Finally, we use this filtered dataset to construct a graph-based representation of POIs enriched with attributes from both sources, enabling advanced spatial analyses and a range of downstream applications.</description>

      <title>SurVigilance: An Application for Accessing Global Pharmacovigilance Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even though several publicly accessible pharmacovigilance databases are available, extracting data from them is a technically challenging process. Existing tools typically focus on a single database. We present SurVigilance, an open-source tool that streamlines the process of retrieving safety data from seven major pharmacovigilance databases. SurVigilance provides a graphical user interface as well as functions for programmatic access, thus enabling integration into existing research workflows. SurVigilance utilizes a modular architecture to provide access to the heterogeneous sources. By reducing the technical barriers to accessing safety data, SurVigilance aims to facilitate pharmacovigilance research.</description>

      <title>From Questions to Queries: An AI-powered Multi-Agent Framework for Spatial Text-to-SQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL), single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components, including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems, advancing the development of autonomous GIS.</description>

      <title>Transformer-Gather, Fuzzy-Reconsider: A Scalable Hybrid Framework for Entity Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entity resolution plays a significant role in enterprise systems where data integrity must be rigorously maintained. Traditional methods often struggle with handling noisy data or semantic understanding, while modern methods suffer from computational costs or the excessive need for parallel computation. In this study, we introduce a scalable hybrid framework, which is designed to address several important problems, including scalability, noise robustness, and reliable results. We utilized a pre-trained language model to encode each structured data into corresponding semantic embedding vectors. Subsequently, after retrieving a semantically relevant subset of candidates, we apply a syntactic verification stage using fuzzy string matching techniques to refine classification on the unlabeled data. This approach was applied to a real-world entity resolution task, which exposed a linkage between a central user management database and numerous shared hosting server records. Compared to other methods, this approach exhibits an outstanding performance in terms of both processing time and robustness, making it a reliable solution for a server-side product. Crucially, this efficiency does not compromise results, as the system maintains a high retrieval recall of approximately 0.97. The scalability of the framework makes it deployable on standard CPU-based infrastructure, offering a practical and effective solution for enterprise-level data integrity auditing.</description>

      <title>Panorama: Fast-Track Nearest Neighbors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00566v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space, aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99% of query time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms compact over 90% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts, SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns. Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.</description>
