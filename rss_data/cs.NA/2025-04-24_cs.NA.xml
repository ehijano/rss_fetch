      <title>Physics-Informed Inference Time Scaling via Simulation-Calibrated Scientific Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) pose significant computational challenges across fields ranging from quantum chemistry to economics and finance. Although scientific machine learning (SciML) techniques offer approximate solutions, they often suffer from bias and neglect crucial physical insights. Inspired by inference-time scaling strategies in language models, we propose Simulation-Calibrated Scientific Machine Learning (SCaSML), a physics-informed framework that dynamically refines and debiases the SCiML predictions during inference by enforcing the physical laws. SCaSML leverages derived new physical laws that quantifies systematic errors and employs Monte Carlo solvers based on the Feynman-Kac and Elworthy-Bismut-Li formulas to dynamically correct the prediction. Both numerical and theoretical analysis confirms enhanced convergence rates via compute-optimal inference methods. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that SCaSML reduces errors by 20-50% compared to the base surrogate model, establishing it as the first algorithm to refine approximated solutions to high-dimensional PDE during inference. Code of SCaSML is available at https://github.com/Francis-Fan-create/SCaSML.</description>

      <title>Quasitubal Tensor Algebra Over Separable Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16231v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tubal tensor framework provides a clean and effective algebraic setting for tensor computations, supporting matrix-mimetic features like Singular Value Decomposition and Eckart-Young-like optimality results. Underlying the tubal tensor framework is a view of a tensor as a matrix of finite sized tubes. In this work, we lay the mathematical and computational foundations for working with tensors with infinite size tubes: matrices whose elements are elements from a separable Hilbert space. A key challenge is that existence of important desired matrix-mimetic features of tubal tensors rely on the existence of a unit element in the ring of tubes. Such unit element cannot exist for tubes which are elements of an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. We sidestep this issue by embedding the tubal space in a commutative unital C*-algebra of bounded operators. The resulting quasitubal algebra recovers the structural properties needed for decomposition and low-rank approximation. In addition to laying the theoretical groundwork for working with tubal tensors with infinite dimensional tubes, we discuss computational aspects of our construction, and provide a numerical illustration where we compute a finite dimensional approximation to a infinitely-sized synthetic tensor using our theory. We believe our theory opens new exciting avenues for applying matrix mimetic tensor framework in the context of inherently infinite dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Numerical Derivatives, Projection Coefficients, and Truncation Errors in Analytic Hilbert Space With Gaussian Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f(z)$ be a holomorphic function, and let $\langle,\; rangle $ denote the inner product defined over an analytic Hilbert space with Gaussian measure. In this work, we demonstrate that the numerical values of the derivatives $f^{(n)}(z)$ at a point $z_{0}$ can be computed by evaluating an inner product of the form $\langle z^{n},f(z)\rangle$, divided by a constant. Specifically, if the inner product is taken over the Bargmann space (the analytic Hilbert space with Gaussian weight and orthogonal monomials), the constant is $\pi$. This result assumes that $f(z)$ is a holomorphic function of a single complex variable. If the function $f(z)$ is square-integrable, then the accuracy of the computed derivative values depends on the precision and reliability of the numerical routine used to evaluate the inner products. We introduce the projection coefficients algorithm , which determines the leading terms of the Taylor series expansion for a given holomorphic function from a graph perspective, and analyze the associated truncation errors. Furthermore, the projection coefficients provide clear insights into certain properties of functions, such as whether they are odd or even, and whether the $n$-th derivatives exist. This study lays the groundwork for further applications in numerical analysis and approximation theory within Hilbert spaces equipped with Gaussian measures. Additionally, it might contribute to advancements in reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) methods, which are widely used in support vector machines (SVM) and other areas of machine learning. Also, it might have impact in probabilistic numerics.</description>

      <title>Data assimilation with model errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nudging is a data assimilation method amenable to both analysis and implementation. It also has the (reported) advantage of being insensitive to model errors compared to other assimilation methods. However, nudging behavior in the presence of model errors is little analyzed. This report gives an analysis of nudging to correct model errors. The analysis indicates that the error contribution due to the model error decays as the nudging parameter $\chi \to \infty$ like $\mathcal{O}(\chi^{-\frac{1}{2}})$, Theorem 3.2. Numerical tests verify the predicted convergence rates and validate the nudging correction to model errors.</description>

      <title>Efficient Design of Compliant Mechanisms Using Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compliant mechanisms achieve motion through elastic deformation. In this work, we address the synthesis of a compliant cross-hinge mechanism capable of large angular strokes while approximating the behavior of an ideal revolute joint. To capture the competing demands of kinematic fidelity, rotational stiffness, and resistance to parasitic motion, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem based on kinetostatic performance measures. A hybrid design strategy is employed: an efficient beam-based structural model enables extensive exploration of a high-dimensional design space using evolutionary algorithms, followed by fine-tuning with high-fidelity three-dimensional finite element analysis. The resulting Pareto-optimal designs reveal diverse geometric configurations and performance trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Alternately-optimized SNN method for acoustic scattering problem in unbounded domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning-based method to solve the acoustic scattering problem in unbounded domain. We first employ the Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) operator to truncate the physically unbounded domain into a computable bounded domain. This transformation reduces the original scattering problem in the unbounded domain to a boundary value problem within the bounded domain. To solve this boundary value problem, we design a neural network with a subspace layer, where each neuron in this layer represents a basis function. Consequently, the approximate solution can be expressed by a linear combination of these basis functions. Furthermore, we introduce an innovative alternating optimization technique which alternately updates the basis functions and their linear combination coefficients respectively by training and least squares methods. In our method, we set the coefficients of basis functions to 1 and use a new loss function each time train the subspace. These innovations ensure that the subspace formed by these basis functions is truly optimized. We refer to this method as the alternately-optimized subspace method based on neural networks (AO-SNN). Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that our new method can significantly reduce the relative $l^2$ error to $10^{-7}$ or lower, outperforming existing machine learning-based methods to the best of our knowledge.</description>

      <title>A hybrid high-order method for the biharmonic problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new hybrid high-order discretization for the biharmonic problem and the corresponding eigenvalue problem. The discrete ansatz space includes degrees of freedom in $n-2$ dimensional submanifolds (e.g., nodal values in 2D and edge values in 3D), in addition to the typical degrees of freedom in the mesh and on the hyperfaces in the HHO literature. This approach enables the characteristic commuting property of the hybrid high-order methodology in any space dimension and allows for lower eigenvalue bounds of higher order for the eigenvalue problem. The main results are quasi-best approximation estimates as well as reliable and efficient error control. The latter motivates an adaptive mesh-refining algorithm that empirically recovers optimal convergence rates for singular solutions.</description>

      <title>Mixing Data-Driven and Physics-Based Constitutive Models using Uncertainty-Driven Phase Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a high interest in accelerating multiscale models using data-driven surrogate modeling techniques. Creating a large training dataset encompassing all relevant load scenarios is essential for a good surrogate, yet the computational cost of producing this data quickly becomes a limiting factor. Commonly, a pre-trained surrogate is used throughout the computational domain. Here, we introduce an alternative adaptive mixture approach that uses a fast probabilistic surrogate model as constitutive model when possible, but resorts back to the true high-fidelity model when necessary. The surrogate is thus not required to be accurate for every possible load condition, enabling a significant reduction in the data collection time. We achieve this by creating phases in the computational domain corresponding to the different models. These phases evolve using a phase-field model driven by the surrogate uncertainty. When the surrogate uncertainty becomes large, the phase-field model causes a local transition from the surrogate to the high-fidelity model, maintaining a highly accurate simulation. We discuss the requirements of this approach to achieve accurate and numerically stable results and compare the phase-field model to a purely local approach that does not enforce spatial smoothness for the phase mixing. Using a Gaussian Process surrogate for an elasto-plastic material, we demonstrate the potential of this mixture of models to accelerate multiscale simulations.</description>

      <title>The root-exponential convergence of lightning plus polynomial approximation on corner domains (II)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper builds rigorous analysis on the root-exponential convergence for the lightning schemes via rational functions in approximating corner singularity problems with uniform exponentially clustered poles proposed by Gopal and Trefethen. The start point is to set up the representations of $z^\alpha$ and $z^\alpha\log z$ in the slit disk and develop results akin to Paley-Wiener theorem, from which, together with the Poisson summation formula, the root-exponential convergence of the lightning plus polynomial scheme with an exact order for each clustered parameter is established in approximation of prototype functions $g(z)z^\alpha$ or $g(z)z^\alpha\log z$ on a sector-shaped domain, which includes $[0,1]$ as a special case. In addition, the fastest convergence rate is confirmed based upon the best choice of the clustered parameter. Furthermore, the optimal choice of the clustered parameter and the convergence rate for corner singularity problems in solving Laplace equations are attested based on Lehman and Wasow's study of corner singularities and along with the decomposition of Gopal and Trefethen. The thorough analysis provides a solid foundation for lightning schemes and rational approximation. Ample numerical evidences demonstrate the optimality and sharpness of the estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This articles investigates physics-based passive imaging problem, wherein one infers an unknown medium using ambient noise and correlation of the noise signal. We develop a general backpropagation framework via the so-called extended adjoint state, suitable for any linear PDE; crucially, this approach reduces by half the number of required PDE solves. Applications to several different PDE models demonstrate the universality of our method. In addition, we analyze the nonlinearity of the correlated model, revealing a surprising tangential cone condition-like structure, thereby advancing the state of the art towards a convergence guarantee for regularized reconstruction in passive imaging.</description>

      <title>Energy Variational Modeling and Numerical Simulation of Open Membranes in Stokes Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lipid bilayer membranes are fundamental biological structures that serve as cellular boundaries, mediating transport, signaling, and maintaining structural integrity. This study introduces a novel mathematical model for open membranes immersed in Stokes flows, accounting for membrane elasticity, line tension at the open edge, and fluid-membrane interactions. The model is derived from an energy functional that incorporates Helfrich bending energy and a line energy associated with the open edge. By balancing dissipation in both the bulk fluid and the membrane surface, following the maximal dissipation principle, we derive the governing equations within an energy variational framework. Assuming axisymmetry and employing a boundary integral reduction, we transform the 3D problem into an effectively 1D problem, for which we develop a finite element-based numerical method to solve the resulting moving boundary problem. Several numerical examples are provided to validate the model and compare the results with existing studies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, based on the combination of finite element mesh and neural network, a novel type of neural network element space and corresponding machine learning method are designed for solving partial differential equations. The application of finite element mesh makes the neural network element space satisfy the boundary value conditions directly on the complex geometric domains. The use of neural networks allows the accuracy of the approximate solution to reach the high level of neural network approximation even for the problems with singularities. We also provide the error analysis of the proposed method for the understanding. The proposed numerical method in this paper provides the way to enable neural network-based machine learning algorithms to solve a broader range of problems arising from engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Real-time Bayesian inference at extreme scale: A digital twin for tsunami early warning applied to the Cascadia subduction zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian inversion-based digital twin that employs acoustic pressure data from seafloor sensors, along with 3D coupled acoustic-gravity wave equations, to infer earthquake-induced spatiotemporal seafloor motion in real time and forecast tsunami propagation toward coastlines for early warning with quantified uncertainties. Our target is the Cascadia subduction zone, with one billion parameters. Computing the posterior mean alone would require 50 years on a 512 GPU machine. Instead, exploiting the shift invariance of the parameter-to-observable map and devising novel parallel algorithms, we induce a fast offline-online decomposition. The offline component requires just one adjoint wave propagation per sensor; using MFEM, we scale this part of the computation to the full El Capitan system (43,520 GPUs) with 92% weak parallel efficiency. Moreover, given real-time data, the online component exactly solves the Bayesian inverse and forecasting problems in 0.2 seconds on a modest GPU system, a ten-billion-fold speedup.</description>

      <title>3D-1D modelling of cranial plate heating induced by low or medium frequency magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety assessment of patients with one-dimensionally structured passive implants, like cranial plates or stents, exposed to low or medium frequency magnetic fields, like those generated in magnetic resonance imaging or magnetic hyperthermia, can be challenging, because of the different length scales of the implant and the human body. Most of the methods used to estimate the heating induced near such implants neglect the presence of the metallic materials within the body, modeling the metal as thermal seeds. To overcome this limitation, a novel numerical approach that solves three-dimensional and one-dimensional coupled problems is proposed. This method leads to improved results by modelling the thermal diffusion through the highly conductive metallic implants. A comparison of the proposed method predictions with measurements performed on a cranial plate exposed to the magnetic field generated by a gradient coil system for magnetic resonance imaging is presented, showing an improved accuracy up to 25 % with respect to the method based on thermal seeds. The proposed method is finally applied to a magnetic hyperthermia case study in which a patient with a cranial plate is exposed to the magnetic field generated by a collar-type magnetic hyperthermia applicator for neck tumour treatment, predicting a temperature increase in proximity of the implant that is 10 % lower than the one overestimated by relying on thermal seeds.</description>

      <title>Linear convergence of a one-cut conditional gradient method for total variation regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a fully-corrective generalized conditional gradient method for convex minimization problems involving total variation regularization on multidimensional domains. It relies on alternating between updating an active set of subsets of the spatial domain as well as of an iterate given by a conic combination of the associated characteristic functions. Different to previous approaches in the same spirit, the computation of a new candidate set only requires the solution of one prescribed mean curvature problem instead of the resolution of a fractional minimization task analogous to finding a generalized Cheeger set. After discretization, the former can be realized by a single run of a graph cut algorithm leading to significant speedup in practice. We prove the global sublinear convergence of the resulting method, under mild assumptions, and its asymptotic linear convergence in a more restrictive two-dimensional setting which uses results of stability of surfaces of prescribed curvature under perturbations of the curvature. Finally, we numerically demonstrate this convergence behavior in some model PDE-constrained minimization problems.</description>

      <title>GenEO spectral coarse spaces in SPD domain decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.00280v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-level domain decomposition methods are preconditioned Krylov solvers. What separates one- and two-level domain decomposition methods is the presence of a coarse space in the latter. The abstract Schwarz framework is a formalism that allows to define and study a large variety of two-level methods. The objective of this article is to define, in the abstract Schwarz framework, a family of coarse spaces called the GenEO coarse spaces (for Generalized Eigenvalues in the Overlaps). In detail, this work is a generalization of several methods, each of which exists for a particular choice of domain decomposition method. The article both unifies the GenEO theory and extends it to new settings. The proofs are based on an abstract Schwarz theory which now applies to coarse space corrections by projection, and has been extended to consider singular local solves. Bounds for the condition numbers of the preconditioned operators are proved that are independent of the parameters in the problem (e.g., any coefficients in an underlying PDE or the number of subdomains). The coarse spaces are computed by finding low- or high-frequency spaces of some well-chosen generalized eigenvalue problems in each subdomain. The abstract framework is illustrated by defining two-level Additive Schwarz, Neumann-Neumann and Inexact Schwarz preconditioners for a two-dimensional linear elasticity problem. Explicit theoretical bounds as well as numerical results are provided for this example.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of the Stokes problem under modified pressure Dirichlet boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper shows that the Stokes problem is well-posed when velocity and pressure simultaneously vanish on the domain boundary. This result is achieved by extending Ne\v{c}as' inequality to square-integrable functions that vanish in a small band covering the boundary. It is found that the associated a priori pressure estimate depends inversely on the volume of the band. Numerical experiments confirm these findings. Based on these results, guidelines are provided for applying vanishing pressure boundary conditions in model coupling and domain decomposition methods.</description>

      <title>On a shrink-and-expand technique for symmetric block eigensolvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In symmetric block eigenvalue algorithms, such as the subspace iteration algorithm and the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) algorithm, a large block size is often employed to achieve robustness and rapid convergence. However, using a large block size also increases the computational cost. Traditionally, the block size is typically reduced after convergence of some eigenpairs, known as deflation. In this work, we propose a non-deflation-based, more aggressive technique, where the block size is adjusted dynamically during the algorithm. This technique can be applied to a wide range of block eigensolvers, reducing computational cost without compromising convergence speed. We present three adaptive strategies for adjusting the block size, and apply them to four well-known eigensolvers as examples. Detailed theoretical analysis and numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed technique. In practice, an overall acceleration of 20% to 30% is observed.</description>

      <title>Deep Gaussian Process Priors for Bayesian Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In image reconstruction, an accurate quantification of uncertainty is of great importance for informed decision making. Here, the Bayesian approach to inverse problems can be used: the image is represented through a random function that incorporates prior information which is then updated through Bayes' formula. However, finding a prior is difficult, as images often exhibit non-stationary effects and multi-scale behaviour. Thus, usual Gaussian process priors are not suitable. Deep Gaussian processes, on the other hand, encode non-stationary behaviour in a natural way through their hierarchical structure. To apply Bayes' formula, one commonly employs a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. In the case of deep Gaussian processes, sampling is especially challenging in high dimensions: the associated covariance matrices are large, dense, and changing from sample to sample. A popular strategy towards decreasing computational complexity is to view Gaussian processes as the solutions to a fractional stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). In this work, we investigate efficient computational strategies to solve the fractional SPDEs occurring in deep Gaussian process sampling, as well as MCMC algorithms to sample from the posterior. Namely, we combine rational approximation and a determinant-free sampling approach to achieve sampling via the fractional SPDE. We test our techniques in standard Bayesian image reconstruction problems: upsampling, edge detection, and computed tomography. In these examples, we show that choosing a non-stationary prior such as the deep GP over a stationary GP can improve the reconstruction. Moreover, our approach enables us to compare results for a range of fractional and non-fractional regularity parameter values.</description>

      <title>The deep multi-FBSDE method: a robust deep learning method for coupled FBSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the deep multi-FBSDE method for robust approximation of coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs), focusing on cases where the deep BSDE method of Han, Jentzen, and E (2018) fails to converge. To overcome the convergence issues, we consider a family of FBSDEs that are equivalent to the original problem in the sense that they satisfy the same associated partial differential equation (PDE). Our algorithm proceeds in two phases: first, we approximate the initial condition for the FBSDE family, and second, we approximate the original FBSDE using the initial condition approximated in the first phase. Numerical experiments show that our method converges even when the standard deep BSDE method does not.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian finite elements in Sobolev-like spaces of order $3/2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Sobolev-like space of order $3/2$, denoted as $\widehat{H}^{3/2}$, for Lagrangian finite elements, especially for $C^0$ elements. It is motivated by the limitations of current stability analysis of the evolving surface finite element method (ESFEM), which relies exclusively on an energy estimate framework. To establish a PDE-based analysis framework for ESFEM, we encounter a fundamental regularity mismatch: the ESFEM adopts the $C^0$ elements, while the PDE regularity theory requires $H^{3/2}$ regularity for solutions. To overcome this difficulty, we first examine the properties of the continuous $H^{3/2}$ space, then introduce a Dirichlet lift and Scott-Zhang type interpolation operators to bridge to the discrete $\widehat{H}^{3/2}$ space. Our new $\widehat{H}^{3/2}$ space is shown to be compatible with the elliptic PDE regularity theory, the trace inequality, and the inverse inequality. Notably, we extend the critical domain deformation estimate in ESFEM to the $\widehat{H}^{3/2}$ setting. The $\widehat{H}^{3/2}$ theory provides a foundation for establishing a PDE-based convergence analysis framework of ESFEM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11266v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning has become a popular tool across many scientific fields, including the study of differential equations, particularly partial differential equations. This work introduces the basic principles of deep learning and the Deep Galerkin method, which uses deep neural networks to solve differential equations. This primer aims to provide technical and practical insights into the Deep Galerkin method and its implementation. We demonstrate how to solve the one-dimensional heat equation step-by-step. We also show how to apply the Deep Galerkin method to solve systems of ordinary differential equations and integral equations, such as the Fredholm of the second kind. Additionally, we provide code snippets within the text and the complete source code on Github. The examples are designed so that one can run them on a simple computer without needing a GPU.</description>

      <title>Constructing optimal Wannier functions via potential theory: isolated single band for matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rapidly convergent scheme for computing globally optimal Wannier functions of isolated single bands for matrix models in two dimensions. The scheme proceeds first by constructing provably exponentially localized Wannier functions directly from parallel transport (with simple analytically computable corrections) when topological obstructions are absent. We prove that the corresponding Wannier functions are real when the matrix model possesses time-reversal symmetry. When a band has a nonzero Berry curvature, the resulting Wannier function is not optimal, but it is transformed into the global optimum by a single gauge transformation that eliminates the divergence of the Berry connection. Complete analysis of the construction is presented, paving the way for further improvements and generalizations. The performance of the scheme is illustrated with several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model for a universal digital quantum computer with an application to the Grover-Rudolph algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13388v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel mathematical framework for universal digital quantum computation using algebraic probability theory. We rigorously define quantum circuits as finite sequences of elementary quantum gates and establish their role in implementing unitary transformations. A key result demonstrates that every unitary matrix in \(\mathrm{U}(N)\) can be expressed as a product of elementary quantum gates, leading to the concept of a universal dictionary for quantum computation. We apply this framework to the construction of quantum circuits that encode probability distributions, focusing on the Grover-Rudolph algorithm. By leveraging controlled quantum gates and rotation matrices, we design a quantum circuit that approximates a given probability density function. Numerical simulations, conducted using Qiskit, confirm the theoretical predictions and validate the effectiveness of our approach. These results provide a rigorous foundation for quantum circuit synthesis within an algebraic probability framework and offer new insights into the encoding of probability distributions in quantum algorithms. Potential applications include quantum machine learning, circuit optimization, and experimental implementations on real quantum hardware.</description>
