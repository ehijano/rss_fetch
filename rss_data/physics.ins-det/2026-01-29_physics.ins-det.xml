      <title>Optimising Re-entrant Cavity Designs for Low Mass Axion Haloscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion haloscopes provide a leading experimental approach to detecting QCD axion dark matter through resonant axion-photon conversion in microwave cavities. Extending haloscope sensitivity to low axion masses remains challenging due to the large resonator volumes required at sub-GHz frequencies. Re-entrant cavities offer a compact solution, but their performance depends strongly on geometric optimisation. We present a comprehensive finite-element study of re-entrant cavity haloscope designs operating in the 100 to 500 MHz range, comparing their performance using effective scan time as a figure of merit. Among the configurations studied, we identify a double attack geometry that achieves a roughly threefold improvement in effective scan time compared to a conventional single-rod re-entrant cavity. We further investigate practical implementation strategies, including a hybrid design employing one fixed rod and one tunable rod, which preserves a scan time gain while reducing mechanical complexity. These results demonstrate a pathway to enhanced low-mass axion haloscope sensitivity.</description>

      <title>TIARA: a fast gamma-ray detector for range monitoring in Proton Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a novel gamma-ray detection system (TIARA) for range monitoring in Particle Therapy. The system employs Cherenkov-based gamma-ray detection modules arranged around the target or patient, operated in time coincidence with a fast plastic beam monitor (described in a separate paper). This work focuses on the design and comprehensive characterization of the gamma-ray detection module. It consists of a monolithic PbF$_2$ crystal (2 $\times$ 1.5 $\times$ 1.5 cm$^{3}$) coupled to a 2 $\times$ 2 SiPM matrix from Hamamatsu. A series of beam tests at different clinical facilities (MEDICYC and ProteusOne in France, CNAO in Italy) enabled the determination of the detector time resolution under various conditions, with values ranging from 222 to 283 ps FWHM (Full Width Half Maximum). Monte Carlo simulations including the optical response of PbF$_2$ allowed for the determination of the detection efficiency as a function of particle type and energy. For the final TIARA prototype, which will be composed of 30 modules, an overall detection efficiency of 0.45% is expected. Comparison with experimental data confirmed that the modules are effectively insensitive to neutrons, yielding an excellent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), with an estimated SNR of 17 for a module placed at 25 cm from the 148 MeV proton beam axis. These features translate into high range accuracy: while the performance varies with beam energy and irradiation conditions, a range accuracy of 3.3 mm at 2$\sigma$ significance level was achieved at low intensity with 63 MeV protons at MEDICYC, for a small irradiation spot of $\mathbf{\sim}$10$\mathbf{^{7}}$ protons.</description>

      <title>Improvements of the ALICE GPU TPC tracking and GPU framework for online and offline processing of Run 3 Pb-Pb data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ALICE is the dedicated heavy ion experiment at the LHC at CERN and records lead-lead collisions at a rate of up to 50 kHz in LHC Run 3. To cope with such collision and data rates, ALICE uses a new GEM TPC with continuous readout and a GPU-based online computing farm for data compression. Operating the first GEM TPC of this size with large space charge distortions due to the high collision rate has many implications for the track reconstruction algorithm, both anticipated and unanticipated. With real Pb-Pb data available, the TPC tracking algorithm needed to be refined, particularly with respect to improved cluster attachment at the inner TPC region. In order to use the online computing farm efficiently for offline processing when there is no beam in the LHC, ALICE is currently running TPC tracking on GPUs also in offline processing. For the future, ALICE aims to run more computing steps on the GPU, and to use other GPU-enabled resources besides its online computing farm. These aspects, along with better possibilities for performance optimizations led to several improvements of the GPU framework and GPU tracking code, particularly using Run Time Compilation (RTC). The talk will give an overview of the improvements for the ALICE tracking code, mostly based on experience from reconstructing real Pb-Pb data with high TPC occupancy. In addition, an overview of the online and offline processing status on GPUs will be given, and an overview of how RTC improves the ALICE tracking code and GPU support.</description>

      <title>Trigger Optimization and Event Classification for Dark Matter Searches in the CYGNO Experiment Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CYGNO experiment employs an optical-readout Time Projection Chamber (TPC) to search for rare low-energy interactions using finely resolved scintillation images. While the optical readout provides rich topological information, it produces large, sparse megapixel images that challenge real-time triggering, data reduction, and background discrimination.
  We summarize two complementary machine-learning approaches developed within CYGNO. First, we present a fast and fully unsupervised strategy for online data reduction based on reconstruction-based anomaly detection. A convolutional autoencoder trained exclusively on pedestal images (i.e. frames acquired with GEM amplification disabled) learns the detector noise morphology and highlights particle-induced structures through localized reconstruction residuals, from which compact Regions of Interest (ROIs) are extracted. On real prototype data, the selected configuration retains (93.0 +/- 0.2)% of reconstructed signal intensity while discarding (97.8 +/- 0.1)% of the image area, with ~25 ms per-frame inference time on a consumer GPU.
  Second, we report a weakly supervised application of the Classification Without Labels (CWoLa) framework to data acquired with an Americium--Beryllium neutron source. Using only mixed AmBe and standard datasets (no event-level labels), a convolutional classifier learns to identify nuclear-recoil-like topologies. The achieved performance approaches the theoretical limit imposed by the mixture composition and isolates a high-score population with compact, approximately circular morphologies consistent with nuclear recoils.</description>

      <title>Probing dark matter interactions with a RES-NOVA prototype cryogenic detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the operation of a 13 g PbWO$_4$ crystal, grown from archaeological Pb and operated as a cryogenic calorimeter in an underground environment. Read out with a Ge thermistor, the detector achieves a low energy threshold and, for the first time, enables the derivation of a dark matter exclusion limit using PbWO$_4$ as target material, for both spin-dependent interactions on neutrons and spin-independent interactions. Although limited in mass and not representative of the final RES-NOVA detector design, this prototype demonstrates effective control of mechanical vibrations and low-energy noise in a cryogenic system, which is a key requirement for rare-event searches. The experiment therefore provides a proof of principle for the RES-NOVA detection concept, validating the use of archaeological Pb-based PbWO$_4$ crystals, low-background operation, and robust data-analysis procedures. These results establish a solid technological and methodological foundation for future RES-NOVA detectors employing larger target masses and advanced thermal readout technologies.</description>

      <title>Development of Low-Noise Two-stage dc-SQUID for TES Detector Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct-current superconducting quantum interference devices (dc-SQUIDs) are one of the most sensitive magnetic detectors. These sensors are extensively used in the readout of superconducting transition edge sensors (TESs), which are used for the detection of weak signals. A cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization telescope operating in 22-48 GHz is currently under developing. The TESs calorimeter of the telescope will be readout by a time-division multiplexer (TDM) SQUID readout system. We develop a two-stage dc-SQUID amplifier circuit, comprising an input-stage SQUID with 4 SQUID cells and a series SQUID array (SSA) with 100 SQUID cells. This configuration has been shown to achieve extremely high signal gain while effectively controlling system noise. We assess the system noise at $300$ $mK$ in an adiabatic demagnetisation refrigerator (ADR). The the measured magnetic flux noise of the two-stage SQUID circuit system is approximately $0.3$ ${\mu}\Phi_{0}/\sqrt{Hz}$ at $10$ $kHz$. The current noise equivalent to the input coil of input SQUID is about $2.4$ $pA/\sqrt{Hz}$. This result meets the low-noise readout requirements of the CMB TES and other applications with TES detectors.</description>
