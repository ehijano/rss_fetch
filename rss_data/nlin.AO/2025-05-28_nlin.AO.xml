      <title>Edge Games: Cooperative Partner Selection in Network Cooperation Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The phenomenon of group cooperation constitutes a fundamental mechanism underlying various social and biological systems. Complex networks provide a structural framework for group interactions, where individuals can not only obtain information from their neighbors but also choose neighbors as cooperative partners. However, traditional evolutionary game theory models, where nodes are the game players, are not convenient for directly choosing cooperative partners. Here, we exchange the roles of nodes and edges and innovatively propose the "edge game" model, using edges in complex networks as virtual game players for group games. Theoretical analysis and simulation experiments show that by configuring a synergy factor (r) that satisfies the "moderate cooperation" condition, a stable cooperative structure can be achieved for any network at the evolutionary equilibrium. Specifically, when there is no constraint on the number of cooperators per node, the condition for the evolution of cooperation in the network is r &gt; kmax, where kmax is the maximum degree of the nodes. When there is a threshold constraint, in nearest-neighbor coupled networks (with degree k), the condition for "moderate cooperation" is k &lt; r &lt; 2k. In heterogeneous networks, a variable synergy factor scheme is adopted, where the synergy factor for each game group (rx) is defined to be proportional to the degree of the central node (kx) in the group (rx = n-fold*kx), "moderate cooperation" can be achieved when 1 &lt; n-fold &lt; 2. If the value of r exceeds the range, it may lead to "excessive cooperation" with node overload. Comparing algorithm performance and time complexity, edge games demonstrate advantages over other optimization algorithms. Simple and universal, the edge game provides a new approach to addressing multi-agent cooperation problems in the era of machine intelligence.</description>

      <title>Symmetry's Edge in Cortical Dynamics: Multiscale Dynamics of Ensemble Excitation and Inhibition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11965v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Creating a quantitative theory for the cortex presents challenges and raises questions. What are the significant scales--micro, meso, or macroscopic? What are the interactions--pairwise, higher order, or mean-field? And what control parameters are relevant--noisy, dissipative, or emergent?
  We suggest an approach inspired by advances in understanding matter. This involves identifying invariances in neuron ensemble dynamics, searching for order parameters connecting key degrees of freedom and distinguishing macroscopic states, and pinpointing broken symmetries to uncover emergent laws when neurons interact and coordinate.
  Using multielectrode and multiscale neural recordings, we measure population-level ensemble Excitation/Inhibition (E/I) balance, differing from the input-level E/I balance of single neurons, to study collective behavior in large neural populations. We investigate a set of parameters that can assist us in differentiating between various functional system states (during wake/sleep cycle) and pinpointing broken symmetries that serve different information processing and memory functions. Furthermore, we identify pathological broken symmetries that result in states like seizures.</description>

      <title>Teleportation fidelity of quantum repeater networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the average of the maximum teleportation fidelities between all pairs of nodes in a large quantum repeater network is a measure of the resourcefulness of the network as a whole. We use simple Werner state-based models to characterise some fundamental (loopless) topologies (star, chain, and some trees) with respect to this measure in three (semi)realistic scenarios. Most of our results are analytic and are applicable for arbitrary network sizes. We identify the parameter ranges where these networks can achieve quantum advantages and show the large-N behaviours.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear second-order dynamics describe labial constriction trajectories across languages and contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08351v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of labial constriction trajectories during the production of /b/ and /m/ in English and Mandarin. We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</description>
