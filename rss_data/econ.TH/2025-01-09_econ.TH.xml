      <title>Bundled School Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel school choice system by incorporating school bundles into the standard framework. Schools are grouped into hierarchical bundles and offered to students as options for preference reports. By listing a bundle, a student seeks admission to any school within the bundle without ranking them. This approach addresses students' difficulty in forming precise preference rankings and expands the number of schools students can report on constrained preference lists, potentially enhancing their match likelihood and welfare. We develop a modified deferred acceptance mechanism that maintains stability while accommodating bundle reports. Laboratory experiments validate our theoretical findings, showing that well-designed bundles aligned with student preferences improve welfare and matching rates without compromising fairness. Practical applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Making school choice lotteries transparent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lotteries are commonly employed in school choice to fairly resolve priority ties; however, current practices leave students uninformed about their lottery outcomes when submitting preferences. This paper advocates for revealing lottery results prior to preference submission. When preference lists are constrained in length, revealing lotteries can reduce uncertainties and enable informed decision-making regarding the selection of schools to rank. Through three stylized models, we demonstrate the benefits of lottery revelation in resolving conflicting preferences, equalizing opportunities among students with varying outside options, and alleviating the neighborhood school bias. Our findings are further supported by a laboratory experiment.</description>

      <title>Gains-from-Trade in Bilateral Trade with a Broker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study bilateral trade with a broker, where a buyer and seller interact exclusively through the broker. The broker strategically maximizes her payoff through arbitrage by trading with the buyer and seller at different prices. We study whether the presence of the broker interferes with the mechanism's gains-from-trade (GFT) achieving a constant-factor approximation to the first-best gains-from-trade (FB).
  We first show that the GFT achieves a $1 / 36$-approximation to the FB even if the broker runs an optimal posted-pricing mechanism under symmetric agents with monotone-hazard-rate distributions. Beyond posted-pricing mechanisms, even if the broker uses an arbitrary incentive-compatible (IC) and individually-rational (IR) mechanism that maximizes her expected profit, we prove that it induces a $1 / 2$-approximation to the first-best GFT when the buyer and seller's distributions are uniform distributions with arbitrary support. This bound is shown to be tight.
  We complement such results by proving that if the broker uses an arbitrary profit-maximizing IC and IR mechanism, there exists a family of problem instances under which the approximation factor to the first-best GFT becomes arbitrarily bad. We show that this phenomenon persists even if we restrict one of the buyer's or seller's distributions to have a singleton support, or even in the symmetric setting where the buyer and seller have identical distributions.</description>
