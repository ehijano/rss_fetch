      <title>Prospects for studying million-degree gas in the Milky Way halo using the forbidden optical [FeX] and [FeXIV] intersystem lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Milky Way is surrounded by large amounts of hot gas at temperatures T&gt;10^6 K, which represents a major baryon reservoir. We here explore the prospects of studying the hot coronal gas in Milky Way halo by analyzing the highly forbidden optical coronal lines of [FeX] and [FeXIV] in absorption against bright extragalactic background sources. We use a semi-analytic model of the Milky Way's coronal gas distribution together wih HESTIA simulations of the Local Group and observational constraints to predict the expected FeX and FeXIV column densities as well as the line shapes and strengths. We predict column densities of log N(FeX)=15.40 and log N(FeXIV)=15.23 in the Milky Way's hot halo and estimate that a minimum S/N of 50,000 (25,000) is required to detect [FeX] l6374.5 ([FeXIV] l5302.9) absorption at a 3sigma level. Using archical optical data from an original sample of 739 high resolution AGN spectra from VLT/UVES and KECK/HIRES, we generate a stacked composite spectrum to measure an upper limit for the column densities of FeX and FeXIV in the Milky Way's coronal gas. No [FeX] and [FeXIV] is detected in our composite spectrum, which achieves a maximum S/N= 1,240 near 5300 A. We derive 3sigma upper column-density limits of log N(FeX)&lt;16.27 and log N(FeXIV)&lt;15.85, in line with the above-mentioned predictions. While [FeX] and [FexIX] absorption is too weak to be detected with current optical data, we outline how up-coming extragalactic spectral surveys with millions of medium- to high-resolution optical spectra will provide the necessary sensitivity and spectral resolution to measure velocity-resolved [FeX] and [FeXIV] absorption in the Milky Way's coronal gas (and beyond). This gives the prospect of opening a new window for studying the dominant baryonic mass component of the Milky Way in the form of hot coronal gas via optical spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Reverberation Response of the Broad Line Region in Active Galactic Nuclei II: Incorporating Photoionization Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The broad emission lines (BELs) emitted by Active Galactic Nuclei respond to variations in the ionizing continuum emission from the accretion disk surrounding the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). This reverberation response provides insights into the structure and dynamics of the Broad Line Region (BLR). In Rosborough et al., 2024, we introduced a new forward-modeling tool, the Broad Emission Line MApping Code (BELMAC), which simulates the velocity-resolved reverberation response of the BLR to an input light curve. In this work, we describe a new version of BELMAC, which uses photoionization models to calculate the cloud luminosities for selected BELs. We investigated the reverberation responses of H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, MgII$\lambda$2800 and CIV$\lambda$1550 for models representing a disk-like BLR with Keplerian rotation, radiatively driven outflows, and inflows. The line responses generally provide a good indication of the respective luminosity-weighted radii. However, there are situations when the BLR exhibits a negative response to the driving continuum, causing overestimates of the luminosity-weighted radius. The virial mass derived from the models can differ dramatically from the actual SMBH mass, depending mainly on the disk inclination and velocity field. In single zone models, the BELs exhibit similar responses and profile shapes; two-zone models, such as a Keplerian disk and a biconical outflow, can reproduce observed differences between high- and low-ionization lines. Radial flows produce asymmetric line profile shapes due to both anisotropic cloud emission and electron scattering in an inter-cloud medium. These competing attenuation effects complicate the interpretation of profile asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Double tidal disruption events in the changing-look AGN Mrk1018</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal disruption events (TDEs) as excellent beacons to black hole (BH) accreting systems have been studied for more than five decades with a single star tidally disrupted by a central massive BH. However, if considering two stars passing through a central BH and being tidally disrupted in a short period, so-called double TDEs could be expected and lead to unique variability features very different from features from standard TDEs. Here, we report such oversimplified double TDEs in the known changing-look AGN Mrk1018, of which 15years-long light curve with plateau features can be described by two main-sequence stars tidally disrupted by the central supermassive BH. Meanwhile, the BH mass determined by the double TDEs is consistent with the M-sigma relation determined value by the measured stellar velocity dispersions in Mrk1018. The results indicate tight connections between the TDEs and the changing-look properties in Mrk1018.</description>

      <title>ALMA-IMF XIX: C18O (J=2-1): Measurements of turbulence in 15 massive protoclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ALMA-IMF is a large program of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) that aims to determine the origin of the core mass function (CMF) of 15 massive Galactic protoclusters (~ 1.0-25.0 x 10^3 solar mass within ~ 2.5 x 2.5 pc^2 ) located towards the Galactic plane. In addition, the objective of the program is to obtain a thorough understanding of their physical and kinematic properties. Here we study the turbulence in these protoclusters with C18O (2-1) emission line using the sonic Mach number analysis (M_s ) and the size-linewidth relation. The probability distribution functions (PDFs) for M_s show a similar pattern, exhibiting no clear trend associated with evolutionary stage, peaking in the range between 4 and 7, and then extending to ~ 25. Such values of M_s indicate that the turbulence in the density regime traced by the C18O line inside the protoclusters is supersonic in nature. In addition, we compare the non-thermal velocity dispersions (sigma_nth, C18O) obtained from the C18O(2-1) line with the non-thermal line widths (sigma_nth, DCN ) of the cores obtained from the DCN (3-2) line. We observe that, on average, the non-thermal linewidth in cores is half that of the gas surrounding them. This suggests that turbulence diminishes at smaller scales or dissipates at the periphery of the cores. Furthermore, we examine the size-linewidth relation for the structures we extracted from the position-position-velocity C18O(2-1) line emission cube with dendrogram algorithm. The power-law index (p) obtained from the size-linewidth relation is between 0.41 and 0.64, steeper than the Kolmogorov law of turbulence, as expected for compressible media. In conclusion, this work is one of the first to carry out such a statistical study of turbulence for embedded massive protoclusters.</description>

      <title>The ALMA Survey of 70 $\mu$m Dark High-mass Clumps in Early Stages (ASHES). XII. Unanchored Forked Stream in the Propogating Path of a Protostellar Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outflows are key indicators of ongoing star formation. We report the discovery of an unanchored forked stream within the propagating path of an extremely young protostellar outflow in the 70 $\mu$m-dark clump G34.74-0.12, based on ALMA 1.3 mm observations with an angular resolution of 1''.6 (~ 5000 au). This outflow originate from a 9.7 $M_{\odot}$ core, exhibits a fork-shaped stream structure in its red-shifted lobe, which is traced by CO (2-1), SiO (5-4), and H$_2$CO (3$_{0,3}$-2$_{0,2}$). It has a momentum of 13 $M_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$, an energy of 107 $M_{\odot}$ km$^{2}$ s$^{-2}$, and a dynamical timescale of ~10$^{4}$ yr. Significantly, the enhanced relative abundances of SiO, H$_2$CO, and CH$_3$OH with respect to CO, along with the increased temperature at the forked point, indicate a collisional origin. The forked point does not coincide with any dust continuum core &gt; 0.1 $M_{\odot}$. Moreover, CO (2-1) emission also traces three other outflows in this region, characterized by their masses (0.40, 0.02 and 0.15 $M_{\odot}$) and momenta (5.2, 0.2, 1.8 $M_{\odot}$ km s$^{-1}$), as part of the ALMA Survey of 70 $\mu$m dark High-mass clumps in Early Stages (ASHES) project. All the newly discovered morphological and kinematic features associated with these extremely young protostellar outflows (with timescales of 10$^3$ - 10$^4$ years) suggest that the initial stages of star formation are more complicated than previously understood.</description>

      <title>Metallicity fluctuation statistics in the interstellar medium and young stars -- II. Elemental cross-correlations and the structure of chemical abundance space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of Milky Way stars by multiplexed spectroscopic instruments and of gas in nearby galaxies using integral field units have made it possible to measure the abundances of multiple elements in both the interstellar medium and the stars that form out of it. These observations have revealed complex correlations between elemental abundances, but thus far there has been no theoretical framework to interpret these data. In this paper we extend the simple stochastically-forced diffusion model of Krumholz &amp; Ting (2018), which has proven successful at explaining the spatial abundance patterns of single elements, to multiple elements, clarifying why elements are correlated and what controls their degree of correlation, and making quantitative predictions for the degree of correlation in both gas and young stars. We show that our results are qualitatively consistent with observed patterns, and point out how application of this theory to measured correlations should enable determination of currently unknown parameters describing r-process nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Dwarf-Dwarf interactions and their influence on star formation : Insights from post-merger galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf galaxies dominate the galaxy population across all redshifts, and majority of mergers are expected to occur between them. However, the impact of dwarf-dwarf mergers on star formation (SF) is less understood. In this context, we study SF in 6,155 isolated dwarf galaxies (no massive galaxy, $M_{*} &gt; 10^{10} M_{\odot}$, within 1 Mpc$^3$), including 194 post-mergers and 5,961 non-interacting galaxies, spanning stellar masses of $10^7$ - $10^{9.6}$ M$_{\odot}$ and redshifts of 0.01 - 0.12. Post-mergers sample is from a previous study, which used deep optical images to identify dwarf galaxies with merger signatures. Using GALEX FUV data, we estimate star formation rates (SFRs) and find difference in log(SFR) between a post-merger galaxy and the median of its corresponding control sample, matched in stellar mass and redshift. SFR offsets range from -2 to +2 dex, indicating both enhancement and suppression of SF in our sample with 67% of post-mergers showing enhancement. The median SFR is found to be elevated by 0.24 dex ($\sim$1.73 times) in post-mergers, comparable to enhancements seen in massive galaxies. SF is found to be similarly enhanced in both the central (6" diameter region) and outer regions of post-mergers with respect to their non-interacting counterparts. This is in contrast to what is observed in massive galaxies, where the merger-triggered SF is more significant in the central regions. In the given small range of redshift, post-merger dwarfs exhibit a higher median specific SFR compared to their non-interacting counterparts. About 33% of post-mergers are quenched, possibly reflecting a later stage of the post-merger regime, where quenching can happen as observed in massive galaxies. This study suggests that dwarf-dwarf mergers can affect SF in the local universe. A more comprehensive study of post-merger dwarfs is required to understand their evolution.</description>

      <title>The Superclouds of the Local Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent 3D dust maps of the local Milky Way are revolutionizing our understanding of the Sun's Galactic neighborhood, bringing much-needed insight into the large-scale organization of the interstellar medium. Focusing on the largest scales in $\textit{Gaia}$-based 3D dust maps, we find a pattern of seven highly elongated, mostly parallel structures in the local $5\,\mathrm{kpc}^2$, five of which were previously unknown. These structures show pitch angles of $33.5 \pm 4.0 ^\circ$, and masses ranging from $10^5$ to $10^6$ $M_\odot$. We refer to these structures as superclouds. Nearly all known star-forming regions in the solar neighborhood lie within the superclouds, primarily along their central axes, supporting the idea that they are precursors to giant molecular clouds. All but one of the seven superclouds show an underlying undulation, indicating that this is not a property unique to the Radcliffe wave. We find that while the superclouds have line masses that vary by about a factor of four, their volume densities vary by about 10$\%$ only. This suggests that superclouds self-regulate their physical sizes and internal structure to maintain pressure equilibrium with their environment. These findings establish a new framework for understanding how large-scale Galactic structures shape the conditions for star formation in the solar vicinity, and likely in galaxies like the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Simple model of violent relaxation of a spherical stellar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A spherical system with arbitrary mean velocities in the radial and transverse directions, but with zero dispersion of radial velocities, is considered as a model describing the violent relaxation of star clusters and galaxies. The model allows to reduce the infinite chain of Jeans' equations of moments to just three hydrodynamic equations. The found system of equations is consistent with the law of conservation of energy and the virial equation. This part of the work is devoted to a general description of the model, then the calculation results will be presented.</description>

      <title>Exploring Spatially-Resolved Metallicities, Dynamics and Outflows in Low-Mass Galaxies at $z \sim 7.6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A majority of JWST/NIRSpec/IFU studies at high redshifts to date have focused on UV-bright or massive objects, while our understanding of low-mass galaxies at early cosmic times remains limited. In this work, we present NIRSpec/IFS high-resolution observations of two low-mass ($M_* &lt; 10^9 \ M_\odot$), low-metallicity ($[12 + \log(\text{O/H})] &lt; 8$) galaxies at $z \sim 7.66$ with evidence of hosting AGN. Using spatially-resolved maps of rest-frame optical emission lines, we find flat metallicity profiles, indicative of ISM redistribution by outflows or past merging. We identify kinematical components decoupled from galactic rotation with velocities of $\sim 250 - 500 \ \text{km} \ \text{s}^{-1}$. We argue that these components are likely tracing outflows, possibly AGN-driven, for which we infer outflow rates of $\sim 21 - 40 \ M_\odot \ \text{yr}^{-1}$, suggesting they may suppress future star formation. We compare our observational results to those from the new large-volume AESOPICA simulations, which fully incorporate different models of black hole growth and AGN feedback. We find that our observational results of $v_\text{out}/v_\text{esc}$ and $\dot{M}_\text{out}$/SFR are consistent with the AGN population in these simulations, hinting that AGN-driven feedback may contribute to quenching both in our systems and in a wider population of low-mass galaxies in the early Universe. This novel study demonstrates the necessity of deep IFU observations to decompose the complex kinematics and morphology of high-$z$ galaxies, trace outflows, and constrain the effect of feedback in these low-mass systems.</description>

      <title>An Integral Field Spectroscopy Study Of Thin And Thick Discs In IC 2531</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thin and thick discs are prominent components in the Milky Way and other spiral galaxies, but their formation histories are not yet understood, which is particularly true for thick discs. This is partially due to the fact that we lack sufficient understanding of thin and thick discs in other galaxies to determine how common features of the Milky Way's discs are. Here, we conduct an integral field spectroscopy study of the thin and thick discs in the edge-on Milky Way analogue IC 2531, using observational data from the WiFeS IFU spectrograph on the ANU 2.3m telescope. We provide spectral analysis of IC 2531's kinematics and stellar populations in the thin and thick disc regions by conducting pPXF fitting with Vazdekis models. We found that IC 2531's disc above the dust plane generally has chemical properties between the Milky Way's chemical thin and thick disc. IC 2531's thick disc is somewhat similar to the Milky Way's in terms of stellar populations: on average, it is older, more metal-poor than its corresponding thin disc, but similarly alpha-enhanced in general. But we do find a clearly alpha-rich thick disc bin though one of our "thick disc" bins may be dominated by a warped thin disc. These results may help to constrain formation theories of thick discs.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Bar-Induced Stellar Kinematics in Disk Galaxies: The Bisymmetric Model and Rotation Curve Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze bars formed in $N$-body simulations to investigate two key aspects of stellar kinematic structure of barred galaxies: the angular distributions of the radial and azimuthal components of stellar velocities, and the impact of bars on rotation curves. We find that stars on bar-supporting $x_1$-like orbits exhibit characteristic sawtooth-like radial velocity patterns and arch-like tangential velocity patterns as a function of azimuth. In contrast, stars on box and disk orbits show little azimuthal variation, effectively smoothing the overall velocity distribution. When averaged over all orbital families, the resulting kinematics are broadly consistent with the bisymmetric model of Spekkens &amp; Sellwood, with the amplitudes of bar-induced velocity perturbations increasing with bar strength. In addition, bars amplify the radial pressure gradient associated with enhanced random stellar motions, leading to a noticeable reduction in the mean rotational velocity. This effect becomes more pronounced with increasing bar strength, resulting in a shallower rotation curve within the bar region. We discuss our results in the context of the kinematic properties of observed barred galaxies.</description>

      <title>The H$\alpha$ concentration of local star-forming galaxies: implications for galaxy structure formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a study on the H$\alpha$ emission line flux concentration of 3098 low-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs) using the MaNGA data available in the Data Release 17 from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We define the H$\alpha$ flux concentration index ($C_{\rm H\alpha}$) as $C_{\rm H\alpha}=F_{\rm H\alpha,0.8~R_e}/F_{\rm H\alpha,1.5~R_e}$, where $F_{\rm H\alpha,0.8~R_e}$ and $F_{\rm H\alpha,1.5~R_e}$ are the cumulative H$\alpha$ flux inside $0.8$ and $1.5$ $r-$band effective radius, respectively. We find that $C_{\rm H\alpha}$ is strongly correlated with the luminosity weighted stellar age gradient. $C_{\rm H\alpha}$ is also sensitive to environmental effects, in the sense that low-mass satellite galaxies below the star formation main sequence tend to have higher $C_{\rm H\alpha}$. For central galaxies, we find that massive disk galaxies with enhanced star formation rate tend to have higher $C_{\rm H\alpha}$, while such a phenomenon is not seen in the low-mass regime. We interpret this as evidence that compaction events more frequently occur in the high-mass regime, which eventually resulting in the buildup of prominent bulges in massive SFGs. Implications of these findings on galaxy structure formation are discussed.</description>

      <title>Spiral arms across stellar populations in simulations via the local dimension method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The origin and nature of spiral arms remain unclear. Star forming regions and young stars are generally strongly associated to the spiral structure, but there are few quantitative predictions from simulations about the involvement of stars of different ages. Aims. We aim to quantify the interplay between spiral arms and different populations. Methods. We use a hydrodynamical simulation of an isolated disc galaxy displaying a dynamic multi-armed spiral structure. Inspired by cosmological structure metrics, we develop a new method, the local dimension, that robustly delineates arms across populations and through space and time. Results. We find that all stars, including those as old as 11Gyr, support the arms. The spiral strength decreases with stellar age up to 2Gyr-old stars and remains nearly constant for older stars. However, the scaling between arm strength and age (or velocity dispersion) depends on the strength of the global spiral structure at each time. Almost all stars formed in arms remain within them for no more than 140-180Myr, whereas old stars leave arms about three times faster. Even if the youngest populations dominate in the production of the spiral torques at early times, all populations contribute equally at later times. Conclusions. Our results highlight the power of the local dimension for studying complex spiral structures and show that all stellar populations in the disc partake in the arms. Since in our model we see spiral arms in populations with velocity dispersions up to 90km/s, which are comparable to those of the Milky Way, we predict that old Galactic populations could also exhibit spiral structure.</description>

      <title>Inclination Effect on Observational Identification of Outflow Rotation in Magnetohydrodynamics Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the observational signatures of outflow rotation in protostellar systems using magnetohydrodynamics simulations of protostellar evolution with radiative transfer and synthetic observation. The velocity gradient perpendicular to the outflow axis indicates outflow rotation. The rotation signature is clearly seen in the moment 1 map and a position-velocity (PV) diagram across an outflow lobe made from our model with an inclination angle of i&gt;~85{degree sign}, as in observational studies of protostellar outflows. Velocity projection with lower inclinations distorts the moment 1 map because the outflow vertical (propagation) velocity contributes more to the line-of-sight velocity, leading to an incorrect outflow axis direction. The PV diagram adopting the incorrect outflow axis shows no clear velocity gradient. These effects may prevent us from identifying outflow rotation. Our analysis implies that rotational signatures can be obscured in ~2/3 to ~4/5 of the total outflow population (i&lt;70{degree sign}-80{degree sign}), regardless of the evolutionary stage. Complicated structures in observed outflows make it difficult to determine the outflow, which may result in the apparent non-detection of outflow rotation.</description>

      <title>A MeerKAT study of a neutral hydrogen rich grouping of galaxies with megaparsec-scale filamentary-like structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmental effects within cosmological overdensities, such as galaxy groups and clusters, have been shown to impact galaxies and their cold gas reservoirs and thereby provide constraints on galaxy evolution models. Galaxy groups foster frequent galaxy-galaxy interactions, making them rich environments in which to study galaxy transformation. In this work, we study a serendipitously discovered large overdensity of HI galaxies at z~0.04. The galaxies appear to lie in a filamentary-like structure of megaparsec scale. MeerKAT's angular resolution and field of view allow us to spatially resolve the HI galaxies while simultaneously probing large-scale structure. The HI and sub-arcsec Dark Energy Survey (DES) imaging reveal a large number of interacting galaxies in this collective group. MeerKAT data enables us to derive HI masses and investigate interacting galaxies. We use DES and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) data to quantify the star formation rates, stellar masses, and stellar morphologies of member galaxies and compare these with field scaling relations. To place this discovery and the environmental effects in context, we use the SIMBA simulation to investigate the prevalence of qualitatively similar HI overdensities and their large-scale morphological properties. This enables a prediction of how frequently such structures might be serendipitously discovered with MeerKAT and SKA-Mid HI observations in comparable observation time. The combination of spatially resolved HI data and optical imaging reveals a group rich in interactions, suggesting environmental processes are already shaping galaxy properties within the structure. More of these serendipitous discoveries are expected and, alongside ongoing targeted programmes, these will provide a rich sample to study galaxy transformation and enable a MeerKAT HI perspective on large-scale structure, including filaments.</description>

      <title>Chasing the formation history of the Galactic metal-poor disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work, we identified $\sim100,000$ metal-poor stars ([Fe/H] $&lt;$ -1.0) from the LAMOST Survey. This work estimates their chemical abundances and explores the origin and evolution of the Galactic metal-poor disc. Our chemo-dynamical analysis reveals four main populations within the metal-poor disc: (1) a primordial disc older than 12 Gyr with [Fe/H] $&gt;$ -1.5; (2) debris stars from the progenitor galaxy of Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE), but now residing in the Galactic disc; (3) the metal-poor tail of the metal-rich, high-$\alpha$ disc formed 10-12 Gyr ago, with metallicity lower limit extending to -2.0; (4) the metal-poor tail of the metal-rich, low-$\alpha$ disc younger than 8 Gyr, reaching a lower metallicity limit of -1.8. These results reveal the presence of a primordial disc and show that both high-$\alpha$ and low-$\alpha$ discs reach lower metallicities than previously thought. Analysis of merger debris reveals that Wukong, with extremely low metallicity, likely originate from merger events distinct from GSE. Additionally, three new substructures are identified: ShangGu-1, characterized by unusual [Fe/H]-eccentricity correlations; ShangGu-2, possibly heated disc stars; and ShangGu-3, which can be divided into four subgroups based on differing orbital directions, with two aligning with the previously known Nyx and Nyx-2.</description>

      <title>SDSO1 is a Ghost Planetary Nebula Bow Shock in Front of M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new, deep narrow band imagery and discuss the nature of SDSO1, the large [O III]-emitting nebula centered 1.5 degrees SE of M31. We find strong evidence to support the hypothesis that SDSO1 is unrelated to M31 and is instead a bow shock driven by a faded, giant (D = 20 pc), 400 kyr-old, ghost planetary nebula (GPN) expelled by the symbiotic WD binary star EG Andromedae. Because EG And lags the rotation of the Milky Way, its hypersonic velocity of 107 km/s drives a shock into the local interstellar medium. SDSO1 also sports a 45-pc long turbulent tail that crosses M31. We establish the shock-powered GPN phase as a new phase of PN evolution, and identify seven more candidate GPNe by their large size and shock-tail morphology. This includes several giant halos of younger planetary nebulae, possibly expelled by now degenerate binary companions. The interaction of an old, fast-moving GPN with the ISM generates a shock that remains visible long after the photoionized PN shell has faded below the limit of detectability. The SDSO1 GPN has reached a phase in its evolution where its outward expansion has been slowed considerably by the work it has done on the interstellar medium. Once the GPN outflow expends the rest of its kinetic energy, it will be stripped from EG And and mix into the surrounding ISM.</description>

      <title>Optical Counterparts to X-ray sources in LSST DP1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a crossmatch between a combined catalog of X-ray sources and the Vera C. Rubin Observatory Data Preview 1 (DP1) to identify optical counterparts. The six fields targeted as part of DP1 include the Extended Chandra Deep Field South (E-CDF-S), the Euclid Deep Field South (EDF-S), the Fornax Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy (Fornax dSph), 47 Tucanae (47 Tuc) and science validation fields with low galactic and ecliptic latitude (SV\_95\_-25 and SV\_38\_7, respectively). We find matches to 2314 of 3830 X-ray sources. We also compare our crossmatch to DP1 in the E-CDF-S field to previous efforts to identify optical counterparts. The probability of a chance coincidence match varies across each DP1 field, with overall high reliability in the E-CDF-S field, and lower proportion of high-reliability matches in the other fields. The majority of previously known sources that we detect are, unsurprisingly, active galaxies. We plot the X-ray-to-optical flux ratio against optical magnitude and color in an effort to identify Galactic accreting compact objects using a {\em Gaia} color threshold transformed to LSST $g$--$i$, but do not find any strong candidates in these primarily extragalactic counterparts. The DP1 dataset contains high-cadence photometry collected over a number of nights. We calculate the Stetson \( J \) variability index for each object under the hypothesis that X-ray counterparts tend to exhibit higher optical variability; however, the evidence is inconclusive whether our sample is more variable over DP1 timescales when compared to field objects.</description>

      <title>The impact of stellar rotations and binaries on the shape of upper main sequence near turn off in open cluster NGC\,6067</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the analysis of the extended Main Sequence Turn-Off (eMSTO) in the open cluster NGC\,6067. We derive the projected rotational velocity, \textit{v}sin\textit{i}, of the stars belonging to the eMSTO region of the main sequence (MS) utilizing \textit{Gaia}-ESO spectra. Our results reveal a positive correlation between \textit{v}sin\textit{i} and the color of eMSTO stars, where fast-rotating stars predominantly occupy the red part of the MS while slow-rotating ones prefer a bluer side of the MS. The gravity-darkening effect might be a reason for this correlation. We find that most of the close binaries present in the eMSTO population would be slow-rotating due to the tidal-locking phenomenon. We identify four double-lined spectroscopic binaries (SB2) featuring slow-rotating companions, further supporting this tidal-locking hypothesis. However, the spatial distribution and the cumulative radial distribution indicate a higher concentration of red eMSTO stars in the cluster's central region than their bluer counterparts. This suggests that tidal locking is less likely to be the cause of the observed spread in rotation rates among eMSTO stars. Instead, we propose that star-disk interactions during the pre-main-sequence phase might have played a crucial role in spreading the rotation rates of stars, leading to the eMSTO phenomenon in NGC\,6067.</description>

      <title>New Frontiers in the Study of Magnetic Massive Stars with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-mass stars are notable for several reasons: they are characterized by strong winds, which inject momentum and enriched material into their surroundings, and die spectacularly as supernovae, leaving behind compact remnants and heavy elements (such as those that make life on Earth possible). Despite their relative rarity, they play a disproportionate role in the evolution of the galaxies that host them, and likely also played a significant role in the early days of the Universe. A subset ($\sim$10\%) of these stars was also found to host magnetic fields on their surface. These fields impact their evolution, and may lead to exotic physics (e.g., heavy stellar-mass black holes, pair-instability supernovae, magnetars, etc.). However, the detection and measurement of magnetic fields is limited, due to current instrumentation, to nearby massive stars in the Milky Way. To truly understand how magnetism arises in massive stars, and what role it might have played in earlier stages of our Universe, we require next-generation hardware, such as the proposed near-infrared-to-ultraviolet spectropolarimeter Pollux, on the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). In this contribution, we detail how Pollux @ HWO will enable new frontiers in the study of magnetic massive stars, delivering results that will profoundly impact the fields of stellar formation, stellar evolution, compact objects, and stellar feedback.</description>

      <title>The formation and evolution of dust in the colliding-wind binary Apep revealed by JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars are significant contributors of carbonaceous dust to the galactic environment, however the mechanisms and conditions for formation and subsequent evolution of dust around these stars remain open questions. Here we present JWST observations of the WR+WR colliding-wind binary Apep which reveal an intricate series of nested concentric dust shells that are abundant in detailed substructure. The striking regularity in these substructures between successive shells suggests an exactly repeating formation mechanism combined with a highly stable outflow that maintains a consistent morphology even after reaching 0.6 pc (assuming a distance of 2.4 kpc) into the interstellar medium. The concentric dust shells show subtle deviations from spherical outflow, which could reflect orbital modulation along the eccentric binary orbit or some mild degree of non-sphericity in the stellar wind. Tracking the evolution of dust across the multi-tiered structure, we measure the dust temperature evolution that can broadly be described with an amorphous carbon composition in radiative thermal equilibrium with the central stars. The temperature profile and orbital period place new distance constraints that support Apep being at a greater distance than previously estimated, reducing the line-of-sight and sky-plane wind speed discrepancy previously thought to characterise the system.</description>

      <title>The Serpent Eating Its Own Tail: Dust Destruction in the Apep Colliding-Wind Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of the carbonaceous dust observed in the early universe may originate from colliding wind binaries (CWBs) hosting hot, luminous Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Downstream of the shock between the stellar winds there exists a suitable environment for dust grain formation, and the orbital motion of the stars wraps this dust into richly structured spiral geometries. The Apep system is the most extreme WR-CWB in our Milky Way: two WR stars produce a complex spiral dust nebula, whose slow expansion has been linked to a gamma-ray burst progenitor. It has been unclear whether the O-type supergiant 0.7" distant from the WR+WR binary is physically associated with the system, and whether it affects the dusty nebula. Multi-epoch VLT/VISIR and JWST/MIRI observations show that this northern companion star routinely carves a cavity in the dust nebula - the first time such an effect has been observed in a CWB - which unambiguously associates the O star as a bound component to the Apep system. These observations are used together with a new geometric model to infer the cavity geometry and the orbit of the WR+WR binary, yielding the first strong constraints on wind and orbital parameters. We confirm an orbital period of over 190 years for the inner binary - nearly an order of magnitude longer than the next longest period dust-producing WR-CWB. This, together with the confirmed classification as a hierarchical triple, cements Apep as a singular astrophysical laboratory for studying colliding winds and the terminal life stages of the most massive star systems.</description>

      <title>An adaptive symplectic integrator for gravitational dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an adaptive symplectic integrator, SQQ-PTQ, developed on the basis of the fixed-step symplectic integrator SQQ. To mitigate the Runge phenomenon, SQQ-PTQ employs Chebyshev interpolation for approximating the action, enhancing both the precision and stability of the interpolation. In addition, to reduce the computational cost of evaluating interpolation functions, SQQ-PTQ introduces a projection method that improves the efficiency of these computations. A key feature of SQQ-PTQ is its use of the time transformation to implement an adaptive time step. To address the challenge of computing complicated Jacobian matrices attributed to the time transformation, SQQ-PTQ adopts a quasi-Newton method based on Broyden's method. This strategy accelerates the solution of nonlinear equations, thereby improving the overall computational performance. The effectiveness and robustness of SQQ-PTQ are demonstrated via three numerical experiments. In particular, SQQ-PTQ demonstrates adaptability in handling close-encounter problems. Moreover, during long-term integrations, SQQ-PTQ maintains the energy conservation, further confirming its advantages as a symplectic algorithm.</description>

      <title>A deep Search for Ethylene Glycol and Glycolonitrile in the V883 Ori Protoplanetary Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ethylene glycol ($\mathrm{(CH_2OH)_2}$, hereafter EG) and Glycolonitrile ($\mathrm{HOCH_2CN}$, hereafter GN) are considered molecular precursors of nucleic acids. EG is a sugar alcohol and the reduced form of Glycolaldehyde ($\mathrm{CH_2(OH)CHO}$, hereafter GA). GN is considered a key precursor of adenine formation (nucleotide) and can be a precursor of glycine (amino acid). Detections of such prebiotic molecules in the interstellar medium are increasingly common. How much of this complexity endures to the planet formation stage, and thus is already present when planets form, remains largely unknown. Here we report Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) observations in which we tentatively detect EG and GN in the protoplanetary disk around the outbursting protostar V883 Ori. The observed EG emission is best reproduced by a column density of $\mathrm{3.63^{+0.11}_{-0.12} \times 10^{16} \; cm^{-2}}$ and a temperature of at least 300 K. The observed GN emission is best reproduced by a column density of $\mathrm{3.37^{+0.09}_{-0.09} \times 10^{16} \; cm^{-2}}$ and a temperature of $88^{+1.2}_{-1.2}$ K. Comparing the abundance of EG and GN relative to methanol in V883 Ori with other objects, V883 Ori falls between hot cores and comets in terms of increasing complexity. This suggests that the build up of prebiotic molecules continues past the hot core phase into the epoch of planet formation. Nascent planets in such environments may inherit essential building blocks for life, enhancing their potential habitability. Further observations of this protoplanetary disk at higher spectral resolution are required to resolve blended lines and to confirm these tentative detection.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Characterization of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS: Water Ice in the Coma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present optical and near-infrared spectroscopy of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, obtained with Gemini-S/GMOS and NASA IRTF/SpeX on 2025 July 5 and July 14. The optical spectrum shows a red slope of approximately 10% per 1000 angstroms between 0.5 and 0.8 microns, closely resembling that of typical D-type asteroids. At longer wavelengths, the near-infrared spectrum flattens significantly to approximately 3% per 1000 angstroms from 0.9 to 1.5 microns, consistent with the spectral behavior of large water ice grains in the coma. Spectral modeling with an areal mixture of 70% Tagish Lake meteorite and 30% 10-micron-sized water ice successfully reproduces both the overall continuum and the broad absorption feature near 2.0 microns. The 1.5-micron water ice band, however, is not detected, likely due to the limited signal-to-noise of the IRTF data and dilution by refractory materials. The ~30% ice fraction should be interpreted as an approximate, order-of-magnitude estimate of the coma composition. The agreement between the GMOS and SpeX spectra, taken nine days apart, suggests short-term stability in the coma's optical properties. Our observations reveal that 3I/ATLAS is an active interstellar comet containing abundant water ice, with a dust composition more similar to D-type asteroids than to ultrared trans-Neptunian objects.</description>

      <title>Optical spectroscopy of blazars for the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory- IV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blazars, including BL Lacs and FSRQs, are the most luminous extragalactic {\gamma}-ray sources. They account for about 56% of the sources listed in the recent Fermi-LAT catalog (4FGL-DR4). The optical and UV spectra of BL Lacs are nearly featureless, making it difficult to precisely determine their redshifts. Consequently, nearly half of the {\gamma}-ray BL Lacs lack reliable redshift measurements. This poses a major challenge, since redshift is crucial for studying the cosmic evolution of the blazar population and {\gamma}-ray propagation studies such as indirect evidence of EBL, placing constraints on IGMF and searches for LIV and ALPs. This paper is the fourth in a series dedicated to determining the redshift of a sample of blazars identified as key targets for future observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO). We performed Monte Carlo simulations to select {\gamma}-ray blazars detected by Fermi-LAT with hard spectra, that lack redshift measurements. These blazars are expected to be detectable by CTAO within 30 hours or less of exposure assuming an average flux state. In this fourth paper, we report the results of detailed spectroscopic observations of 29 blazars using the ESO/VLT, Keck II, and SALT telescopes. Our analysis involved a thorough search for spectral lines in the spectra of each blazar, and when features of the host galaxy were identified, we modeled its properties. We also compared the magnitudes of the targets during the observations to their long-term light curves. In the sample studied, 9 of 29 sources were observed with a high signal-to-noise ratio (S/N &gt; 100), while the remaining 20 were observed with a moderate or low S/N. We successfully determined firm redshifts for 12 blazars, ranging from 0.1636 to 1.1427, and identified two lower limit redshifts at z &gt; 1.0196 and z &gt; 1.4454. The remaining 15 BL Lac objects exhibited featureless spectra.</description>

Abstract: With the same general purposes as Part I of this monograph, we analyze here major events in the history of the Earth, such as the formation of the Earth itself, the origin of life, the great glaciations and the mass extinctions of species, and we also analyze the astronomical context in which they occurred. We argue that the Sun was captured around 500-700 Myr ago by a supercloud, of which the Orion arm and Gould's belt are currently part, and that this event marked the history of the Earth. With this fact, we associate a massive capture of comets by the Sun, the great glaciations of the Cryogenic period, the emergence of complex life in the Cambrian and the recurrent mass extinctions of species.</description>

      <title>Stellar Population Astrophysics (SPA) with the TNG: NLTE atmospheric parameters and abundances of giant stars in 33 Open Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open clusters serve as important tools for accurately studying the chemical evolution of the Milky Way. By combining precise chemical data from high-resolution spectra with information on their distances and ages, we can effectively uncover the processes that have shaped our Galaxy. This study aims to derive NLTE atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances for approximately one hundred giant stars across 33 open clusters with near-solar metallicity. The clusters span a wide range of ages, enabling an assessment of the presence and extent of any age-related abundance gradients. In the Stellar Population Astrophysics (SPA) project, we acquired new high-resolution spectra of open clusters using the HARPS-N echelle spectrograph at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo. We chemically characterized nine open clusters for the first time and reanalyzed previously studied SPA clusters, resulting in a consistent and homogeneous sample. We determined NLTE atmospheric parameters using the equivalent width method and derived NLTE chemical abundances through spectral synthesis for various elements, including alpha elements (Mg, Si, and Ti), light odd-Z elements (Na, Al), iron-peak elements (Mn, Co, and Ni), and neutron-capture elements (Sr, Y, and Eu). Our findings are compared with the existing literature, revealing good agreement. We examine the trends of [X/Fe] versus age, confirming previous observations and the enrichment patterns predicted by nucleosynthesis processes. Positive correlations with age are present for Mg, Si, Ti, Al, Mn, Co, Ni, and Sr, while Na and Y and Eu show a negative trend. This study emphasizes the significance of NLTE corrections and reinforces the utility of open clusters as tracers of Galactic chemical evolution. Furthermore, we provide a benchmark sample of NLTE abundances for upcoming open cluster surveys within large-scale projects such as 4MOST and WEAVE.</description>

      <title>Chemical Diagnostics for Tracing the Physical Structures in Disk-Forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand the chemical origin of the Solar system, the chemical evolution along the star/planet formation is a key issue. Extensive observational studies have demonstrated a chemical diversity in young low-mass protostellar sources so far. Furthermore, chemical differentiations in the vicinity of the protostars have recently been reported. This suggests that molecular distribution is sensitive to a change in the physical conditions associated with disk formation. Some kinds of molecular lines, especially Sulfur-bearing species, are therefore prospected to work as molecular markers to highlight particular structures of disk-forming regions. Conversely, detailed physical characterization is essential for elucidating the chemical evolution occurring there. Machine learnings may help us to disentangle the observed structures. Angular momentum of the gas is the key topic to understand the structure formation, which is also essential to the integration of the chemical and physical characterization.</description>

      <title>Signatures of Exploding Supermassive PopIII Stars at High Redshift in JWST, EUCLID and Roman Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently discovered supermassive black holes with masses of $\sim10^8\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $z\sim9$-$11$ in active galactic nuclei (AGN) pose severe challenges to our understanding of supermassive black hole formation. One proposed channel are rapidly accreting supermassive PopIII stars (SMSs) that form in large primordial gas halos and grow up to $&lt;10^6\,M_\odot$. They eventually collapse due to the general relativistic instability and could lead to supernova-like explosions. This releases massive and energetic ejecta that then interact with the halo medium via an optically thick shock. We develop a semi-analytic model to compute the shock properties, bolometric luminosity, emission spectrum and photometry over time. The initial data is informed by stellar evolution and general relativistic SMS collapse simulations. We find that SMS explosion light curves reach a brightness $\sim10^{45\mathrm{-}47}\,\mathrm{erg/s}$ and last $10$-$200$ years in the source frame - up to $250$-$3000$ years with cosmic time dilation. This makes them quasi-persistent sources which vary indistinguishably to little red dots and AGN within $0.5$-$9\,(1+z)$ yrs. Bright SMS explosions are observable in long-wavelength JWST filters up to $z\leq20$ ($24$-$26$ mag) and pulsating SMSs up to $z\leq15$. EUCLID and the Roman space telescope (RST) can detect SMS explosions at $z&lt;11$-$12$. Their deep fields could constrain the SMS rate down to $10^{-11}$Mpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, which is much deeper than JWST bounds. Based on cosmological simulations and observed star formation rates, we expect to image up to several hundred SMS explosions with EUCLID and dozens with RST deep fields.</description>

      <title>Accelerated quenching and chemical enhancement of massive galaxies in a $z\sim4$ gas-rich halo</title>

Abstract: Stars in galaxies form when baryons radiatively cool down and fall into gravitational wells whose mass is dominated by dark matter. Eventually, star formation quenches as gas is depleted and/or perturbed by feedback processes, no longer being able to collapse and condense. We report the first spatially resolved spectroscopic observations, using the JWST/NIRSpec IFU, of a massive, completely quiescent galaxy (Jekyll) and its neighborhood at $z=3.714$, when the Universe age was 10% of today's. Jekyll resides in a massive dark matter halo (with mass M$_\mathrm{DM}&gt;10^{12}$ M$_\odot$) and forms a galaxy pair with Hyde, which shows very intense dust-enshrouded star formation (star formation rate $\sim300$ M$_\odot$yr$^{-1}$). We find large amounts of kinematically perturbed ionized and neutral gas in the circumgalactic medium around the pair. Despite this large gas reservoir, Jekyll, which formed $10^{11}$ M$_\odot$ in stars and chemically enriched early (first billion years of the Universe) and quickly (200-300 Myr), has remained quiescent for over 500 Myr. The properties of the gas found around the two galaxies are consistent with intense, AGN-induced photoionization, or intense shocks. However, with the current data no obscured or unobscured AGN is detected in the central galaxy (Jekyll) nor in the very active and dust rich star-forming galaxy (Hyde).</description>

      <title>Exploring the interaction between the MW and LMC with a large sample of blue horizontal branch stars from the DESI survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is a Milky Way (MW) satellite that is massive enough to gravitationally attract the MW disc and inner halo, causing significant motion of the inner MW with respect to the outer halo. In this work, we probe this interaction by constructing a sample of 9,866 blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars with radial velocities from the DESI spectroscopic survey out to 120 kpc from the Galactic centre. This is the largest spectroscopic set of BHB stars in the literature to date, and it contains four times more stars with Galactocentric distances beyond 50 kpc than previous BHB catalogues. Using the DESI BHB sample combined with SDSS BHBs, we measure the bulk radial velocity of stars in the outer halo and observe that the velocity in the Southern Galactic hemisphere is different by 3.7$\sigma$ from the North. Modelling the projected velocity field shows that its dipole component is directed at a point 22 degrees away from the LMC along its orbit, which we interpret as the travel direction of the inner MW. The velocity field includes a monopole term that is -24 km/s, which we refer to as compression velocity. This velocity is significantly larger than predicted by the current models of the MW and LMC interaction. This work uses DESI data from its first two years of observations, but we expect that with upcoming DESI data releases, the sample of BHB stars will increase and our ability to measure the MW-LMC interaction will improve significantly.</description>

      <title>The angular momentum of stars reflects the relationship between star-forming environment and galactic evolution history</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01035v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study focuses on stars with masses above the Kraft break in the \textit{Kepler} field. Their rotational angular momenta are essentially the same as those at the zero-age main sequence. The angular momentum dissipation experienced by these stars during their pre-main sequence phase is also relatively weak, so their rotational angular momentum can reflect the parameters of their parental molecular clouds. The reliability of angular momentum measurements was evaluated based on the phenomenon of angular momentum conservation observed in stars before and after the turn-off point in observational data. We find that stars with masses between 1.4$M_\odot$ and 1.8$M_\odot$ show an inverse proportionality between angular momentum and isochrone age. We propose that the angular momentum-age correlation reflects changes in the star-forming environment in the Milky Way's history. Besides, the observed inverse proportionality implies that, as the Milky Way has evolved, the stars formed within it tend to possess greater rotational angular momenta. This trend would promote the fragmentation of stars during the pre-main sequence phase and inhibit the formation of massive stars, providing a useful perspective for explaining variations in the initial mass function.</description>

      <title>Lyman-alpha resonant-line radiative transfer in expanding media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Lyman-alpha (LyA) line of atomic hydrogen encodes crucial information about both the intrinsic sources and surrounding environments of star-forming regions throughout the Universe. Due to the complexity of resonant scattering, analytic solutions remain scarce, with most studies focusing on idealized, static configurations. However, observations of LyA emitting galaxies consistently reveal signatures of outflows, imprinted through red-peak dominance in spectral line profiles. In this paper, we derive novel analytic solutions for resonant-line radiative transfer in moving media, specifically homologous-like cloud expansion and unbounded cosmological flows, which capture the main physics of velocity gradients. To validate these analytic solutions and identify regimes where diffusion-based assumptions hold, we introduce a robust Gridless Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (GMCRT) method. By integrating optical depths exactly in the comoving frame, GMCRT updates photon frequencies continuously to account for Doppler shifts induced by velocity gradients. We demonstrate excellent consistency between GMCRT and our analytic solutions in regimes where diffusion approximations apply. At higher velocities or lower optical depths, discrepancies highlight the limitations of simplified formalisms. We also provide scaling relations for a point source in a cloud with a maximum-to-thermal velocity ratio beta = V_max / v_th, as modifying the standard dependence on line centre optical depth of (atau_0)^1/3 by additional factors, e.g. characteristic escape frequency scale as x_esc ~ beta^1/3, force multipliers as M_F ~ beta^-1/3, and trapping time as t_trap ~ beta^-2/3. Our work complements numerical simulations by improving physical intuition about nonstatic environments when interpreting LyA observations and guiding future subgrid prescriptions in galaxy formation models.</description>

Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is discovering an increasing number of galaxies well into the early stages of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Many of these galaxies are clustered with strong Lyman alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission, motivating the presence of surrounding cosmic HII regions that would facilitate Ly$\alpha$ transmission through the intergalactic medium (IGM). Detecting these HII "bubbles" would allow us to connect their growth to the properties of the galaxies inside them. Here we develop a new forward-modeling framework to estimate the local HII region size and location from Ly$\alpha$ spectra of galaxy groups in the early stages of the EoR. Our model takes advantage of the complementary information provided by neighboring sightlines through the IGM. Our forward models sample the main sources of uncertainty, including: (i) the global neutral fraction; (ii) EoR morphology; (iii) emergent Ly$\alpha$ emission; and (iv) NIRSpec instrument noise. Depending on the availability of complementary nebular lines, $\sim$ 0.006 $\unicode{x2013}$ 0.01 galaxies per cMpc$^3$, are required to be $\gtrsim$95\% confident that the HII bubble location and size recovered by our method is accurate to within $\sim$ 1 comoving Mpc. This corresponds roughly to tens of galaxies at $z\sim7\unicode{x2013}8$ in $\sim$2x2 tiled pointing with JWST NIRSpec. Such a sample is achievable with a targeted survey with completeness down to $M_{\rm UV}^{\rm min}\lesssim$ -19 $\unicode{x2013}$ -17, depending on the over-density of the field. We test our method on 3D EoR simulations as well as misspecified equivalent width distributions, in both cases accurately recovering the HII region surrounding targeted galaxy groups.</description>

      <title>Ripples spreading across the Galactic disc. Interplay of direct and indirect effects of the Sagittarius dwarf impact</title>

Abstract: Gaia data have revealed vertically asymmetric phase-space structures in the Milky Way (MW) disc, such as phase spirals, indicating vertical oscillations. These oscillations exhibit two distinct modes: the bending mode and the breathing mode, associated with one-arm and two-arm phase spirals, respectively. This study aims to explore the excitation mechanisms of the bending and breathing modes and their subsequent evolution in the MW disc, focusing on the interplay between direct perturbations from the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy and indirect contributions from tidally induced spiral arms. We perform high-resolution $N$-body simulations to model the interaction between an MW-like disc galaxy and a Sagittarius dwarf-like satellite. These simulations resolve fine phase-space structures, enabling analysis of the bending and breathing modes at both macroscopic (global bending and breathing waves) and microscopic (local phase spirals) scales. Our simulations demonstrate that the satellite's perturbation directly excites the bending mode and induces spiral arms in the galactic disc. These spiral arms excite the breathing mode, making it an indirect consequence of the satellite interaction. Initially, the bending mode dominates, but it rapidly decays due to horizontal mixing. In contrast, the breathing mode persists for a longer duration, sustained by the spiral arms, leading to a transition from a bending-dominated to a breathing-dominated state. This transition progresses faster in the inner galaxy than in the outer regions. The simulations reproduce the one-arm phase spiral observed in the solar neighbourhood and reveal two-arm phase spirals, particularly in the inner galaxy, associated with spiral arm-induced breathing modes. Our findings highlight the combined effects of direct satellite perturbations and indirect spiral arm dynamics in shaping the vertical structure of the MW disc.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium ionization in the multiphase circumgalactic medium -- impact on quasar absorption-line analyses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an updated framework for studying the ionizing conditions and elemental abundances of photoionized, metal-enriched quasar absorption systems. The standard assumption of ionization equilibrium invoked in absorption line analyses requires gas to cool on longer timescales than ionic recombination (t_cool &gt;&gt; t_rec). However, this assumption may not be valid at high metallicities due to enhanced cooling losses. This work presents a suite of time-dependent photoionization (TDP) models that self-consistently solve for the ionization state of rapidly cooling gas irradiated by the extragalactic ultraviolet background (UVB). The updated framework explores various revised UVBs from recent studies, a range of initial temperatures, and different elemental abundance patterns to quantify the effects of TDP on the observed ion fractions. A metal-enriched ($\mathrm{[\alpha/H]}=0.6_{-0.1}^{+0.2}$) C IV absorption system at z ~ 1 previously studied using photoionization equilibrium (PIE) models is re-examined under the TDP framework. The main findings are as follows: (1) varying prescriptions for the underlying UVB or adopting initial temperatures T_0 &lt; 1e6 K (with the starting ionization state in collisional equilibrium) change TDP ion fractions by up to a factor of three and ten respectively, but the adopted relative elemental abundance pattern affects ion fractions by at most 40%; (2) the inferred gas densities are consistent between PIE and TDP, but under TDP solar metallicity cannot be ruled out at more than 2-$\sigma$ significance and a non-solar [C/$\alpha$]$\approx 0.25$ is robustly constrained from the observed relative ion abundances. Extending the TDP analyses to a larger sample of super-solar absorption components with high signal-to-noise absorption spectra is needed to quantify the fraction of metal absorbers originating in rapid cooling gas.</description>

      <title>The impact of medium-width bands on the selection, and subsequent luminosity function measurements, of high-z galaxies</title>

Abstract: New, ultra-deep medium-width photometric coverage with JWST's NIRCam instrument provides the potential for much improved photo-z reliability at high redshifts. In this study, we conduct a systematic analysis of the JADES Origins Field, which contains 14 broad- and medium-width near-infrared bands, to assess the benefits of medium band photometry on high-z completeness and contamination rates. Using imaging reaching AB mag $29.8-30.35$ depth, we test how high-z selections differ when images are artificially degraded or bands are removed. In parallel, the same experiments are conducted on simulated catalogues from the JAGUAR semi-analytic model to examine if observations can be replicated. We find sample completeness is high ($80\%+$) and contamination low ($&lt;4\%$) when in the $10\sigma+$ regime, even without the use of any medium-width bands. The addition of medium-width bands leads to increases in completeness ($\sim10\%$) but multiple bands are required to improve contamination rates due to the small redshift ranges over which they probe strong emission lines. Incidents of Balmer-Lyman degeneracy increase in the $5-7\sigma$ regime and this can be replicated in both simulated catalogues and degraded real data. We measure the faint-end of the UV LF at $8.5&lt;z&lt;13.5$, finding high number densities that agree with previous JWST observations. Overall, medium bands are effective at increasing completeness and reducing contamination, but investment in achieving comparable depths in the blue ($&lt;1.5\mu$m) as achieved in the red is also found to be key to fully reducing contamination from high-z samples.</description>

      <title>The life cycle of giant molecular clouds in simulated Milky Way-mass galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we trace the complete life cycle of individual GMCs in high-resolution Milky Way-mass galaxy simulations to determine how different stellar feedback mechanisms and galactic-scale processes govern cloud lifetimes, mass evolution, and local star formation efficiency (SFE). We identify GMCs in simulated galaxies and track their evolution using cloud evolution trees. Via cloud evolution trees, we quantify the lifetimes and SFE of GMCs. We further apply our diagnostics on a suite of simulations with varying star formation and stellar feedback subgrid models and explore their impact together with galactic environments to the GMC life cycles. Our analysis reveals that GMCs undergo dynamic evolution, characterized by continuous gas accretion, gravitational collapse, and star formation, followed by disruption due to stellar feedback. The accretion process sustains the gas content throughout most of the GMC life cycles, resulting in a positive correlation between GMC lifetimes and their maximum masses. The GMC lifetimes range from a few to several tens of Myr, with two distinct dynamical modes: (1) GMCs near the galactic center experience strong tidal disturbances, prolonging their lifetimes when they remain marginally unbound; (2) those in the outer regions are less affected by tides, remain gravitationally bound, and evolve more rapidly. In all model variations, we observe that GMC-scale SFE correlates with the baryonic surface density of GMCs, consistent with previous studies of isolated GMCs. Additionally, we emphasize the critical role of galactic shear in regulating GMC-scale star formation and refine the correlation between local SFE and surface density by including its effects. These findings demonstrate how stellar feedback and galactic-scale dynamics jointly shape GMC-scale star formation in realistic galactic environments.</description>

      <title>Predictions for Detecting a Turndown in the Baryonic Tully Fisher Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The baryonic Tully Fisher relation (bTFR) provides an empirical connection between baryonic mass and dynamical mass (measured by the maximum rotation velocity) for galaxies. Due to the impact of baryonic feedback in the shallower potential wells of dwarf galaxies, the bTFR is predicted to turn down at low masses from the extrapolated power-law relation at high masses. The low-mass end of the bTFR is poorly constrained due to small samples and difficulty in connecting the galaxy's gas kinematics to its dark matter halo. Simulations can help us understand this connection and interpret observations. We measure the bTFR with 75 dwarf galaxies from the Marvel-ous and Marvelous Massive Dwarfs hydrodynamic simulations. Our sample has M$_\star = 10^6-10^9$ M$_\odot$, and is mostly gas dominated. We compare five velocity methods: V$_\mathrm{out,circ}$ (spatially resolved mass-enclosed), V$_\mathrm{out,mid}$ (spatially resolved midplane gravitational potential), and unresolved HI linewidths at different percentages of the peak flux (W$_\mathrm{10}$, W$_\mathrm{20}$, and W$_\mathrm{50}$). We find an intrinsic turndown in the bTFR for maximum halo speeds $\lesssim 50$ km s$^{-1}$, or total baryonic mass M$_\mathrm{bary}\lesssim 10^{8.5}$ M$_\odot$. We find that observing HI in lower-mass galaxies to the conventional surface density limit of 1 M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$ is not enough to detect a turndown in the bTFR; none of the HI velocity methods, spatially resolved or unresolved, recover the turndown, and we find bTFR slopes consistent with observations of higher-mass galaxies. However, we predict that the turndown can be recovered by resolved rotation curves if the HI limit is $\lesssim 0.08$ M$_\odot$ pc$^{-2}$, which is within the sensitivity of current HI surveys like FEASTS and MHONGOOSE.</description>

      <title>Flashlights: Prospects for constraining the Initial Mass Function around cosmic noon with caustic-crossing events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Flashlights program with the Hubble Space Telescope imaged the six Hubble Frontier Fields galaxy clusters in two epochs and detected twenty transients. These are primarily expected to be caustic-crossing events (CCEs) where bright stars in distant lensed galaxies, typically at redshift $z\approx1$--3, get temporarily magnified close to cluster caustics. Since CCEs are generally biased toward more massive and luminous stars, they offer a unique route for probing the high end of the stellar mass function. We take advantage of the Flashlights event statistics to place preliminary constraints on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) around cosmic noon. The photometry (along with spectral information) of lensed arcs is used to infer their various stellar properties, and stellar synthesis models are used to evolve a recent stellar population in them. We estimate the microlens surface density near each arc and, together with existing lens models and simple formalism for CCEs, calculate the expected rate for a given IMF. We find that, on average, a Salpeter-like IMF ($\alpha=2.35$) underpredicts the number of observed CCEs by a factor of ${\sim}0.7$, and a top-heavy IMF ($\alpha=1.00$) overpredicts by a factor of ${\sim}1.7$, suggesting that the average IMF slope may lie somewhere in between. However, given the large uncertainties associated with estimating the stellar populations, these results are strongly model-dependent. Nevertheless, we introduce a useful framework for constraining the IMF using CCEs. Observations with JWST are already yielding many more CCEs and will soon enable more stringent constraints on the IMF at a range of redshifts.</description>

Abstract: Carbon Radio Recombination Lines (CRRLs) at decametre wavelengths trace the diffuse phase of the interstellar medium (ISM) of the Galaxy. Their observation allows to measure physical parameters of this phase. We observed CRRLs with the recently commissioned New Extension in Nan\c{c}ay Upgrading LOFAR (NenuFAR) telescope towards two of the brightest sources at low-frequency (10-85 MHz): Cassiopeia A and Cygnus A (hereafter Cas A and Cyg A respectively), to measure the density n_e and temperature T_e of electrons in line-of-sight clouds. We used NenuFAR's beamforming mode, and we integrated several tens of hours on each source. The nominal spectral resolution was 95.4 Hz. We developed a pipeline to remove radio frequency interference (RFI) contamination and correct the baselines. We then fitted the spectral lines observed in absorption, associated to line-of-sight clouds. Cas A is the brightest source in the sky at low frequencies and represents an appropriate test bench for this new telescope. On this source, we detected 398 C\alpha lines between principal quantum numbers n=426 and n=826. C\alpha lines towards Cyg A were fainter. We stacked the signal by groups of a few tens of lines to improve the quality of our fitting process. On both sources we reached significantly higher S/N and spectral resolution than the most recent detections by the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR). The variation of line shape with n provides constraints on the physical properties of the clouds: T_e, n_e, the temperature T_0 of the radiation field, the mean turbulent velocity v_t and the typical size of the cloud. The NenuFAR observations sample a larger space volume than LOFAR's towards the same sources due to the differences in instrumental beamsizes, and the discrepancies highlight the sensitivity of low-frequency CRRLs as probes of the diffuse ISM, paving the way towards large area surveys of CRRLs in our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>MeerKAT radio continuum imaging of nearby star-forming spirals in the NGC 6221, NGC 3256/3263, and NGC 2434 galaxy groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. We present high-resolution MeerKAT 1.3 GHz radio continuum images of star-forming spirals in the nearby galaxy groups around NGC 6221, NGC 3256/3263 and NGC 2434. This sample spans the evolutionary timeline for galaxy groups, encompassing early, intermediate, and late stages, respectively. The NGC 6221 group contains an interacting galaxy pair with tidal debris, along with at least three dwarf galaxies. In contrast, the NGC 3256/3263 group represents a loose group consisting of several spiral as well as dwarf galaxies, while a massive elliptical galaxy dominates the NGC 2434 group. Aims. We study the star formation activity in all detected galaxies, as it is one of the dominant physical processes in their formation and evolution, seeking evidence of environmental impact. Methods. We use MeerKAT radio continuum data and archival WISE infrared data to locate and measure the star formation rate in all group members. In particular, we used polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as tracers of gas heated due to star formation activity. Furthermore, we create in-band spectral index maps, providing insights into the underlying physical processes associated with the detected star-forming regions. Results. We found that galaxies are distributed differently in the WISE colour-colour diagram depending on their evolutionary group stage, as expected. Except for ESO 059-G012, the galaxies in our sample follow the radio-W3PAH correlation. A possible scenario that explains the ESO 059-G012 result is that the galaxy has already consumed the gas. We also found evidence that the interaction among the spiral galaxies NGC 3263, NGC 3256B and NGC 3256C is causing the Vela Cloud complex and that the galaxies NGC 6221 and NGC 3256 might host a low-luminosity AGN, as was previously proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Do JWST reionization (optical depth) puzzle, cosmological tensions, and CMB anomalies imply Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed massive galaxies at high redshifts, which implies an earlier epoch of reionization (EoR) compared with the cosmic microwave background (CMB) results. In this paper, based on \texttt{Planck 2020} (NPIPE release), \texttt{ACT DR4} and \texttt{SPT-3G} data, if assumed a Harrison-Zel'dovich (HZ) primordial power spectrum in the standard cosmological model, we show that the redshift or optical depth of reionization is larger than the case of a power-law (PL) primordial power spectrum. In HZ-$ \Lambda $CDM model, the redshift of reionization is $ z_\text{reio} = 9.11 \pm 0.61 $, which is consistent with the JWST result that $ z_\text{reio} \approx 8.9 $. Moreover, the cosmological tensions, i.e. Hubble ($H_0$) tension and $ S_8 $ tension are alleviated in HZ-$ \Lambda $CDM case. The Hubble constant is $ H_0 = 70.38 \pm 0.35 \, \text{km}/\text{s}/\text{Mpc}$ and the structure growth parameter is $ S_8 = 0.7645\pm 0.0094 $ in HZ-$ \Lambda $CDM model. We also consider two extensions of $ \Lambda $CDM, including $ \Lambda $CDM$ + A_\text{L} $ and $ \Lambda $CDM$ + \Omega_\text{k} $ models. But the extensions of $ \Lambda $CDM with a HZ spectrum meet more serious CMB anomalies, i.e. lensing anomaly and spatial curvature anomaly as compared with the extensions of $ \Lambda $CDM with a PL spectrum. We discuss that these two CMB anomalies may come from the degeneracy of cosmological parameters.</description>

      <title>The First Model-Independent Chromatic Microlensing Search: No Evidence in the Gravitational Wave Catalog of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lensing of Gravitational Waves (GWs) due to intervening matter distribution in the universe can lead to chromatic and achromatic signatures in the wave-optics and geometrical-optics limit respectively. This makes it difficult to model for the unknown mass distribution of the lens and hence requires a model-independent lensing detection technique from GW data. We perform the first model-independent microlensing search in the wave-optics limit on the 72 super-threshold GW events observed with both the LIGO detectors up to the third observation catalog GWTC-3 of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA using the analysis method $\mu$-\texttt{GLANCE}. These unmodelled searches pick up one plausible candidate $\rm GW190408\_181802$ with a slightly above threshold residual amplitude compared to the residual expected from detector noise. However, exploring the microlensing modulation signatures on this event, we do not find any conclusive evidence of the microlensing signal in the data. With this, we confidently rule out the presence of any statistically significant microlensing signal in the 72 events up to GWTC-3 in a model-independent way.</description>

      <title>Do We Know How to Model Reionization?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I compare the power spectra of the radiation fields from two recent sets of fully coupled simulations that model cosmic reionization: "Cosmic Reionization On Computers" (CROC) and "Thesan". While both simulations have similar power spectra of the radiation sources, the power spectra of the photoionization rate are significantly different at the same values of cosmic time or the same values of the mean neutral hydrogen fraction. However, the power spectra of the photoionization rate can be matched at large scales for the two simulations when the matching snapshots are allowed to vary independently. I.e., on large scales, the clustering of the radiation field in two simulations evolves similarly, but the exact timing of this evolution is different in different simulations and is not parameterized by an easily interpretable physical quantity like the mean neutral fraction or the mean free path. On small scales, large differences are present and remain partially unexplained.
  Both CROC and Thesan use the Variable Eddington Tensor approximation for modeling radiative transfer, but adopt different closure relations (optically thin OTVET versus M1). The role of this key difference is tested by using smaller simulations with a new cosmological simulation code that implements both closure relations in a controlled environment (the same hydro, cooling, and gravity solvers and the star formation recipe). In these controlled tests, both the M1 closure and the OTVET ansatz follow the expected behavior from a simple analytical approximation, demonstrating that the differences in the 2-point function of the radiation field induced by the choice of the Eddington tensor are not dominant.</description>

      <title>N-body simulations of dark matter-baryon interactions</title>

Abstract: Dark matter (DM) particles can interact with particles of the standard model. Although there are a number of constraints derived from direct and indirect detection experiments, the evolution of astrophysical objects could offer a promising probe. Obtaining predictions is challenging and primarily limited by our ability to simulate scattering between DM and baryonic particles within N-body and hydrodynamics simulations. We have developed the first scheme allowing for the simulation of these interacting dark matter (IDM) models, accurately accounting for their angular and velocity dependence, as well as the mass ratio between the DM and baryonic scattering partners. To describe DM-baryon interactions, we used an N-body code together with its implementation of smoothed-particle hydrodynamics and meshless finite mass. The interaction is realised in a pairwise fashion by creating a virtual scattering partner from the baryonic particle and allowing it to interact with a DM particle using a scattering routine initially developed for self-interacting dark matter (SIDM). After the interaction, the virtual particle is rejoined with the baryonic particle, fulfilling the requirements of energy and momentum conservation. Through several test problems, we demonstrated that we are able to reproduce the analytic solutions with our IDM scheme. This includes a test for scattering with a physical mass ratio of 1:1000, which is beyond the limits of SIDM simulations. We comment on various numerical aspects and challenges, and we describe the limitations of our numerical scheme. Furthermore, we study the impact of IDM on halo formation with a collapsing over-density. We find that it is possible to accurately model IDM within N-body and hydrodynamics simulations commonly used in astrophysics. Finally, our scheme allows for novel predictions to be made and new constraints on DM-baryon scattering to be set.</description>

      <title>A New Determination of the Mass of NGC 3603-A1: the Most Massive Binary Known?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13522v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The star NGC 3603-A1 has long been known to be a very massive binary, consisting of a pair of O2-3If*/WN5-6 stars, which show Wolf-Rayet-like emission due to their luminosities being near the Eddington limit. The system has been poorly characterized until now, due to the difficulties of obtaining reliable radial velocities from broad, blended emission lines and the extreme crowding in the cluster. However, previously unpublished archival HST/STIS spectra revealed that some of the upper Balmer lines (seen in absorption) are well separated at favorable orbital phases, prompting us to obtain our own carefully-timed new HST/STIS spectra, which we have analyzed along with the older data. Radial velocities measured from these spectra allow us to obtain an orbit for this 3.77298 day system. We also used archival STIS imaging of the cluster to obtain a more accurate light curve for this eclipsing system, which we then modeled, yielding the orbital inclination and providing values for the stellar radii and temperatures. Together, these data show that the NGC 3603-A1 system consists of a 93.3+/-11.0 Mo O3If*/WN6 primary with an effective temperature of 37,000 K, and a 70.4+/-9.3 Mo O3If*/WN5 secondary that is slightly hotter, 42,000 K. Although a more massive binary is known in the LMC, NGC 3603-A1 is as massive as any binary known in our own Galaxy for which a direct measurement of its mass has been made. The secondary has been spun up by mass accretion from the primary, and we discuss the evolutionary status of this intriguing system.</description>

      <title>Kerr black hole in a uniform magnetic field: An exact solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new class of exact spacetimes in Einstein's gravity, which are Kerr black holes immersed in an external magnetic (or electric) field that is asymptotically uniform and oriented along the rotational axis, is presented. These are axisymmetric stationary solutions to the Einstein-Maxwell equations such that (unlike in the Plebanski-Demianski spacetime) the null directions of the Faraday tensor are not aligned with neither of the two principal null directions of the Weyl tensor of algebraic type D (unlike the Kerr-Melvin spacetime). Three physical parameters are the black hole mass $m$, its rotation $a$, and the external field value $B$. For vanishing $B$ the metric directly reduces to standard Boyer-Lindquist form of the Kerr black hole, while for zero $m$ we recover conformally flat Bertotti-Robinson universe with a uniform Maxwell field. For zero $a$ the spacetime is contained in the Alekseev-Garcia and the Van den Bergh-Carminati solutions which can be understood as the Schwarzschild black hole in a magnetic field. Our family of black holes with non-aligned Maxwell hair - that can be called the Kerr-Bertotti-Robinson (Kerr-BR) black holes - may find application in various studies ranging from mathematical relativity to relativistic astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Bringing the Norma Dark Cloud to Light in X-rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09047v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The filamentary dark cloud complex in Norma reveals signs of active low-mass star formation including protostars, H-alpha emission line stars, Herbig Haro objects, and the eruptive FU Orionis-like star V346 Nor. We present results of the first pointed X-ray observations of the Norma dark cloud, focusing on the westernmost Sandqvist 187 region. Chandra detected 75 X-ray sources and a complementary XMM-Newton observation detected 92 sources within the Chandra field-of-view, of which 46 are cross-matched to Chandra, yielding 121 unique X-ray sources. We present a catalog of X-ray sources along with basic X-ray properties and candidate IR and optical counterparts. Existing near-IR photometry reveals several X-ray sources with color excesses as typical of young stars with disks. Gaia parallaxes single out foreground stars and X-ray sources with distances of 500 - 1000 pc that are probable cloud members. The known emission line stars Sz 136 and Sz 137 were detected but V346 Nor was not. Interestingly, the optical and IR counterparts of the brightest Chandra source are not known with certainty but the prime suspects are very faint. Thus, the nature of the object responsible for the bright X-ray emission remains speculative. The X-ray observations presented here will serve as a pathfinder for identifying and characterizing the young stellar population in the Norma dark cloud.</description>

      <title>Is the Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Alien Technology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At this early stage of its passage through our Solar System, 3I/ATLAS, the recently discovered interstellar interloper, has displayed various anomalous characteristics, determined from photometric and astrometric observations. As largely a pedagogical exercise, in this paper we present additional analysis into the astrodynamics of 3I/ATLAS, and hypothesize that this object could be technological, and possibly hostile as would be expected from the 'Dark Forest' resolution to the 'Fermi Paradox'. We show that 3I/ATLAS approaches surprisingly close to Venus, Mars and Jupiter, with a probability of $\lesssim 0.005$\%. Furthermore the low retrograde tilt of 3I/ATLAS's orbital plane to the ecliptic offers various benefits to an Extra-terrestrial Intelligence (ETI), since it allows the object access to our planet with relative impunity. The eclipse by the Sun from Earth of 3I/ATLAS at perihelion, would allow it to conduct a clandestine reverse Solar Oberth Manoeuvre, an optimal high-thrust strategy for interstellar spacecraft to brake and stay bound to the Sun. An optimal intercept of Earth would entail an arrival in late November/early December of 2025, and also, a non-gravitational acceleration of $\sim{5.9} \times 10^{-5}$ au day$^{-2}$, normalized at 1 au from the Sun, would indicate an intent to intercept the planet Jupiter, not far off its path, and a strategy to rendezvous with it after perihelion.</description>

      <title>Chaos of charged particles in quadrupole magnetic fields under Schwarzschild backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A four-vector potential of an external test electromagnetic field in a Schwarzschild background is described in terms of a combination of dipole and quadrupole magnetic fields. This combination is an interior solution of the source-free Maxwell equations. Such external test magnetic fields cause the dynamics of charged particles around the black hole to be nonintegrable, and are mainly responsible for chaotic dynamics of charged particles. In addition to the external magnetic fields, some circumstances should be required for the onset of chaos. The effect of the magnetic fields on chaos is shown clearly through an explicit symplectic integrator and a fast Lyapunov indicator. The inclusion of the quadrupole magnetic fields easily induces chaos, compared with that of the dipole magnetic fields. This result is because the Lorentz forces from the quadrupole magnetic fields are larger than those from the dipole magnetic fields. In addition, the Lorentz forces act as attractive forces, which are helpful to bring the occurrence of chaos in the nonintegrable case.</description>
