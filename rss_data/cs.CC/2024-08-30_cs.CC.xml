      <title>Hypercontractivity on HDX II: Symmetrization and q-Norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bourgain's symmetrization theorem is a powerful technique reducing boolean analysis on product spaces to the cube. It states that for any product $\Omega_i^{\otimes d}$, function $f: \Omega_i^{\otimes d} \to \mathbb{R}$, and $q &gt; 1$:
  $$||T_{\frac{1}{2}}f(x)||_q \leq ||\tilde{f}(r,x)||_{q} \leq ||T_{c_q}f(x)||_q$$ where $T_{\rho}f = \sum\limits \rho^Sf^{=S}$ is the noise operator and $\widetilde{f}(r,x) = \sum\limits r_Sf^{=S}(x)$ `symmetrizes' $f$ by convolving its Fourier components $\{f^{=S}\}_{S \subseteq [d]}$ with a random boolean string $r \in \{\pm 1\}^d$.
  In this work, we extend the symmetrization theorem to high dimensional expanders (HDX). Adapting work of O'Donnell and Zhao (2021), we give as a corollary a proof of optimal global hypercontractivity for partite HDX, resolving one of the main open questions of Gur, Lifshitz, and Liu (STOC 2022). Adapting work of Bourgain (JAMS 1999), we also give the first booster theorem for HDX, resolving a main open questions of Bafna, Hopkins, Kaufman, and Lovett (STOC 2022).
  Our proof is based on two elementary new ideas in the theory of high dimensional expansion. First we introduce `$q$-norm HDX', generalizing standard spectral notions to higher moments, and observe every spectral HDX is a $q$-norm HDX. Second, we introduce a simple method of coordinate-wise analysis on HDX which breaks high dimensional random walks into coordinate-wise components, and allows each component to be analyzed as a $1$-dimensional operator locally within $X$. This allows for application of standard tricks such as the replacement method, greatly simplifying prior analytic techniques.</description>

      <title>Unconditionally separating noisy $\mathsf{QNC}^0$ from bounded polynomial threshold circuits of constant depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study classes of constant-depth circuits with gates that compute restricted polynomial threshold functions, recently introduced by [Kum23] as a family that strictly generalizes $\mathsf{AC}^0$. Denoting these circuit families $\mathsf{bPTFC}^0[k]$ for $\textit{bounded polynomial threshold circuits}$ parameterized by an integer-valued degree-bound $k$, we prove three hardness results separating these classes from constant-depth quantum circuits ($\mathsf{QNC}^0$).
  $\hspace{2em}$ - We prove that the parity halving problem [WKS+19], which $\mathsf{QNC}^0$ over qubits can solve with certainty, remains average-case hard for polynomial size $\mathsf{bPTFC}^0[k]$ circuits for all $k=\mathcal{O}(n^{1/(5d)})$.
  $\hspace{2em}$ - We construct a new family of relation problems based on computing $\mathsf{mod}\ p$ for each prime $p&gt;2$, and prove a separation of $\mathsf{QNC}^0$ circuits over higher dimensional quantum systems (`qupits') against $\mathsf{bPTFC}^0[k]$ circuits for the same degree-bound parameter as above.
  $\hspace{2em}$ - We prove that both foregoing results are noise-robust under the local stochastic noise model, by introducing fault-tolerant implementations of non-Clifford $\mathsf{QNC}^0/|\overline{T^{1/p}}&gt;$ circuits, that use logical magic states as advice.
  $\mathsf{bPTFC}^0[k]$ circuits can compute certain classes of Polynomial Threshold Functions (PTFs), which in turn serve as a natural model for neural networks and exhibit enhanced expressivity and computational capabilities. Furthermore, for large enough values of $k$, $\mathsf{bPTFC}^0[k]$ contains $\mathsf{TC}^0$ as a subclass. The main challenges we overcome include establishing classical average-case lower bounds, designing non-local games with quantum-classical gaps in winning probabilities and developing noise-resilient non-Clifford quantum circuits necessary to extend beyond qubits to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Improved Circuit Lower Bounds With Applications to Exponential Separations Between Quantum and Classical Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kumar used a switching lemma to prove exponential-size lower bounds for a circuit class GC^0 that not only contains AC^0 but can--with a single gate--compute functions that require exponential-size TC^0 circuits. His main result was that switching-lemma lower bounds for AC^0 lift to GC^0 with no loss in parameters, even though GC^0 requires exponential-size TC^0 circuits. Informally, GC^0 is AC^0 with unbounded-fan-in gates that behave arbitrarily inside a sufficiently small Hamming ball but must be constant outside it.
  We show an analogous result for GC^0[p] (GC^0 with MODp gates) and the polynomial method. Specifically, we show that polynomial-method lower bounds for AC^0[p] lift to GC^0[p] with no loss in parameters. As an application, we prove Majority requires depth-d GC^0[p] circuits of size $2^{\Omega(n^{1/2(d-1)})}$, matching the state-of-the-art lower bounds for AC^0[p]. We also show that E^NP requires exponential-size GCC^0 circuits (the union of GC^0[m] for all m), extending the result of Williams.
  It is striking that the switching lemma, polynomial method, and algorithmic method all generalize to GC^0-related classes, with the first two methods doing so without any loss.
  We also establish the strongest known unconditional separations between quantum and classical circuits:
  1. There's an oracle relative to which BQP is not contained in the class of languages decidable by uniform families of size-$2^{n^{O(1)}}$ GC^0 circuits, generalizing Raz and Tal's relativized separation of BQP from the polynomial hierarchy.
  2. There's a search problem that QNC^0 circuits can solve but average-case hard for exponential-size GC^0 circuits.
  3. There's a search problem that QNC^0/qpoly circuits can solve but average-case hard for exponential-size GC^0[p] circuits.
  4. There's an interactive problem that QNC^0 circuits can solve but exponential-size GC^0[p] circuits cannot.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trace Distance and Fidelity Estimations for Pure Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the distinguishability between quantum states is a basic problem in quantum information theory. In this paper, we develop optimal quantum algorithms that estimate both the trace distance and the (square root) fidelity between pure states to within additive error $\varepsilon$ using $\Theta(1/\varepsilon)$ queries to their state-preparation circuits, quadratically improving the long-standing folklore $O(1/\varepsilon^2)$. At the heart of our construction, is an algorithmic tool for quantum square root amplitude estimation, which generalizes the well-known quantum amplitude estimation.</description>

      <title>Reducing Isotropy and Volume to KLS: Faster Rounding and Volume Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.02146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.02146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the volume of a convex body in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$ in the general membership oracle model can be computed to within relative error $\varepsilon$ using $\widetilde{O}(n^{3.5}\psi^{2} + n^3/\varepsilon^{2})$ oracle queries, where $\psi$ is the KLS constant. With the current bound of $\psi=\widetilde{O}(1)$, this gives an $\widetilde{O}(n^{3.5} + n^3/\varepsilon^{2})$ algorithm, improving on the Lov\'{a}sz-Vempala $\widetilde{O}(n^{4}/\varepsilon^{2})$ algorithm from 2003. The main new ingredient is an $\widetilde{O}(n^{3}\psi^{2})$ algorithm for isotropic transformation of a well-rounded convex body; we apply this iteratively to isotropicize a general convex body. Following this, we can apply the $\widetilde{O}(n^{3}/\varepsilon^{2})$ volume algorithm of Cousins and Vempala for well-rounded convex bodies. We also give an efficient implementation of the new algorithm for convex polytopes defined by $m$ inequalities in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$: polytope volume can be estimated in time $\widetilde{O}(mn^{c}/\varepsilon^{2})$ where $c&lt;3.7$ depends on the current matrix multiplication exponent and improves on the previous best bound.</description>

      <title>Generic Reed-Solomon Codes Achieve List-decoding Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05256v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, Brakensiek, Gopi and Makam introduced higher order MDS codes as a generalization of MDS codes. An order-$\ell$ MDS code, denoted by $\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$, has the property that any $\ell$ subspaces formed from columns of its generator matrix intersect as minimally as possible. An independent work by Roth defined a different notion of higher order MDS codes as those achieving a generalized singleton bound for list-decoding. In this work, we show that these two notions of higher order MDS codes are (nearly) equivalent.
  We also show that generic Reed-Solomon codes are $\operatorname{MDS}(\ell)$ for all $\ell$, relying crucially on the GM-MDS theorem which shows that generator matrices of generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve any possible zero pattern. As a corollary, this implies that generic Reed-Solomon codes achieve list decoding capacity. More concretely, we show that, with high probability, a random Reed-Solomon code of rate $R$ over an exponentially large field is list decodable from radius $1-R-\epsilon$ with list size at most $\frac{1-R-\epsilon}{\epsilon}$, resolving a conjecture of Shangguan and Tamo.</description>

      <title>The $\mathsf{AC}^0$-Complexity Of Visibly Pushdown Languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13116v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the question of which visibly pushdown languages (VPLs) are in the complexity class $\mathsf{AC}^0$ and how to effectively decide this question. Our contribution is to introduce a particular subclass of one-turn VPLs, called intermediate VPLs, for which the raised question is entirely unclear: to the best of our knowledge our research community is unaware of containment or non-containment in $\mathsf{AC}^0$ for any language in our newly introduced class.
  Our main result states that there is an algorithm that, given a visibly pushdown automaton, correctly outputs either that its language is in $\mathsf{AC}^0$, outputs some $m\geq 2$ such that $L$ is $\mathsf{ACC}^0(m)$-hard (implying that $L$ is not in $\mathsf{AC}^0$), or outputs a finite disjoint union of intermediate VPLs that $L$ is constant-depth equivalent to. In the latter case one can moreover effectively compute $k,l\in\mathbb{N}_{&gt;0}$ with $k\not=l$ such that the concrete intermediate VPL $L(S\rightarrow\varepsilon\mid a c^{k-1} S b_1\mid ac^{l-1}Sb_2)$ is constant-depth reducible to the language $L$. Due to their particular nature we conjecture that either all intermediate VPLs are in $\mathsf{AC}^0$ or all are not. As a corollary of our main result we obtain that in case the input language is a visibly counter language our algorithm can effectively determine if it is in $\mathsf{AC}^0$ -- hence our main result generalizes a result by Krebs et al. stating that it is decidable if a given visibly counter language is in $\mathsf{AC}^0$ (when restricted to well-matched words).
  For our proofs we revisit so-called Ext-algebras (introduced by Czarnetzki et al.), which are closely related to forest algebras (introduced by Boja\'nczyk and Walukiewicz), and use Green's relations.</description>

      <title>Is stochastic thermodynamics the key to understanding the energy costs of computation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17166v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between the thermodynamic and computational characteristics of dynamical physical systems has been a major theoretical interest since at least the 19th century, and has been of increasing practical importance as the energetic cost of digital devices has exploded over the last half century. One of the most important thermodynamic features of real-world computers is that they operate very far from thermal equilibrium, in finite time, with many quickly (co-)evolving degrees of freedom. Such computers also must almost always obey multiple physical constraints on how they work. For example, all modern digital computers are periodic processes, governed by a global clock. Another example is that many computers are modular, hierarchical systems, with strong restrictions on the connectivity of their subsystems. This properties hold both for naturally occurring computers, like brains or Eukaryotic cells, as well as digital systems. These features of real-world computers are absent in 20th century analyses of the thermodynamics of computational processes, which focused on quasi-statically slow processes. However, the field of stochastic thermodynamics has been developed in the last few decades - and it provides the formal tools for analyzing systems that have exactly these features of real-world computers. We argue here that these tools, together with other tools currently being developed in stochastic thermodynamics, may help us understand at a far deeper level just how the fundamental physical properties of dynamic systems are related to the computation that they perform.</description>
