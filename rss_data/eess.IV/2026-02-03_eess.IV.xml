      <title>Frequent Pattern Mining approach to Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper focuses on Image Compression, explaining efficient approaches based on Frequent Pattern Mining(FPM). The proposed compression mechanism is based on clustering similar pixels in the image and thus using cluster identifiers in image compression. Redundant data in the image is effectively handled by replacing the DCT phase of conventional JPEG through a mixture of k-means Clustering and Closed Frequent Sequence Mining. To optimize the cardinality of pattern(s) in encoding, efficient pruning techniques have been used through the refinement of Conventional Generalized Sequential Pattern Mining(GSP) algorithm. We have proposed a mechanism for finding the frequency of a sequence which will yield significant reduction in the code table size. The algorithm is tested by compressing benchmark datasets yielding an improvement of 45% in compression ratios, often outperforming the existing alternatives. PSNR and SSIM, which are the image quality metrics, have been tested which show a negligible loss in visual quality.</description>

      <title>Radiomics in Medical Imaging: Methods, Applications, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiomics enables quantitative medical image analysis by converting imaging data into structured, high-dimensional feature representations for predictive modeling. Despite methodological developments and encouraging retrospective results, radiomics continue to face persistent challenges related to feature instability, limited reproducibility, validation bias, and restricted clinical translation. Existing reviews largely focus on application-specific outcomes or isolated pipeline components, with limited analysis of how interdependent design choices across acquisition, preprocessing, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation collectively affect robustness and generalizability. This survey provides an end-to-end analysis of radiomics pipelines, examining how methodological decisions at each stage influence feature stability, model reliability, and translational validity. This paper reviews radiomic feature extraction, selection, and dimensionality reduction strategies; classical machine and deep learning-based modeling approaches; and ensemble and hybrid frameworks, with emphasis on validation protocols, data leakage prevention, and statistical reliability. Clinical applications are discussed with a focus on evaluation rigor rather than reported performance metrics. The survey identifies open challenges in standardization, domain shift, and clinical deployment, and outlines future directions such as hybrid radiomics-artificial intelligence models, multimodal fusion, federated learning, and standardized benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Toward a Unified Semantic Loss Model for Deep JSCC-based Transmission of EO Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Earth Observation (EO) systems increasingly rely on high-resolution imagery to support critical applications such as environmental monitoring, disaster response, and land-use analysis. Although these applications benefit from detailed visual data, the resulting data volumes impose significant challenges on satellite communication systems constrained by limited bandwidth, power, and dynamic link conditions. To address these limitations, this paper investigates Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding (DJSCC) as an effective source-channel paradigm for the transmission of EO imagery. We focus on two complementary aspects of semantic loss in DJSCC-based systems. First, a reconstruction-centric framework is evaluated by analyzing the semantic degradation of reconstructed images under varying compression ratios and channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Second, a task-oriented framework is developed by integrating DJSCC with lightweight, application-specific models (e.g., EfficientViT), with performance measured using downstream task accuracy rather than pixel-level fidelity. Based on extensive empirical analysis, we propose a unified semantic loss framework that captures both reconstruction-centric and task-oriented performance within a single model. This framework characterizes the implicit relationship between JSCC compression, channel SNR, and semantic quality, offering actionable insights for the design of robust and efficient EO imagery transmission under resource-constrained satellite links.</description>

      <title>Visible Singularities Guided Correlation Network for Limited-Angle CT Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Limited-angle computed tomography (LACT) offers the advantages of reduced radiation dose and shortened scanning time. Traditional reconstruction algorithms exhibit various inherent limitations in LACT. Currently, most deep learning-based LACT reconstruction methods focus on multi-domain fusion or the introduction of generic priors, failing to fully align with the core imaging characteristics of LACT-such as the directionality of artifacts and directional loss of structural information, which are caused by the absence of projection angles in certain directions. Inspired by the theory of visible and invisible singularities, taking into account the aforementioned core imaging characteristics of LACT, we propose a Visible Singularities Guided Correlation network for LACT reconstruction (VSGC). The design philosophy of VSGC consists of two core steps: First, extract VS edge features from LACT images and focus the model's attention on these VS. Second, establish correlations between the VS edge features and other regions of the image. Additionally, a multi-scale loss function with anisotropic constraint is employed to constrain the model to converge in multiple aspects. Finally, qualitative and quantitative validations are conducted on both simulated and real datasets to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed design. Particularly, in comparison with alternative methods, VSGC delivers more prominent performance in small angular ranges, with the PSNR improvement of 2.45 dB and the SSIM enhancement of 1.5\%. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/yqx7150/VSGC.</description>

      <title>SurfelSoup: Learned Point Cloud Geometry Compression With a Probablistic SurfelTree Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents SurfelSoup, an end-to-end learned surface-based framework for point cloud geometry compression, with surface-structured primitives for representation. It proposes a probabilistic surface representation, pSurfel, which models local point occupancies using a bounded generalized Gaussian distribution. In addition, the pSurfels are organized into an octree-like hierarchy, pSurfelTree, with a Tree Decision module that adaptively terminates the tree subdivision for rate-distortion optimal Surfel granularity selection. This formulation avoids redundant point-wise compression in smooth regions and produces compact yet smooth surface reconstructions. Experimental results under the MPEG common test condition show consistent gain on geometry compression over voxel-based baselines and MPEG standard G-PCC-GesTM-TriSoup, while providing visually superior reconstructions with smooth and coherent surface structures.</description>

      <title>SCALED : Surrogate-gradient for Codec-Aware Learning of Downsampling in ABR Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth in video consumption has introduced significant challenges to modern streaming architectures. Over-the-Top (OTT) video delivery now predominantly relies on Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) streaming, which dynamically adjusts bitrate and resolution based on client-side constraints such as display capabilities and network bandwidth. This pipeline typically involves downsampling the original high-resolution content, encoding and transmitting it, followed by decoding and upsampling on the client side. Traditionally, these processing stages have been optimized in isolation, leading to suboptimal end-to-end rate-distortion (R-D) performance. The advent of deep learning has spurred interest in jointly optimizing the ABR pipeline using learned resampling methods. However, training such systems end-to-end remains challenging due to the non-differentiable nature of standard video codecs, which obstructs gradient-based optimization. Recent works have addressed this issue using differentiable proxy models, based either on deep neural networks or hybrid coding schemes with differentiable components such as soft quantization, to approximate the codec behavior. While differentiable proxy codecs have enabled progress in compression-aware learning, they remain approximations that may not fully capture the behavior of standard, non-differentiable codecs. To our knowledge, there is no prior evidence demonstrating the inefficiencies of using standard codecs during training. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that enables end-to-end training with real, non-differentiable codecs by leveraging data-driven surrogate gradients derived from actual compression errors. It facilitates the alignment between training objectives and deployment performance. Experimental results show a 5.19\% improvement in BD-BR (PSNR) compared to codec-agnostic training approaches, consistently across the entire rate-distortion convex hull spanning multiple downsampling ratios.</description>

      <title>A Renderer-Enabled Framework for Computing Parameter Estimation Lower Bounds in Plenoptic Imaging Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on assessing the information-theoretic limits of scene parameter estimation in plenoptic imaging systems. A general framework to compute lower bounds on the parameter estimation error from noisy plenoptic observations is presented, with a particular focus on passive indirect imaging problems, where the observations do not contain line-of-sight information about the parameter(s) of interest. Using computer graphics rendering software to synthesize the often-complicated dependence among parameter(s) of interest and observations, i.e. the forward model, the proposed framework evaluates the Hammersley-Chapman-Robbins bound to establish lower bounds on the variance of any unbiased estimator of the unknown parameters. The effects of inexact rendering of the true forward model on the computed lower bounds are also analyzed, both theoretically and via simulations. Experimental evaluations compare the computed lower bounds with the performance of the Maximum Likelihood Estimator on a canonical object localization problem, showing that the lower bounds computed via the framework proposed here are indicative of the true underlying fundamental limits in several nominally representative scenarios.</description>

      <title>Advanced Geometric Correction Algorithms for 3D Medical Reconstruction: Comparison of Computed Tomography and Macroscopic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid two-stage registration framework for reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) kidney anatomy from macroscopic slices, using CT-derived models as the geometric reference standard. The approach addresses the data-scarcity and high-distortion challenges typical of macroscopic imaging, where fully learning-based registration (e.g., VoxelMorph) often fails to generalize due to limited training diversity and large nonrigid deformations that exceed the capture range of unconstrained convolutional filters. In the proposed pipeline, the Optimal Cross-section Matching (OCM) algorithm first performs constrained global alignment: translation, rotation, and uniform scaling to establish anatomically consistent slice initialization. Next, a lightweight deep-learning refinement network, inspired by VoxelMorph, predicts residual local deformations between consecutive slices. The core novelty of this architecture lies in its hierarchical decomposition of the registration manifold. This hybrid OCM+DL design integrates explicit geometric priors with the flexible learning capacity of neural networks, ensuring stable optimization and plausible deformation fields even with few training examples. Experiments on an original dataset of 40 kidneys demonstrated better results compared to single-stage baselines. The pipeline maintains physical calibration via Hough-based grid detection and employs Bezier-based contour smoothing for robust meshing and volume estimation. Although validated on kidney data, the proposed framework generalizes to other soft-tissue organs reconstructed from optical or photographic cross-sections. By decoupling interpretable global optimization from data-efficient deep refinement, the method advances the precision, reproducibility, and anatomical realism of multimodal 3D reconstructions for surgical planning, morphological assessment, and medical education.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Vanilla GAN, DCGAN, and WGAN Architectures for MRI Reconstruction: A Quantitative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a crucial imaging modality for viewing internal body structures. This research work analyses the performance of popular GAN models for accurate and precise MRI reconstruction by enhancing image quality and improving diagnostic accuracy. Three GAN architectures considered in this study are Vanilla GAN, Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), and Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). They were trained and evaluated using knee, brain, and cardiac MRI datasets to assess their generalizability across body regions. While the Vanilla GAN operates on the fundamentals of the adversarial network setup, DCGAN advances image synthesis by securing the convolutional layers, giving a superior appearance to the prevalent spatial features. Training instability is resolved in WGAN through the Wasserstein distance to minimize an unstable regime, therefore, ensuring stable convergence and high-quality images. The GAN models were trained and tested using 1000 MR images of an anonymized knee, 805 images of Heart, 90 images of Brain MRI dataset. The Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) for Vanilla GAN is 0.84, DCGAN is 0.97, and WGAN is 0.99. The Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) for Vanilla GAN is 26, DCGAN is 49.3, and WGAN is 43.5. The results were further statistically validated. This study shows that DCGAN and WGAN-based frameworks are promising in MR image reconstruction because of good image quality and superior accuracy. With the first cross-organ benchmark of baseline GANs under a common preprocessing pipeline, this work provides a reproducible benchmark for future hybrid GANs and clinical MRI applications.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances of End-to-End Video Coding Technologies for AVS Standard Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video coding standards are essential to enable the interoperability and widespread adoption of efficient video compression technologies. In pursuit of greater video compression efficiency, the AVS video coding working group launched the standardization exploration of end-to-end intelligent video coding, establishing the AVS End-to-End Intelligent Video Coding Exploration Model (AVS-EEM) project. A core design principle of AVS-EEM is its focus on practical deployment, featuring inherently low computational complexity and requiring strict adherence to the common test conditions of conventional video coding. This paper details the development history of AVS-EEM and provides a systematic introduction to its key technical framework, covering model architectures, training strategies, and inference optimizations. These innovations have collectively driven the project's rapid performance evolution, enabling continuous and significant gains under strict complexity constraints. Through over two years of iterative refinement and collaborative effort, the coding performance of AVS-EEM has seen substantial improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that its latest model achieves superior compression efficiency compared to the conventional AVS3 reference software, marking a significant step toward a deployable intelligent video coding standard.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Super Resolution-enabled Coding Model for the JPEG Pleno Learning-based Point Cloud Coding Standard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While point cloud-based applications are gaining traction due to their ability to provide rich and immersive experiences, they critically need efficient coding solutions due to the large volume of data involved, often many millions of points per object. The JPEG Pleno Learning-based Point Cloud Coding standard, as the first learning-based coding standard for static point clouds, has set a foundational framework with very competitive compression performance regarding the relevant conventional and learning-based alternative point cloud coding solutions. This paper proposes a novel lightweight point cloud geometry coding model that significantly reduces the complexity of the standard, which is essential for the broad adoption of this coding standard, particularly in resource-constrained environments, while simultaneously achieving small average compression efficiency benefits. The novel coding model is based on the pioneering adoption of a compressed domain approach for the super-resolution model, in addition to a major reduction of the number of latent channels. A reduction of approximately 70% in the total number of model parameters is achieved while simultaneously offering slight average compression performance gains for the JPEG Pleno Point Cloud coding dataset.</description>

      <title>Diagnostic Impact of Cine Clips for Thyroid Nodule Assessment on Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Thyroid ultrasound is commonly performed using a combination of static images and cine clips (video recordings). However, the exact utility and impact of cine images remains unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of cine imaging on accuracy and consistency of thyroid nodule assessment, using the American College of Radiology Thyroid Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS). Methods: 50 benign and 50 malignant thyroid nodules with cytopathology results were included. A reader study with 4 specialty-trained radiologists was then conducted over 3 rounds, assessing only static images in the first two rounds and both static and cine images in the third round. TI-RADS scores and the consequent management recommendations were then evaluated by comparing them to the malignancy status of the nodules. Results: Mean sensitivity for malignancy detection was 0.65 for static images and 0.67 with both static and cine images (p&gt;0.5). Specificity was 0.20 for static images and 0.22 with both static and cine images (p&gt;0.5). Management recommendations were similar with and without cine images. Intrareader agreement on feature assignments remained consistent across all rounds, though TI-RADS point totals were slightly higher with cine images. Conclusion: The inclusion of cine imaging for thyroid nodule assessment on ultrasound did not significantly change diagnostic performance. Current practice guidelines, which do not mandate cine imaging, are sufficient for accurate diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Coordinate-conditioned Deconvolution for Scalable Spatially Varying High-Throughput Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wide-field fluorescence microscopy with compact optics often suffers from spatially varying blur due to field-dependent aberrations, vignetting, and sensor truncation, while finite sensor sampling imposes an inherent trade-off between field of view (FOV) and resolution. Computational Miniaturized Mesoscope (CM2) alleviate the sampling limit by multiplexing multiple sub-views onto a single sensor, but introduce view crosstalk and a highly ill-conditioned inverse problem compounded by spatially variant point spread functions (PSFs). Prior learning-based spatially varying (SV) reconstruction methods typically rely on global SV operators with fixed input sizes, resulting in memory and training costs that scale poorly with image dimensions. We propose SV-CoDe (Spatially Varying Coordinate-conditioned Deconvolution), a scalable deep learning framework that achieves uniform, high-resolution reconstruction across a 6.5 mm FOV. Unlike conventional methods, SV-CoDe employs coordinate-conditioned convolutions to locally adapt reconstruction kernels; this enables patch-based training that decouples parameter count from FOV size. SV-CoDe achieves the best image quality in both simulated and experimental measurements while requiring 10x less model size and 10x less training data than prior baselines. Trained purely on physics-based simulations, the network robustly generalizes to bead phantoms, weakly scattering brain slices, and freely moving C. elegans. SV-CoDe offers a scalable, physics-aware solution for correcting SV blur in compact optical systems and is readily extendable to a broad range of biomedical imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Unified ROI-based Image Compression Paradigm with Generalized Gaussian Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Region-of-Interest (ROI)-based image compression allocates bits unevenly according to the semantic importance of different regions. Such differentiated coding typically induces a sharp-peaked and heavy-tailed distribution. This distribution characteristic mathematically necessitates a probability model with adaptable shape parameters for accurate description. However, existing methods commonly use a Gaussian model to fit this distribution, resulting in a loss of coding performance. To systematically analyze the impact of this distribution on ROI coding, we develop a unified rate-distortion optimization theoretical paradigm. Building on this paradigm, we propose a novel Generalized Gaussian Model (GGM) to achieve flexible modeling of the latent variables distribution. To support stable optimization of GGM, we introduce effective differentiable functions and further propose a dynamic lower bound to alleviate train-test mismatch. Moreover, finite differences are introduced to solve the gradient computation after GGM fits the distribution. Experiments on COCO2017 demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art in both ROI reconstruction and downstream tasks (e.g., Segmentation, Object Detection). Furthermore, compared to classical probability models, our GGM provides a more precise fit to feature distributions and achieves superior coding performance.

      <title>A texture-based framework for foundational ultrasound models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound is the most widely used medical imaging modality, yet the images it produces are fundamentally unique, arising from tissue-dependent scattering, reflection, and speed-of-sound variations that produce a constrained set of characteristic textures that differ markedly from natural-image statistics. These acoustically driven patterns make ultrasound challenging for algorithms originally designed for natural images. To bridge this gap, the field has increasingly turned to foundation models, hoping to leverage their generalization capabilities. However, these models often falter in ultrasound applications because they are not designed for ultrasound physics, they are merely trained on ultrasound data. Therefore, it is essential to integrate ultrasound-specific domain knowledge into established learning frameworks. We achieve this by reformulating self-supervised learning as a texture-analysis problem, introducing texture ultrasound semantic analysis (TUSA). Using TUSA, models learn to leverage highly scalable contrastive methods to extract true domain-specific representations directly from simple B-mode images. We train a TUSA model on a combination of open-source, simulated, and in vivo data. The latent space is compared to several larger foundation models, demonstrating that our approach gives TUSA models better generalizability for difficult downstream tasks on unique online datasets as well as a clinical eye dataset collected for this study. Our model achieves higher accuracy in detecting COVID (70%), spinal hematoma (100%) and vitreous hemorrhage (97%) and correlates more closely with quantitative parameters like liver steatosis (r = 0.83), ejection fraction (r = 0.63), and oxygen saturation (r = 0.38). We open-source the model weights and training script: https://github.com/talg2324/tusa</description>

      <title>MarkCleaner: High-Fidelity Watermark Removal via Imperceptible Micro-Geometric Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic watermarks exhibit strong robustness against conventional image-space attacks. In this work, we show that such robustness does not survive under micro-geometric perturbations: spatial displacements can remove watermarks by breaking the phase alignment. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MarkCleaner, a watermark removal framework that avoids semantic drift caused by regeneration-based watermark removal. Specifically, MarkCleaner is trained with micro-geometry-perturbed supervision, which encourages the model to separate semantic content from strict spatial alignment and enables robust reconstruction under subtle geometric displacements. The framework adopts a mask-guided encoder that learns explicit spatial representations and a 2D Gaussian Splatting-based decoder that explicitly parameterizes geometric perturbations while preserving semantic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MarkCleaner achieves superior performance in both watermark removal effectiveness and visual fidelity, while enabling efficient real-time inference. Our code will be made available upon acceptance.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral Image Fusion with Spectral-Band and Fusion-Scale Agnosticism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current deep learning models for Multispectral and Hyperspectral Image Fusion (MS/HS fusion) are typically designed for fixed spectral bands and spatial scales, which limits their transferability across diverse sensors. To address this, we propose SSA, a universal framework for MS/HS fusion with spectral-band and fusion-scale agnosticism. Specifically, we introduce Matryoshka Kernel (MK), a novel operator that enables a single model to adapt to arbitrary numbers of spectral channels. Meanwhile, we build SSA upon an Implicit Neural Representation (INR) backbone that models the HS signal as a continuous function, enabling reconstruction at arbitrary spatial resolutions. Together, these two forms of agnosticism enable a single MS/HS fusion model that generalizes effectively to unseen sensors and spatial scales. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our single model achieves state-of-the-art performance while generalizing well to unseen sensors and scales, paving the way toward future HS foundation models.</description>

      <title>Edge-Aligned Initialization of Kernels for Steered Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steered Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) has recently emerged as a powerful framework for spatial-domain image modeling, enabling high-fidelity image representation using a remarkably small number of parameters. Its ability to steer kernel-based experts toward structural image features has led to successful applications in image compression, denoising, super-resolution, and light field processing. However, practical adoption is hindered by the reliance on gradient-based optimization to estimate model parameters on a per-image basis - a process that is computationally intensive and difficult to scale. Initialization strategies for SMoE are an essential component that directly affects convergence and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel, edge-based initialization scheme that achieves good reconstruction qualities while reducing the need for stochastic optimization significantly. Through a method that leverages Canny edge detection to extract a sparse set of image contours, kernel positions and orientations are deterministically inferred. A separate approach enables the direct estimation of initial expert coefficients. This initialization reduces both memory consumption and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Efficient UAV trajectory prediction: A multi-modal deep diffusion framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To meet the requirements for managing unauthorized UAVs in the low-altitude economy, a multi-modal UAV trajectory prediction method based on the fusion of LiDAR and millimeter-wave radar information is proposed. A deep fusion network for multi-modal UAV trajectory prediction, termed the Multi-Modal Deep Fusion Framework, is designed. The overall architecture consists of two modality-specific feature extraction networks and a bidirectional cross-attention fusion module, aiming to fully exploit the complementary information of LiDAR and radar point clouds in spatial geometric structure and dynamic reflection characteristics. In the feature extraction stage, the model employs independent but structurally identical feature encoders for LiDAR and radar. After feature extraction, the model enters the Bidirectional Cross-Attention Mechanism stage to achieve information complementarity and semantic alignment between the two modalities. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed model, the MMAUD dataset used in the CVPR 2024 UG2+ UAV Tracking and Pose-Estimation Challenge is adopted as the training and testing dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed multi-modal fusion model significantly improves trajectory prediction accuracy, achieving a 40% improvement compared to the baseline model. In addition, ablation experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of different loss functions and post-processing strategies in improving model performance. The proposed model can effectively utilize multi-modal data and provides an efficient solution for unauthorized UAV trajectory prediction in the low-altitude economy.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Presentation Attack Detection in Remote Identity Validation Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00109v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Presentation attack detection (PAD) subsystems are an important part of effective and user-friendly remote identity validation (RIV) systems. However, ensuring robust performance across diverse environmental and procedural conditions remains a critical challenge. This paper investigates the impact of low-light conditions and automated image acquisition on the robustness of commercial PAD systems using a scenario test of RIV. Our results show that PAD systems experience a significant decline in performance when utilized in low-light or auto-capture scenarios, with a model-predicted increase in error rates by a factor of about four under low-light conditions and a doubling of those odds under auto-capture workflows. Specifically, only one of the tested systems was robust to these perturbations, maintaining a maximum bona fide presentation classification error rate below 3% across all scenarios. Our findings emphasize the importance of testing across diverse environments to ensure robust and reliable PAD performance in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>From Manual Observation to Automated Monitoring: Space Allowance Effects on Play Behaviour in Group-Housed Dairy Calves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Play behaviour serves as a positive welfare indicator in dairy calves, yet the influence of space allowance under commercial conditions remains poorly characterized, particularly at intermediate-to-high allowances (6-20 m2 per calf). This study investigated the relationship between space allowance and play behaviour in 60 group-housed dairy calves across 14 commercial farms in the Netherlands (space range: 2.66-17.98 m2 per calf), and developed an automated computer vision pipeline for scalable monitoring. Video observations were analyzed using a detailed ethogram, with play expressed as percentage of observation period (%OP). Statistical analysis employed linear mixed models with farm as a random effect. A computer vision pipeline was trained on manual annotations from 108 hours on 6 farms and validated on held-out test data. The computer vision classifier achieved 97.6% accuracy with 99.4% recall for active play detection. Calves spent on average 1.0% of OP playing reflecting around 10 minutes per 17-hour period. The space-play relationship was non-linear, with highest play levels at 8-10 m2 per calf (1.6% OP) and lowest at 6-8 m2 and 12-14 m2 (&lt;0.6% OP). Space remained significant after controlling for age, health, and group size. In summary, these findings suggest that 8-10 m2 per calf represents a practical target balancing welfare benefits with economic feasibility, and demonstrate that automated monitoring can scale small annotation projects to continuous welfare assessment systems.</description>

      <title>D3R-Net: Dual-Domain Denoising Reconstruction Network for Robust Industrial Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) is a key ingredient of automated visual inspection in modern manufacturing. The reconstruction-based methods appeal because they have basic architectural design and they process data quickly but they produce oversmoothed results for high-frequency details. As a result, subtle defects are partially reconstructed rather than highlighted, which limits segmentation accuracy. We build on this line of work and introduce D3R-Net, a Dual-Domain Denoising Reconstruction framework that couples a self-supervised 'healing' task with frequency-aware regularization. During training, the network receives synthetically corrupted normal images and is asked to reconstruct the clean targets, which prevents trivial identity mapping and pushes the model to learn the manifold of defect-free textures. In addition to the spatial mean squared error, we employ a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude loss that encourages consistency in the frequency domain. The implementation also allows an optional structural similarity (SSIM) term, which we study in an ablation. On the MVTec AD Hazelnut benchmark, D3R-Net with the FFT loss improves localization consistency over a spatial-only baseline: PRO AUC increases from 0.603 to 0.687, while image-level ROC AUC remains robust. Evaluated across fifteen MVTec categories, the FFT variant raises the average pixel ROC AUC from 0.733 to 0.751 and PRO AUC from 0.417 to 0.468 compared to the MSE-only baseline, at roughly 20 FPS on a single GPU. The network is trained from scratch and uses a lightweight convolutional autoencoder backbone, providing a practical alternative to heavy pre-trained feature embedding methods.</description>

      <title>SDCM: Simulated Densifying and Compensatory Modeling Fusion for Radar-Vision 3-D Object Detection in Internet of Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3-D object detection based on 4-D radar-vision is an important part in Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, there are two challenges which need to be faced. First, the 4-D radar point clouds are sparse, leading to poor 3-D representation. Second, vision datas exhibit representation degradation under low-light, long distance detection and dense occlusion scenes, which provides unreliable texture information during fusion stage. To address these issues, a framework named SDCM is proposed, which contains Simulated Densifying and Compensatory Modeling Fusion for radar-vision 3-D object detection in IoV. Firstly, considering point generation based on Gaussian simulation of key points obtained from 3-D Kernel Density Estimation (3-D KDE), and outline generation based on curvature simulation, Simulated Densifying (SimDen) module is designed to generate dense radar point clouds. Secondly, considering that radar data could provide more real time information than vision data, due to the all-weather property of 4-D radar. Radar Compensatory Mapping (RCM) module is designed to reduce the affects of vision datas' representation degradation. Thirdly, considering that feature tensor difference values contain the effective information of every modality, which could be extracted and modeled for heterogeneity reduction and modalities interaction, Mamba Modeling Interactive Fusion (MMIF) module is designed for reducing heterogeneous and achieving interactive Fusion. Experiment results on the VoD, TJ4DRadSet and Astyx HiRes 2019 dataset show that SDCM achieves best performance with lower parameter quantity and faster inference speed. Our code will be available.</description>

Abstract: We propose a lightweight compressed-domain tracking model that operates directly on video streams, without requiring full RGB video decoding.

      <description>arXiv:2602.00216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smallholder cacao producers often rely on outdated farming techniques and face significant challenges from pests and diseases, unlike larger plantations with more resources and expertise. In the Philippines, cacao farmers have limited access to data, information, and good agricultural practices. This study addresses these issues by developing a mobile application for cacao disease identification and management that functions offline, enabling use in remote areas where farms are mostly located. The core of the system is a deep learning model trained to identify cacao diseases accurately. The trained model is integrated into the mobile app to support farmers in field diagnosis. The disease identification model achieved a validation accuracy of 96.93% while the model for detecting cacao black pod infection levels achieved 79.49% validation accuracy. Field testing of the application showed an agreement rate of 84.2% compared with expert cacao technician assessments. This approach empowers smallholder farmers by providing accessible, technology-enabled tools to improve cacao crop health and productivity.</description>

      <title>A Novel Differential Pathlength Factor Model for Near-Infrared Diffuse Optical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near infrared diffuse optical imaging can be performed in reflectance and transmission mode and relies on physical models along with measurements to extract information on changes in chromophore concentration. Continuous-wave near-infrared diffuse optical imaging relies on accurate differential pathlength factors (DPFs) for quantitative chromophore estimation. Existing DPF definitions inherit formulation-dependent limitations that can introduce large errors in modified Beer--Lambert law analyses. These errors are significantly higher at smaller source-detector separations in a reflectance mode of measurement. This minimizes their applicability in situations where large area detection is used and also when signal depth is varying. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we derive two distance- and property-dependent DPF models one ideal and one experimentally practical and benchmark them against standard formulations. The proposed models achieve errors below 10 percent across broad optical conditions, whereas conventional DPFs can exceed 100 percent error. The theoretical predictions are further validated using controlled phantom experiments, demonstrating improved quantitative accuracy in CW-NIR imaging.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Imaging Depth and Sensitivity in Reflectance Mode Near Infrared Optical Imaging with Scatter Reducing Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of scatter reducing agents in a continuous wave (CW) near infrared (NIR)reflectance mode imaging setting. We use food-grade dye Tartrazine as a scatter reducing agent to enhance depth sensitivity and weak-absorber detectability in CW diffuse reflectance measurements. We found that reflectance signal was enhanced when the dye was applied on chicken breast phantom. However, we saw reduced reflectance sensitivity when the dye was uniformly dissolved in intralipid phantom which is a commonly used for NIR imaging studies. This shows that the gradient of refractive index modulation created as the dye diffuses from the top layer allows increased reflectance signal sensitivity of optical photons. However, when the scatter reduction is uniform throughout the phantom (like in intralipid phantom), the improved reflectance sensitivity was not observed. Our study points to significant redistribution of photons with scatter modulation with Tartrazine dye. We show significant improvement in sensitivity to signals with reflectance imaging. To elucidate the underlying mechanism of dye induced scatter reduction in tissue, analytical diffusion models and Monte Carlo simulations were employed. Modeling results show the impact of refractive index gradient created due to dye diffusion in enhancing reflectance sensitivity. These findings demonstrate that dye induced scatter reduction provides a practical, low-complexity approach to improving depth sensitivity in CW diffuse reflectance measurements and extend the functional capabilities of CW-NIRS systems for deep-tissue sensing applications. Our preliminary studies shows up to five fold enhancement in signal sensitivity for signals between two and three cm depth.</description>

      <title>Combined Flicker-banding and Moire Removal for Screen-Captured Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Capturing display screens with mobile devices has become increasingly common, yet the resulting images often suffer from severe degradations caused by the coexistence of moir\'e patterns and flicker-banding, leading to significant visual quality degradation. Due to the strong coupling of these two artifacts in real imaging processes, existing methods designed for single degradations fail to generalize to such compound scenarios. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on joint removal of moir\'e patterns and flicker-banding in screen-captured images, and propose a unified restoration framework, named CLEAR. To support this task, we construct a large-scale dataset containing both moir\'e patterns and flicker-banding, and introduce an ISP-based flicker simulation pipeline to stabilize model training and expand the degradation distribution. Furthermore, we design a frequency-domain decomposition and re-composition module together with a trajectory alignment loss to enhance the modeling of compound artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently. outperforms existing image restoration approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Streamlined Hybrid Annotation Framework using Scalable Codestream for Bandwidth-Restricted UAV Object Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Emergency response missions depend on the fast relay of visual information, a task to which unmanned aerial vehicles are well adapted. However, the effective use of unmanned aerial vehicles is often compromised by bandwidth limitations that impede fast data transmission, thereby delaying the quick decision-making necessary in emergency situations. To address these challenges, this paper presents a streamlined hybrid annotation framework that utilizes the JPEG 2000 compression algorithm to facilitate object detection under limited bandwidth. The proposed framework employs a fine-tuned deep learning network for initial image annotation at lower resolutions and uses JPEG 2000's scalable codestream to selectively enhance the image resolution in critical areas that require human expert annotation. We show that our proposed hybrid framework reduces the response time by a factor of 34 in emergency situations compared to a baseline approach.</description>

      <title>Future frame prediction in chest and liver cine MRI using the PCA respiratory motion model: comparing transformers and dynamically trained recurrent neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Respiratory motion complicates accurate irradiation of thoraco-abdominal tumors in radiotherapy, as treatment-system latency entails target-location uncertainties. This work addresses frame forecasting in chest and liver cine MRI to compensate for such delays. We investigate RNNs trained with online learning algorithms, enabling adaptation to changing respiratory patterns via on-the-fly parameter updates, and transformers, increasingly common in time series forecasting for their ability to capture long-term dependencies. Experiments were conducted using 12 sagittal thoracic and upper-abdominal cine-MRI sequences from ETH Z\"urich and OvGU. PCA decomposes the Lucas-Kanade optical-flow field into static deformations and low-dimensional time-dependent weights. We compare various methods forecasting the latter: linear filters, population and sequence-specific encoder-only transformers, and RNNs trained with real-time recurrent learning (RTRL), unbiased online recurrent optimization, decoupled neural interfaces, and sparse one-step approximation (SnAp-1). Predicted displacements were used to warp the reference frame and generate future images. Prediction accuracy decreased with the horizon h. Linear regression performed best at short horizons (1.3mm geometrical error at h=0.32s, ETH Z\"urich data), while RTRL and SnAp-1 outperformed the other algorithms at medium-to-long horizons, with geometrical errors below 1.4mm and 2.8mm on the sequences from ETH Z\"urich and OvGU (the latter featuring higher motion variability, noise, and lower contrast), respectively. The sequence-specific transformer was competitive for low-to-medium horizons, but transformers remained overall limited by data scarcity and domain shift between datasets. Predicted frames visually resembled the ground truth, with notable errors occurring near the diaphragm at end-inspiration and regions affected by out-of-plane motion.</description>

Abstract: Data-driven developments in lensless imaging, such as machine learning-based reconstruction algorithms, require large datasets. In this work, we introduce a data acquisition pipeline that can capture from multiple lensless imaging systems in parallel, under the same imaging conditions, and paired with computational ground truth registration. We provide an open-access 25,000 image dataset with two lensless imagers, a reproducible hardware setup, and open-source camera synchronization code. Experimental datasets from our system can enable data-driven developments in lensless imaging, such as machine learning-based reconstruction algorithms and end-to-end system design.</description>

      <title>From Slices to Structures: Unsupervised 3D Reconstruction of Female Pelvic Anatomy from Freehand Transvaginal Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Volumetric ultrasound has the potential to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and clinical decision-making, yet its widespread adoption remains limited by dependence on specialized hardware and restrictive acquisition protocols. In this work, we present a novel unsupervised framework for reconstructing 3D anatomical structures from freehand 2D transvaginal ultrasound sweeps, without requiring external tracking or learned pose estimators. Our method, TVGS, adapts the principles of Gaussian Splatting to the domain of ultrasound, introducing a slice-aware, differentiable rasterizer tailored to the unique physics and geometry of ultrasound imaging. We model anatomy as a collection of anisotropic 3D Gaussians and optimize their parameters directly from image-level supervision. To ensure robustness against irregular probe motion, we introduce a joint optimization scheme that refines slice poses alongside anatomical structure. The result is a compact, flexible, and memory-efficient volumetric representation that captures anatomical detail with high spatial fidelity. This work demonstrates that accurate 3D reconstruction from 2D ultrasound images can be achieved through purely computational means, offering a scalable alternative to conventional 3D systems and enabling new opportunities for AI-assisted analysis and diagnosis.</description>

      <title>RDDM: Practicing RAW Domain Diffusion Model for Real-world Image Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data. While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and image generation. These models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM obviates this limitation by directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional two-stage image signal processing (ISP)-&gt;Image Restoration (IR) pipeline. However, a simple adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts many challenges. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE (RVAE), encoding sensor RAW and decoding it into an enhanced linear domain image, to solve the out-of-distribution (OOD) issues between the different domain distributions; (2) a configurable multi-bayer (CMB) LoRA module, adapting diverse RAW Bayer patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. To compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable data synthesis pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for large-scale training. Extensive experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts. Codes will be publicly available at https://github.com/YanCHEN-fr/RDDM.</description>

      <title>AI-Based Stroke Rehabilitation Domiciliary Assessment System with ST_GCN Attention</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective stroke recovery requires continuous rehabilitation integrated with daily living. To support this need, we propose a home-based rehabilitation exercise and feedback system. The system consists of (1) hardware setup with RGB-D camera and wearable sensors to capture stroke movements, (2) a mobile application for exercise guidance, and (3) an AI server for assessment and feedback. When a stroke user exercises following the application guidance, the system records skeleton sequences, which are then assessed by the deep learning model, RAST-G@ (Rehabilitation Assessment Spatio-Temporal Graph ATtention). The model employs a spatio-temporal graph convolutional network to extract skeletal features and integrates transformer-based temporal attention to figure out action quality. For system implementation, we constructed the NRC dataset, include 10 upper-limb activities of daily living (ADL) and 5 range-of-motion (ROM) collected from stroke and non-disabled participants, with Score annotations provided by licensed physiotherapists. Results on the KIMORE and NRC datasets show that RAST-G@ improves over baseline in terms of MAD, RMSE, and MAPE. Furthermore, the system provides user feedback that combines patient-centered assessment and monitoring. The results demonstrate that the proposed system offers a scalable approach for quantitative and consistent domiciliary rehabilitation assessment.</description>

      <title>SatFusion: A Unified Framework for Enhancing Remote Sensing Image via Multi-Frame and Multi-Source Image Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) imaging is constrained by hardware cost and physical limitations, making high-quality image acquisition challenging and motivating image fusion for quality enhancement. Multi-frame super-resolution (MFSR) and Pansharpening exploit complementary information from multiple frames and multiple sources, respectively, but are usually studied in isolation: MFSR lacks high-resolution structural priors for fine-grained texture recovery, while Pansharpening depends on upsampled multispectral images and is sensitive to noise and misalignment. With the rapid development of the Satellite Internet of Things (Sat-IoT), effectively leveraging large numbers of low-quality yet information-complementary images has become increasingly important. To this end, we propose SatFusion, a unified framework for enhancing RS images via joint multi-frame and multi-source fusion. SatFusion employs a Multi-Frame Image Fusion (MFIF) module to extract high-resolution semantic features from multiple low-resolution multispectral frames, and integrates fine-grained structural information from a high-resolution panchromatic image through a Multi-Source Image Fusion (MSIF) module, enabling robust feature integration with implicit pixel-level alignment. To further mitigate the lack of structural priors in multi-frame fusion, we introduce SatFusion*, which incorporates a panchromatic-guided mechanism into the multi-frame fusion stage. By combining structure-aware feature embedding with transformer-based adaptive aggregation, SatFusion* enables spatially adaptive selection of multi-frame features and strengthens the coupling between multi-frame and multi-source representations. Extensive experiments on the WorldStrat, WV3, QB, and GF2 datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform existing approaches in terms of reconstruction quality, robustness, and generalizability.</description>

      <title>Tumor-anchored deep feature random forests for out-of-distribution detection in lung cancer segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cancerous lesions from 3D computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and response assessment. However, even state-of-the-art models combining self-supervised learning (SSL) pretrained transformers with convolutional decoders are susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, generating confidently incorrect tumor segmentations, posing risks to safe clinical deployment. Existing logit-based methods suffer from task-specific model biases, while architectural enhancements to explicitly detect OOD increase parameters and computational costs. Hence, we introduce a lightweight, plug-and-play post-hoc random forests-based OOD detection framework called RF-Deep that leverages deep features with limited outlier exposure. RF-Deep enhances generalization to imaging variations by repurposing the hierarchical features from the pretrained-then-finetuned backbone, providing task-relevant OOD detection by extracting the features from multiple regions of interest anchored to the predicted tumor segmentations. We compared RF-Deep against existing OOD detection methods using 2,056 CT scans across near-OOD (pulmonary embolism, negative COVID-19) and far-OOD (kidney cancer, healthy pancreas) datasets. RF-Deep achieved AUROC &gt; 93.50 for the challenging near-OOD datasets and near-perfect detection (AUROC &gt; 99.00) for the far-OOD datasets, substantially outperforming logit-based and radiomics approaches. RF-Deep maintained consistent performance across networks of different depths and pretraining strategies, demonstrating its effectiveness as a lightweight, architecture-agnostic approach to enhance the reliability of tumor segmentation from CT volumes.</description>

      <title>Generative Video Compression: Towards 0.01% Compression Rate for Video Transmission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether a video can be compressed at an extreme compression rate as low as 0.01%? To this end, we achieve the compression rate as 0.02% at some cases by introducing Generative Video Compression (GVC), a new framework that redefines the limits of video compression by leveraging modern generative video models to achieve extreme compression rates while preserving a perception-centric, task-oriented communication paradigm, corresponding to Level C of the Shannon-Weaver model. Besides, How we trade computation for compression rate or bandwidth? GVC answers this question by shifting the burden from transmission to inference: it encodes video into extremely compact representations and delegates content reconstruction to the receiver, where powerful generative priors synthesize high-quality video from minimal transmitted information. Is GVC practical and deployable? To ensure practical deployment, we propose a compression-computation trade-off strategy, enabling fast inference on consume-grade GPUs. Within the AI Flow framework, GVC opens new possibility for video communication in bandwidth- and resource-constrained environments such as emergency rescue, remote surveillance, and mobile edge computing. Through empirical validation, we demonstrate that GVC offers a viable path toward a new effective, efficient, scalable, and practical video communication paradigm.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Rate Control for Neural Video Compression via Inter-Frame Rate-Distortion Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has demonstrated superior compression efficiency, yet effective rate control remains a significant challenge due to complex temporal dependencies. Existing rate control schemes typically leverage frame content to capture distortion interactions, overlooking inter-frame rate dependencies arising from shifts in per-frame coding parameters. This often leads to suboptimal bitrate allocation and cascading parameter decisions. To address this, we propose a reinforcement-learning (RL)-based rate control framework that formulates the task as a frame-by-frame sequential decision process. At each frame, an RL agent observes a spatiotemporal state and selects coding parameters to optimize a long-term reward that reflects rate-distortion (R-D) performance and bitrate adherence. Unlike prior methods, our approach jointly determines bitrate allocation and coding parameters in a single step, independent of group of pictures (GOP) structure. Extensive experiments across diverse NVC architectures show that our method reduces the average relative bitrate error to 1.20% and achieves up to 13.45% bitrate savings at typical GOP sizes, outperforming existing approaches. In addition, our framework demonstrates improved robustness to content variation and bandwidth fluctuations with lower coding overhead, making it highly suitable for practical deployment.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a deep transformer network for estimating the relative 6D pose of a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with respect to a ship using monocular images. A synthetic dataset of ship images is created and annotated with 2D keypoints of multiple ship parts. A Transformer Neural Network model is trained to detect these keypoints and estimate the 6D pose of each part. The estimates are integrated using Bayesian fusion. The model is tested on synthetic data and in-situ flight experiments, demonstrating robustness and accuracy in various lighting conditions. The position estimation error is approximately 0.8\% and 1.0\% of the distance to the ship for the synthetic data and the flight experiments, respectively. The method has potential applications for ship-based autonomous UAV landing and navigation.</description>

Abstract: Water diffusion gives rise to micron-scale sensitivity of diffusion MRI (dMRI) to cellular-level tissue structure. Precision medicine and quantitative imaging depend on uncovering the information content of dMRI and establishing its parsimonious hardware-independent fingerprint. Based on the rotational SO(3) symmetry, we study the geometry of the dMRI signal and the topology of its acquisition, identify irreducible components and a full set of invariants for the cumulant tensors, and relate them to tissue properties. Including all kurtosis invariants improves multiple sclerosis classification in a cohort of 1189 subjects. We design the shortest acquisitions based on icosahedral vertices to determine the most used invariants in only 1-2 minutes for whole brain. Representing dMRI via scalar invariant maps with definite symmetries will underpin machine learning classifiers of pathology, development, and aging, while fast protocols will enable translation of advanced dMRI into clinic.</description>

Abstract: Unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection aims to identify out-of-domain data by learning only from unlabeled In-Distribution (ID) training samples, which is crucial for developing a safe real-world machine learning system. Current reconstruction-based methods provide a good alternative approach by measuring the reconstruction error between the input and its corresponding generative counterpart in the pixel/feature space. However, such generative methods face a key dilemma: improving the reconstruction power of the generative model while keeping a compact representation of the ID data. To address this issue, we propose the diffusion-based layer-wise semantic reconstruction approach for unsupervised OOD detection. The innovation of our approach is that we leverage the diffusion model's intrinsic data reconstruction ability to distinguish ID samples from OOD samples in the latent feature space. Moreover, to set up a comprehensive and discriminative feature representation, we devise a multi-layer semantic feature extraction strategy. By distorting the extracted features with Gaussian noise and applying the diffusion model for feature reconstruction, the separation of ID and OOD samples is implemented according to the reconstruction errors. Extensive experimental results on multiple benchmarks built upon various datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of detection accuracy and speed.

      <title>An Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light Data Reconstruction (1986-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities. Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series studies that extend to earlier periods. Current extended VIIRS-like NTL data products suffer from two significant shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the omission of structural details. To overcome these limitations, we present the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light (EVAL) dataset, a new annual NTL dataset for China spanning from 1986 to 2024. This dataset was generated using a novel two-stage deep learning model designed to address the aforementioned shortcomings. The model first constructs an initial estimate and subsequently refines fine-grained structural details using high-resolution impervious surface data as guidance. Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that EVAL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art products, exhibiting superior temporal consistency and a stronger correlation with socioeconomic indicators.</description>

      <title>Hospital-Specific Bias in Patch-Based Pathology Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pathology foundation models (PFMs) achieve strong performance on diverse histopathology tasks, but their sensitivity to hospital-specific domain shifts remains underexplored. We systematically evaluate state-of-the-art PFMs on TCGA patch-level datasets and introduce a lightweight adversarial adaptor to remove hospital-related domain information from latent representations. Experiments show that, while disease classification accuracy is largely maintained, the adaptor effectively reduces hospital-specific bias, as confirmed by t-SNE visualizations. Our study establishes a benchmark for assessing cross-hospital robustness in PFMs and provides a practical strategy for enhancing generalization under heterogeneous clinical settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/MengRes/pfm_domain_bias.</description>

      <title>F-scheduler: illuminating the free-lunch design space for fast sampling of diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are the state-of-the-art generative models for high-resolution images, but sampling from pretrained models is computationally expensive, motivating interest in fast sampling. Although Free-U Net is a training-free enhancement for improving image quality, we find it ineffective under few-step ($&lt;10$) sampling. We analyze the discrete diffusion ODE and propose F-scheduler, a scheduler designed for ODE solvers with Free-U Net. Our proposed scheduler consists of a special time schedule that does not fully denoise the feature to enable the use of the KL-term in the $\beta$-VAE decoder, and the schedule of a proper inference stage for modifying the U-Net skip-connection via Free-U Net. Via information theory, we provide insights into how the better scheduled ODE solvers for the diffusion model can outperform the training-based diffusion distillation model. The newly proposed scheduler is compatible with most of the few-step ODE solvers and can sample a 1024 x 1024-resolution image in 6 steps and a 512 x 512-resolution image in 5 steps when it applies to DPM++ 2m and UniPC, with an FID result that outperforms the SOTA distillation models and the 20-step DPM++ 2m solver, respectively.

      <title>ARCAS: An Augmented Reality Collision Avoidance System with SLAM-Based Tracking for Enhancing VRU Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vulnerable road users (VRUs) face high collision risks in mixed traffic, yet most existing safety systems prioritize driver or vehicle assistance over direct VRU support. This paper presents ARCAS, a real-time augmented reality (AR) collision avoidance system that provides personalized spatial alerts to VRUs via wearable AR headsets. By fusing roadside 360{\deg} 3D LiDAR with SLAM-based headset tracking and an automatic 3D calibration procedure, ARCAS accurately overlays world-locked 3D bounding boxes and directional arrows onto approaching hazards in the user's passthrough view. The system also enables multi-headset coordination through shared world anchoring. Evaluated in real-world pedestrian interactions with e-scooters and vehicles (180 trials), ARCAS nearly doubles pedestrians' time to collision and increases counterparts' reaction margins by up to 4x compared to unaided eye conditions. Results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of LiDAR-driven AR guidance and highlight the potential of wearable AR as a promising next generation safety tool for urban mobility.</description>
