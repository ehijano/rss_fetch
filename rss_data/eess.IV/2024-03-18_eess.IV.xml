      <title>Selective nonlinearities removal from digital signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many instruments performing optical and non-optical imaging and sensing, such as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT), Magnetic Resonance Imaging or Fourier-transform spectrometry, produce digital signals containing modulations, sine-like components, which only after Fourier transformation give information about the structure or characteristics of the investigated object. Due to the fundamental physics-related limitations of such methods, the distribution of these signal components is often nonlinear and, when not properly compensated, leads to the resolution, precision or quality drop in the final image. Here, we propose an innovative approach that has the potential to allow cleaning of the signal from the nonlinearities but most of all, it now allows to switch the given order off, leaving all others intact. The latter provides a tool for more in-depth analysis of the nonlinearity-inducing properties of the investigated object, which can lead to applications in early disease detection or more sensitive sensing of chemical compounds. We consider OCT signals and nonlinearities up to the third order. In our approach, we propose two neural networks: one to remove solely the second-order nonlinearity and the other for removing solely the third-order nonlinearity. The input of the networks is a novel two-dimensional data structure with all the information needed for the network to infer a nonlinearity-free signal. We describe the developed networks and present the results for second-order and third-order nonlinearity removal in OCT data representing the images of various objects: a mirror, glass, and fruits.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Blood Flow in Data-Poor Regimes: A Vasculature Network Kernel for Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blood flow reconstruction in the vasculature is important for many clinical applications. However, in clinical settings, the available data are often quite limited. For instance, Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD) is a noninvasive clinical tool that is commonly used in the clinical settings to measure blood velocity waveform at several locations on brain's vasculature. This amount of data is grossly insufficient for training machine learning surrogate models, such as deep neural networks or Gaussian process regression. In this work, we propose a Gaussian process regression approach based on physics-informed kernels, enabling near-real-time reconstruction of blood flow in data-poor regimes. We introduce a novel methodology to reconstruct the kernel within the vascular network, which is a non-Euclidean space. The proposed kernel encodes both spatiotemporal and vessel-to-vessel correlations, thus enabling blood flow reconstruction in vessels that lack direct measurements. We demonstrate that any prediction made with the proposed kernel satisfies the conservation of mass principle. The kernel is constructed by running stochastic one-dimensional blood flow simulations, where the stochasticity captures the epistemic uncertainties, such as lack of knowledge about boundary conditions and uncertainties in vasculature geometries. We demonstrate the performance of the model on three test cases, namely, a simple Y-shaped bifurcation, abdominal aorta, and the Circle of Willis in the brain.</description>

      <title>FastSAM3D: An Efficient Segment Anything Model for 3D Volumetric Medical Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segment anything models (SAMs) are gaining attention for their zero-shot generalization capability in segmenting objects of unseen classes and in unseen domains when properly prompted. Interactivity is a key strength of SAMs, allowing users to iteratively provide prompts that specify objects of interest to refine outputs. However, to realize the interactive use of SAMs for 3D medical imaging tasks, rapid inference times are necessary. High memory requirements and long processing delays remain constraints that hinder the adoption of SAMs for this purpose. Specifically, while 2D SAMs applied to 3D volumes contend with repetitive computation to process all slices independently, 3D SAMs suffer from an exponential increase in model parameters and FLOPS. To address these challenges, we present FastSAM3D which accelerates SAM inference to 8 milliseconds per 128*128*128 3D volumetric image on an NVIDIA A100 GPU. This speedup is accomplished through 1) a novel layer-wise progressive distillation scheme that enables knowledge transfer from a complex 12-layer ViT-B to a lightweight 6-layer ViT-Tiny variant encoder without training from scratch; and 2) a novel 3D sparse flash attention to replace vanilla attention operators, substantially reducing memory needs and improving parallelization. Experiments on three diverse datasets reveal that FastSAM3D achieves a remarkable speedup of 527.38x compared to 2D SAMs and 8.75x compared to 3D SAMs on the same volumes without significant performance decline. Thus, FastSAM3D opens the door for low-cost truly interactive SAM-based 3D medical imaging segmentation with commonly used GPU hardware.

      <title>Analyzing Data Augmentation for Medical Images: A Case Study in Ultrasound Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data augmentation is one of the most effective techniques to improve the generalization performance of deep neural networks. Yet, despite often facing limited data availability in medical image analysis, it is frequently underutilized. This appears to be due to a gap in our collective understanding of the efficacy of different augmentation techniques across medical imaging tasks and modalities. One domain where this is especially true is breast ultrasound images. This work addresses this issue by analyzing the effectiveness of different augmentation techniques for the classification of breast lesions in ultrasound images. We assess the generalizability of our findings across several datasets, demonstrate that certain augmentations are far more effective than others, and show that their usage leads to significant performance gains.</description>

      <title>Empowering Healthcare through Privacy-Preserving MRI Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the healthcare domain, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) assumes a pivotal role, as it employs Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) methodologies to extract invaluable insights from imaging data. Nonetheless, the imperative need for patient privacy poses significant challenges when collecting data from diverse healthcare sources. Consequently, the Deep Learning (DL) communities occasionally face difficulties detecting rare features. In this research endeavor, we introduce the Ensemble-Based Federated Learning (EBFL) Framework, an innovative solution tailored to address this challenge. The EBFL framework deviates from the conventional approach by emphasizing model features over sharing sensitive patient data. This unique methodology fosters a collaborative and privacy-conscious environment for healthcare institutions, empowering them to harness the capabilities of a centralized server for model refinement while upholding the utmost data privacy standards.Conversely, a robust ensemble architecture boasts potent feature extraction capabilities, distinguishing itself from a single DL model. This quality makes it remarkably dependable for MRI analysis. By harnessing our groundbreaking EBFL methodology, we have achieved remarkable precision in the classification of brain tumors, including glioma, meningioma, pituitary, and non-tumor instances, attaining a precision rate of 94% for the Global model and an impressive 96% for the Ensemble model. Our models underwent rigorous evaluation using conventional performance metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. Integrating DL within the Federated Learning (FL) framework has yielded a methodology that offers precise and dependable diagnostics for detecting brain tumors.</description>

      <title>Attention-Enhanced Hybrid Feature Aggregation Network for 3D Brain Tumor Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive and malignant brain tumor type that requires early diagnosis and prompt intervention. Due to its heterogeneity in appearance, developing automated detection approaches is challenging. To address this challenge, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven approaches in healthcare have generated interest in efficiently diagnosing and evaluating brain tumors. The Brain Tumor Segmentation Challenge (BraTS) is a platform for developing and assessing automated techniques for tumor analysis using high-quality, clinically acquired MRI data. In our approach, we utilized a multi-scale, attention-guided and hybrid U-Net-shaped model -- GLIMS -- to perform 3D brain tumor segmentation in three regions: Enhancing Tumor (ET), Tumor Core (TC), and Whole Tumor (WT). The multi-scale feature extraction provides better contextual feature aggregation in high resolutions and the Swin Transformer blocks improve the global feature extraction at deeper levels of the model. The segmentation mask generation in the decoder branch is guided by the attention-refined features gathered from the encoder branch to enhance the important attributes. Moreover, hierarchical supervision is used to train the model efficiently. Our model's performance on the validation set resulted in 92.19, 87.75, and 83.18 Dice Scores and 89.09, 84.67, and 82.15 Lesion-wise Dice Scores in WT, TC, and ET, respectively. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/yaziciz/GLIMS.</description>

      <title>Boundary Constraint-free Biomechanical Model-Based Surface Matching for Intraoperative Liver Deformation Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In image-guided liver surgery, 3D-3D non-rigid registration methods play a crucial role in estimating the mapping between the preoperative model and the intraoperative surface represented as point clouds, addressing the challenge of tissue deformation. Typically, these methods incorporate a biomechanical model, represented as a finite element model (FEM), used to regularize a surface matching term. This paper introduces a novel 3D-3D non-rigid registration method. In contrast to the preceding techniques, our method uniquely incorporates the FEM within the surface matching term itself, ensuring that the estimated deformation maintains geometric consistency throughout the registration process. Additionally, we eliminate the need to determine zero-boundary conditions and applied force locations in the FEM. We achieve this by integrating soft springs into the stiffness matrix and allowing forces to be distributed across the entire liver surface. To further improve robustness, we introduce a regularization technique focused on the gradient of the force magnitudes. This regularization imposes spatial smoothness and helps prevent the overfitting of irregular noise in intraoperative data. Optimization is achieved through an accelerated proximal gradient algorithm, further enhanced by our proposed method for determining the optimal step size. Our method is evaluated and compared to both a learning-based method and a traditional method that features FEM regularization using data collected on our custom-developed phantom, as well as two publicly available datasets. Our method consistently outperforms or is comparable to the baseline techniques. Both the code and dataset will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Cardiac Magnetic Resonance 2D+T Short- and Long-axis Segmentation via Spatio-temporal SAM Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate 2D+T myocardium segmentation in cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) scans is essential to analyze LV motion throughout the cardiac cycle comprehensively. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), known for its accurate segmentation and zero-shot generalization, has not yet been tailored for CMR 2D+T segmentation. We therefore introduce CMR2D+T-SAM, a novel approach to adapt SAM for CMR 2D+T segmentation using spatio-temporal adaption. This approach also incorporates a U-Net framework for multi-scale feature extraction, as well as text prompts for accurate segmentation on both short-axis (SAX) and long-axis (LAX) views using a single model. CMR2D+T-SAM outperforms existing deep learning methods on the STACOM2011 dataset, achieving a myocardium Dice score of 0.885 and a Hausdorff distance (HD) of 2.900 pixels. It also demonstrates superior zero-shot generalization on the ACDC dataset with a Dice score of 0.840 and a HD of 4.076 pixels.</description>

      <title>Histo-Genomic Knowledge Distillation For Cancer Prognosis From Histopathology Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Histo-genomic multi-modal methods have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm, demonstrating significant potential for improving cancer prognosis. However, genome sequencing, unlike histopathology imaging, is still not widely accessible in underdeveloped regions, limiting the application of these multi-modal approaches in clinical settings. To address this, we propose a novel Genome-informed Hyper-Attention Network, termed G-HANet, which is capable of effectively distilling the histo-genomic knowledge during training to elevate uni-modal whole slide image (WSI)-based inference for the first time. Compared with traditional knowledge distillation methods (i.e., teacher-student architecture) in other tasks, our end-to-end model is superior in terms of training efficiency and learning cross-modal interactions. Specifically, the network comprises the cross-modal associating branch (CAB) and hyper-attention survival branch (HSB). Through the genomic data reconstruction from WSIs, CAB effectively distills the associations between functional genotypes and morphological phenotypes and offers insights into the gene expression profiles in the feature space. Subsequently, HSB leverages the distilled histo-genomic associations as well as the generated morphology-based weights to achieve the hyper-attention modeling of the patients from both histopathology and genomic perspectives to improve cancer prognosis. Extensive experiments are conducted on five TCGA benchmarking datasets and the results demonstrate that G-HANet significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art WSI-based methods and achieves competitive performance with genome-based and multi-modal methods. G-HANet is expected to be explored as a useful tool by the research community to address the current bottleneck of insufficient histo-genomic data pairing in the context of cancer prognosis and precision oncology.</description>

      <title>Progressive Divide-and-Conquer via Subsampling Decomposition for Accelerated MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep unfolding networks (DUN) have emerged as a popular iterative framework for accelerated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. However, conventional DUN aims to reconstruct all the missing information within the entire null space in each iteration. Thus it could be challenging when dealing with highly ill-posed degradation, usually leading to unsatisfactory reconstruction. In this work, we propose a Progressive Divide-And-Conquer (PDAC) strategy, aiming to break down the subsampling process in the actual severe degradation and thus perform reconstruction sequentially. Starting from decomposing the original maximum-a-posteriori problem of accelerated MRI, we present a rigorous derivation of the proposed PDAC framework, which could be further unfolded into an end-to-end trainable network. Specifically, each iterative stage in PDAC focuses on recovering a distinct moderate degradation according to the decomposition. Furthermore, as part of the PDAC iteration, such decomposition is adaptively learned as an auxiliary task through a degradation predictor which provides an estimation of the decomposed sampling mask. Following this prediction, the sampling mask is further integrated via a severity conditioning module to ensure awareness of the degradation severity at each stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance on the publicly available fastMRI and Stanford2D FSE datasets in both multi-coil and single-coil settings.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Convolutional and Attention Network for Hyperspectral Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is critical for the effective analysis and interpretation of hyperspectral data. However, simultaneously modeling global and local features is rarely explored to enhance HSI denoising. In this letter, we propose a hybrid convolution and attention network (HCANet), which leverages both the strengths of convolution neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers. To enhance the modeling of both global and local features, we have devised a convolution and attention fusion module aimed at capturing long-range dependencies and neighborhood spectral correlations. Furthermore, to improve multi-scale information aggregation, we design a multi-scale feed-forward network to enhance denoising performance by extracting features at different scales. Experimental results on mainstream HSI datasets demonstrate the rationality and effectiveness of the proposed HCANet. The proposed model is effective in removing various types of complex noise. Our codes are available at \url{https://github.com/summitgao/HCANet}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Full DNN-based image signal processors (ISPs) have been actively studied and have achieved superior image quality compared to conventional ISPs. In contrast to this trend, we propose a lightweight ISP that consists of simple conventional ISP functions but achieves high image quality by increasing expressiveness. Specifically, instead of tuning the parameters of the ISP, we propose to control them dynamically for each environment and even locally. As a result, state-of-the-art accuracy is achieved on various datasets, including other tasks like tone mapping and image enhancement, even though ours is lighter than DNN-based ISPs. Additionally, our method can process different image sensors with a single ISP through dynamic control, whereas conventional methods require training for each sensor.</description>

      <title>Cardiac valve event timing in echocardiography using deep learning and triplane recordings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardiac valve event timing plays a crucial role when conducting clinical measurements using echocardiography. However, established automated approaches are limited by the need of external electrocardiogram sensors, and manual measurements often rely on timing from different cardiac cycles. Recent methods have applied deep learning to cardiac timing, but they have mainly been restricted to only detecting two key time points, namely end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES). In this work, we propose a deep learning approach that leverages triplane recordings to enhance detection of valve events in echocardiography. Our method demonstrates improved performance detecting six different events, including valve events conventionally associated with ED and ES. Of all events, we achieve an average absolute frame difference (aFD) of maximum 1.4 frames (29 ms) for start of diastasis, down to 0.6 frames (12 ms) for mitral valve opening when performing a ten-fold cross-validation with test splits on triplane data from 240 patients. On an external independent test consisting of apical long-axis data from 180 other patients, the worst performing event detection had an aFD of 1.8 (30 ms). The proposed approach has the potential to significantly impact clinical practice by enabling more accurate, rapid and comprehensive event detection, leading to improved clinical measurements.</description>

      <title>Learning on JPEG-LDPC Compressed Images: Classifying with Syndromes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In goal-oriented communications, the objective of the receiver is often to apply a Deep-Learning model, rather than reconstructing the original data. In this context, direct learning over compressed data, without any prior decoding, holds promise for enhancing the time-efficient execution of inference models at the receiver. However, conventional entropic-coding methods like Huffman and Arithmetic break data structure, rendering them unsuitable for learning without decoding. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach in which entropic coding is realized with Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes. We hypothesize that Deep Learning models can more effectively exploit the internal code structure of LDPC codes. At the receiver, we leverage a specific class of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), trained for image classification. Our numerical results indicate that classification based on LDPC-coded bit-planes surpasses Huffman and Arithmetic coding, while necessitating a significantly smaller learning model. This demonstrates the efficiency of classification directly from LDPC-coded data, eliminating the need for any form of decompression, even partial, prior to applying the learning model.</description>

      <title>End-to-end Adaptive Dynamic Subsampling and Reconstruction for Cardiac MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accelerating dynamic MRI is essential for enhancing clinical applications, such as adaptive radiotherapy, and improving patient comfort. Traditional deep learning (DL) approaches for accelerated dynamic MRI reconstruction typically rely on predefined or random subsampling patterns, applied uniformly across all temporal phases. This standard practice overlooks the potential benefits of leveraging temporal correlations and lacks the adaptability required for case-specific subsampling optimization, which holds the potential for maximizing reconstruction quality. Addressing this gap, we present a novel end-to-end framework for adaptive dynamic MRI subsampling and reconstruction. Our pipeline integrates a DL-based adaptive sampler, generating case-specific dynamic subsampling patterns, trained end-to-end with a state-of-the-art 2D dynamic reconstruction network, namely vSHARP, which effectively reconstructs the adaptive dynamic subsampled data into a moving image. Our method is assessed using dynamic cine cardiac MRI data, comparing its performance against vSHARP models that employ common subsampling trajectories, and pipelines trained to optimize dataset-specific sampling schemes alongside vSHARP reconstruction. Our results indicate superior reconstruction quality, particularly at high accelerations.</description>

      <title>CPGA: Coding Priors-Guided Aggregation Network for Compressed Video Quality Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, numerous approaches have achieved notable success in compressed video quality enhancement (VQE). However, these methods usually ignore the utilization of valuable coding priors inherently embedded in compressed videos, such as motion vectors and residual frames, which carry abundant temporal and spatial information. To remedy this problem, we propose the Coding Priors-Guided Aggregation (CPGA) network to utilize temporal and spatial information from coding priors. The CPGA mainly consists of an inter-frame temporal aggregation (ITA) module and a multi-scale non-local aggregation (MNA) module. Specifically, the ITA module aggregates temporal information from consecutive frames and coding priors, while the MNA module globally captures spatial information guided by residual frames. In addition, to facilitate research in VQE task, we newly construct the Video Coding Priors (VCP) dataset, comprising 300 videos with various coding priors extracted from corresponding bitstreams. It remedies the shortage of previous datasets on the lack of coding information. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. The code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/CPGA/CPGA.git.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Distribution Shifts in Plug-and-Play Methods with Test-Time Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plug-and-Play Priors (PnP) is a well-known class of methods for solving inverse problems in computational imaging. PnP methods combine physical forward models with learned prior models specified as image denoisers. A common issue with the learned models is that of a performance drop when there is a distribution shift between the training and testing data. Test-time training (TTT) was recently proposed as a general strategy for improving the performance of learned models when training and testing data come from different distributions. In this paper, we propose PnP-TTT as a new method for overcoming distribution shifts in PnP. PnP-TTT uses deep equilibrium learning (DEQ) for optimizing a self-supervised loss at the fixed points of PnP iterations. PnP-TTT can be directly applied on a single test sample to improve the generalization of PnP. We show through simulations that given a sufficient number of measurements, PnP-TTT enables the use of image priors trained on natural images for image reconstruction in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).</description>

      <title>Tensor Star Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel tensor decomposition framework, termed Tensor Star (TS) decomposition, is proposed which represents a new type of tensor network decomposition based on tensor contractions. This is achieved by connecting the core tensors in a ring shape, whereby the core tensors act as skip connections between the factor tensors and allow for direct correlation characterisation between any two arbitrary dimensions. Uniquely, this makes it possible to decompose an order-$N$ tensor into $N$ order-$3$ factor tensors $\{\mathcal{G}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{N}$ and $N$ order-$4$ core tensors $\{\mathcal{C}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{N}$, which are arranged in a star shape. Unlike the class of Tensor Train (TT) decompositions, these factor tensors are not directly connected to one another. The so obtained core tensors also enable consecutive factor tensors to have different latent ranks. In this way, the TS decomposition alleviates the "curse of dimensionality" and controls the "curse of ranks", exhibiting a storage complexity which scales linearly with the number of dimensions and as the fourth power of the ranks.</description>

      <title>On Unsupervised Image-to-image translation and GAN stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of image-to-image translation is one that is intruiging and challenging at the same time, for the impact potential it can have on a wide variety of other computer vision applications like colorization, inpainting, segmentation and others. Given the high-level of sophistication needed to extract patterns from one domain and successfully applying them to another, especially, in a completely unsupervised (unpaired) manner, this problem has gained much attention as of the last few years. It is one of the first problems where successful applications to deep generative models, and especially Generative Adversarial Networks achieved astounding results that are actually of realworld impact, rather than just a show of theoretical prowess; the such that has been dominating the GAN world. In this work, we study some of the failure cases of a seminal work in the field, CycleGAN [1] and hypothesize that they are GAN-stability related, and propose two general models to try to alleviate these problems. We also reach the same conclusion of the problem being ill-posed that has been also circulating in the literature lately.</description>

Abstract: Food security has grown in significance due to the changing climate and its warming effects. To support the rising demand for agricultural products and to minimize the negative impact of climate change and mass cultivation, precision agriculture has become increasingly important for crop cultivation. This study employs deep learning and pixel-based machine learning methods to accurately segment lavender fields for precision agriculture, utilizing various spectral band combinations extracted from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. Our fine-tuned final model, a U-Net architecture, can achieve a Dice coefficient of 0.8324. Additionally, our investigation highlights the unexpected efficacy of the pixel-based method and the RGB spectral band combination in this task.</description>

      <title>Skeleton-Based Human Action Recognition with Noisy Labels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding human actions from body poses is critical for assistive robots sharing space with humans in order to make informed and safe decisions about the next interaction. However, precise temporal localization and annotation of activity sequences is time-consuming and the resulting labels are often noisy. If not effectively addressed, label noise negatively affects the model's training, resulting in lower recognition quality. Despite its importance, addressing label noise for skeleton-based action recognition has been overlooked so far. In this study, we bridge this gap by implementing a framework that augments well-established skeleton-based human action recognition methods with label-denoising strategies from various research areas to serve as the initial benchmark. Observations reveal that these baselines yield only marginal performance when dealing with sparse skeleton data. Consequently, we introduce a novel methodology, NoiseEraSAR, which integrates global sample selection, co-teaching, and Cross-Modal Mixture-of-Experts (CM-MOE) strategies, aimed at mitigating the adverse impacts of label noise. Our proposed approach demonstrates better performance on the established benchmark, setting new state-of-the-art standards. The source code for this study will be made accessible at https://github.com/xuyizdby/NoiseEraSAR.</description>

      <title>TRG-Net: An Interpretable and Controllable Rain Generator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring and modeling rain generation mechanism is critical for augmenting paired data to ease training of rainy image processing models. Against this task, this study proposes a novel deep learning based rain generator, which fully takes the physical generation mechanism underlying rains into consideration and well encodes the learning of the fundamental rain factors (i.e., shape, orientation, length, width and sparsity) explicitly into the deep network. Its significance lies in that the generator not only elaborately design essential elements of the rain to simulate expected rains, like conventional artificial strategies, but also finely adapt to complicated and diverse practical rainy images, like deep learning methods. By rationally adopting filter parameterization technique, we first time achieve a deep network that is finely controllable with respect to rain factors and able to learn the distribution of these factors purely from data. Our unpaired generation experiments demonstrate that the rain generated by the proposed rain generator is not only of higher quality, but also more effective for deraining and downstream tasks compared to current state-of-the-art rain generation methods. Besides, the paired data augmentation experiments, including both in-distribution and out-of-distribution (OOD), further validate the diversity of samples generated by our model for in-distribution deraining and OOD generalization tasks.</description>

      <title>Real-World Computational Aberration Correction via Quantized Domain-Mixing Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relying on paired synthetic data, existing learning-based Computational Aberration Correction (CAC) methods are confronted with the intricate and multifaceted synthetic-to-real domain gap, which leads to suboptimal performance in real-world applications. In this paper, in contrast to improving the simulation pipeline, we deliver a novel insight into real-world CAC from the perspective of Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). By incorporating readily accessible unpaired real-world data into training, we formalize the Domain Adaptive CAC (DACAC) task, and then introduce a comprehensive Real-world aberrated images (Realab) dataset to benchmark it. The setup task presents a formidable challenge due to the intricacy of understanding the target aberration domain. To this intent, we propose a novel Quntized Domain-Mixing Representation (QDMR) framework as a potent solution to the issue. QDMR adapts the CAC model to the target domain from three key aspects: (1) reconstructing aberrated images of both domains by a VQGAN to learn a Domain-Mixing Codebook (DMC) which characterizes the degradation-aware priors; (2) modulating the deep features in CAC model with DMC to transfer the target domain knowledge; and (3) leveraging the trained VQGAN to generate pseudo target aberrated images from the source ones for convincing target domain supervision. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks reveal that the models with QDMR consistently surpass the competitive methods in mitigating the synthetic-to-real gap, which produces visually pleasant real-world CAC results with fewer artifacts. Codes and datasets will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Control and Automation for Industrial Production Storage Zone: Generation of Optimal Route Using Image Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital image processing (DIP) is of great importance in validating and guaranteeing parameters that ensure the quality of mass-produced products. Therefore, this article focused on developing an industrial automation method for a zone of a production line model using the DIP. The neo-cascade methodology employed allowed for defining each of the stages in an adequate way, ensuring the inclusion of the relevant methods for its development, which finally incurred in the modeling, design, implementation, and testing of an optimal route generation system for a warehouse area, using DIP with optimization guidelines, in conjunction with an embedded platform and the connection to programmable logic controllers (PLCs) for its execution. The system was based on the OpenCV library; tool focused on artificial vision, which was implemented on an object-oriented programming (OOP) platform based on Java language. It generated the optimal route for the automation of processes in a scale warehouse area, using the segmentation of objects and the optimization of flow in networks as pillars, ending with the connection to PLCs as a method of action, which in case of implementation would eliminate constraints such as process inefficiency, the use of manpower to perform these tasks, inadequate use of resources, among others</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous driving demands high-quality LiDAR data, yet the cost of physical LiDAR sensors presents a significant scaling-up challenge. While recent efforts have explored deep generative models to address this issue, they often consume substantial computational resources with slow generation speeds while suffering from a lack of realism. To address these limitations, we introduce RangeLDM, a novel approach for rapidly generating high-quality range-view LiDAR point clouds via latent diffusion models. We achieve this by correcting range-view data distribution for accurate projection from point clouds to range images via Hough voting, which has a critical impact on generative learning. We then compress the range images into a latent space with a variational autoencoder, and leverage a diffusion model to enhance expressivity. Additionally, we instruct the model to preserve 3D structural fidelity by devising a range-guided discriminator. Experimental results on KITTI-360 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate both the robust expressiveness and fast speed of our LiDAR point cloud generation.</description>

      <title>Strong and Controllable Blind Image Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind image decomposition aims to decompose all components present in an image, typically used to restore a multi-degraded input image. While fully recovering the clean image is appealing, in some scenarios, users might want to retain certain degradations, such as watermarks, for copyright protection. To address this need, we add controllability to the blind image decomposition process, allowing users to enter which types of degradation to remove or retain. We design an architecture named controllable blind image decomposition network. Inserted in the middle of U-Net structure, our method first decomposes the input feature maps and then recombines them according to user instructions. Advantageously, this functionality is implemented at minimal computational cost: decomposition and recombination are all parameter-free. Experimentally, our system excels in blind image decomposition tasks and can outputs partially or fully restored images that well reflect user intentions. Furthermore, we evaluate and configure different options for the network structure and loss functions. This, combined with the proposed decomposition-and-recombination method, yields an efficient and competitive system for blind image decomposition, compared with current state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2201.01034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PSNR-oriented models are a critical class of super-resolution models with applications across various fields. However, these models tend to generate over-smoothed images, a problem that has been analyzed previously from the perspectives of models or loss functions, but without taking into account the impact of data properties. In this paper, we present a novel phenomenon that we term the center-oriented optimization (COO) problem, where a model's output converges towards the center point of similar high-resolution images, rather than towards the ground truth. We demonstrate that the strength of this problem is related to the uncertainty of data, which we quantify using entropy. We prove that as the entropy of high-resolution images increases, their center point will move further away from the clean image distribution, and the model will generate over-smoothed images. Implicitly optimizing the COO problem, perceptual-driven approaches such as perceptual loss, model structure optimization, or GAN-based methods can be viewed. We propose an explicit solution to the COO problem, called Detail Enhanced Contrastive Loss (DECLoss). DECLoss utilizes the clustering property of contrastive learning to directly reduce the variance of the potential high-resolution distribution and thereby decrease the entropy. We evaluate DECLoss on multiple super-resolution benchmarks and demonstrate that it improves the perceptual quality of PSNR-oriented models. Moreover, when applied to GAN-based methods, such as RaGAN, DECLoss helps to achieve state-of-the-art performance, such as 0.093 LPIPS with 24.51 PSNR on 4x downsampled Urban100, validating the effectiveness and generalization of our approach.</description>

      <title>Ring Deconvolution Microscopy: An Exact Solution for Spatially-Varying Aberration Correction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.08928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The most ubiquitous form of computational aberration correction for microscopy is deconvolution. However, deconvolution relies on the assumption that the point spread function is the same across the entire field-of-view. It is well recognized that this assumption is often inadequate, but space-variant deblurring techniques generally require impractical amounts of calibration and computation. We present a new imaging pipeline, ring deconvolution microscopy (RDM), that leverages the rotational symmetry of most optical systems to provide simple and fast spatially-varying aberration correction. We formally derive theory and algorithms for exact image recovery and additionally propose a neural network based on Seidel coefficients as a fast alternative. We showcase significant enhancements both visually and quantitatively compared to standard deconvolution and existing spatially-varying deconvolution across a diverse range of microscope modalities, including miniature microscopy, multicolor fluorescence microscopy, and point-scanning multimode fiber micro-endoscopy. Our approach enables near-isotropic, subcellular resolution in each of these applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.09783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image recognition often faces the problem of insufficient data in practical applications. Image recognition and processing under few-shot conditions will produce overfitting, low recognition accuracy, low reliability and insufficient robustness. It is often the case that the difference of characteristics is subtle, and the recognition is affected by perspectives, background, occlusion and other factors, which increases the difficulty of recognition. Furthermore, in fine-grained images, the few-shot problem leads to insufficient useful feature information in the images. Considering the characteristics of few-shot and fine-grained image recognition, this study has established a recognition model based on attention and Siamese neural network. Aiming at the problem of few-shot samples, a Siamese neural network suitable for classification model is proposed. The Attention-Based neural network is used as the main network to improve the classification effect. Covid- 19 lung samples have been selected for testing the model. The results show that the less the number of image samples are, the more obvious the advantage shows than the ordinary neural network.</description>

Abstract: Brain tumors remain a critical global health challenge, necessitating advancements in diagnostic techniques and treatment methodologies. A tumor or its recurrence often needs to be identified in imaging studies and differentiated from normal brain tissue. In response to the growing need for age-specific segmentation models, particularly for pediatric patients, this study explores the deployment of deep learning techniques using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities. By introducing a novel ensemble approach using ONet and modified versions of UNet, coupled with innovative loss functions, this study achieves a precise segmentation model for the BraTS-PEDs 2023 Challenge. Data augmentation, including both single and composite transformations, ensures model robustness and accuracy across different scanning protocols. The ensemble strategy, integrating the ONet and UNet models, shows greater effectiveness in capturing specific features and modeling diverse aspects of the MRI images which result in lesion wise Dice scores of 0.52, 0.72 and 0.78 on unseen validation data and scores of 0.55, 0.70, 0.79 on final testing data for the "enhancing tumor", "tumor core" and "whole tumor" labels respectively. Visual comparisons further confirm the superiority of the ensemble method in accurate tumor region coverage. The results indicate that this advanced ensemble approach, building upon the unique strengths of individual models, offers promising prospects for enhanced diagnostic accuracy and effective treatment planning and monitoring for brain tumors in pediatric brains.</description>

      <title>Image Demoireing in RAW and sRGB Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Moire patterns frequently appear when capturing screens with smartphones or cameras, potentially compromising image quality. Previous studies suggest that moire pattern elimination in the RAW domain offers greater effectiveness compared to demoireing in the sRGB domain. Nevertheless, relying solely on RAW data for image demoireing is insufficient in mitigating the color cast due to the absence of essential information required for the color correction by the image signal processor (ISP). In this paper, we propose to jointly utilize both RAW and sRGB data for image demoireing (RRID), which are readily accessible in modern smartphones and DSLR cameras. We develop Skip-Connection-based Demoireing Module (SCDM) with Gated Feedback Module (GFM) and Frequency Selection Module (FSM) embedded in skip-connections for the efficient and effective demoireing of RAW and sRGB features, respectively. Subsequently, we design a RGB Guided ISP (RGISP) to learn a device-dependent ISP, assisting the process of color recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our RRID outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, in terms of the performance in moire pattern removal and color cast correction by 0.62dB in PSNR and 0.003 in SSIM.</description>

      <title>Brain Tumor Segmentation Based on Deep Learning, Attention Mechanisms, and Energy-Based Uncertainty Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brain tumors are one of the deadliest forms of cancer with a mortality rate of over 80%. A quick and accurate diagnosis is crucial to increase the chance of survival. However, in medical analysis, the manual annotation and segmentation of a brain tumor can be a complicated task. Multiple MRI modalities are typically analyzed as they provide unique information regarding the tumor regions. Although these MRI modalities are helpful for segmenting gliomas, they tend to increase overfitting and computation. This paper proposes a region of interest detection algorithm that is implemented during data preprocessing to locate salient features and remove extraneous MRI data. This decreases the input size, allowing for more aggressive data augmentations and deeper neural networks. Following the preprocessing of the MRI modalities, a fully convolutional autoencoder with soft attention segments the different brain MRIs. When these deep learning algorithms are implemented in practice, analysts and physicians cannot differentiate between accurate and inaccurate predictions. Subsequently, test time augmentations and an energy-based model were used for voxel-based uncertainty predictions. Experimentation was conducted on the BraTS benchmarks and achieved state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Additionally, qualitative results were used to assess the segmentation models and uncertainty predictions.</description>

      <title>Detecting Brain Tumors through Multimodal Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tumors can manifest in various forms and in different areas of the human body. Brain tumors are specifically hard to diagnose and treat because of the complexity of the organ in which they develop. Detecting them in time can lower the chances of death and facilitate the therapy process for patients. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, more specifically, deep learning, has the potential to significantly reduce costs in terms of time and resources for the discovery and identification of tumors from images obtained through imaging techniques. This research work aims to assess the performance of a multimodal model for the classification of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans processed as grayscale images. The results are promising, and in line with similar works, as the model reaches an accuracy of around 98\%. We also highlight the need for explainability and transparency to ensure human control and safety.</description>

      <title>Fully Differentiable Correlation-driven 2D/3D Registration for X-ray to CT Image Fusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Image-based rigid 2D/3D registration is a critical technique for fluoroscopic guided surgical interventions. In recent years, some learning-based fully differentiable methods have produced beneficial outcomes while the process of feature extraction and gradient flow transmission still lack controllability and interpretability. To alleviate these problems, in this work, we propose a novel fully differentiable correlation-driven network using a dual-branch CNN-transformer encoder which enables the network to extract and separate low-frequency global features from high-frequency local features. A correlation-driven loss is further proposed for low-frequency feature and high-frequency feature decomposition based on embedded information. Besides, a training strategy that learns to approximate a convex-shape similarity function is applied in our work. We test our approach on a in-house datasetand show that it outperforms both existing fully differentiable learning-based registration approaches and the conventional optimization-based baseline.</description>

      <title>Architecture Analysis and Benchmarking of 3D U-shaped Deep Learning Models for Thoracic Anatomical Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent rising interests in patient-specific thoracic surgical planning and simulation require efficient and robust creation of digital anatomical models from automatic medical image segmentation algorithms. Deep learning (DL) is now state-of-the-art in various radiological tasks, and U-shaped DL models have particularly excelled in medical image segmentation since the inception of the 2D UNet. To date, many variants of U-shaped models have been proposed by the integration of different attention mechanisms and network configurations. Systematic benchmark studies which analyze the architecture of these models by leveraging the recent development of the multi-label databases, can provide valuable insights for clinical deployment and future model designs, but such studies are still rare. We conduct the first systematic benchmark study for variants of 3D U-shaped models (3DUNet, STUNet, AttentionUNet, SwinUNETR, FocalSegNet, and a novel 3D SwinUnet with four variants) with a focus on CT-based anatomical segmentation for thoracic surgery. Our study systematically examines the impact of different attention mechanisms, the number of resolution stages, and network configurations on segmentation accuracy and computational complexity. To allow cross-reference with other recent benchmarking studies, we also included a performance assessment of the BTCV abdominal structural segmentation. With the STUNet ranking at the top, our study demonstrated the value of CNN-based U-shaped models for the investigated tasks and the benefit of residual blocks in network configuration designs to boost segmentation performance.</description>

      <title>CAMixerSR: Only Details Need More "Attention"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To satisfy the rapidly increasing demands on the large image (2K-8K) super-resolution (SR), prevailing methods follow two independent tracks: 1) accelerate existing networks by content-aware routing, and 2) design better super-resolution networks via token mixer refining. Despite directness, they encounter unavoidable defects (e.g., inflexible route or non-discriminative processing) limiting further improvements of quality-complexity trade-off. To erase the drawbacks, we integrate these schemes by proposing a content-aware mixer (CAMixer), which assigns convolution for simple contexts and additional deformable window-attention for sparse textures. Specifically, the CAMixer uses a learnable predictor to generate multiple bootstraps, including offsets for windows warping, a mask for classifying windows, and convolutional attentions for endowing convolution with the dynamic property, which modulates attention to include more useful textures self-adaptively and improves the representation capability of convolution. We further introduce a global classification loss to improve the accuracy of predictors. By simply stacking CAMixers, we obtain CAMixerSR which achieves superior performance on large-image SR, lightweight SR, and omnidirectional-image SR.</description>

      <title>A Dual-domain Regularization Method for Ring Artifact Removal of X-ray CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ring artifacts in computed tomography images, arising from the undesirable responses of detector units, significantly degrade image quality and diagnostic reliability. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-domain regularization model to effectively remove ring artifacts, while maintaining the integrity of the original CT image. The proposed model corrects the vertical stripe artifacts on the sinogram by innovatively updating the response inconsistency compensation coefficients of detector units, which is achieved by employing the group sparse constraint and the projection-view direction sparse constraint on the stripe artifacts. Simultaneously, we apply the sparse constraint on the reconstructed image to further rectified ring artifacts in the image domain. The key advantage of the proposed method lies in considering the relationship between the response inconsistency compensation coefficients of the detector units and the projection views, which enables a more accurate correction of the response of the detector units. An alternating minimization method is designed to solve the model. Comparative experiments on real photon counting detector data demonstrate that the proposed method not only surpasses existing methods in removing ring artifacts but also excels in preserving structural details and image fidelity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the realm of medical imaging, particularly for COVID-19 detection, deep learning models face substantial challenges such as the necessity for extensive computational resources, the paucity of well-annotated datasets, and a significant amount of unlabeled data. In this work, we introduce the first lightweight detector designed to overcome these obstacles, leveraging a frozen CLIP image encoder and a trainable multilayer perception (MLP). Enhanced with Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) for robustness and a loss landscape flattening strategy for improved generalization, our model is tailored for high efficacy in COVID-19 detection. Furthermore, we integrate a teacher-student framework to capitalize on the vast amounts of unlabeled data, enabling our model to achieve superior performance despite the inherent data limitations. Experimental results on the COV19-CT-DB dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, surpassing baseline by up to 10.6% in `macro' F1 score in supervised learning.

      <title>Perceptual Quality Assessment of Virtual Reality Videos in the Wild</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.08751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.08751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating how people perceive virtual reality (VR) videos in the wild (i.e., those captured by everyday users) is a crucial and challenging task in VR-related applications due to complex authentic distortions localized in space and time. Existing panoramic video databases only consider synthetic distortions, assume fixed viewing conditions, and are limited in size. To overcome these shortcomings, we construct the VR Video Quality in the Wild (VRVQW) database, containing $502$ user-generated videos with diverse content and distortion characteristics. Based on VRVQW, we conduct a formal psychophysical experiment to record the scanpaths and perceived quality scores from $139$ participants under two different viewing conditions. We provide a thorough statistical analysis of the recorded data, observing significant impact of viewing conditions on both human scanpaths and perceived quality. Moreover, we develop an objective quality assessment model for VR videos based on pseudocylindrical representation and convolution. Results on the proposed VRVQW show that our method is superior to existing video quality assessment models. We have made the database and code available at https://github.com/limuhit/VR-Video-Quality-in-the-Wild.</description>

      <title>StyleTalker: One-shot Style-based Audio-driven Talking Head Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose StyleTalker, a novel audio-driven talking head generation model that can synthesize a video of a talking person from a single reference image with accurately audio-synced lip shapes, realistic head poses, and eye blinks. Specifically, by leveraging a pretrained image generator and an image encoder, we estimate the latent codes of the talking head video that faithfully reflects the given audio. This is made possible with several newly devised components: 1) A contrastive lip-sync discriminator for accurate lip synchronization, 2) A conditional sequential variational autoencoder that learns the latent motion space disentangled from the lip movements, such that we can independently manipulate the motions and lip movements while preserving the identity. 3) An auto-regressive prior augmented with normalizing flow to learn a complex audio-to-motion multi-modal latent space. Equipped with these components, StyleTalker can generate talking head videos not only in a motion-controllable way when another motion source video is given but also in a completely audio-driven manner by inferring realistic motions from the input audio. Through extensive experiments and user studies, we show that our model is able to synthesize talking head videos with impressive perceptual quality which are accurately lip-synced with the input audios, largely outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>OmniCount: Multi-label Object Counting with Semantic-Geometric Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05435v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object counting is pivotal for understanding the composition of scenes. Previously, this task was dominated by class-specific methods, which have gradually evolved into more adaptable class-agnostic strategies. However, these strategies come with their own set of limitations, such as the need for manual exemplar input and multiple passes for multiple categories, resulting in significant inefficiencies. This paper introduces a new, more practical approach enabling simultaneous counting of multiple object categories using an open vocabulary framework. Our solution, OmniCount, stands out by using semantic and geometric insights from pre-trained models to count multiple categories of objects as specified by users, all without additional training. OmniCount distinguishes itself by generating precise object masks and leveraging point prompts via the Segment Anything Model for efficient counting. To evaluate OmniCount, we created the OmniCount-191 benchmark, a first-of-its-kind dataset with multi-label object counts, including points, bounding boxes, and VQA annotations. Our comprehensive evaluation in OmniCount-191, alongside other leading benchmarks, demonstrates OmniCount's exceptional performance, significantly outpacing existing solutions and heralding a new era in object counting technology.</description>

      <title>OccFiner: Offboard Occupancy Refinement with Hybrid Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08504v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vision-based occupancy prediction, also known as 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC), presents a significant challenge in computer vision. Previous methods, confined to onboard processing, struggle with simultaneous geometric and semantic estimation, continuity across varying viewpoints, and single-view occlusion. Our paper introduces OccFiner, a novel offboard framework designed to enhance the accuracy of vision-based occupancy predictions. OccFiner operates in two hybrid phases: 1) a multi-to-multi local propagation network that implicitly aligns and processes multiple local frames for correcting onboard model errors and consistently enhancing occupancy accuracy across all distances. 2) the region-centric global propagation, focuses on refining labels using explicit multi-view geometry and integrating sensor bias, especially to increase the accuracy of distant occupied voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OccFiner improves both geometric and semantic accuracy across various types of coarse occupancy, setting a new state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset. Notably, OccFiner elevates vision-based SSC models to a level even surpassing that of LiDAR-based onboard SSC models.</description>
