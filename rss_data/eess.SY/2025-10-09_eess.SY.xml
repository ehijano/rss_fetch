      <title>Comparing Normal Form Representations for Station-Keeping near Cislunar Libration Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The normal forms provide useful approximations for many trajectories of interest within the circular restricted three-body problem. This paper aims to thoroughly compare two of these forms: the Birkhoff normal form and the resonant normal form, highlighting the strengths of each for the representation of center manifold trajectories. A method of station-keeping is introduced, analogous to Floquet modes, in which the unstable component is minimized at specific points along a trajectory through impulsive maneuvers. Three different formulations of the same station-keeping approach are posed, collectively spanning Lyapunov, vertical, and halo orbits, as well as Lissajous and quasihalo trajectories.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Integrated Guidance and Control for Leader-Follower Flexible Formation of Fixed Wing UAVs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a nonlinear integrated guidance and control (IGC) approach for flexible leader-follower formation flight of fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) while accounting for high-fidelity aerodynamics and thrust dynamics. Unlike conventional leader-follower schemes that fix the follower's position relative to the leader, the follower is steered to maintain range and bearing angles (which is the angle between its velocity vector and its line-of-sight (LOS) with respect to the leader) arbitrarily close to the prescribed values, enabling the follower to maintain formation on a hemispherical region behind the leader. The proposed IGC framework directly maps leader-follower relative range dynamics to throttle commands, and the follower's velocity orientation relative to the LOS to aerodynamic control surface deflections. This enables synergism between guidance and control subsystems. The control design uses a dynamic surface control-based backstepping approach to achieve convergence to the desired formation set, where Lyapunov barrier functions are incorporated to ensure the follower's bearing angle is constrained within specified bounds. Rigorous stability analysis guarantees uniform ultimate boundedness of all error states and strict constraint satisfaction in the presence of aerodynamic nonlinearities. The proposed flexible formation scheme allows the follower to have an orientation mismatch relative to the leader to execute anticipatory reconfiguration by transitioning between the relative positions in the admissible formation set when the leader aggressively maneuvers. The proposed IGC law relies only on relative information and onboard sensors without the information about the leader's maneuver, making it suitable for GPS-denied or non-cooperative scenarios. Finally, we present simulation results to vindicate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Terrain-Aided Navigation Using a Point Cloud Measurement Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the use of a point cloud measurement in terrain-aided navigation. Our goal is to aid an inertial navigation system, by exploring ways to generate a useful measurement innovation error for effective nonlinear state estimation. We compare two such measurement models that involve the scanning of a digital terrain elevation model: a) one that is based on typical ray-casting from a given pose, that returns the predicted point cloud measurement from that pose, and b) another computationally less intensive one that does not require raycasting and we refer to herein as a sliding grid. Besides requiring a pose, it requires the pattern of the point cloud measurement itself and returns a predicted point cloud measurement. We further investigate the observability properties of the altitude for both measurement models. As a baseline, we compare the use of a point cloud measurement performance to the use of a radar altimeter and show the gains in accuracy. We conclude by showing that a point cloud measurement outperforms the use of a radar altimeter, and the point cloud measurement model to use depends on the computational resources</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Path Integral Control for Roll-to-Roll Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Roll-to-roll (R2R) manufacturing is a continuous processing technology essential for scalable production of thin-film materials and printed electronics, but precise control remains challenging due to subsystem interactions, nonlinearities, and process disturbances. This paper proposes a Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control formulation for R2R systems, leveraging a GPU-based Monte-Carlo sampling approach to efficiently approximate optimal controls online. Crucially, MPPI easily handles non-differentiable cost functions, enabling the incorporation of complex performance criteria relevant to advanced manufacturing processes. A case study is presented that demonstrates that MPPI significantly improves tension regulation performance compared to conventional model predictive control (MPC), highlighting its suitability for real-time control in advanced manufacturing.</description>

      <title>A Cascade of Systems and the Product of Their $\theta$-Symmetric Scaled Relative Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we utilize a variant of the scaled relative graph (SRG), referred to as the $\theta$-symmetric SRG, to develop a graphical stability criterion for the feedback interconnection of a cascade of systems. A crucial submultiplicative property of $\theta$-symmetric SRG is established, enabling it to handle cyclic interconnections for which conventional graph separation methods are not applicable. By integrating both gain and refined phase information, the $\theta$-symmetric SRG provides a unified graphical characterization of the system, which better captures system properties and yields less conservative results. In the scalar case, the $\theta$-symmetric SRG can be reduced exactly to the scalar itself, whereas the standard SRG appears to be a conjugate pair. Consequently, the frequency-wise $\theta$-symmetric SRG is more suitable than the standard SRG as a multi-input multi-output extension of the classical Nyquist plot. Illustrative examples are included to demonstrate the effectiveness of the $\theta$-symmetric SRG.</description>

      <title>Delay Independent Safe Control with Neural Networks: Positive Lur'e Certificates for Risk Aware Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a risk-aware safety certification method for autonomous, learning enabled control systems. Focusing on two realistic risks, state/input delays and interval matrix uncertainty, we model the neural network (NN) controller with local sector bounds and exploit positivity structure to derive linear, delay-independent certificates that guarantee local exponential stability across admissible uncertainties. To benchmark performance, we adopt and implement a state-of-the-art IQC NN verification pipeline. On representative cases, our positivity-based tests run orders of magnitude faster than SDP-based IQC while certifying regimes the latter cannot-providing scalable safety guarantees that complement risk-aware control.</description>

      <title>Resilient Multi-Dimensional Consensus and Distributed Optimization against Agent-Based and Denial-of-Service Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06835v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the resilient multi-dimensional consensus and distributed optimization problems of multi-agent systems (MASs) in the presence of both agent-based and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The considered agent-based attacks can cover malicious, Byzantine, and stubborn agents. The links between agents in the network can be blocked by DoS attacks, which may lead the digraph to be time-varying and even disconnected. The objective is to ensure that the remaining benign agents achieve consensus. To this end, an "auxiliary point"-based resilient control algorithm is proposed for MASs. Under the proposed algorithm, each healthy agent constructs a "safe kernel" utilizing the states of its in-neighbors and updates its state toward a specific point within this kernel at each iteration. If an agent cannot receive its neighbors' states owing to DoS attacks, it will use the states received immediately before the DoS period. Moreover, a resilient multi-dimensional distributed optimization (RMDO) algorithm is also proposed. Theoretical proofs and numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Decentralized CBF-based Safety Filters for Collision Avoidance of Cooperative Missile Systems with Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized safety filter for collision avoidance in multi-agent aerospace interception scenarios. The approach leverages robust control barrier functions (RCBFs) to guarantee forward invariance of safety sets under bounded inputs and high-relative-degree dynamics. Each effector executes its nominal cooperative guidance command, while a local quadratic program (QP) modifies the input only when necessary. Event-triggered activation based on range and zero-effort miss (ZEM) criteria ensures scalability by restricting active constraints to relevant neighbors. To resolve feasibility issues from simultaneous constraints, a slack-variable relaxation scheme is introduced that prioritizes critical agents in a Pareto-optimal manner. Simulation results in many-on-many interception scenarios demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains collision-free operation with minimal deviation from nominal guidance, providing a computationally efficient and scalable solution for safety-critical multi-agent aerospace systems.</description>

      <title>Falsification-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Maritime Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compliance with maritime traffic rules is essential for the safe operation of autonomous vessels, yet training reinforcement learning (RL) agents to adhere to them is challenging. The behavior of RL agents is shaped by the training scenarios they encounter, but creating scenarios that capture the complexity of maritime navigation is non-trivial, and real-world data alone is insufficient. To address this, we propose a falsification-driven RL approach that generates adversarial training scenarios in which the vessel under test violates maritime traffic rules, which are expressed as signal temporal logic specifications. Our experiments on open-sea navigation with two vessels demonstrate that the proposed approach provides more relevant training scenarios and achieves more consistent rule compliance.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Increase-Decrease Gaming with Alternative Connection Agreements: A Defender-Attacker-Defender Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Redispatch markets are widely used by system operators to manage network congestion. A well-known drawback, however, is that Flexibility Service Providers (FSPs) may strategically adjust their baselines in anticipation of redispatch actions, thereby aggravating congestion and raising system costs. To address this increase-decrease gaming, Distribution System Operators (DSOs) could use Alternative Connection Agreements (ACAs) to conditionally limit the available connection capacity of market participants in the day-ahead stage. In this paper, we present a novel Defender-Attacker-Defender game to investigate the potential of this approach in distribution networks under load and price uncertainty. We solve the resulting trilevel optimization model using a custom branch-and-bound algorithm, and we demonstrate that it efficiently solves the problem without exploring many nodes in the branch-and-bound search tree for most simulated scenarios. The case study demonstrates that applying ACAs can substantially lower redispatch costs (e.g. by 25%) for the DSO with only a limited impact on FSP profits. The effectiveness of the approach critically depends on how often the DSO can invoke ACAs and on the extent to which the DSO can anticipate strategic bidding behavior of the FSP.</description>

      <title>Identification and optimal control strategies for the transversal splitting of ultra--cold Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07113v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Splitting a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) is a key operation in fundamental physics experiments and emerging quantum technologies, where precise preparation of well--defined initial states requires fast yet coherent control of the condensate's nonlinear dynamics. This work formulates the BEC splitting process as an optimal feedforward control problem based on a physically interpretable, reduced--order model identified from limited experimental data. We introduce a systematic calibration strategy that combines optimal experiment selection and constrained nonlinear parameter estimation, enabling accurate system identification with minimal experimental overhead. Using this calibrated model, we compute energy--optimal trajectories via indirect optimal control to realize shortcuts to adiabaticity (STAs), achieving rapid transitions to the ground state of a double--well potential while suppressing excitations. Experiments confirm that the proposed control framework yields high--fidelity state transfers across multiple configurations, demonstrating its robustness and scalability for quantum control applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a control law for stabilization and trajectory tracking of a multicopter subject to safety constraints. The proposed approach guarantees forward invariance of a prescribed safety set while ensuring smooth tracking performance. Unlike conventional control barrier function methods, the constrained control problem is transformed into an unconstrained one using state-dependent mappings together with carefully constructed Lyapunov functions. This approach enables explicit synthesis of the control law, instead of requiring a solution of constrained optimization at each step. The transformation also enables the controller to enforce safety without sacrificing stability or performance. Simulation results for a polytopic reference trajectory confined within a designated safe region demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Glass Detection and Reprojection using Sensor Fusion Onboard Aerial Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous aerial robots are increasingly being deployed in real-world scenarios, where transparent obstacles present significant challenges to reliable navigation and mapping. These materials pose a unique problem for traditional perception systems because they lack discernible features and can cause conventional depth sensors to fail, leading to inaccurate maps and potential collisions. To ensure safe navigation, robots must be able to accurately detect and map these transparent obstacles. Existing methods often rely on large, expensive sensors or algorithms that impose high computational burdens, making them unsuitable for low Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) robots. In this work, we propose a novel and computationally efficient framework for detecting and mapping transparent obstacles onboard a sub-300g quadrotor. Our method fuses data from a Time-of-Flight (ToF) camera and an ultrasonic sensor with a custom, lightweight 2D convolution model. This specialized approach accurately detects specular reflections and propagates their depth into corresponding empty regions of the depth map, effectively rendering transparent obstacles visible. The entire pipeline operates in real-time, utilizing only a small fraction of a CPU core on an embedded processor. We validate our system through a series of experiments in both controlled and real-world environments, demonstrating the utility of our method through experiments where the robot maps indoor environments containing glass. Our work is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind to demonstrate a real-time, onboard transparent obstacle mapping system on a low-SWaP quadrotor using only the CPU.</description>

      <title>Safe Stabilization of the Stefan Problem with a High-Order Moving Boundary Dynamics by PDE Backstepping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a safe stabilization of the Stefan PDE model with a moving boundary governed by a high-order dynamics. We consider a parabolic PDE with a time-varying domain governed by a second-order response with respect to the Neumann boundary value of the PDE state at the moving boundary. The objective is to design a boundary heat flux control to stabilize the moving boundary at a desired setpoint, with satisfying the required conditions of the model on PDE state and the moving boundary. We apply a PDE backstepping method for the control design with considering a constraint on the control law. The PDE and moving boundary constraints are shown to be satisfied by applying the maximum principle for parabolic PDEs. Then the closed-loop system is shown to be globally exponentially stable by performing Lyapunov analysis. The proposed control is implemented in numerical simulation, which illustrates the desired performance in safety and stability. An outline of the extension to third-order moving boundary dynamics is also presented. Code is released at https://github.com/shumon0423/HighOrderStefan_CDC2025.git.</description>

      <title>From Neural Sensing to Stimulation: An Interdisciplinary Roadmap for Neurotechnology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurotechnologies are transforming how we measure, interpret, and modulate brain-body interactions, integrating real-time sensing, computation, and stimulation to enable precise physiological control. They hold transformative potential across clinical and non-clinical domains, from treating disorders to enhancing cognition and performance. Realizing this potential requires navigating complex, interdisciplinary challenges spanning neuroscience, materials science, device engineering, signal processing, computational modelling, and regulatory and ethical frameworks. This Perspective presents a strategic roadmap for neurotechnology development, created by early-career researchers, highlighting their role at the intersection of disciplines and their capacity to bridge traditional silos. We identify five cross-cutting trade-offs that constrain progress across functionality, scalability, adaptability, and translatability, and illustrate how technical domains influence their resolution. Rather than a domain-specific review, we focus on shared challenges and strategic opportunities that transcend disciplines.

      <title>A Genetic Algorithm Approach to Anti-Jamming UAV Swarm Behavior</title>

Abstract: In recent years, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have brought a new true revolution to military tactics. While UAVs already constitute an advantage when operating alone, multi-UAV swarms expand the available possibilities, allowing the UAVs to collaborate and support each other as a team to carry out a given task. This entails the capability to exchange information related with situation awareness and action coordination by means of a suitable wireless communication technology. In such scenario, the adversary is expected to disrupt communications by jamming the communication channel. The latter becomes the Achilles heel of the swarm. While anti-jamming techniques constitute a well covered topic in the literature, the use of intelligent swarm behaviors to leverage those techniques is still an open research issue.
  This paper explores the use of Genetic Algorithms (GAs) to jointly optimize UAV swarm formation, beam-steering antennas and traffic routing in order to mitigate the effect of jamming in the main coordination channel, under the assumption that a more robust and low data rate channel is used for formation management signaling. Simulation results show the effectiveness of proposed approach. However, the significant computational cost paves the way for further research.</description>

      <title>Sparse dynamic network reconstruction through L1-regularization of a Lyapunov equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05457v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important problem in many areas of science is that of recovering interaction networks from simultaneous time-series of many interacting dynamical processes. A common approach is to use the elements of the correlation matrix or its inverse as proxies of the interaction strengths, but the reconstructed networks are necessarily undirected. Transfer entropy methods have been proposed to reconstruct directed networks but the reconstructed network lacks information about interaction strengths. We propose a network reconstruction method that inherits the best of the two approaches by reconstructing a directed weighted network from noisy data under the assumption that the network is sparse and the dynamics are governed by a linear (or weakly-nonlinear) stochastic dynamical system. The two steps of our method are i) constructing an (infinite) family of candidate networks by solving the covariance matrix Lyapunov equation for the state matrix and ii) using L1-regularization to select a sparse solution. We further show how to use prior information on the (non)existence of a few directed edges to drastically improve the quality of the reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Simulation of Aircraft Descent via a Physics-Informed Machine Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for generating probabilistic descent trajectories in simulations of real-world airspace. A dataset of 116,066 trajectories harvested from Mode S radar returns in UK airspace was used to train and test the model. Thirteen aircraft types with varying performance characteristics were investigated. It was found that the error in the mean prediction of time to reach the bottom of descent for the proposed method was less than that of the the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) model by a factor of 10. Furthermore, the method was capable of generating a range of trajectories that were similar to the held out test dataset when analysed in distribution. The proposed method is hybrid, with aircraft drag and calibrated airspeed functions generated probabilistically to parameterise the BADA equations, ensuring the physical plausibility of generated trajectories.</description>

      <title>HBS -- Hardware Build System: A Tcl-based, minimal common abstraction approach for build system for hardware designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09642v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Build systems become an indispensable part of the software implementation and deployment process. New programming languages are released with the build system integrated into the language tools, for example, Go, Rust, or Zig. However, in the hardware description domain, no official build systems have been released with the predominant Hardware Description Languages (HDL) such as VHDL or SystemVerilog. Moreover, hardware design projects are often multilanguage.
  The paper proposes a new build system for the hardware description domain. The system is called the Hardware Build System (HBS). The main goals of the system include simplicity, readability, a minimal number of dependencies, and ease of integration with the existing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools. The system proposes a novel, minimal common abstraction approach, whose particular implications are described in the article. All the core functionalities are implemented in Tcl. Only the EDA tool's independent features, such as dependency graph generation, are implemented in a Python wrapper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a data-driven PID controller design based on the principle of adaptive gain optimization, leveraging Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) generated for predictive modeling purposes. The proposed control design method utilizes gradients of the PID gain optimization, achieved through the automatic differentiation of PINNs, to apply model predictive control using a cost function based on tracking error and control inputs. By optimizing PINNs-based PID gains, the method achieves adaptive gain tuning that ensures stability while accounting for system nonlinearities. The proposed method features a systematic framework for integrating PINNs-based models of dynamical control systems into closed-loop control systems, enabling direct application to PID control design. A series of numerical experiments is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method from the control perspectives based on both time and frequency domains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies sensor placement when detection performance varies stochastically due to environmental factors over space and time and false alarms are present, but a filter is used to attenuate the effect. We introduce a unified model that couples detection and false alarms through an availability function, which captures how false alarms reduce effective sensing and filtering responses to the disturbance. Building on this model, we give a sufficient condition under which filtering improves detection. In addition, we derive a coverage-based lower bound on the void probability. Furthermore, we prove robustness guarantees showing that performance remains stable when detection probabilities are learned from limited data. We validate the approach with numerical studies using AIS vessel-traffic data and synthetic maritime scenarios. Together, these results provide theory and practical guidance for deploying sensors in dynamic, uncertain environments.</description>

      <title>Optimal Batched Scheduling of Stochastic Processing Networks Using Atomic Action Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic processing networks (SPNs) have broad applications in healthcare, transportation, and communication networks. The control of SPN is to dynamically assign servers in batches under uncertainty to optimize long-run performance. This problem is challenging as the policy dimension grows exponentially with the number of servers, making standard reinforcement learning and policy optimization methods intractable at scale. We propose an atomic action decomposition framework that addresses this scalability challenge by breaking joint assignments into sequential single-server assignments. This yields policies with constant dimension, independent of the number of servers. We study two classes of atomic policies, the step-dependent and step-independent atomic policies, and prove that both achieve the same optimal long-run average reward as the original joint policies. These results establish that computing the optimal SPN control can be made scalable without loss of optimality using the atomic framework. Our results offer theoretical justification for the strong empirical success of the atomic framework in large-scale applications reported in previous articles.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Cross-Layer Authentication for Secure and Efficient Vehicular Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intelligent transportation systems increasingly depend on wireless communication for broadcasting traffic messages and facilitating real-time vehicular communication. In this context, message authentication is crucial for establishing secure and reliable communication. However, security solutions must consider the dynamic nature of vehicular communication links, which fluctuate between line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) due to obstructions. This paper proposes a lightweight cross-layer authentication scheme that employs public-key infrastructure (PKI)-based authentication for initial legitimacy detection/handshaking while using key-based physical-layer re-authentication for message verification. This approach reduces signature generation and signaling overheads associated with each transmission, thereby enhancing network scalability. However, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC; Pd: detection vs. PFA: false alarm probabilities) of the latter decreases with lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To address this, we investigate the use of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to strengthen the SNR directed toward the designated vehicle in shadowed areas (i.e., NLoS scenarios), thereby improving the ROC. Theoretical analysis and practical implementation are conducted using a 1-bit RIS consisting of 64 x 64 reflective meta-surfaces. Experimental results show a significant improvement in Pd, increasing from 0.82 to 0.96 at SNR = -6 dB for an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system with 128 subcarriers. We also conducted informal and formal security analyses using Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic to prove the scheme's ability to resist passive and active attacks.</description>

      <title>Generalizable Physics-Informed Learning for Stochastic Safety-Critical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08868v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of long-term risk is essential for the design and analysis of stochastic dynamical systems. Existing risk quantification methods typically rely on extensive datasets involving risk events observed over extended time horizons, which can be prohibitively expensive to acquire. Motivated by this gap, we propose an efficient method for learning long-term risk probabilities using short-term samples with limited occurrence of risk events. Specifically, we establish that four distinct classes of long-term risk probabilities are characterized by specific partial differential equations (PDEs). Using this characterization, we introduce a physics-informed learning framework that combines empirical data with physics information to infer risk probabilities. We then analyze the theoretical properties of this framework in terms of generalization and convergence. Through numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our framework not only generalizes effectively beyond the sampled states and time horizons but also offers additional benefits such as improved sample efficiency, rapid online inference capabilities under changing system dynamics, and stable computation of probability gradients. These results highlight how embedding PDE constraints, which contain explicit gradient terms and inform how risk probabilities depend on state, time horizon, and system parameters, improves interpolation and generalization between/beyond the available data.</description>

      <title>Regular Pairings for Non-quadratic Lyapunov Functions and Contraction Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on stability and contractivity have highlighted the importance of semi-inner products, which we refer to as pairings,
  associated with general norms. A pairing is a binary operation that relates the derivative of a curve's norm to the radius-vector of the
  curve and its tangent. This relationship, known as the curve norm derivative formula, is crucial when using the norm as a Lyapunov
  function. Another important property of the pairing, used in stability and contraction criteria, is the so-called Lumer inequality, which
  relates the pairing to the induced logarithmic norm. We prove that the curve norm derivative formula and Lumer's inequality are, in fact,
  equivalent to each other and to several simpler properties. We then introduce and characterize regular pairings that satisfy all of
  these properties. Our results unify several independent theories of pairings (semi-inner products) developed in previous work on functional
  analysis and control theory. Additionally, we introduce the polyhedral max pairing and develop computational tools for polyhedral norms,
  advancing contraction theory in non-Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Development of a magnetorheological hand exoskeleton featuring a high force-to-power ratio for enhanced grip endurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hand exoskeletons have significant potential in labor-intensive fields by mitigating hand grip fatigue, enhancing hand strength, and preventing injuries. However, most of the traditional hand exoskeletons are driven by motors, whose output force is limited in the constrained installation conditions. Besides, they also come with the disadvantages of high power consumption, complex and bulky assistive systems, and high instability. In this work, we develop a novel hand exoskeleton integrated with innovative magnetorheological (MR) clutches that offers a high force-to-power ratio to improve grip endurance. The clutch features an enhanced structure design, a micro roller enhancing structure, which can significantly boost output forces. The experimental data demonstrate that, when it is supplied with 2 V, the clutch can deliver a peak holding force of 381.15 N-55 times that when no voltage is provided (7 N). In this scenario, it only consumes 1.38 W, yielding a force-to-power ratio of 256.75N/W, which is 2.35 times higher than the best-reported actuator used for hand exoskeletons. This capability enables the designed MRHE to provide approximately 419.79 N support force for gripping. The designed MR hand exoskeleton is highly integrated, comprising an exoskeleton frame, MR clutches, a control unit, and a battery. Evaluations through static grip endurance tests and dynamic carrying and lifting tests confirm that the MR hand exoskeleton can effectively reduce muscle fatigue, extend grip endurance, and minimize injuries. These findings highlight its strong potential for practical applications in repetitive tasks such as carrying and lifting in industrial settings.</description>

      <title>Control of Humanoid Robots with Parallel Mechanisms using Differential Actuation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several recently released humanoid robots, inspired by the mechanical design of Cassie, employ actuator configurations in which the motors are displaced from the joints to reduce leg inertia. While studies accounting for the full kinematic complexity have demonstrated the benefits of these designs, the associated loop-closure constraints greatly increase computational cost and limit their use in control and learning. As a result, the non-linear transmission is often approximated by a constant reduction ratio, preventing exploitation of the mechanism's full capabilities. This paper introduces a compact analytical formulation for the two standard knee and ankle mechanisms that captures the exact non-linear transmission while remaining computationally efficient. The model is fully differentiable up to second order with a minimal formulation, enabling low-cost evaluation of dynamic derivatives for trajectory optimization and of the apparent transmission impedance for reinforcement learning. We integrate this formulation into trajectory optimization and locomotion policy learning, and compare it against simplified constant-ratio approaches. Hardware experiments demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness, showing that the proposed method provides a practical means to incorporate parallel actuation into modern control algorithms.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust System Level Synthesis With Output Feedback Affine Control Policy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the finite-horizon robust optimal control of constrained linear systems subject to model mismatch and additive stochastic disturbances. Utilizing the system level synthesis (SLS) parameterization, we propose a novel SLS design using an output-feedback affine control policy and extend it to a distributionally robust setting to improve system resilience by minimizing the cost function while ensuring constraint satisfaction against the worst-case uncertainty distribution. The scopes of model mismatch and stochastic disturbances are quantified using the 1-norm and a Wasserstein metric-based ambiguity set, respectively. For the closed-loop dynamics, we analyze the distributional shift between the predicted output-input response -- computed using nominal parameters and empirical disturbance samples -- and the actual closed-loop distribution, highlighting its dependence on model mismatch and SLS parameterization. Assuming convex and Lipschitz continuous cost functions and constraints, we derive a tractable reformulation of the distributionally robust SLS (DR-SLS) problem by leveraging tools from robust control and distributionally robust optimization (DRO). Numerical experiments validate the performance and robustness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Stage-wise Conservative Linear Bandits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters). Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves regret $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$ with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and $|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.</description>

      <title>Optimization via a Control-Centric Framework</title>

Abstract: Optimization plays a central role in intelligent systems and cyber-physical technologies, where the speed and reliability of convergence directly impact performance. In control theory, optimization-centric methods are standard: controllers are designed by repeatedly solving optimization problems, as in linear quadratic regulation, $H_\infty$ control, and model predictive control. In contrast, this paper develops a control-centric framework for optimization itself, where algorithms are constructed directly from Lyapunov stability principles rather than being proposed first and analyzed afterward. A key element is the stationarity vector, which encodes first-order optimality conditions and enables Lyapunov-based convergence analysis. By pairing a Lyapunov function with a selectable decay law, we obtain continuous-time dynamics with guaranteed exponential, finite-time, fixed-time, or prescribed-time convergence. Within this framework, we introduce three feedback realizations of increasing restrictiveness: the Hessian-gradient, Newton, and gradient dynamics. Each realization shapes the decay of the stationarity vector to achieve the desired rate. These constructions unify unconstrained optimization, extend naturally to constrained problems via Lyapunov-consistent primal-dual dynamics, and broaden the results for minimax and generalized Nash equilibrium seeking problems beyond exponential stability. The framework provides systematic design tools for optimization algorithms in control and game-theoretic problems.</description>
