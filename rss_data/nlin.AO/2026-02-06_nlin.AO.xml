      <title>Intermittent precipitation and spatial Allee effects drive irregular vegetation patterns in semiarid ecosystems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vegetation in semi-arid ecosystems frequently organizes into spatially heterogeneous mosaics that regulate ecosystem functioning, productivity, and resilience. These patterns arise from local biological interactions, including facilitation among neighboring plants and competition for limiting resources. Classical theoretical approaches have attributed such organization to scale-dependent feedbacks, predicting regular spatial patterns and abrupt transitions to collapse. However, growing empirical and theoretical evidence reveal that environmental variability and demographic stochasticity can fundamentally reshape spatial organization, driving irregular clusters, dynamic mosaics, and gradual rather than catastrophic vegetation declines. In drylands, rainfall variability is a dominant source of environmental forcing: precipitation typically occurs in short, irregular pulses that transiently enhance survival and recruitment before competitive interactions again dominate. Near persistence thresholds, ecosystem dynamics are therefore governed not only by average climatic conditions but also by the timing and spatial coincidence of favorable events. Under these conditions, positive density dependence and local facilitation can critically determine whether vegetation patches persist, expand, or collapse. Here, we develop an individual-based model that integrates intermittent precipitation with local Allee effects to examine how stochastic rainfall shapes spatial organization and persistence. We show that the interaction between pulsed resource availability and density-dependent survival generates irregular cluster structures and strongly modulates extinction risk, with resilience emerging from local spatial covariance and neighborhood density rather than from total biomass alone. These results highlight the importance of individual-level, stochastic processes in determining ecosystem resilience.</description>

      <title>Higher-order adaptive behaviors outperform pairwise strategies in mitigating contagion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When exposed to a contagion phenomenon, individuals may respond to the perceived risk of infection by adopting behavioral changes, aiming to reduce their exposure or their risk of infecting others. The social cost of such adaptive behaviors and their impact on the contagion dynamics have been investigated in pairwise networks, with binary interactions driving both contagion and risk perception. However, contagion and adaptive mechanisms can also be driven by group (higher-order) interactions. Here, we consider several adaptive behaviors triggered by awareness of risk perceived through higher-order and pairwise interactions, and we compare their impact on pairwise and higher-order contagion processes. By numerical simulations and a mean-field analytic approach, we show that adaptive behaviors driven by higher-order information are more effective in limiting the spread of a contagion, than similar mechanisms based on pairwise information. Meanwhile, they also entail a lower social cost, measured as the reduction of the intensity of interactions in the population. Indeed, adaptive mechanisms based on higher-order information lead to a heterogeneous risk perception within the population, producing a higher alert on nodes with large hyperdegree (i.e., participating in many groups), on their neighborhoods, and on large groups. This in turn prevents the spreading process to exploit the properties of these nodes and groups, which tend to drive and sustain the dynamics in the absence of adaptive behaviors.</description>
