      <title>Expanding the search space of high entropy oxides and predicting synthesizability using machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient computational methodology for predicting the synthesizability of high entropy oxides (HEOs) in a large space of possible candidate compounds. HEOs are a growing field with an enormous potential chemical composition space, and yet the discovery of new HEOs is slow and driven by experimental trial-and-error. In this work, we attempt to speed up this process by using a machine learned interatomic potential offering DFT-level accuracy. Our methodology starts by identifying a set of crystal structures and elements for screening, building a large random unit cell of each composition and structure, then relaxing this structure. The most promising candidates are distinguished based on the variance of the individual cation energies, which we introduce as our entropy descriptor, and the enthalpy of mixing, which is used as the enthalpy descriptor. The approach is applied to tetravalent HEOs, and its validity is confirmed by comparison to alternative descriptors and DFT calculations for a set of 7 elements. The search is then extended to a set of 14 elements and three crystal structures, where it successfully identifies the only known stable 4-component HEO in the $\alpha$-PbO$_2$ structure, as well as predicting several new 5-component candidate systems. This approach can straightforwardly be applied to new sets of elements and structures, allowing for the accelerated discovery of new HEOs.</description>

      <title>Autoregressive Typical Thermal States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of generative neural networks recently adopted from machine learning have provided promising strategies for studying quantum matter. In particular, the success of autoregressive models in natural language processing has motivated their use as variational ans\"atze, with the hope that their demonstrated ability to scale will transfer to simulations of quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we introduce an autoregressive framework to calculate finite-temperature properties of a quantum system based on the imaginary-time evolution of an ensemble of pure states. We find that established approaches based on minimally entangled typical thermal states (METTS) have numerical instabilities when an autoregressive recurrent neural network is used as the variational ans\"atz. We show that these instabilities can be mitigated by evolving the initial ensemble states with a unitary operation, along with applying a threshold to curb runaway evolution of ensemble members. By comparing our algorithm to exact results for the spin 1/2 quantum XY chain, we demonstrate that autoregressive typical thermal states are capable of accurately calculating thermal observables.</description>

      <title>Random cubic graph embedded in a hypercube: Entanglement spectrum and many-body localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The schematic model of interacting spins is introduced, which combines the symmetry of hypercube with the simplicity of random regular graph with degree three, i.e. the random cubic graph. We study the localization transition in this model, which shares essential characteristics with the systems exhibiting many-body localization. Namely, we investigate the transition in terms of the entanglement entropy and entanglement spectrum. We also show that the most significant indicator of the localization transition is the failure of eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, when the distribution of matrix elements of local operators changes from Gasussian to bimodal. It also provides good estimate for the critical disorder strength.</description>

      <title>Stochastic synaptic dynamics under learning</title>

Abstract: Learning is based on synaptic plasticity, which drives and is driven by neural activity. Because pre- and postsynaptic spiking activity is shaped by randomness, the synaptic weights follow a stochastic process, requiring a probabilistic framework to capture the noisy synaptic dynamics. We consider a paradigmatic supervised learning example: a presynaptic neural population impinging in a sequence of episodes on a recurrent network of integrate-and-fire neurons through synapses undergoing spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) with additive potentiation and multiplicative depression. We first analytically compute the drift- and diffusion coefficients for a single synapse within a single episode (microscopic dynamics), mapping the true jump process to a Langevin and the associated Fokker-Planck equations. Leveraging new analytical tools, we include spike-time--resolving cross-correlations between pre- and postsynaptic spikes, which corrects substantial deviations seen in standard theories purely based on firing rates. We then apply this microdynamical description to the network setup in which hetero-associations are trained over one-shot episodes into a feed-forward matrix of STDP synapses connecting to neurons of the recurrent network (macroscopic dynamics). By mapping statistically distinct synaptic populations to instances of the single-synapse process above, we self-consistently determine the joint neural and synaptic dynamics and, ultimately, the time course of memory degradation and the memory capacity. We demonstrate that specifically in the relevant case of sparse coding, our theory can quantitatively capture memory capacities which are strongly overestimated if spike-time--resolving cross-correlations are ignored. We conclude with a discussion of the many directions in which our framework can be extended.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal projections of hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10257</link>

Abstract: Projections of hypercubes have been applied to visualize high-dimensional binary state spaces in various scientific fields. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization-based algorithms limit the interpretability and reproducibility of the resulting plots. These limitations motivate us to explore theoretically analyzable projection algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA). Here, we investigate the mathematical properties of PCA-projected hypercubes. Our numerical and analytical results show that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions within the hypercubic state space. This property enables the assessment of the asymptotic distribution of projected vertices and error bounds, which characterize the performance of PCA in the projected space. We demonstrate the application of PCA to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems, specifically finite artificial spin-ice systems, including those with geometric frustration. By adding projected hypercubic edges, these visualizations reveal pathways of correlated spin flips. We confirm that the time-integrated probability flux exhibits patterns consistent with the pathways identified in the projected hypercubic energy landscapes. Using the mean-field model, we show that dominant state transition pathways tend to emerge around the periphery of the projected hypercubes. Our work provides a better understanding of how PCA discovers hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.</description>

      <title>Efficient Construction of Feasible Solutions in Column Generation using Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Column generation (CG) has been used to solve constrained 0-1 quadratic programming problems. The pricing problem, which is iteratively solved in CG, can be reduced to an unconstrained 0-1 quadratic programming problem, allowing for the efficient application of quantum annealing (QA). The solutions obtained by CG are continuous relaxations, which cannot be practically used as feasible 0-1 solutions. In this paper, we propose a postprocessing method for constructing feasible 0-1 solutions from the continuous relaxations obtained through CG. The proposed technique consists of two phases: (i) mapping the continuous CG solution to a feasible 0-1 solution and (ii) applying a constraint-aware local search to improve that solution's quality. Numerical experiments on randomly generated problems demonstrate that CG with the proposed postprocessing yields solutions comparable to commercial solvers with significantly reduced computation time. Consequently, the postprocessing enables CG with QA to obtain high-quality approximate solutions faster.</description>

      <title>Correlation Functions and Chaotic Behavior of the SYK Chain Model in Pure States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations of R\'enyi entanglement entropy in the SYK chain of Majorana fermions have indicated that the model exhibits slow thermalization when initialized in certain states. The extent to which the heavy modes -- believed to underlie this behavior -- affect other aspects of the model remains an open question. In this work, I study thermalization and scrambling of information in individual energy eigenstates of the SYK chain using exact diagonalization. I show that two-point correlation functions in finite-energy eigenstates closely match their thermal counterparts and that information scrambling occurs efficiently within these pure states. These results suggest that the slow thermalization observed in entanglement dynamics does not extend to all probes of thermalization and scrambling, even in pure states. I discuss the implications of these findings for thermal states in a potential holographic dual theory.</description>
