      <title>Four-quark operators with $\Delta F = 2$ in the GIRS scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the mixing matrices of four-quark operators that change flavor numbers by two units. Our approach employs two schemes: the coordinate-space Gauge Invariant Renormalization Scheme (GIRS) and the Modified Minimal Subtraction scheme. From our perturbative computations, we extract the conversion factors between these two renormalization schemes at the next-to-leading order. A significant challenge in the study of four-quark operators is that they mix among themselves upon renormalization. Additionally, computations in GIRS at a given order in perturbation theory require Feynman diagrams with at least one additional loop. The extraction of the conversion factors involves calculating two-point Green's functions, which include products of two four-quark operators, and three-point Green's functions, which involve one four-quark operator and two bilinear operators, with all operators located at distinct spacetime points. We investigate both parity-conserving and parity-violating four-quark operators. This calculation is relevant to the determination of Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements from numerical simulations using the GIRS scheme.</description>

      <title>Grassmann Tensor Renormalization Group for two-flavor massive Schwinger model with a theta term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $N_f=2$ Schwinger model with the massive staggered fermions in the presence of a $2\pi$ periodic $\theta$ term, using the Grassmann tensor renormalization group. Thanks to the Grassmann tensor network formulation, there is no difficulty in dealing with the massive staggered fermions. We study the $\theta$ dependence of the free energy in the thermodynamic limit. Our calculation provides consistent results with the analytical solution in the large mass limit. The results also suggest that the $N_f=2$ Schwinger model on a lattice has a different phase structure from that described by the continuum theory.</description>

      <title>Excitations of gauge bosons, and other aspects of gauge Higgs theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I review the qualitative physical distinction between the Higgs and confinement phases of a gauge Higgs theory, and the non-local order parameter introduced by Matsuyama and myself which identifies the two phases. I then present some new results suggestive of a possible excitation spectrum of vector bosons in the electroweak sector of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Toward tensor renormalization group study of lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tensor renormalization group is a promising complementary approach to traditional Monte Carlo methods for lattice systems, as it is inherently free from the sign problem. We discuss recent developments crucial for its application to lattice QCD: the multi-layer construction for multi-flavor gauge theory and the armillary sphere formulation for non-Abelian gauge theory. These techniques are important for reducing the size of the initial tensor and for eliminating non-local entanglement structures within the tensor network. We present selected numerical results and discuss potential generalizations to lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Control variates with neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precision of lattice QCD calculations is often hindered by the stochastic noise inherent in these methods. The control variates method can provide an effective noise reduction but are typically constructed using heuristic approaches, which may be inadequate for complex theories. In this work, we introduce a neural network-based framework for parametrizing control variates, eliminating the reliance on manual guesswork. Using $1+1$ dimensional scalar field theory as a test case, we demonstrate significant variance reduction, particularly in the strong coupling regime. Furthermore, we extend this approach to gauge theories, showcasing its potential to tackle signal-to-noise problems in diverse lattice QCD applications.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quantization with discrete fictitious time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to stochastic quantization \`a la Parisi-Wu with a discrete fictitious time. The noise average is modified by weights, which results in the equivalence in the large time limit to the correlation function of the corresponding quantum field theory {\it without taking any continuum limit of fictitious time}. We test our method in a zero-dimensional toy model both perturbatively and numerically.</description>

      <title>Can one-loop corrections to the one-gluon exchange potential adequately describe the charmed meson spectrum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the charmed meson spectrum using a constituent quark model (CQM) with one-loop corrections applied to the one-gluon exchange (OGE) potential. The study aims to understand if these one-loop corrections sufficiently account for the charmed meson spectrum observed experimentally, without invoking exotic configurations like tetraquarks. Within this model, charmed mesons' masses are computed, comparing theoretical predictions to experimental data. The results suggest that the model, with one-loop OGE corrections, generally reproduces mass splittings and level ordering observed for charmed mesons. Discrepancies, particularly in P-wave states, are addressed by incorporating higher-order interaction terms. The findings emphasize that while the traditional quark model is limited in fully describing charmed mesons, enhanced potential terms may bridge the gap with experimental observations. The study contributes a framework for predicting excited charmed meson states for future experimental validation.</description>

      <title>QCD constraints on isospin-dense matter and the nuclear equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09273v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of dense hadronic matter is a central goal in nuclear physics as it governs the nature and dynamics of astrophysical objects such as supernovae and neutron stars. Because of the non-perturbative nature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), little is known rigorously about hadronic matter in these extreme conditions. Here, lattice QCD calculations are used to compute thermodynamic quantities and the equation of state of QCD over a wide range of isospin chemical potentials with controlled systematic uncertainties. Agreement is seen with chiral perturbation theory when the chemical potential is small. Comparison to perturbative QCD at large chemical potential allows for an estimate of the gap in the superconducting phase, and this quantity is seen to agree with perturbative determinations. Since the partition function for an isospin chemical potential, $\mu_I$, bounds the partition function for a baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=3\mu_I/2$, these calculations also provide rigorous non-perturbative QCD bounds on the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state over a wide range of baryon densities for the first time.</description>

      <title>Studies of nucleon isovector structure with the PACS10 superfine lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results for the nucleon axial-vector, induced pseudoscalar and pion-nucleon couplings obtained from 2+1 flavor lattice QCD at the physical point with a large spatial extent of about 10 fm. Our calculations are performed with the PACS10 gauge configurations generated by the PACS Collaboration with the six stout-smeared $O(a)$ improved Wilson-clover quark action and Iwasaki gauge action at $\beta$ = 1.82, 2.00 and 2.20 corresponding to lattice spacings of 0.09 fm (coarse), 0.06 fm (fine) and 0.04 fm (superfine), respectively. We first evaluate the value of the nucleon axial-vector coupling. In addition, the induced pseudoscalar and pion-nucleon couplings from the induced pseudoscalar form factor are also investigated. Combining the results obtained from the all of our coarse, fine and superfine lattices, we finally discuss the systematic uncertainties in our calculation based on the comparison with both of the experimental values and lattice QCD results provided by the other collaborations.</description>
