      <title>Physics Informed Optimal Homotopy Analysis Method (PI-OHAM): A Hybrid Analytical Computational Framework for Solving nonlinear Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Physics-Informed Optimal Homotopy Analysis Method (PI-OHAM) for solving nonlinear differential equations. PI-OHAM, based on classical HAM, employs a physics-informed residual loss to optimize convergence-control parameters systematically by combining data, boundary conditions, and governing equations in the manner similar to Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The combination of the flexibility of PINNs and the analytical transparency of HAM provides the approach with high numerical stability, rapid convergence, and high consistency with traditional numerical solutions. PI-OHAM has superior accuracy-time trade-offs and faster and more accurate convergence than standard HAM and PINNs when applied to the Blasius boundary-layer problem. It is also very close to numerical standards available in the literature. PI-OHAM ensures analytical transparency and interpretability by series-based solutions, unlike purely data-driven or data-free PINNs. Significant contributions are a conceptual bridge between decades of homotopy-based analysis and modern physics-inspired methods, and a numerically aided but analytically interpretable solver of nonlinear differential equations. PI-OHAM appears as a computationally efficient, accurate and understandable alternative to nonlinear fluid flow, heat transfer and other industrial problems in cases where robustness and interpretability are important.</description>

      <title>A practical scenario generation method for electricity prices on day-ahead and intraday spot markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing interest in demand-side management (DSM) as part of the energy cost optimization calls for effective methods to determine representative electricity prices for energy optimization and scheduling investigations. We propose a practical method to construct price profiles of day-ahead (DA) and intraday (ID) electricity spot markets. We construct single-day and single-week price profiles based on historical market time series to provide ready-to-use price data sets. Our method accounts for dominant mechanisms in price variation to preserve critical statistical features (e.g., mean and standard deviation) and transient patterns in the constructed profiles. Unlike common scenario generation approaches, the method is deterministic, with few degrees of freedom and minimal application effort. Our method ensures consistency between ID and DA price profiles when both are considered and introduces profile scaling to enable multiple scenario generation. Finally, we compare the constructed profiles to clustering techniques in a DSM case study, noting similar cost results.</description>

      <title>SPGD: Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04946v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optimization algorithms are pivotal in advancing various scientific and industrial fields but often encounter obstacles such as trapping in local minima, saddle points, and plateaus (flat regions), which makes the convergence to reasonable or near-optimal solutions particularly challenging. This paper presents the Steepest Perturbed Gradient Descent (SPGD), a novel algorithm that innovatively combines the principles of the gradient descent method with periodic uniform perturbation sampling to effectively circumvent these impediments and lead to better solutions whenever possible. SPGD is distinctively designed to generate a set of candidate solutions and select the one exhibiting the steepest loss difference relative to the current solution. It enhances the traditional gradient descent approach by integrating a strategic exploration mechanism that significantly increases the likelihood of escaping sub-optimal local minima and navigating complex optimization landscapes effectively. Our approach not only retains the directed efficiency of gradient descent but also leverages the exploratory benefits of stochastic perturbations, thus enabling a more comprehensive search for global optima across diverse problem spaces. We demonstrate the efficacy of SPGD in solving the 3D component packing problem, an NP-hard challenge. Preliminary results show a substantial improvement over four established methods, particularly on response surfaces with complex topographies and in multidimensional non-convex continuous optimization problems. Comparative analyses with established 2D benchmark functions highlight SPGD's superior performance, showcasing its ability to navigate complex optimization landscapes. These results emphasize SPGD's potential as a versatile tool for a wide range of optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised full-field Bayesian inference of orthotropic hyperelasticity from a single biaxial test: a myocardial case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cardiac muscle tissue exhibits highly non-linear hyperelastic and orthotropic material behavior during passive deformation. Traditional constitutive identification protocols therefore combine multiple loading modes and typically require multiple specimens and substantial handling. In soft living tissues, such protocols are challenged by inter- and intra-sample variability and by manipulation-induced alterations of mechanical response, which can bias inverse calibration. In this work we exploit spatially heterogeneous full-field kinematics as an information-rich alternative to multimodal testing. We adapt EUCLID, an unsupervised method for the automated discovery of constitutive models, towards Bayesian parameter inference for highly nonlinear, orthotropic constitutive models. Using synthetic myocardial tissue slabs, we demonstrate that a single heterogeneous biaxial experiment, combined with sparse reaction-force measurements, enables robust recovery of Holzapfel-Ogden parameters with quantified uncertainty, across multiple noise levels. The inferred responses agree closely with ground-truth simulations and yield credible intervals that reflect the impact of measurement noise on orthotropic material model inference. Our work supports single-shot, uncertainty-aware characterization of nonlinear orthotropic material models from a single biaxial test, reducing sample demand and experimental manipulation.</description>
