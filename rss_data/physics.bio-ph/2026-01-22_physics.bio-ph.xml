      <title>Cell proliferation maintains cell area polydispersity in the growing fruit fly wing epithelium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing epithelial tissues coordinate cell proliferation and mechanical forces to achieve proper size and shape. As epithelial cells tightly adhere together to form the confluent tissue, the distribution of cell areas significantly influences possible patterns of cellular packing and thereby also the mechanics of the epithelium. Therefore, it is important to understand the origin of cell area heterogeneity in developing tissues and, if possible, how to control it. Previous models of cell growth and division have been successful in accounting for experimentally observed area distributions in cultured cells and bacterial colonies, but developing tissues present additional complexity due to self-organized patterns of mechanical stresses that guide morphogenesis. Here, we address this challenge focusing on the D. melanogaster wing disc epithelium. We consider a simple model that couples cell cycle dynamics to tissue mechanics. From time-lapse imaging of the cellular network, we extract all model parameters - cell growth rates, division rates, and mechanical fluctuations - revealing that they all depend on cell size. With these independently measured parameters, our model quantitatively reproduces the observed cell area distribution without any fitting parameters and further predicts tissue pressure gradients, in quantitative agreement with previously published data. Importantly, we find that cell proliferation accounts for 85% of cell area variance, establishing it as the dominant source of packing disorder that influences tissue mechanics and organization.</description>

      <title>The Lie Group Basis of Neuronal Membrane Architecture: Why the Hodgkin-Huxley Equations Take Their Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hodgkin-Huxley equations have described neuronal excitability for seventy years, yet their mathematical structure-gating exponents m3h and n4, exponential voltage dependencies, and bounded activation variables, has remained empirically justified rather than theoretically derived. Hodgkin and Huxley introduced voltage-dependent conductances controlled by gating variables. While these equations reproduce experimental observations, they were derived through curve-fitting without theoretical justification. Modern theoretical physics derives governing equations from symmetry principles through Lie group theory. We prove that the complete Hodgkin-Huxley equations necessarily follow from three fundamental symmetries: (1) compact conformational state spaces, (2) multiplicative conductance scaling, and (3) temporal translation invariance. These symmetries uniquely determine a Lie group structure isomorphic to SO(2) semidirect product with R2. From representation theory, we derive: boundedness from SO(2) compactness, exponential Boltzmann factors from scale invariance, specific integer exponents m3h and n4 from irreducible representations, and first-order kinetics from Lie algebra flows. This demonstrates that the HH equations are not empirical curve-fits but the unique mathematical structure mandated by fundamental symmetries. We reveal why gating variables must be bounded, voltage dependencies must be exponential, sodium requires three activation gates and one inactivation gate, potassium requires four activation gates, and kinetics must be first-order. This establishes that neural electrophysiology obeys the same theoretical framework as modern physics, where symmetries determine dynamics, providing a foundation for understanding channel mutations and network dynamics through group theory.</description>

      <title>One scale to rule them all: interpretable multi-scale Deep Learning for predicting cell survival after proton and carbon ion irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between the physical characteristics of the radiation field and biological damage is central to both radiotherapy and radioprotection, yet the link between spatial scales of energy deposition and biological effects remains not entirely understood. To address this, we developed an interpretable deep learning model that predicts cell survival after proton and carbon ion irradiation, leveraging sequential attention to highlight relevant features and provide insight into the contribution of different energy deposition scales. Trained and tested on the PIDE dataset, our model incorporates, beside LET, nanodosimetric and microdosimetric quantities simulated with MC-Startrack and Open-TOPAS, enabling multi-scale characterization. While achieving high predictive accuracy, our approach also emphasizes transparency in decision-making. We demonstrate high accuracy in predicting RBE for in vitro experiments. Multiple scales are utilized concurrently, with no single spatial scale being predominant. Quantities defined at smaller spatial domains generally have a greater influence, whereas the LET plays a lesser role.</description>

      <title>Coarse-graining active tension nets with discrete conformal geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In contrast to inert materials, living cells use molecular motors to generate forces independently of elastic strain. How do local active forces translate into large-scale shape, and what are the mechanical properties of the resulting "living matter"? Here, we address these questions within the active tension network (ATN) model for the mechanics of 2d epithelia. We represent the configuration of active forces geometrically by a tension triangulation dual to the cell tessellation. The Voronoi dual of the tension triangulation is shown to be macroscopically stress-free -- the tensions hence define an emergent reference state for the tissue. Two soft modes, curl-free and conformal deformations, map this reference to the internally stressed, but force-balanced, physical configuration of the tissue. Conformal deformations parametrize pressure gradients, leading to a generalization of von Neumann's law for the pressure in a foam. Via finite-element-like interpolation and a notion of "discrete" conformal maps, we both construct the mechanically balanced cell tessellations exactly on the microscopic level, and pass to the continuum limit. We systematically incorporate cell rearrangement into our theory by representing cell-scale topology in terms of circle packings. The results of this bottom-up coarse-graining study match a top-down continuum analysis presented in a companion paper. Thus, the geometry of force balance bridges between micro- and macro-scales, elucidating how cell-level active forces program shape. The present formalism may be useful in the study of foams, granular matter, and metamaterials, as well as in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Landing-Induced Viscoelastic Changes in an Anthropomimetic Foot Joint Structure are Modulated by Foot Structure and Posture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cadaveric studies have provided important insights into the mechanics of the human foot arch and plantar fascia. However, repeatedly probing posture-dependent viscoelastic responses immediately after landing impact is difficult in biological specimens, leaving the contribution of skeletal architecture to landing dynamics incompletely understood. In this study, we developed an anthropomimetic foot joint structure aimed at replicating the skeletal geometry of the human foot. Using a vertical drop apparatus that simulates landing and a viscoelastic system-identification model, we investigated how skeletal structure and posture modulate the apparent post-impact viscoelastic response. The results show that the multi-jointed anthropomimetic structure exhibited a higher damping ratio than simplified flat and rigid feet. Moreover, ankle dorsiflexion and toe extension systematically shifted the identified parameters, reducing the damping ratio under the tested conditions. Taken together, these findings indicate that an arch-like, multi-jointed skeletal architecture can enhance impact attenuation in an anthropomimetic mechanical foot, and that morphology and passive posture alone can tune the trade-off between attenuation and rebound. The observed posture-dependent trends are qualitatively consistent with reported differences in human landing strategies, suggesting that skeletal architecture may partly account for the modulation. Furthermore, these results highlight the engineering advantage of anatomically informed skeletal replication for achieving human-like apparent viscoelastic behavior through postural adjustment during landing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiDRoSIS is an automated MATLAB-Python software suite for the segmentation and quantification of lipid droplets (LDs) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in fluorescence microscopy images of irradiated A549 and MCF7 cells exposed to gold-based nanoparticles. It combines classical image processing algorithms with statistical post-analysis through a companion Python tool, StatLysis. The platform enables reproducible, high-throughput analysis of morphological and spectral parameters linked to nanoparticle-enhanced radiobiological responses. By bridging imaging and quantitative analytics, LiDRoSIS provides a robust framework for nanomedicine and radiation biology research.</description>

      <title>A combined dose and microdosimetric modeling framework incorporating volume effects correlates with tissue sparing in proton minibeam radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proton minibeam (pMB) radiotherapy, delivers highly heterogeneous dose distributions alternating high-dose peaks and low-dose valleys. This aims to widen the therapeutic window by improving normal tissue sparing while maintaining the same or even better tumour control. The performance of pMB strongly depends on the collimator design and physical parameters. To better understand the physical and radiobiological drivers of this enhanced therapeutic window, we perform a detailed microdosimetric characterization of proton minibeams and assess their impact.
  We characterize radiation quality with microdosimetry through Monte Carlo simulations. Then we extend the Generalized Stochastic Microdosimetric Model to predict the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) at different depths in water, 1cm, 2cm, and 4cm, for 100MeV proton minibeams realized with varying configurations of collimator. Results are compared with conventional homogeneous field (HF) irradiation after dose normalization to the tumor. The developed model is applied by considering tissues as divided into several functional subunits, connected by a seriality parameter.
  Microdosimetric characterization of proton minibeam irradiation shows differences between peak and valley regions in shaping lineal energy spectra, especially at low depth, while radiation quality uniforms progressively getting closer to the tumor. NTCP calculations results suggest an increased sparing effect for pMB over conventional HF. A strong dependence is found on the peak-to-valley dose ratio (PVDR), and on the seriality parameter. Predictions indicate substantial sparing from pMB, especially for PVDR &gt; 15, including relatively serial organs with seriality around 0.7.
  This integrated dose-microdosimetric-biological framework elucidates how spatial fractionation, radiation quality, and organ architecture collectively shape tissue sparing in pMB.</description>

      <title>Collective behavior based on agent-environment interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model of active particles interacting through a dynamic, heterogeneous environment, leading to emergent collective behaviors without direct agent-to-agent communication. Expanding the resource-dependent framework introduced in Briozzo et al., 2025, arXiv:2512.08762, agents perform a persistent random walk combined with chemotaxis, directing toward nutrient-rich patches, whose resources are generated by logistic regrowth. We identify distinct phases of collective organization, ranging from disordered gas-like states to polar traveling waves and nematic independent clusters, depending on the interplay between chemotactic sensitivity and angular noise. The system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking and density waves driven purely by the coupling between population dynamics (birth-death processes) and environmental feedback. Our results bridge active matter physics and movement ecology, demonstrating that complex spatiotemporal patterns can arise without direct interaction between agents, but solely from the maximization of resource intake in a reactive environment.</description>

      <title>Learning minimal representations of stochastic processes with variational autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic processes have found numerous applications in science, as they are broadly used to model a variety of natural phenomena. Due to their intrinsic randomness and uncertainty, they are, however, difficult to characterize. Here, we introduce an unsupervised machine learning approach to determine the minimal set of parameters required to effectively describe the dynamics of a stochastic process. Our method builds upon an extended $\beta$-variational autoencoder architecture. By means of simulated datasets corresponding to paradigmatic diffusion models, we showcase its effectiveness in extracting the minimal relevant parameters that accurately describe these dynamics. Furthermore, the method enables the generation of new trajectories that faithfully replicate the expected stochastic behavior. Overall, our approach enables the autonomous discovery of unknown parameters describing stochastic processes, hence enhancing our comprehension of complex phenomena across various fields.</description>

      <title>Inferring intermediate states by leveraging the many-body Arrhenius law</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18574v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metastable states appear as long-lived intermediate states in various natural transport phenomena which are governed by energy landscapes. As such, these intermediate metastable states dominate the system's dynamics at coarse grained times. Moreover, they can strongly influence the overall pathways through which the energy landscape is explored. Thus, quantifying these metastabilities is crucial for uncovering the key details of the underlying landscape. Here, we introduce a robust method based on a generalized many-body Arrhenius law to identify metastable states in escape problems involving interacting particles with excluded volume. Experimental platforms such as colloidal transport or macromolecular translocation through biological pores can offer promising settings to validate our predictions.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Active Particles in Incompressible Fluid Membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03609v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active proteins and membrane-bound motors exert force dipole flows along fluid interfaces and lipid bilayers. We develop a Hamiltonian framework for the interactions of pusher and puller dipoles embedded in an incompressible two-dimensional membrane supported by a shallow viscous subphase. Beginning from the Brinkman-regularized Stokes equations of the membrane-subphase system, we construct the near- and far-field dipolar velocity and associated stream functions. Although generic dipoles reorient under the local membrane vorticity, we show that the far-field dipolar flow is vorticity-free; force-free motors therefore retain fixed orientation and obey a position-based Hamiltonian dynamics in which the positions of N dipoles evolve via an effective Hamiltonian built from the dipolar stream function. In the near field, where the flow possesses finite vorticity, a Hamiltonian formulation is recovered in the quenched-orientation limit. We demonstrate this Hamiltonian structure by simulating ensembles of pusher and puller dipoles and compare the dynamics generated by the near-field and far-field Hamiltonians. For identical dipoles, the far-field Hamiltonian produces rapid clustering from random initial conditions, whereas the near-field Hamiltonian suppresses collapse and yields extended, non-aggregating configurations. Our work thus provides a concrete realization of position-based Hamiltonian descriptions for active particles in incompressible fluid membranes and establishes the important roles of membrane incompressibility and fluid vorticity that leads to the emergence of such Hamiltonian descriptions.</description>

      <title>Crossing the Functional Desert: Critical Cascades and a Feasibility Transition for the Emergence of Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of life poses a problem of combinatorial feasibility: How can temporally supported functional organization arise in exponentially branching assembly spaces when unguided exploration behaves as a memoryless random walk? We show that nonlinear threshold-cascade dynamics in connected interaction networks provide a minimal, substrate-agnostic mechanism that can soften this obstruction. Below a critical connectivity threshold, cascades die out locally and structured input-output response mappings remain sparse and transient--a "functional desert" in which accumulation is dynamically unsupported. Near the critical percolation threshold, system-spanning cascades emerge, enabling discriminative functional responses that recur over finite coherence timescales. We illustrate this transition using a minimal toy model and generalize the argument to arbitrary networked systems. Also near criticality, cascades introduce finite-timescale structural and functional coherence, directional bias, and weak dynamical path-dependence into otherwise memoryless exploration, allowing biased accumulation over short coherence timescales. This connectivity-driven transition--functional percolation--requires only generic ingredients: interacting units, nonlinear thresholds, influence transmission, and non-zero coherence times. The mechanism does not explain specific biochemical pathways, but it identifies a necessary dynamical regime in which structured functional organization can emerge and be temporarily supported over finite coherence intervals, providing a physical foundation for how combinatorial feasibility barriers can be crossed through network dynamics alone.</description>
