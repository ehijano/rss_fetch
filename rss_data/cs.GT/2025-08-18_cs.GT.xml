      <title>Discovering Expert-Level Nash Equilibrium Algorithms with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithm design and analysis is a cornerstone of computer science, but it confronts a major challenge. Proving an algorithm's performance guarantee across all inputs has traditionally required extensive and often error-prone human effort. While AI has shown great success in finding solutions to specific problem instances, automating the discovery of general algorithms with such provable guarantees has remained a significant barrier. This challenge stems from the difficulty of integrating the creative process of algorithm design with the rigorous process of formal analysis. To address this gap, we propose LegoNE, a framework that tightly fuses these two processes for the fundamental and notoriously difficult problem of computing approximate Nash equilibria. LegoNE automatically translates any algorithm written by a simple Python-like language into a constrained optimization problem. Solving this problem derives and proves the algorithm's approximation bound. Using LegoNE, a state-of-the-art large language model rediscovered the state-of-the-art algorithm for two-player games within hours, a feat that had taken human researchers 15 years to achieve. For three-player games, the model discovered a novel algorithm surpassing all existing human-designed ones. This work demonstrates a new human-machine collaborative paradigm for theoretical science: humans reason at a higher-abstract level, using symbols to compress the search space, and AI explores within it, achieving what neither could alone.</description>

      <title>Computing Approximately Proportional Allocations of Indivisible Goods: Beyond Additive and Monotone Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although approximate notions of envy-freeness-such as envy-freeness up to one good (EF1)-have been extensively studied for indivisible goods, the seemingly simpler fairness concept of proportionality up to one good (PROP1) has received far less attention. For additive valuations, every EF1 allocation is PROP1, and well-known algorithms such as Round-Robin and Envy-Cycle Elimination compute such allocations in polynomial time. PROP1 is also compatible with Pareto efficiency, as maximum Nash welfare allocations are EF1 and hence PROP1.
  We ask whether these favorable properties extend to non-additive valuations. We study a broad class of allocation instances with {\em satiating goods}, where agents have non-negative valuation functions that need not be monotone, allowing for negative marginal values. We present the following results:
  - EF1 implies PROP1 for submodular valuations over satiating goods, ensuring existence and efficient computation via Envy-Cycle Elimination for monotone submodular valuations;
  - Round-robin computes a partial PROP1 allocation after the second-to-last round for satiating submodular goods and a complete PROP1 for monotone submodular valuations;
  - PROP1 allocations for satiating subadditive goods can be computed in polynomial-time;
  - Maximum Nash welfare allocations are PROP1 for monotone submodular goods, revealing yet another facet of their ``unreasonable fairness.''</description>

      <title>Group Fair Matchings using Convex Cost Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of assigning items to platforms where each item has a utility associated with each of the platforms to which it can be assigned. Each platform has a soft constraint over the total number of items it serves, modeled via a convex cost function. Additionally, items are partitioned into groups, and each platform also incurs group-specific convex cost over the number of items from each group that can be assigned to the platform. These costs promote group fairness by penalizing imbalances, yielding a soft variation of fairness notions introduced in prior work, such as Restricted Dominance and Minority protection. Restricted Dominance enforces upper bounds on group representation, while Minority protection enforces lower bounds. Our approach replaces such hard constraints with cost-based penalties, allowing more flexible trade-offs. Our model also captures Nash Social Welfare kind of objective.
  The cost of an assignment is the sum of the values of all the cost functions across all the groups and platforms. The objective is to find an assignment that minimizes the cost while achieving a total utility that is at least a user-specified threshold. The main challenge lies in balancing the overall platform cost with group-specific costs, both governed by convex functions, while meeting the utility constraint. We present an efficient polynomial-time approximation algorithm, supported by theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluation. Our algorithm is based on techniques involving linear programming and network flows. We also provide an exact algorithm for a special case with uniform utilities and establish the hardness of the general problem when the groups can intersect arbitrarily.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based Anti-Jamming Techniques for UAV Communications in Adversarial Environments: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicle communications are encountering increasingly severe multi-source interference challenges in dynamic adversarial environments, which impose higher demands on their reliability and resilience. To address these challenges, agent-based autonomous anti-jamming techniques have emerged as a crucial research direction. This paper presents a comprehensive survey that first formalizes the concept of intelligent anti-jamming agents for UAV communications and establishes a closed-loop decision-making framework centered on the "Perception-Decision-Action" (P-D-A) paradigm. Within this framework, we systematically review key technologies at each stage, with particular emphasis on employing game theory to model UAV-jammer interactions and integrating reinforcement learning-based intelligent algorithms to derive adaptive anti-jamming strategies. Furthermore, we discuss potential limitations of current approaches, identify critical engineering challenges, and outline promising future research directions, aiming to provide valuable references for developing more intelligent and robust anti-jamming communication systems for UAVs.</description>

      <title>Co-Investment with Payoff-Sharing Mechanism for Cooperative Decision-Making in Network Design Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network-based systems are inherently interconnected, with the design and performance of subnetworks being interdependent. However, the decisions of self-interested operators may lead to suboptimal outcomes for users and the overall system. This paper explores cooperative mechanisms that can simultaneously benefit both operators and users. We address this challenge using a game-theoretical framework that integrates both non-cooperative and cooperative game theory. In the non-cooperative stage, we propose a network design game in which subnetwork decision-makers strategically design local infrastructures. In the cooperative stage, co-investment with payoff-sharing mechanism is developed to enlarge collective benefits and fairly distribute them. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, we conduct case studies on the Sioux Falls network and real-world public transport networks in Zurich and Winterthur, Switzerland. Our evaluation considers impacts on environmental sustainability, social welfare, and economic efficiency. The proposed framework provides a foundation for improving interdependent networked systems by enabling strategic cooperation among self-interested operators.</description>

      <title>EXOTIC: An Exact, Optimistic, Tree-Based Algorithm for Min-Max Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Min-max optimization arises in many domains such as game theory, adversarial machine learning, etc., with gradient-based methods as a typical computational tool. Beyond convex-concave min-max optimization, the solutions found by gradient-based methods may be arbitrarily far from global optima. In this work, we present an algorithmic apparatus for computing globally optimal solutions in convex-non-concave and non-convex-concave min-max optimization. For former, we employ a reformulation that transforms it into a non-concave-convex max-min optimization problem with suitably defined feasible sets and objective function. The new form can be viewed as a generalization of Sion's minimax theorem. Next, we introduce EXOTIC-an Exact, Optimistic, Tree-based algorithm for solving the reformulated max-min problem. EXOTIC employs an iterative convex optimization solver to (approximately) solve the inner minimization and a hierarchical tree search for the outer maximization to optimistically select promising regions to search based on the approximate solution returned by convex optimization solver. We establish an upper bound on its optimality gap as a function of the number of calls to the inner solver, the solver's convergence rate, and additional problem-dependent parameters. Both our algorithmic apparatus along with its accompanying theoretical analysis can also be applied for non-convex-concave min-max optimization. In addition, we propose a class of benchmark convex-non-concave min-max problems along with their analytical global solutions, providing a testbed for evaluating algorithms for min-max optimization. Empirically, EXOTIC outperforms gradient-based methods on this benchmark as well as on existing numerical benchmark problems from the literature. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of EXOTIC by computing security strategies in multi-player games with three or more players.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design for Congested Facility Location</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates mechanism design for congested facility location problems, where agents are partitioned into groups with conflicting interests (e.g., competition for booking a basketball court in a gymnasium), and each agent's cost increases when the facility is located closer to their competitors. We analyze three types of misreporting: location-only, group-membership-only, and combined misreporting. To minimize social cost, we propose a strategyproof mechanism that achieves optimality under location-only misreporting. For group membership and combined misreporting, we show that the median mechanism attains tight approximation bounds. For the objective of minimizing maximum cost, we introduce novel strategyproof mechanisms for location-only and group-membership-only misreporting, while employing the leftmost mechanism under combined misreporting. We prove that all proposed mechanisms achieve nearly tight performance guarantees.</description>

      <title>Learning Zero-Sum Linear Quadratic Games with Improved Sample Complexity and Last-Iterate Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04272v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zero-sum Linear Quadratic (LQ) games are fundamental in optimal control and can be used (i)~as a dynamic game formulation for risk-sensitive or robust control and (ii)~as a benchmark setting for multi-agent reinforcement learning with two competing agents in continuous state-control spaces. In contrast to the well-studied single-agent linear quadratic regulator problem, zero-sum LQ games entail solving a challenging nonconvex-nonconcave min-max problem with an objective function that lacks coercivity. Recently, Zhang et al. showed that an~$\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium (NE) of finite horizon zero-sum LQ games can be learned via nested model-free Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) algorithms with poly$(1/\epsilon)$ sample complexity. In this work, we propose a simpler nested Zeroth-Order (ZO) algorithm improving sample complexity by several orders of magnitude and guaranteeing convergence of the last iterate. Our main results are two-fold: (i) in the deterministic setting, we establish the first global last-iterate linear convergence result for the nested algorithm that seeks NE of zero-sum LQ games; (ii) in the model-free setting, we establish a~$\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ sample complexity using a single-point ZO estimator. For our last-iterate convergence results, our analysis leverages the Implicit Regularization (IR) property and a new gradient domination condition for the primal function. Our key improvements in the sample complexity rely on a more sample-efficient nested algorithm design and a finer control of the ZO natural gradient estimation error utilizing the structure endowed by the finite-horizon setting.</description>

      <title>It Takes Two: A Peer-Prediction Solution for Blockchain Verifier's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01794v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The security of blockchain systems is fundamentally based on the decentralized consensus in which the majority of parties behave honestly, and the content verification process is essential to maintaining the robustness of blockchain systems. However, the phenomenon that a rational verifier may not have the incentive to honestly perform the costly verification, referred to as the Verifier's Dilemma, could incentivize lazy reporting and undermine the fundamental security of blockchain systems, particularly for verification-expensive decentralized AI applications.
  In this paper, we initiate the research with the development of a Byzantine-robust peer prediction framework towards the design of one-phase Bayesian truthful mechanisms for the decentralized verification games among multiple verifiers, incentivizing all verifiers to perform honest verification without access to the ground truth even in the presence of noisy observations, malicious players and inaccurate priors in the verification process, proposing the compactness criteria that ensures such robustness guarantees. With robust incentive guarantees and budget efficiency, our study provides a framework of incentive design for decentralized verification protocols that enhances the security and robustness of the blockchain, decentralized AI, and potentially other decentralized systems.</description>

      <title>Game Reasoning Arena: A Framework and Benchmark for Assessing Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models via Game Play</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Game Reasoning Arena library provides a framework for evaluating the decision making abilities of large language models (LLMs) through strategic board games implemented in Google OpenSpiel library. The framework enables systematic comparisons between LLM based agents and other agents (random, heuristic, reinforcement learning agents, etc.) in various game scenarios by wrapping multiple board and matrix games and supporting different agent types. It integrates API access to models via liteLLM, local model deployment via vLLM, and offers distributed execution through Ray. This paper summarises the library structure, key characteristics, and motivation of the repository, highlighting how it contributes to the empirical evaluation of the reasoning of LLM and game theoretic behaviour.</description>
