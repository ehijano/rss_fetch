      <title>Infinitely fast critical dynamics: Teleportation through temporal rare regions in monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider measurement-induced phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits with a measurement rate that fluctuates in time. The spatially correlated fluctuations in the measurement rate disrupt the volume-law phase for low measurement rates; at a critical measurement rate, they give rise to an entanglement phase transition with "ultrafast" dynamics, i.e., spacetime ($x,t$) scaling $\log x \sim t^{\psi_\tau}$. The ultrafast dynamics at the critical point can be viewed as a spacetime-rotated version of an infinite-randomness critical point; despite the spatial locality of the dynamics, ultrafast information propagation is possible because of measurement-induced quantum teleportation. We identify temporal Griffiths phases on either side of this critical point. We provide a physical interpretation of these phases, and support it with extensive numerical simulations of information propagation and entanglement dynamics in stabilizer circuits.</description>

      <title>Ensemble inequivalence and phase transitions in unlabeled networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discover a first-order phase transition in the canonical ensemble of random unlabeled networks with a prescribed average number of links. The transition is caused by the nonconcavity of microcanonical entropy. Above the critical point, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles are equivalent and have a well-behaved thermodynamic limit. Below the critical point, the ensemble equivalence is broken, and the canonical ensemble is a mixture of phases: empty networks and networks with logarithmic average degrees. As a consequence, networks with bounded average degrees do not survive in the thermodynamic limit, decaying into the empty phase. The celebrated percolation transition in labeled networks is thus absent in unlabeled networks. In view of these differences between labeled and unlabeled ensembles, the question of which one should be used as a null model of different real-world networks cannot be ignored.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in single species Ising Models with Non-Reciprocal couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for incorporating non-reciprocal interactions into the Ising model with Glauber dynamics, without requiring multiple species. We then focus on a model with vision-cone type interactions. We solve it in a fully connected network (mean-field) and perform extensive numerical simulations of the model in the square lattice. We find that the breakdown of the spin-flip symmetry introduced by non-reciprocity induces a discontinuous phase transition on top of the usual continuous one, that eventually occurs at higher critical temperatures. Combining a static and dynamic scaling analysis, we measure the critical exponents associated to the continuous symmetry breaking transition, and find them to be identical to the ones of the Ising model in two dimensions (2D), with the exception of the exponent $\beta$ associated to the order parameter. The latter appears to increase as the non-reciprocity of the coupling increases, suggesting that, within our numerical precision, the model does not belong to the 2D Ising model universality class. The coarsening process is anisotropic, but still follows the usual dynamic scaling with an exponent compatible with the standard value with non-conserved order parameter dynamics.</description>

      <title>Holographic deep thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random quantum states play a critical role in quantum information processing. While random quantum circuits typically provide pseudo-random states, deep thermalization introduces quantum measurement to generate genuinely random states. However, the requirement of large ancillae in conventional deep thermalization poses a challenge to scale up the system size. We introduce holographic deep thermalization to substantially reduce the required ancillae to a system-size independent constant. Our circuit design trades space with time, via adopting a sequential application of an scrambling-measure-reset process on a small number of ancillae. Via tuning the ancilla size and number of time steps, holographic deep thermalization allows a continuous trade-off between the total quantum circuit size and the ancilla size. In the case of finite-size systems, we further enhance the performance of holographic deep thermalization via generative quantum machine learning, which leads to constant-factor advantages in the convergence towards Haar random. The theoretical predictions are verified with IBM Quantum noisy simulations.</description>

      <title>Effect of Random Pinning on the Yielding Transition of Amorphous Solid under Oscillatory Shear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of random pinning, where we freeze the relaxation degrees of freedom for a fraction of randomly selected particles, on the yielding transition under oscillatory shear through extensive computer simulations. Using Kob-Anderson model as our model glass former, we pin a fraction of the particles. These pinned particles can move affinely under the imposed oscillatory shear deformation but are not allowed to relax through subsequent rearrangements due to plastic events. As the fraction of pinned particles increases, the system transitions from being a fragile glass former to a strong glass former. This gives us opportunity to examine how changes in fragility impact the yielding transition. Our results demonstrate notable differences in the yielding transition between strong and fragile glass formers under random pinning. This aligns with previous observations where fragility was altered by changing the packing fraction in soft sphere model albeit with a main difference that random pinning significantly suppresses the formation of shear bands, even in well-annealed glass samples.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Ground State from the Neural Tangent Kernel Perspective: The Sign Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural networks has recently attracted much interest as useful representations of quantum many body ground states, which might help address the infamous sign problem. Most attention was directed at their representability properties, while possible limitations on finding the desired optimal state have not been suitably explored. By leveraging well-established results applicable in the context of infinite width, specifically regarding the renowned neural tangent kernel and conjugate kernel, a comprehensive analysis of the convergence and initialization characteristics of the method is conducted. We reveal the dependence of these characteristics on the interplay among these kernels, the Hamiltonian, and the basis used for its representation. We introduce and motivate novel performance metrics and explore the condition for their optimization. By leveraging these findings, we elucidate a substantial dependence of the effectiveness of this approach on the selected basis, demonstrating that so-called stoquastic Hamiltonians are more amenable to solution through neural networks than those suffering from a sign problem.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Adiabatic Quantum-Flux-Parametrons in the MIT LL SFQ5ee+ Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adiabatic quantum-flux-parametron (AQFP) logic is a proven energy-efficient superconductor technology for various applications. To address the scalability challenges, we investigated AQFP shift registers with the AQFP footprint area reduced by 25% with respect to prior work and with more than 2x denser overall designs obtained by eliminating the previously used free space between the AQFPs. We also investigated AQFP cells with different designs of flux trapping moats in the superconducting ground plane as well as compact AQFP cells that took advantage of the smaller feature sizes available in the new fabrication process, SFQ5ee+, at MIT Lincoln Laboratory. This new process features nine planarized Nb layers with a 0.25 $\mu$m minimum linewidth.
  The fabricated circuits were tested in a liquid He probe and in a closed-cycle cryocooler using a controlled cooling rate through the superconducting critical temperature. Using multiple thermal cycles, we investigated flux trapping in the dense AQFP shift registers as well as in the registers using the old (sparse) AQFP designs at two levels of the residual magnetic field, about 0.53 $\mu$T and about 1.2 $\mu$T. The sparse designs demonstrated 95% to almost 100% probability of operation after the cooldown and very wide operation margins, although the flux trapping probability was increasing with circuit complexities. The margins were similarly wide in the newer dense designs, but flux trapping probability that rendered the registers nonoperational was significantly, by an order of magnitude, higher in the denser circuits and was also very sensitive to the moats' shape and location.
  Our findings indicate that AQFP circuits are amendable to increasing the scale of integration and further densification, but a careful moat design and optimization are required to reduce flux trapping effects in the dense AQFP circuits.</description>

      <title>Disorder-Order Interface Propagating over the Ferromagnetic Ground State in the Transverse Field Ising Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider time evolution of order parameters and entanglement asymmetries in the ferromagnetic phase of the transverse-field Ising chain. One side of the system is prepared in a ferromagnetic ground state and the other side either in equilibrium at higher temperature or out of equilibrium. We focus on the disorder-order interface in which the order parameter attains a nonzero value, different from the ground state one. In that region, correlations follow a universal behaviour. We analytically compute the asymptotic scaling functions of the one- and two-point equal time correlations of the order parameter and provide numerical evidence that also the non-equal time correlations are universal. We analyze the R\'enyi entanglement asymmetries of subsystems and obtain a prediction that is expected to hold also in the von Neumann limit. Finally, we show that the Wigner-Yanase skew information of the order paramerter in subsystems within the interfacial region scales as their length squared. We propose a semiclassical approximation that is particularly effective close to the edge of the lightcone.</description>

Abstract: Here we outline some new results for the GHWS model which points to a discretization of parameter space into well differentiated collective dynamic states. We argue this can lead to basic processes in parameter space, starting with minimum modelling ingredients: a complex network with a disorder parameter and an excitable dynamics (cellular automata) on it.</description>

      <title>Information scrambling in quantum walks: Discrete-time formulation of Krylov complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05865v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study information scrambling -- a spread of initially localized quantum information into the system's many degree of freedom -- in discrete-time quantum walks. We consider out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOC) and K-complexity as a probe of information scrambling. The OTOC for local spin operators in all directions has a light-cone structure which is ``shell-like''. As the wavefront passes, the OTOC approaches to zero in the long-time limit, showing no signature of scrambling. The introduction of spatial or temporal disorder changes the shape of the light-cone akin to localization of wavefunction. We formulate the K-complexity in system with discrete-time evolution, and show that it grows linearly in discrete-time quantum walk. The presence of disorder modifies this growth to sub-linear. Our study present interesting case to explore many-body phenomenon in a discrete-time quantum walk using scrambling.</description>

      <title>Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone \&amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson \&amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>
