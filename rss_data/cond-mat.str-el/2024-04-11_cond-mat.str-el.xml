      <title>Topological Heavy Fermion Principle For Flat (Narrow) Bands With Concentrated Quantum Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a general principle for the low-energy theory of narrow bands with concentrated Berry curvature and Fubini-Study metric in the form of a map to Anderson-"+" models composed of heavy fermions hybridizing and interacting with semi-metallic modes. This map resolves the obstruction preventing topological bands from being realized in a local Hamiltonian acting on the low-energy degrees of freedom. The concentrated quantum geometry is reproduced through band inversion with a dispersive semi-metal, leaving a nearly flat, trivial band which becomes the heavy fermion. This representation is natural when the narrow band is not energetically isolated on the scale of the interaction and an enlarged Hilbert space is inescapable, but also provides analytical insight into the projected-interaction limit. First exemplified in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), we extend it to (1) the twisted checkerboard, which we find has a chiral symmetric stable anomaly that forbids a lattice realization at all energies, and (2) the Lieb lattice with gapless flat bands, where we show the heavy fermions can be obtained by minimizing a Euclidean instanton action to saturate its BPS bound. The heavy fermion approach is widely applicable and physically transparent: heavy electrons carry the strong correlations and dispersive electrons carry the topology. This simple picture unifies the dichotomous phenomena observed in TBG and points to connections between moir\'e and stoichiometric materials.</description>

      <title>Exact deconfined gauge structures in the higher-spin Yao-Lee model: a quantum spin-orbital liquid with spin fractionalization and non-Abelian anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-S Kitaev model has recently been shown to definitely exhibit topological order with spin liquid ground states for half-integer spin, but could be trivially gapped insulators for integer spin. This interesting "even-odd" effect is largely due to the fermionic (bosonic) $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges for half-integer (integer) spin. In this Letter, we theoretically show that a spin-S Yao-Lee model (a spin-orbital model with SU(2) spin-rotation symmetry) possesses exact deconfined fermionic $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges for any spin (both integer and half integer spin), which implies a topologically-nontrivial quantum spin-orbital liquid (QSOL) ground state regardless of the value of the spin quantum number. We further study the easy-axis limit of the spin-1 Yao-Lee model which can be solved in a controlled perturbative way and show that it exhibits a gapless QSOL ground state, which can even host a non-Abelian topological order by further considering time-reversal breaking interactions to gap out the Dirac cones of the gapless QSOL.</description>

      <title>Low-energy spin dynamics in a Kitaev material Na3Ni2BiO6 investigated by NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed 23Na NMR and magnetization measurements on an S = 1, quasi-2D honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet Na3Ni2BiO6. A large positive Curie-Weiss constant of 22.9 K is observed. The NMR spectra at low fields are consistent with a "zigzag" magnetic order, indicating a large easy-axis anisotropy. With field applied along the c* axis, the NMR spectra confirm the existence of a 1/3-magnetization plateau phase between 5.1 T and 7.1 T. The transition from the zigzag order to the 1/3-magnetization plateau phase is also found to be a first-order type. A monotonic decrease of the spin gap is revealed in the 1/3-magnetization plateau phase, which reaches zero at a quantum critical field Hc = 8.35 T before entering the fully polarized phase. These data suggest the existence of exchange frustration in the system along with strong ferromagnetic interactions, hosting the possibility for Kitaev physics. Besides, well below the ordered phase, the 1/T1 at high fields shows either a level off or an enhancement upon cooling below 3 K, which suggests the existence of low-energy fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space fragmentation from lattice geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis describes how isolated many-body quantum systems reach thermal equilibrium. However, quantum many-body scars and Hilbert space fragmentation violate this hypothesis and cause nonthermal behavior. We demonstrate that Hilbert space fragmentation may arise from lattice geometry in a spin-1/2 model that conserves the number of domain walls. We generalize a known, one-dimensional, scarred model to larger dimensions and show that this model displays Hilbert space fragmentation on the Vicsek fractal lattice of arbitrary generation. Using Monte Carlo methods, the model is characterized as strongly fragmented on the Vicsek fractal lattice when the number of domain walls is either small or close to the maximal value. We show that the model displays signatures similar to Hilbert space fragmentation on the second-generation hexaflake fractal lattice, the two-dimensional lattice, and a modified two-dimensional lattice. We study the autocorrelation function of local observables and demonstrate that the model displays nonthermal dynamics.</description>

      <title>Matrix product states and first quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common wisdom says that the entanglement of fermionic systems can be low in the second quantization formalism but is extremely large in the first quantization. Hence Matrix Product State (MPS) methods based on moderate entanglement have been overwhelmingly formulated in second quantization. Here we introduce a first-quantized MPS approach to simulate quantum many-body systems. We show that by reformulating the way the fermionic anti-symmetry is handled, we arrive at MPS with a level of entanglement comparable to the usual one found in second quantization. We demonstrate our scheme on the one-dimensional $t$-$V$ model (spinless fermions with nearest neighbour density-density interaction) for both ground state and time evolution. For time evolution, we find that the entanglement entropy in first quantization is significantly smaller than in its second quantization counterpart.</description>

      <title>Stability of mixed-state quantum phases via finite Markov length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For quantum phases of Hamiltonian ground states, the energy gap plays a central role in ensuring the stability of the phase as long as the gap remains finite. We propose Markov length, the length scale at which the quantum conditional mutual information (CMI) decays exponentially, as an equally essential quantity characterizing mixed-state phases and transitions. For a state evolving under a local Lindbladian, we argue that if its Markov length remains finite along the evolution, then it remains in the same phase, meaning there exists another quasi-local Lindbladian evolution that can reverse the former one. We apply this diagnostic to toric code subject to decoherence and show that the Markov length is finite everywhere except at its decodability transition, at which it diverges. CMI in this case can be mapped to the free energy cost of point defects in the random bond Ising model. This implies that the mixed state phase transition coincides with the decodability transition and also suggests a quasi-local decoding channel.</description>

      <title>Origin of pinning disorder in magnetic-field-induced Wigner solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At low Landau level filling factors ($\nu$), Wigner solid phases of two-dimensional electron systems in GaAs are pinned by disorder, and exhibit a pinning mode, whose frequency is a measure of the disorder that pins the Wigner solid. Despite numerous studies spanning the last three decades, the origin of the disorder that causes the pinning and determines the pinning mode frequency remains unknown. Here we present a study of the pinning mode resonance in the low-$\nu$ Wigner solid phases of a series of ultralow-disorder GaAs quantum wells which are similar except for their varying well widths, $d$. The pinning mode frequencies,$f_p$, decrease strongly as $d$ increases, with the widest well exhibiting $f_p$ as low as $\simeq$35 MHz. The amount of reduction of \fp\ with increasing $d$ can be explained remarkably well by tails of the wave function impinging into the alloy-disordered Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$As barriers that contain the electrons. However, it is imperative that the model for the confinement and wave function includes the Coulomb repulsion in the growth direction between the electrons as they occupy the quantum well.</description>

      <title>Generalized Pitaevskii relation between rectifying and linear responses: its application to reciprocal magnetization induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear optics has regained attention in recent years, especially in the context of optospintronics and topological materials. Nonlinear responses involved in various degrees of freedom manifest their intricacy more pronounced than linear responses. However, for a certain class of nonlinear responses, a connection can be established with linear-response coefficients, enabling the exploration of diverse nonlinear-response functionality in terms of the linear-response counterpart. Our study quantum-mechanically elucidates the relation between such nonlinear and linear responses we call the Pitevskii relation and identifies the condition for the relation to hold. Following the obtained general formulation, we systematically identify the Pitaevskii relations such as the inverse magnetoelectric effect and inverse natural optical activity unique to systems manifesting the space-inversion-symmetry breaking. These results provide a systematic understanding of intricate nonlinear responses and may offer further implications to ultrafast spintronics.</description>

Abstract: We present a locality preserving unitary mapping from fermions to qubits on a 2D torus whilst accounting for the mapping of topological sectors. Extending the work of Shukla et al. [Phys. Rev. B 101, 155105], an explicit intertwiner is constructed in the form of a projected entangled pair operator. By encoding the information about the charge sectors (and if applicable the twisted boundary conditions) in ancillary qubit(s), the intertwiner becomes a unitary operator which exchanges boundary conditions and charge sectors.</description>

      <title>Respective Roles of Electron-Phonon and Electron-Electron Interactions in the Transport and Quasiparticle Properties of SrVO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectral and transport properties of strongly correlated metals, such as SrVO$_3$ (SVO), are widely attributed to electron-electron ($e$-$e$) interactions, with lattice vibrations (phonons) playing a secondary role. Here, using first-principles electron-phonon ($e$-ph) and dynamical mean field theory calculations, we show that $e$-ph interactions play an essential role in SVO: they govern the electron scattering and resistivity in a wide temperature range down to 30 K, and induce an experimentally observed kink in the spectral function. In contrast, the $e$-$e$ interactions control quasiparticle renormalizations and low temperature transport, and enhance the $e$-ph coupling. We clarify the origin of the near $T^2$ temperature dependence of the resistivity by analyzing the $e$-$e$ and $e$-ph limited transport regimes. Our work disentangles the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom in a prototypical correlated metal, revealing the dominant role of $e$-ph interactions in SVO.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fruitful avenue in investigating out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems is to abruptly change their Hamiltonian and study the subsequent evolution of their quantum state. If this is done once, the setup is called a quench, while if it is done periodically, it is called Floquet driving. We consider the solvable setup of a two-dimensional CFT driven by Hamiltonians built out of conformal symmetry generators: in this case, the quantum dynamics can be understood using two-dimensional geometry. We investigate how the dynamics is reflected in the holographic dual three-dimensional spacetime and find new horizons. We argue that bulk operators behind the new horizons are reconstructable by virtue of modular flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free Fermion dynamics. This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intra-particle entanglement of individual particles such as neutrons could enable a new class of scattering probes that are sensitive to entanglement in quantum systems and materials. In this work, we present experimental results demonstrating quantum contextuality as a result of entanglement between the spin and energy modes (i.e., degrees of freedom) of single neutrons in a beam using a pair of resonant radio-frequency neutron spin flippers in the MIEZE configuration (Modulated IntEnsity with Zero Effort). We verified the mode-entanglement by measuring a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) contextuality witness $S$ defined in the spin and energy subsystems, observing a clear breach of the classical bound of $|S| \leq 2$, obtaining $S = 2.40 \pm 0.02$. These entangled beams could enable novel approaches for directly probing dynamics and entanglement in quantum materials whose low-energy excitation scales match those of the incident entangled neutron.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Signatures of dynamical quantum phase transitions and chaos can be found in the time evolution of generalized partition functions such as spectral form factors (SFF) and Loschmidt echoes. While a lot of work has focused on the nature of such systems in a variety of strongly interacting quantum theories, in this work, we study their behavior in short-range entangled topological phases, particularly focusing on the role of symmetry-protected topological zero modes. We show, using both analytical and numerical methods, how the existence of such zero modes in any representative system can mask the SFF with large period (akin to generalized Rabi) oscillations, hiding any behavior arising from the bulk of the spectrum. Moreover, in a quenched disordered system, these zero modes fundamentally change the late-time universal behavior reflecting the chaotic signatures of the zero-energy manifold. Our study uncovers the rich physics underlying the interplay of chaotic signatures and topological characteristics in a quantum system.</description>
