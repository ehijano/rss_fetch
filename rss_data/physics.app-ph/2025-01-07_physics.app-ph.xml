      <title>Ferroelectric AlScN thin films with enhanced polarization and low leakage enabled by high-power impulse magnetron sputtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for efficient data processing motivates a shift toward in-memory computing architectures. Ferroelectric materials, particularly AlScN, show great promise for next-generation memory devices. However, their widespread application is limited due challenges such as high coercive fields, leakage currents and limited stability. Our work introduces a novel synthesis approach for ferroelectric AlScN thin films using high-power impulse magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS). Through a combinatorial study, we investigate the effect of scandium content and substrate bias on the ferroelectric properties of AlScN films deposited using metal-ion synchronized (MIS) HiPIMS. Leveraging the high ionization rates of HiPIMS and optimally timed substrate bias potentials, we enhance the adatom mobility at low temperatures. Our films exhibit a high degree of texture and crystallinity as well as low roughness at temperatures as low as 250{\deg}C. Most importantly, the films exhibit coercive fields comparable to state-of-the-art values (5 MV/cm) with significantly enhanced remanent polarization (158-172.0 {\mu}C/cm2). Notably, the remanent polarization remains stable across varying scandium concentrations. We further evaluate cycling stability and leakage current to assess suitability for memory applications. This study demonstrates HiPIMS as a scalable and CMOS compatible technique for synthesizing high-quality ferroelectric AlScN films, paving the way for their application in non-volatile memory applications.</description>

      <title>Semiconductor Laser with Electrically Modulated Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to control the frequency of semiconductor lasers. The new technique allows fabricating three-terminal lasers with fast frequency tuning and the possibility to implement intrinsically the linearization of laser frequency sweep. The electrical contact located between the lower undoped cladding and the waveguide together with the upper laser contact enable pumping for optical gain. A voltage applied between the same contact and the contact located under the lower cladding induces space charge limited current (SCLC) across the lower cladding. Electrons driven into this layer create the space charge. The charge affects the refractive index of the layer and correspondingly the laser frequency. The proposed technique is applicable to any semiconductor lasers. Critical requirements are that free carrier concentration in the lower cladding must be small enough not to affect the SCLC and the laser gain must be high enough to overcome losses introduced by interactivity contact. As an example, we present the calculated characteristics of the QCL operated at 10$\mu$m wavelength. Our calculations show that the laser frequency shift can reach GHz range and the laser tuning speed will be limited by external electronics. Calculations demonstrate that within the range of the selected parameters, the device possesses intrinsically linear relation between the optical frequency and the tuning voltage.</description>

      <title>Low voltage graphene interface engineered organic ferroelectric tunnel junction devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been indicated that the path forward for the widespread usage of ferroelectric (FE) materials may be considerably facilitated through the reduction of programming voltages to on-chip logic compatible values of &lt; 1 V. Obstacles involve issues related to the scaling of the FEs to lower thickness as well as the presence of an interfacial layer (IL) between the high permittivity FE and the substrate -- resulting in wasted voltage across the IL. Here, we show how lower operating voltages along with a higher tunneling electroresistance (TER) could be achieved through IL engineering. We use piezoresponse force microscopy and fabricated ferroelectric tunnel junctions (FTJs) to show that ultra-thin FE films deposited on single layer graphene can exhibit polarization switching at ~ 0.8 V with significant TER.</description>

      <title>Ultra-fast, high-power MUTC Photodiodes with bandwidth-efficiency product over 130 GHz * 100%</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accelerating demand for wireless communication necessitates wideband, energy-efficient photonic sub-terahertz (sub-THz) sources to enable ultra-fast data transfer. However, as critical components for THz photonic mixing, photodiodes (PDs) face a fundamental trade-off between quantum efficiency and bandwidth, presenting a major obstacle to achieving high-speed performance with high optoelectronic conversion efficiency. Here, we overcome this challenge by demonstrating an InP-based, waveguide-integrated modified uni-traveling carrier photodiode (MUTC-PD) with a terahertz bandwidth exceeding 200 GHz and a bandwidth-efficiency product (BEP) surpassing 130 GHz * 100%. Through the integration of a spot-size converter (SSC) to enhance external responsivity, alongside optimized electric field distribution, balanced carrier transport, and minimized parasitic capacitance, the device achieves a 3-dB bandwidth of 206 GHz and an external responsivity of 0.8 A/W, setting a new benchmark for BEP. Packaged with WR-5.1 waveguide output, it delivers radio-frequency (RF) power exceeding -5 dBm across the 127-185 GHz frequency range. As a proof of concept, we achieved a wireless transmission of 54 meters with a single-line rate of up to 120 Gbps, leveraging photonics-aided technology without requiring a low-noise amplifier (LNA). This work establishes a pathway to significantly enhance optical power budgets and reduce energy consumption, presenting a transformative step toward high-bandwidth, high-efficiency sub-THz communication systems and next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-time scale and high performance in-material reservoir computing using graphene-based ion-gating reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising energy demands of conventional AI systems underscore the need for efficient computing technologies like brain-inspired computing. Physical reservoir computing (PRC), leveraging the nonlinear dynamics of physical systems for information processing, has emerged as a promising approach for neuromorphic computing. However, current PRC systems are constrained by narrow operating timescales and limited performance. To address these challenges, an ion-gel/graphene electric double layer transistor-based ion-gating reservoir (IGR) was developed, offering adaptability across multi-time scales with an exceptionally wide operating range from 1 MHz to 20 Hz and high information processing capacity. The IGR achieved deep learning (DL)-level accuracy in chaotic time series prediction tasks while reducing computational resource requirements to 1/100 of those needed by DL. Principal component analysis reveals the IGR's superior performance stems from its high-dimensionality, driven by the ambipolar behavior of graphene and multiple relaxation processes. The proposed IGR represents a significant step forward in providing low-power, high-performance computing solutions, particularly for resource-constrained edge environments.</description>

      <title>Universality in multispecies traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of traffic heterogeneity is of major importance, given the widespread adoption of micromobility in cities. Based on massive field data and a nonequilibrium model, we demonstrate that heterogeneous, multispecies traffic is a member of an inherently nonequilibrium universality class associated with porous flows, namely directed percolation (DP) in one spatial dimension. Our central finding is that, macroscopically, multispecies traffic behaves like water percolating through a porous medium. This hypothesis remained unresolved for years mainly due to the incompatibility of equilibrium approaches with phenomena that are quite far from equilibrium and the limited resonance of complexity theory in the transportation literature. DP entails the existence of a nontrivial phase transition from a disordered subcritical phase to an ordered supercritical phase that depends on a temperature-like control parameter and is governed by a universal power-law. Our model explains the large scatter found in experimental data by taking into account the nonlinear, stochastic perturbations present in multispecies traffic configurations due to coupling of a predominantly lane-based host system with a layer of lane-free parasitic flows.</description>

      <title>Magnetoelectric effect in van der Waals magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02070v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetoelectric (ME) effect is a fundamental concept in modern condensed matter physics and represents the electrical control of magnetic polarisations or vice versa. Two-dimensional (2D) van-der-Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a new class of materials and exhibit novel ME effects with diverse manifestations. This review emphasizes some important recent discoveries unique to vdW magnets: multiferroicity on two dimensions, spin-charge correlation, atomic ME effect and current-induced intrinsic spin-orbit torque, and electrical gating control and magnetic control of their electronic properties. We also highlight the promising route of utilizing quantum magnetic hetero- or homo-structures to engineer the ME effect and corresponding spintronic and optoelectronic device applications. Due to the intrinsic two-dimensionality, vdW magnets with those ME effects are expected to form a new, exciting research direction.</description>

      <title>Materials Discovery in Combinatorial and High-throughput Synthesis and Processing: A New Frontier for SPM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For over three decades, scanning probe microscopy (SPM) has been a key method for exploring material structures and functionalities at nanometer and often atomic scales in ambient, liquid, and vacuum environments. Historically, SPM applications have predominantly been downstream, with images and spectra serving as a qualitative source of data on the microstructure and properties of materials, and in rare cases of fundamental physical knowledge. However, the fast growing developments in accelerated material synthesis via self-driving labs and established applications such as combinatorial spread libraries are poised to change this paradigm. Rapid synthesis demands matching capabilities to probe structure and functionalities of materials on small scales and with high throughput, which are characteristically inherent to SPM. Here, we overview SPM methods applicable to these emerging applications and emphasize their quantitativeness, focusing on piezoresponse force microscopy, electrochemical strain microscopy, conductive, and surface photovoltage measurements. We discuss the challenges and opportunities ahead, asserting that SPM will play a crucial role in closing the loop from material prediction and synthesis to characterization.</description>

      <title>Visualization Techniques for Assessing Inhomogeneities and Stress in Ti:Sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive optical analysis of titanium-doped sapphire (Ti:Sa) crystals, introducing two innovative measurement techniques to enhance the characterization of this material. The first method enables highly precise transmission measurements, facilitating the visualization of optical doping patterns across samples and providing accurate Figure of Merit (FoM) evaluations. This technique covers an area of 25 x 100 mm, allowing for the creation of detailed optical property maps. The second method is specifically designed to identify stress and refractive index inhomogeneities using circular polarization, leveraging the birefringent properties of Ti:Sa material. Experimental validation was performed on three Ti:Sa samples with distinct defects, analyzing and comparing their optical and structural properties. A novel central optical pattern, previously unreported, was observed in all samples. This pattern is hypothesized to originate from core formation during crystal growth. These findings provide new insights into the material's internal structure and hold significant implications for its optimization in optical applications.</description>

      <title>Actuation mechanisms in twisted and coiled polymer actuators using finite element model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Twisted and coiled polymer actuators (TCPAs) offer the advantages of large stroke and large specific work as compared to other actuators. There have been extensive experimental investigations towards understanding their actuation response, however, a computational model with full material description is not utilized to probe into the underlying mechanisms responsible for their large actuation. In this work, we develop a three-dimensional finite element model that includes the physics of the fabrication process to simulate the actuation of TCPA under various loading and boundary conditions. The model is validated against the experimental data and used to explore the factors responsible for actuation under free and isobaric conditions. The model captures the physics of the angle of twist in the fiber and the distinction between the homochiral and heterochiral nature of TCPA actuation response. The simulations show that the anisotropy in the thermal expansion coefficient (CTE) matrix plays a major role in large actuation irrespective of the anisotropy or isotropy in the elasticity tensor. We further investigate the extent of anisotropy in thermal expansion and the parametric studies show that the key for TCPA actuation is the absolute value of mismatch in thermal expansion even if the material has positive or negative CTE in both directions of the fiber. Furthermore, we propose a new shell-core composite-based TCPA concept by combining the epoxy and hollow Nylon tubes to suppress the creep in TCPA. The results show that the volume fraction of epoxy-core can be tuned to attain a desired actuation while offering a stiffer and creep-resistant response. This framework provides a wider application for probing various kinds of TCPAs and enhancing their actuation performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The original theory of phonon polariton is Huang's equation which is suitable for diatomic polar crystals only. We proposed a generalized Huang's equation without fitting parameters for phonon polariton in polyatomic polar crystals. We obtained the dispersions of phonon polariton in GaP (bulk), hBN (bulk and 2D), {\alpha}-MoO3 (bulk and 2D) and ZnTeMoO6 (2D), which agree with the experimental results in the literature and of ourselves. We also obtained the eigenstates of the phonon polariton. We found that the circular polarization of the ion vibration component of these eigenstates is nonzero in hBN flakes. The result is different from that of the phonon in hBN.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Giant Magnetic Chirality during Dimensionality Crossover of Magnetic Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chirality, an intrinsic preference for a specific handedness, is a fundamental characteristic observed in nature. In magnetism, magnetic chirality arises from the anti-symmetric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in competition with the symmetric Heisenberg exchange interaction. Traditionally, the anti-symmetric interaction has been considered minor relative to the symmetric interaction. In this study, we demonstrate an observation of giant magnetic chirality during the dimensionality crossover of magnetic materials from three-dimensional to two-dimensional. The ratio between the anti-symmetric and symmetric interactions exhibits a reversal in their dominance over this crossover, overturning the traditional consideration. This observation is validated theoretically using a non-local interaction model and tight-binding calculation with distinct pairing schemes for each exchange interaction throughout the crossover. Additional experiments investigating the asphericity of orbital moments corroborate the robustness of our findings. Our findings highlight the critical role of dimensionality in shaping magnetic chirality and offer strategies for engineering chiral magnet states with unprecedented strength, desired for the design of spintronic materials.</description>

      <title>Image-charge detection of electrons on helium in an on-chip trapping device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons trapped on the surface of superfluid helium have been thought of as a useful resource for quantum computing. Such electrons show long coherence of their surface-bound (Rydberg) states combined with their easy electrostatic manipulation. Recent proposals explored the possibility of coupling the spin state of an electron and the state of its quantized motion with a promise of a highly scalable 2D architecture for a quantum computer. However, despite recent progress in the detection of quantized lateral motion of electrons using a circuit-QED setup, the manipulation of a small number of electrons and their quantum state detection remains a challenging problem. Here, we report on the detection of the Rydberg transition of electrons on superfluid helium in an on-chip microchannel device in which electrons are moved and trapped by a set of electrostatic gates. A highly sensitive image-charge detection system allows us not only to resolve the transition spectra of such electrons, but also to perform the device characterization. The demonstrated sensitivity shows the feasibility of detecting the Rydberg transition of a single electron, which can open a new pathway for a non-destructive spin-state readout.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond temperature measurements of laser-shocked copper deduced from the intensity of the x-ray thermal diffuse scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present 50-fs, single-shot measurements of the x-ray thermal diffuse scattering (TDS) from copper foils that have been shocked via nanosecond laser-ablation up to pressures above 135~GPa. We hence deduce the x-ray Debye-Waller (DW) factor, providing a temperature measurement. The targets were laser-shocked with the DiPOLE 100-X laser at the High Energy Density (HED) endstation of the European X-ray Free-Electron Laser (EuXFEL). Single x-ray pulses, with a photon energy of 18 keV, were scattered from the samples and recorded on Varex detectors. Despite the targets being highly textured (as evinced by large variations in the elastic scattering), and with such texture changing upon compression, the absolute intensity of the azimuthally averaged inelastic TDS between the Bragg peaks is largely insensitive to these changes, and, allowing for both Compton scattering and the low-level scattering from a sacrificial ablator layer, provides a reliable measurement of $T/\Theta_D^2$, where $\Theta_D$ is the Debye temperature. We compare our results with the predictions of the SESAME 3336 and LEOS 290 equations of state for copper, and find good agreement within experimental errors. We thus demonstrate that single-shot temperature measurements of dynamically compressed materials can be made via thermal diffuse scattering of XFEL radation.</description>

      <title>Enabling Efficient Optimal Control of Reconfigurable Battery Systems by Unifying System Modeling and Narrowing Search Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable battery systems (RBSs) are emerging as a promising solution to improving fault tolerance, charge and thermal balance, energy delivery, etc. To optimize these performance metrics, high-dimensional nonlinear integer programming problems need to be formulated and solved. During this process, it is necessary to address multiple challenges stemming from nonlinear battery characteristics, discrete switch states, dynamic system configurations, as well as the curse of dimensionality inherent in large-scale systems. Thus, we propose a unified modeling framework to accommodate various potential configurations of an RBS and even to cover different RBS designs, significantly facilitating the topology design and optimization problem formulation for RBSs. Moreover, to solve the formulated RBS problems, the search space is tailored to encompass only feasible SSVs, thereby ensuring safe system operation while substantially curtailing search efforts. These proposed methods, focusing on unifying the system modeling and narrowing the search space, lay a solid foundation for effectively formulating and efficiently solving RBS optimal control problems. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated by simulation and experimental tests.</description>

      <title>Parabolic dielectric reflector for extreme on-chip spot-size conversion with broad bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spot-size converters are key for efficient coupling of light between waveguides of different sizes. While adiabatic tapers are well suited for small size differences, they become impractically long for expansion factors around x100 which are often required when coupling integrated waveguides and free-space beams. Evanescent couplers and bragg deflectors can be used in this scenario, but their operation is inherently limited in bandwidth. Here we propose a solution based on a parabolic dielectric interface that couples light from a 0.5 um-wide waveguide to a 285 um-wide waveguide, i.e. an expansion factor of x570. We experimentally demonstrate an unprecedented bandwidth of more than 380 nm with insertion losses below 0.35 dB. We furthermore provide analytical expressions for the design of such parabolic spot-size-converters for arbitrary expansion factors.</description>

      <title>Compact superconducting vacuum-gap capacitors with low microwave loss and high mechanical coherence for scalable quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vacuum gap capacitors have recently gained considerable attention in superconducting circuit platforms due to their compact design and low dielectric losses in the microwave regime. Their ability to support mechanical vibrational modes makes them ideal candidates for circuit optomechanics. However, precise control of gap size and achieving high coherence in mechanical modes remain long-standing challenges. Here, we present a detailed fabrication process for scalable vacuum gap capacitors that support ultra-high-coherence mechanical motion, exhibit low microwave loss, and maintain a small footprint compared to planar geometries. We fabricate arrays of up to 24 LC resonators, with capacitors featuring nanometer-scale gap size variations. We demonstrate that the mechanical quality factors can reach up to $40 \times 10^6$, a 100-fold improvement over other platforms, with microwave quality factors $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ at low photon number levels. This platform also achieves a sizable single-photon optomechanical coupling rate of approximately 20 Hz. Using this, we cooled the mechanical oscillator to its ground state (0.07 quanta) and squeezed its motion below the vacuum level by 2.7 dB. We further demonstrate the scalability of this platform by implementing large-scale optomechanical arrays, a strained graphene model, and observing quantum collective phenomena in a mechanical hexamer. These vacuum gap capacitors are promising candidates for coupling superconducting qubits with mechanical systems, serving as storage elements in quantum computing, and exploring gravitational effects on quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Parameter extraction for a superconducting thermal switch (hTron) SPICE model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently simulating large circuits is crucial to the development of superconducting nanowire-based electronics. However, current simulation tools for this technology are not adapted to the scaling of circuit size and complexity. We focus on the multilayered heater-nanocryotron (hTron), a promising superconducting nanowire-based switch used in applications such as superconducting nanowire single-photon detector (SNSPD) readout. Previously, the hTron was modeled using traditional finite-element methods (FEM), which fall short in simulating systems at a larger scale. An empirical-based method would be better adapted to this task, enhancing both simulation speed and agreement with experimental data. In this work, we perform switching current and activation delay measurements on 17 hTron devices. We then develop a method for extracting physical fitting parameters used to characterize the devices. We build a SPICE behavioral model that reproduces the static and transient device behavior using these parameters, and validate it by comparing its performance to a model developed in prior work, showing an improvement in simulation time by several orders of magnitude. Our model provides circuit designers with a tool to help understand the hTron's behavior during all design stages, thus enabling broader use of the hTron across various new areas of application.</description>

      <title>Unusually high-density 2D electron gases in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures with GaN/AlN superlattice back barriers grown on sapphire substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12570v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reported on the observation of extremely high-density ($&gt;10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$) 2D electron gas in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on sapphire substrates. Due to introducing the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier between the GaN buffer layer and AlGaN barrier layer, we observed a giant enhancement of the 2D electron gas density at the GaN/AlGaN interface from $3\times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ (without SL) to $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ (with SL back barrier) that is only one order of magnitude below the intrinsic crystal limit of $\approx10^{15}$cm$^{-2}$. We found that the changes of 2D electron gas density with SL correlated well with the changes of the wafer warp parameter which suggests that the strains are responsible for the 2D electron gas density enhancement (reduction of the piezoelectric polarization in the GaN channel). Nevertheless, this finding is probably insufficient to fully explain the observed high 2D electron gas density. Simultaneously, the room temperature electron mobility was 169 cm$^2$/Vs, which with the electron density of $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ gives a low sheet resistance of 264 $\Omega$/sq (one of the lowest reported so far for the N-polar 2D electron gas channel). Finally, the possibility of application of such high-density 2D electron gas with low sheet resistance to transistors, emitters and detectors was discussed.</description>

      <title>Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in 2D Photonics: Analysis and Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The centerpiece of topological photonics is the bulk-boundary correspondence principle (BBCP), which relates discrete invariants of the Bloch bands to the possible presence of topologically protected interface modes between two periodic heterostructures. In addition to the fundamental significance of BBCP, interface modes are of interest in a variety of applications. In Maxwell's electrodynamics, the BBCP has been rigorously proved for 1D problems, but the 2D case is qualitatively different, because the boundary conditions involve nontrivial Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps rather than scalar impedances as in 1D. The theoretical analysis and numerical examples presented in the paper are consistent with the BBCP. Moreover, the BBCP is closely connected with the positivity of electromagnetic energy density, as has also been shown to be the case in 1D and 1.5D.</description>

      <title>Invisible Hydrodynamic Tweezers Based on Near-Zero Index Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Manipulating particles, such as cells and tissues, in a flowing liquid environment is crucial for life science research. Traditional contactless tweezers, although widely used for single-cell manipulation, face several challenges. These include potential damage to the target, restriction to static environments, complex excitation setups, and interference outside the target area. To address these issues, we propose an ``invisible hydrodynamic tweezer'' utilizing near-zero index hydrodynamic metamaterials. This metamaterial-based device creates an equipotential resistance zone, effectively immobilizing particles in flowing fluids without disturbing the external flow field and without causing damage to the targets. Unlike traditional active control methods, our tweezer passively captures and releases particles by adjusting the flow channel, eliminating the need for continuous and stable excitation devices, thereby significantly simplifying the setup complexity. Furthermore, these tweezers can be modularly designed in different sizes to flexibly accommodate various application needs. Simulations and experimental validations demonstrated the non-interfering, stable trapping, and precise movement capabilities of these tweezers. This proposed technique holds significant potential for applications in biomedicine, microfluidics, and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of solid-state batteries (SSBs) is hindered by degradation at solid-solid interfaces due to void formation and contact loss, resulting in increased impedance. Here, we systematically investigate the roles of real and unrecoverable interfacial contact areas at the electrode/Li$_6$PS$_5$Cl interface in driving the impedance rise. By controlling contact geometries and applied pressures, we identify their distinct contributions to the impedance spectra and quantify their influence on the interfacial resistance and transport. Experiments reveal that interfacial resistance varies strongly with recoverable contact area and applied pressure following power law scaling, with exponents of -1 and -0.5, respectively. Moreover, distributed contacts result in lower impedance due to smaller potential gradients and a more uniform potential distribution. Continuum simulations of the contact geometries predict interfacial resistances in agreement with experiments. Our work highlights the influence of unrecoverable and recoverable contact losses on SSB impedance while quantifying the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.</description>

      <title>A self-learning magnetic Hopfield neural network with intrinsic gradient descent adaption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical neural networks using physical materials and devices to mimic synapses and neurons offer an energy-efficient way to implement artificial neural networks. Yet, training physical neural networks are difficult and heavily relies on external computing resources. An emerging concept to solve this issue is called physical self-learning that uses intrinsic physical parameters as trainable weights. Under external inputs (i.e. training data), training is achieved by the natural evolution of physical parameters that intrinsically adapt modern learning rules via autonomous physical process, eliminating the requirements on external computation resources.Here, we demonstrate a real spintronic system that mimics Hopfield neural networks (HNN) and unsupervised learning is intrinsically performed via the evolution of physical process. Using magnetic texture defined conductance matrix as trainable weights, we illustrate that under external voltage inputs, the conductance matrix naturally evolves and adapts Oja's learning algorithm in a gradient descent manner. The self-learning HNN is scalable and can achieve associative memories on patterns with high similarities. The fast spin dynamics and reconfigurability of magnetic textures offer an advantageous platform towards efficient autonomous training directly in materials.</description>
