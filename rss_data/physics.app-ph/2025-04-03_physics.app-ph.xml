      <title>Rapid Muon Tomography for Border Security</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray muon tomography is a promising technique for border security applications, leveraging highly penetrating cosmic-ray muons and their interactions with various materials to generate 3D images of large and dense objects, such as shipping containers. Using scattering and absorption of muons as they pass through dense cargo materials, muon tomography provides a viable solution for customs and border security by enabling the verification of shipping container declarations and preventing illegal trafficking. In this study, we utilized Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of muon tomography for cargo characterization and contraband detection in various smuggling scenarios. Our results demonstrate that muon tomography can offers a novel approach to cargo inspection, moving beyond traditional 3D image reconstruction. Instead, it analyzes muon scattering and absorption rates in real time during scanning, enabling the prompt detection of discrepancies between actual cargo contents and declared goods within just 10 to 20 seconds. This method is particularly effective for cargo consisting of uniform loads composed of a single material or product, a common practice in shipping. Unlike traditional X-ray radiography, which analyzes detailed 2D images, muon tomography begins evaluating scatter-absorption rates within the first few seconds of scanning. This early assessment enables cargo evaluation long before a statistically reliable 3D image is formed, significantly improving scanning throughput without disrupting trade flow.</description>

      <title>Defect detection in III-V multijunction solar cells using reverse-bias stress tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reverse biasing triple-junction GaInP/Ga(In)As/Ge solar cells may affect their performance by the formation of permanent shunts even if the reverse breakdown voltage is not reached. In previous works, it was observed that, amid the three components, GaInP subcells are more prone to degrade when reverse biased suffering permanent damage, although they present an initial good performance. The aim of this work is, firstly, to study the characteristics of the defects that cause the catastrophic failure of the devices. For this, GaInP isotype solar cells were analysed by visual inspection and electroluminescence maps and submitted to reverse bias stress test. We find that specific growth defects (i.e. hillocks), when covered with metal, cause the degradation in the cells. SEM cross-section imaging and EDX compositional analysis of these defects reveal their complex structures, which in essence consist of material abnormally grown on and around particles present on the wafer surface before growth. The reverse bias stress test is proposed as a screening method to spot defects hidden under the metal that may not be detected by conventional screening methods. By applying a quick reverse bias stress test, we can detect those defects that cause the degradation of devices at voltages below the breakdown voltage and that may also affect their long-term reliability.</description>

      <title>Physical Modeling of Saturated Common Mode Choke</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common mode chokes (CMCs) are conventional circuit elements performing several tasks, including noise suppression, hindering electromagnetic interference, providing signal integrity, and circuit protection. Much as they are widely used, their fundamental construction and description are often qualitative and lack an understanding of the underlying physical principles. We discuss the behavior of a commercial CMC based on the physical description of the superparamagnetic core and parasitic circuit elements. The results are validated using a DC bias current and an external magnetic field, which affect the magnetic properties. The behavior of the CMCs in the strongly non-linear regime is also described.</description>

      <title>Energy Bands and Breakdown Characteristics in Al2O3/UWBG AlGaN Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on energy bands and breakdown characteristics of Al2O3 dielectrics on ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructures. Metal-dielectric-semiconductor structures are important to sustain high fields needed for future high-performance UWBG transistors. Using systematic experiments, we determined the fixed charge density (&gt; 1013 cm-2), the dielectric/interface, and electric fields in the oxide of under flat-band conditions in the semiconductor. Low gate-to-drain leakage current of up to 5 x 10-7 A/cm2 were obtained in the metal-oxide-semiconductor structures. In lateral metal-semiconductor-insulator test structures, breakdown voltage exceeding 1 kV was obtained with a channel sheet charge density of 1.27 x 1013 cm-2. The effective peak electric field and average breakdown field were estimated to be &gt; 4.27 MV/cm and 1.99 MV/cm, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of Al2O2 integration for enhancing the breakdown performance of UWBG AlGaN HEMTs.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocally Boosting Magnetoacoustic Coupling with Surface-Acoustic-Wave-induced Spin Transfer Torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strengthening magnetoacoustic coupling is crucial to the improvement of the surface acoustic wave (SAW)-driven spintronics devices. A key challenge in enhancing magnetoacoustic coupling is minimizing the phonon and magnon dissipation of the device, which usually requires complicated techniques for generating shear-horizontal (SH) or standing waves to suppress the phonon dissipation. In this work, we significantly strengthened the magnetoacoustic coupling by suppressing the magnon dissipation via the SAW-induced spin-transfer-torque (STT) in Co/Cu/NiFe multilayer, which is facilitated by the non-parallel magnetization alignment between the two ferromagnetic layers. Also, this STT exhibits the form of Zhang-Li torque due to the SAW-induced spin wave, which gives rise to the unique nonreciprocal SAW transportation under external magnetic field. This finding opens new avenues for non-reciprocally boosting magnetoacoustic coupling, which pays the way for developing on-chip SAW-driven multifunctional devices.</description>

      <title>Modeling conductive thermal transport in three-dimensional fibrous media with fiber-to-fiber contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding heat transfers in fibrous materials, particularly conduction, is a major challenge due to their heterogeneous and multiscale nature, and the unknown contribution of fiber-to-fiber contacts. In most previous modeling studies, the existence of thermal contact resistance is not considered, and the computational complexity limits the size of simulated samples, which often leads to imprecise or inaccurate predictions. The same problem arises when considering electrical conduction through fibrous materials. In this work, we describe a computationally efficient simulation approach based on multinodal representation to analyze the steady-state heat conduction through the solid structure in numerically generated three-dimensional nanofiber networks, including contact resistance. We show that the solid conductivity in these networks is governed by a master curve that depends on a single parameter: a characteristic ratio representing the interplay between the intrinsic fiber conductivity and contact resistance as well as the influence of other geometric parameters, which numerically validates previous theoretical studies. However, we observe a deviation to this established theory for poorly connected networks. We derive an expression for a correction factor, considering the influence of correlations between fiber temperatures, and we then find good agreement with our simulation data. Our results demonstrate that the solid conductivity can be fully predicted based on geometric quantities, regardless of the extent of network connectivity, thus generalizing previous studies on this topic. This work, contributing to improve our understanding of conductive heat transport in fibrous media, may prove useful in the development of accurate predictive models and optimization strategies for fibrous insulation materials.</description>

      <title>Low-power multi-mode fiber projector overcomes shallow neural networks classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.04745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the domain of disordered photonics, the characterization of optically opaque materials for light manipulation and imaging is a primary aim. Among various complex devices, multi-mode optical fibers stand out as cost-effective and easy-to-handle tools, making them attractive for several tasks. In this context, we cast these fibers into random hardware projectors, transforming an input dataset into a higher dimensional speckled image set. The goal of our study is to demonstrate that using such randomized data for classification by training a single logistic regression layer improves accuracy compared to training on direct raw images. Interestingly, we found that the classification accuracy achieved is higher than that obtained with the standard transmission matrix model, a widely accepted tool for describing light transmission through disordered devices. We conjecture that the reason for such improved performance could be due to the fact that the hardware classifier operates in a flatter region of the loss landscape when trained on fiber data, which aligns with the current theory of deep neural networks. These findings suggest that the class of random projections operated by multi-mode fibers generalize better to previously unseen data, positioning them as promising tools for optically-assisted neural networks. With this study, in fact, we want to contribute to advancing the knowledge and practical utilization of these versatile instruments, which may play a significant role in shaping the future of neuromorphic machine learning.</description>

      <title>Enhanced thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional Janus ferromagnetic LaBrI with strain-induced valley degeneracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the successful synthesis of the MoSSe monolayer, which violated the out-of-plane mirror symmetry of TMDs monolayers, considerable and systematic research has been conducted on Janus monolayer materials. By systematically analyzing the LaBrI monolayer, we are able to learn more about the novel Janus material by focusing on the halogen family next to group VIA (S, Se, Te). The structural optimizations have been carried out using pseudopotential based Quantum espresso code. Computed structural parameters are in good agreement with literature reports. The optimized crystal structures were used for computing effect of strain on electronic and thermoelectric properties. Dynamical stability predicts that this material can withstand up to 10% of tensile strain. Computed electronic structure reveals material to be indirect wide band gap ferromagnet with magnetic moment 1{\mu}B. With increase in the biaxial tensile strain the band gap decreases. Furthermore, the computed magneto-thermoelectric properties predict high Seebeck coefficient ~ 400 {\mu}V/K and low thermal conductivity of ~ 0.93 W/m.K in LaBrI which results in a high ZT ~ 1.84 for 4% strain at 800 K. The present study supports the fact that tensile strain on ferromagnetic LaBrI material can further enhance TE properties making it to be a promising material for TE applications at higher temperatures.</description>

Abstract: Neuromorphic processors improve the efficiency of machine learning algorithms through the implementation of physical artificial neurons to perform computations. However, whilst efficient classical neuromorphic processors have been demonstrated in various forms, practical quantum neuromorphic platforms are still in the early stages of development. Here we propose a fixed optical network for photonic quantum reservoir computing that is enabled by photon number-resolved detection of the output states. This significantly reduces the required complexity of the input quantum states while still accessing a high-dimensional Hilbert space. The approach is implementable with currently available technology and lowers the barrier to entry to quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Streamlined optical training of large-scale modern deep learning architectures with direct feedback alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern deep learning relies nearly exclusively on dedicated electronic hardware accelerators. Photonic approaches, with low consumption and high operation speed, are increasingly considered for inference but, to date, remain mostly limited to relatively basic tasks. Simultaneously, the problem of training deep and complex neural networks, overwhelmingly performed through backpropagation, remains a significant limitation to the size and, consequently, the performance of current architectures and a major compute and energy bottleneck. Here, we experimentally implement a versatile and scalable training algorithm, called direct feedback alignment, on a hybrid electronic-photonic platform. An optical processing unit performs large-scale random matrix multiplications, which is the central operation of this algorithm, at speeds up to 1500 TeraOPS under 30 Watts of power. We perform optical training of modern deep learning architectures, including Transformers, with more than 1B parameters, and obtain good performances on language, vision, and diffusion-based generative tasks. We study the scaling of the training time, and demonstrate a potential advantage of our hybrid opto-electronic approach for ultra-deep and wide neural networks, thus opening a promising route to sustain the exponential growth of modern artificial intelligence beyond traditional von Neumann approaches.</description>

      <title>First image-guided treatment of a mouse tumor with radioactive ion beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14898v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radioactive ion beams (RIB) are a key focus of current research in nuclear physics. Already long ago it was proposed that they could have applications in cancer therapy. In fact, while charged particle therapy is potentially the most effective radiotherapy technique available, it is highly susceptible to uncertainties in the beam range. RIB are well-suited for image-guided particle therapy, as isotopes that undergo \b{eta}+-decay can be precisely visualized using positron emission tomography (PET), enabling accurate real-time monitoring of the beam range. We successfully treated a mouse osteosarcoma using a radioactive 11C-ion beam. The tumor was located in the neck, in close proximity to the spinal cord, increasing the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy from even slight variations in the beam range caused by anatomical changes or incorrect calibration of the planning CT. We managed to completely control the tumor with the highest dose while minimizing toxicity. Low-grade neurological side effects were correlated to the positron activity measured in the spine. The biological washout of the activity from the tumor volume was dependent on the dose, indicating a potential component of vascular damage at high doses. This experiment marks the first instance of tumor treatment using RIB and paves the way for future clinical applications.</description>

      <title>3D Heterogeneous Integration of Silicon Nitride and Aluminum Nitride on Sapphire toward Ultra-wideband Photonics Integrated Circuits</title>

Abstract: Extending two-dimensional photonic integrated circuits (PICs) to three-dimensional (3D) configurations promises great potential for scaling up integration, enhancing functionality, and improving performance of PICs. Silicon-based 3D PICs have made substantial progress due to CMOS compatibility. However, the narrow bandgap of silicon (1.1 eV) limits their use in short-wavelength applications, such as chemical and biological sensing, underwater optical communications, and optical atomic clocks. In this work, we developed a 3D photonics platform by heterogeneously integrating silicon nitride (SiN) and aluminum nitride (AlN) PICs on sapphire (Al$_2$O$_3$). The broadband transparency of these materials allow our platform to operate over a multi-octave wavelength ranging from ultraviolet to infrared. Leveraging this platform, we demonstrated efficient optical nonlinearity in an AlN microcavity, low-loss and tunable SiN waveguide-based optical components, and optical linking between AlN and SiN PICs layers in the visible and near-infrared spectrum, hinting at potential applications in integrated quantum systems. Our work presents an ultra-wideband 3D PICs platform, providing new opportunities for broadband and short-wavelength applications of PICs.</description>

Abstract: Heterogeneously-integrated electro-optic modulators (EOM) are demonstrated using the hybrid-mode concept, incorporating thin-film lithium niobate (LN) by bonding with silicon nitride (SiN) passive photonics. At wavelengths near 1550 nm, these EOMs demonstrated greater than 30 dB extinction ratio, 3.8 dB on-chip insertion loss, a low-frequency half-wave voltage-length product ($V_\pi L$) of 3.8 $V.{}cm$, and a 3-dB EO modulation bandwidth exceeding 110 GHz. This work demonstrates the combination of multi-layer low-loss SiN waveguides with high-performance LN EOMs made in a scalable fabrication process using conventional low-resistivity silicon (Si) wafers.</description>
