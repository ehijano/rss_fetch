      <title>Quasi-analytical lineshape for the 1S-2S laser spectroscopy of antihydrogen and hydrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of high precision and fundamental measurements of atomic transition frequencies via laser spectroscopy depends upon fitting the spectral data with a lineshape. With atomic hydrogen and antihydrogen 1S-2S two-photon spectroscopy, computer intensive Monte-Carlo simulations have been used to compute the optical Bloch equations in order to match and interpret the experimental spectra. For the highest resolutions, one tries to minimize saturation effects going to regimes of low excitation probability, where perturbation theory can provide reliable results. Here we describe an analytical approach to the lineshape based on perturbation theory accounting for the AC-Stark shift and ionization. The expressions can be used for beam experiments or integrated over the magnetic field profile for a trapped sample. Theses lineshapes, providing fast results, allow for studies of many systematic effects that influence the accuracy of the determination of the central frequency. This development has relevance to hydrogen beam experiments and to trapped hydrogen and antihydrogen, as developed by the ALPHA collaboration at CERN, for tests of the CPT-symmetry and the highest accuracy measurement on antimatter.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical trapping of a heavy polyatomic molecule for precision measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a magneto-optical trap of strontium monohydroxide (SrOH) containing 2000(600) molecules at a temperature of 1.2(3) mK. The lifetime is 91(9) ms, which is limited by decay to optically unaddressed vibrational states. This provides the foundation for future sub-Doppler cooling and optical trapping of SrOH, a polyatomic molecule suited for precision searches for physics beyond the Standard Model including new CP violating particles and ultralight dark matter. We also identify important features in this system that guide cooling and trapping of complex and heavy polyatomic molecules into the ultracold regime.</description>

      <title>Detection of radiatively open systems using an optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a cavity-based detection scheme for a cold atomic ensemble with a radiatively open transition. Our method exploits the collective strong coupling of atoms to the cavity mode, which results in off-resonant probing of the atomic ensemble, leading to a dramatic reduction in losses from the detection cycle. We then show the viability of this frequency measurement for detecting a small number of atoms and molecules by theoretical modelling. Compared with the most commonly used fluorescence method, we show that the cavity-based scheme allows rapid and prolonged detection of the system's evolution with minimal destruction.</description>

      <title>Double interatomic Coulombic electron capture induced by a single incident electron in two- and three-center atomic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the process of interatomic Coulombic electron capture, an incident free electron is captured at an atomic center $A$ and the transition energy is transferred radiationlessly over a rather large distance to a neighboring atom $B$ of different species, upon which the latter is ionized. We consider two-step cascade processes where the electron emitted from atom $B$ is subsequently captured as well, either at center $A$ or yet another atomic center $C$, leading to emission of a second electron from one of the centers. We derive formulas for the cross section of this double interatomic Coulombic electron capture and discuss the relevance of this process, which leads to a substantial rearrangement of the electronic configuration, in various two- and three-center atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Ramsey-Borde Atom Interferometry with a Thermal Strontium Beam for a Compact Optical Clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact optical atomic clocks have become increasingly important in field applications and clock networks. Systems based on Ramsey-Borde interferometry (RBI) with a thermal atomic beam seem promising to fill a technology gap in optical atomic clocks, as they offer higher stability than optical vapour cell clocks while being less complex than cold atomic clocks. Here, we demonstrate RBI with strontium atoms, utilizing the narrow 1S0 -&gt; 3P1 intercombination line at 689 nm, yielding a 60 kHz broad spectral feature. The obtained Ramsey fringes for varying laser power are analyzed and compared with a numerical model. The 1S0 -&gt; 1P1 transition at 461 nm is used for fluorescence detection. Analyzing the slope of the RBI signal and the fluorescence detection noise yields an estimated short-term stability of 4x10-14 / sqrt{tau}. We present our experimental setup in detail, including the atomic beam source, frequency-modulation spectroscopy to lock the 461 nm laser, laser power stabilization and the high-finesse cavity pre-stabilization of the 689 nm laser. Our system serves as a ground testbed for future clock systems in mobile and space applications.</description>

      <title>Anomalous multi-gap topological phases in periodically driven quantum rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that periodically driven quantum rotors provide a promising and broadly applicable platform to implement multi-gap topological phases, where groups of bands can acquire topological invariants due to non-Abelian braiding of band degeneracies. By adiabatically varying the periodic kicks to the rotor we find nodal-line braiding, which causes sign flips of topological charges of band nodes and can prevent them from annihilating, indicated by non-zero values of the %non-Abelian patch Euler class. In particular, we report on the emergence of an anomalous Dirac string phase arising in the strongly driven regime, a truly out-of-equilibrium phase of the quantum rotor. This phase emanates from braiding processes involving all (quasienergy) gaps and manifests itself with edge states at zero angular momentum. Our results reveal direct applications in state-of-the-art experiments of quantum rotors, such as linear molecules driven by periodic far-off-resonant laser pulses or artificial quantum rotors in optical lattices, whose extensive versatility offers precise modification and observation of novel non-Abelian topological properties.</description>

      <title>Quantum error correction of motional dephasing using optical dressing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maintaining the coherence in quantum systems is interesting in both fundamental physics and quantum information processing. In particular, suppressing the dephasing caused by thermal fluctuations in quantum systems can potentially enable functional quantum devices. Techniques to reduce motional dephasing of quantum superpositions include spin echo and bang-bang. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a novel protocol on a collective quantum superposition state known as a Rydberg polariton. These collective states are potentially important in the context of single photon sources, optical transistor, all-optical quantum gates and fast read-out of quantum information. However progress in Rydberg polariton quantum technology has been hindered by fast motional dephasing on which no effective methods exist for undoing it. Here, we show how our protocol via optical dressing using Raman lasers cancels dephasing and enhances coherence times by more than an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Spin-Imbalanced Fermi Gases with SU(N) Symmetric Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamics of degenerate Fermi gases has been extensively studied through various aspects such as Pauli blocking effects, collective modes, BCS superfluidity, and more. Despite this, multi-component fermions with imbalanced spin configurations remain largely unexplored, particularly beyond the two-component scenario. In this work, we generalize the thermodynamic study of SU($N$) fermions to spin-imbalanced configurations based on density fluctuations. Theoretically, we provide closed-form expressions of density fluctuation across all temperature ranges for general spin population setups. Experimentally, after calibrating the measurements with deeply degenerate $^{173}$Yb Fermi gases under spin-balanced configurations ($N\leq$~6), we examine the density fluctuations in spin-imbalanced systems. Specifically, we investigate two-species and four-species configurations to validate our theoretical predictions. Our analysis indicates that interaction enhancement effects can be significant even in highly spin-imbalanced systems. Finally, as an application, we use this approach to examine the decoherence process. Our study provides a deeper understanding of the thermodynamic features of spin-imbalanced multi-component Fermi gases and opens new avenues for exploring complex quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetic quadrupole dichroism in isotropic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05411v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For an isotropic medium, a magnetic field applied in the Voigt geometry affects the optical properties in the second order only, so its effect is much weaker than in the Faraday geometry. In this work, we show that, under resonant excitation well beyond the linear regime, the situation changes drastically: A small magnetic linear anisotropy considerably increases, and an even stronger new quadrupole dichroism emerges. The latter manifests itself as 90{\deg}-periodic azimuthal dependence of transmission and anisotropic rotation of the probe polarization plane. These effects are described microscopically in a toy model and their symmetry analysis is presented. Both are observed experimentally on the D2 resonance of cesium vapor and agree with the theoretical predictions. The large magnitude of the quadrupole dichroism makes it promising for magnetometric applications and for studying the effects of anisotropic bleaching.</description>

      <title>High-fidelity heralded quantum state preparation and measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel protocol for high-fidelity qubit state preparation and measurement (SPAM) that combines standard SPAM methods with a series of in-sequence measurements to detect and remove errors. The protocol can be applied in any quantum system with a long-lived (metastable) level and a means to detect population outside of this level without coupling to it. We demonstrate the use of the protocol for three different qubit encodings in a single trapped $^{137}\mathrm{Ba}^+$ ion. For all three, we achieve the lowest reported SPAM infidelities of $7(4) \times 10^{-6}$ (optical qubit), $5(4) \times 10^{-6}$ (metastable-level qubit), and $8(4) \times 10^{-6}$ (ground-level qubit).</description>

      <title>Systematic-free limit on new light scalar bosons via isotope shift spectroscopy in Ca$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17337v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a precise measurement of the isotope shifts in the $4^2$S$_{1/2} \rightarrow 3^2$D$_{3/2}$ electric quadrupole transition at 732~nm in $^{40 - 42,44,48}$Ca$^+$ via high-resolution laser spectroscopy of co-trapped ions, finding measured shifts of 2,775,392,374.8(6.0), 5,347,679,835.1(5.9), and 10,003,129,115.1(5.7)\,Hz between $^{42,44,48}$Ca$^+$and $^{40}$Ca$^+$, respectively. When combined with prior measurements on the $4^2$S$_{1/2} \rightarrow 3^2$D$_{5/2}$ transition [Phys. Rev. A 100, 022514 (2019), https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.100.022514] a King Plot analysis shows the data to be consistent with linearity below the level of parts per billion. This observed linearity, which is free of nuclear systematics, improves the previous isotope-shift based limits of Ca$^+$ for couplings of a scalar boson beyond the Standard Model to electrons and neutrons by a factor of 3. Our new limit excludes part of the coupling range remaining for a new physics interpretation after accounting for one higher-order nuclear term in the nonlinear King plot of Yb/Yb$^+$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe micro-fabricated rubidium vapor cells with integrated temperature-control functionality and demonstrate their suitability for use in miniaturized ultra-sensitive magnetometers. These functionalized vapor cells (FVCs) embody a dual-chamber design in low-conductivity silicon with anti-permeation coatings and micro-structured thin-film platinum surface traces as resistive heaters and temperature sensors. Thermal tests show our ability to control alkali metal distribution within the FVCs, ensuring a clean sensing chamber for optical measurements. Optical absorption spectroscopy is used to correlate the temperature readings with vapor density and to measure buffer gas pressure, of interest for optimizing sensitivity. Finally, we demonstrate zero-field resonance magnetometry with 18 fT/Hz$^{1/2}$ sensitivity in the 10 Hz to 100 Hz band, limited by laser noise and magnetic shield noise, which indicates that the functionalization does not introduce significant magnetic noise.</description>

Abstract: We report numerically exact quantum scattering calculations on magnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold, strongly anisotropic atom-molecule [Rb($^2$S) + SrF($^2\Sigma^+$)] collisions based on state-of-the-art ab initio potential energy surfaces. We find broad resonances mediated by the intermolecular spin-exchange interaction, as well as narrow resonances due to the intramolecular spin-rotation interaction, which are unique to atom-molecule collisions. Remarkably, the density of resonances in atom-molecule collisions is not much higher than that in atomic collisions despite the presence of a dense manifold of molecular rotational states, which can be rationalized by analyzing the adiabatic states of the collision complex.</description>

      <title>Frequency ratio of the $^{229\mathrm{m}}$Th nuclear isomeric transition and the $^{87}$Sr atomic clock</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18719v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical atomic clocks$^{1,2}$ use electronic energy levels to precisely keep track of time. A clock based on nuclear energy levels promises a next-generation platform for precision metrology and fundamental physics studies. Thorium-229 nuclei exhibit a uniquely low energy nuclear transition within reach of state-of-the-art vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) laser light sources and have therefore been proposed for construction of the first nuclear clock$^{3,4}$. However, quantum state-resolved spectroscopy of the $^{229m}$Th isomer to determine the underlying nuclear structure and establish a direct frequency connection with existing atomic clocks has yet to be performed. Here, we use a VUV frequency comb to directly excite the narrow $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition in a solid-state CaF$_2$ host material and determine the absolute transition frequency. We stabilize the fundamental frequency comb to the JILA $^{87}$Sr clock$^2$ and coherently upconvert the fundamental to its 7th harmonic in the VUV range using a femtosecond enhancement cavity. This VUV comb establishes a frequency link between nuclear and electronic energy levels and allows us to directly measure the frequency ratio of the $^{229}$Th nuclear clock transition and the $^{87}$Sr atomic clock. We also precisely measure the nuclear quadrupole splittings and extract intrinsic properties of the isomer. These results mark the start of nuclear-based solid-state optical clock and demonstrate the first comparison of nuclear and atomic clocks for fundamental physics studies. This work represents a confluence of precision metrology, ultrafast strong field physics, nuclear physics, and fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Contrast Loss from Astrophysical Backgrounds in Space-Based Matter-Wave Interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atom and matter interferometers are precise quantum sensing experiments that can probe differential forces along separated spacetime paths. Various atom and matter interferometer experiments have been proposed to study dark matter, gravitational waves, and exotic new physics. Increasingly, these experimental concepts have proposed space-based designs to maximize interrogation times and baselines. However, decoherence and phase shifts caused by astrophysical backgrounds could largely undermine or destroy the target sensitivity of the experiments. We calculate the decoherence effects induced by solar photons, the solar wind, cosmic rays, solar neutrinos and zodiacal dust on space-based atom and matter interferometers. We find that, in future space-based atom and matter interferometers, the solar wind generically produces decoherence beyond the quantum noise limit, without proper shielding. In addition, solar photons are also an important background for matter interferometers.</description>

      <title>Multichannel quantum defect theory with a frame transformation for ultracold atom-molecule collisions in magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the powerful formalism of multichannel quantum defect theory combined with a frame transformation to ultracold atom-molecule collisions in magnetic fields. By solving the coupled-channel equations with hyperfine and Zeeman interactions omitted at short range, the extended theory enables a drastically simplified description of the intricate quantum dynamics of ultracold molecular collisions in terms of a small number of short-range parameters. We apply the formalism to ultracold Mg + NH collisions in a magnetic field, achieving a 10$^4$-fold reduction in computational effort.</description>

      <title>Membrane-in-the-middle optomechanical system and structural frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09127v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional membrane-in-the-middle model for a cavity that consists of two fixed, perfect mirrors and a mobile dielectric membrane between them that has a constant electric susceptibility. We present a sequence of exact cavity angular frequencies that we call structural angular frequencies and that have the remarkable property that they are independent of the position of the membrane inside the cavity. Furthermore, the case of a thin membrane is considered and simple, approximate formulae for the angular frequencies and for the modes of the cavity are obtained. Finally, the cavity electromagnetic potential is numerically calculated and it is found that the potential is accurately described by a multiple scales solution.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy-induced spin parity effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19311v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin parity effects refer to those special situations where a dichotomy in the physical behavior of a system arises, solely depending on whether the relevant spin quantum number is integral or half-odd integral. As is the case with the Haldane conjecture in antiferromagnetic spin chains, their pursuit often derives deep insights and invokes new developments in quantum condensed matter physics. Here, we put forth a simple and general scheme for generating such effects in any spatial dimension through the use of anisotropic interactions, and a setup within reasonable reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom implementations. We demonstrate its utility through a detailed analysis of the magnetization behavior of a specific one-dimensional spin chain model, an anisotropic antiferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field, unraveling along the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.</description>

      <title>Site-selective cavity readout and classical error correction of a 5-bit atomic register</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical cavities can provide fast and non-destructive readout of individual atomic qubits; however, scaling up to many qubits remains a challenge. Using locally addressed excited-state Stark shifts to tune atoms out of resonance, we realize site-selective hyperfine-state cavity readout across a 10-site array. The state discrimination fidelity is 0.994(1) for one atom and 0.989(2) averaged over the entire array at a survival probability of 0.975(1). To further speed up array readout, we demonstrate adaptive search strategies utilizing global/subset checks. Finally, we demonstrate repeated rounds of classical error correction, showing exponential suppression of logical error and extending logical memory fivefold beyond the single-bit idling lifetime.</description>
