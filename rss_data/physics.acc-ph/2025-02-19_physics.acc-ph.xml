      <title>Peak current reduction in presence of RF phase modulation in the dual RF system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High harmonic cavities are widely used in electron storage rings to lengthen the bunch, thereby enhancing the Touschek lifetime, reducing the IBS effect, as well as providing Landau damping. When the RF phase is modulated in such a dual-RF system, simulations reveal that the peak current can be further reduced. This paper presents the simulation results and explains the underlying mechanism.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Prior Mean Models for Faster Bayesian Optimization of Particle Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03225v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tuning particle accelerators is a challenging and time-consuming task that can be automated and carried out efficiently using suitable optimization algorithms, such as model-based Bayesian optimization techniques. One of the major advantages of Bayesian algorithms is the ability to incorporate prior information about beam physics and historical behavior into the model used to make control decisions. In this work, we examine incorporating prior accelerator physics information into Bayesian optimization algorithms by utilizing fast executing, neural network models trained on simulated or historical datasets as prior mean functions in Gaussian process models. We show that in ideal cases, this technique substantially increases convergence speed to optimal solutions in high-dimensional tuning parameter spaces. Additionally, we demonstrate that even in non-ideal cases, where prior models of beam dynamics do not exactly match experimental conditions, the use of this technique can still enhance convergence speed. Finally, we demonstrate how these methods can be used to improve optimization in practical applications, such as transferring information gained from beam dynamics simulations to online control of the LCLS injector, and transferring knowledge gained from experimental measurements across different operating modes, such as accelerating different ion species at the ATLAS heavy ion accelerator.</description>

      <title>Atomistic modeling of the channeling process with and without account for ionising collisions: A comparative study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a quantitative analysis of the impact of inelastic collisions of ultra-relativistic electrons and positrons, passing through oriented crystalline targets, on the channeling efficiency and on the intensity of the channeling radiation. The analysis is based on the numerical simulations of the channeling process performed using the MBNExplorer software package. The ionising collisions, being random, fast and local events, are incorporated into the classical molecular dynamics framework according to their probabilities. This methodology is outlined in the paper. The case studies presented refer to electrons with energy $\E$ ranging from 270 to 1500 MeV and positrons with $\E=530$ MeV incident on thick (up to 1 mm) single diamond, silicon and germanium crystals oriented along the (110) and (111) planar directions. In order to elucidate the role of the ionising collisions, the simulations were performed with and without account for the ionising collisions. The case studies presented demonstrate that both approaches yield highly similar results for the electrons. For the positrons, the ionising collisions reduce significantly the channeling efficiency. However, it has been observed that this effect does not result in a corresponding change in the radiation intensity.</description>
