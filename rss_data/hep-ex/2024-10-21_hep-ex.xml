      <title>The application of Hough transform for fast interaction vertex position estimation in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Track reconstruction in high-multiplicity events, such as heavy-ion collisions at LHC, is a difficult and resource-demanding process. A priori knowledge of the collision vertex position would allow discarding non-viable track seeds, reducing the overall computing requirements for the track reconstruction. The method proposed in this note uses the Hough transform for the estimation of the interaction vertex position without the necessity to reconstruct the tracks first. It offers admissible resolution with linear scaling of numerical complexity with the track multiplicity.</description>

      <title>A Simple Parametrisation of the Pion Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a novel and simple parametrisation of the pion vector form factor that transparently connects spacelike and timelike regions of the momentum transfer $q^2$. Our parametrisation employs the framework of conformal mapping and respects the known analyticity properties of the form factor, accounting explicitly for the $\rho(770)$-meson pole. The parametrisation manifestly fulfils the normalisation condition at $q^2 = 0$ as well as further restrictions at the pion production threshold and in the limit $|q^2| \to \infty$. In contrast to the widely used Omn\`es parametrisation, our approach does not use the pion-pion scattering phase shift as input. We confront the parametrisation with experimental data from $\pi H$ scattering and $\tau^- \to \pi^-\pi^0\nu$ decay. We already find a good description of the data with only five free parameters, which include the pole mass and decay width of the $\rho(770)$.</description>

      <title>First constraints on general neutrino interactions based on KATRIN data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precision measurement of the tritium $\beta$-decay spectrum performed by the KATRIN experiment provides a unique way to search for general neutrino interactions (GNI). All theoretical allowed GNI terms involving neutrinos are incorporated into a low-energy effective field theory, and can be identified by specific signatures in the measured tritium $\beta$-spectrum. In this paper an effective description of the impact of GNI on the $\beta$-spectrum is formulated and the first constraints on the effective GNI parameters are derived based on the 4 Mio. electrons collected in the second measurement campaign of KATRIN in 2019. In addition, constraints on selected types of interactions are investigated, thereby exploring the potential of KATRIN to search for more specific new physics cases, including a right-handed W boson, a charged Higgs or leptoquarks.</description>

      <title>Application of Machine Learning Based Top Quark and W Jet Tagging to Hadronic Four-Top Final States Induced by SM and BSM Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply both cut-based and machine learning techniques using the same inputs to the challenge of hadronic jet substructure recognition, utilizing classical subjettiness variables within the Delphes parameterized detector simulation framework. We focus on jets generated in simulated proton-proton collisions, identifying those consistent with the decay signatures of top quarks or W bosons. Such jets are employed in four-top quark events in fully hadronic final states stemming from both the Standard Model as well as from a new physics process of a hypothetical scalar resonance y0 decaying into a pair of top quarks. We reconstruct the resonance invariant mass and compare it properties over the falling background using the two tagging approaches, with implications to LHC searches.</description>

      <title>How large could CP violation in neutral $B$ meson mixing be? Implications for baryogenesis and upcoming searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CP violation in neutral $B$ meson oscillations is an experimental observable that could be directly related to the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through the $B$-Mesogenesis mechanism. As this phenomenon is highly suppressed in the Standard Model, it could also be a sensitive probe for many new physics scenarios that modify neutral meson mixing. Motivated by these facts, and the timely $B$ physics program at the LHC and Belle II, we analyze how large CP violation in the mixing of neutral $B_d$ and $B_s$ meson systems could be. We answer this question, in light of current experimental data, within three different scenarios, namely: (i) generic heavy new physics only affecting the mass mixing $M_{12}^q$, (ii) vector-like quark extensions that introduce deviations of 3$\times$3 CKM unitarity, and (iii) light new physics modifying the decay mixing $\Gamma_{12}^q$. We find that enhancements of the semileptonic asymmetries, that measure the amount of CP violation in mixing, at the level of $10^{-3}$ for the $B_d$ system and $10^{-4}$ for the $B_s$ system can be achieved within scenarios (i) and (ii), while they are much more suppressed in realistic UV completions triggering scenario (iii). With respect to cosmology, the difficulty of finding large CP asymmetries in our analysis puts the $B$-Mesogenesis mechanism in tension. Finally, we conclude that upcoming experimental searches for CP violation in $B$ meson mixing at LHCb and Belle II are unlikely to detect a new physics signal for the most generic models.</description>

      <title>MACK: Mismodeling Addressed with Contrastive Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of machine learning methods in high energy physics typically relies on large volumes of precise simulation for training. As machine learning models become more complex they can become increasingly sensitive to differences between this simulation and the real data collected by experiments. We present a generic methodology based on contrastive learning which is able to greatly mitigate this negative effect. Crucially, the method does not require prior knowledge of the specifics of the mismodeling. While we demonstrate the efficacy of this technique using the task of jet-tagging at the Large Hadron Collider, it is applicable to a wide array of different tasks both in and out of the field of high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy using L\'evy-distributed sources at NA61/SHINE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the recent years, research studies in high-energy physics have confirmed the creation of the strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma (sQGP) in ultra-relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions. NA61/SHINE at CERN SPS investigates hadronic matter properties by varying collision energy ($\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}} \approx 5.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.8, 12$, and 16.8 GeV) and systems (such as p+p, p+Pb, Be+Be, Ar+Sc, Xe+La, Pb+Pb). Utilizing femtoscopic correlations, we can unveil the space-time structure of the hadron emitting source. Our focus is on femtoscopic correlations in small to intermediate systems, comparing measurements with source calculations based on L\'evy-distributed sources, to explore the pair transverse mass dependence of the L\'evy source parameters. The L\'evy exponent $\alpha$ is of particular significance, which characterizes the shape of the source and may be connected to the critical exponent $\eta$ near the critical point. Our analysis will reveal that the L\'evy shape parameter, $\alpha$, has a slight non-monotonic behaviour as a function of collision energy and that we see a deviation from Gaussian sources. Finally, it will be shown that there is no indication of the critical point at any of the investigated energies.</description>

      <title>Quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms for multijet clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet clustering or reconstruction, a procedure to identify sprays of collimated particles originating from the fragmentation and hadronization of quarks and gluons, is a key component at high energy colliders. It is a complicated combinatorial optimization problem and requires intensive computing resources. In this study, we formulate jet reconstruction as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and introduce novel quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms for clustering multiple jets in electron-positron collision events. One of these quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms, ballistic simulated bifurcation, overcomes problems previously observed in multijet clustering with quantum-annealing approaches. We find that both the distance defined in the QUBO matrix as well as the prediction power of the QUBO solvers have crucial impacts on the multijet clustering performance. This study opens up a new approach to globally reconstruct multijet beyond dijet in one-go, in contrast to the traditional iterative method.</description>

      <title>Nature of X(3872) from recent BESIII data: Considering the universal feature of an S-wave threshold resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the recent data from the BESIII collaboration on the $X(3872)$ state in the $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ and $D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ decay channels. The quantum number and mass of the $X(3872)$ state allow us to exploit the universal feature of the very near-threshold $D\bar D^*$ scattering in the $S$ wave. The analysis of $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ data and $D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ data separately as well as the combined analysis of these data together, all support the conclusion that $X(3872)$ is an extremely weakly bound charm meson molecule.</description>

Abstract: Using proton-proton collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$ collected by the CMS experiment at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, the $\Lambda_\text{b}^0$ $\to$ J/$\psi\Xi^-$K$^+$ decay is observed for the first time, with a statistical significance exceeding 5 standard deviations. The relative branching fraction, with respect to the $\Lambda_\text{b}^0$ $\to$ $\psi$(2S)$\Lambda$ decay, is measured to be $\mathcal{B}$($\Lambda_\text{b}^0$ $\to$ J/$\psi\Xi^-$K$^+$) / $\mathcal{B}$( $\Lambda_\text{b}^0$ $\to$ $\psi$(2S)$\Lambda$) = [3.38 $\pm$ 1.02 $\pm$ 0.61 $\pm$ 0.03]%, where the first uncertainty is statistical, the second is systematic, and the third is related to the uncertainties in $\mathcal{B}$($\psi$(2S) $\to$ J/$\psi\pi^+\pi^-$) and $\mathcal{B}$($\Xi^-$ $\to$ $\Lambda\pi^-$).</description>

      <title>Studies of the energy dependence of diboson polarization fractions and the Radiation Amplitude Zero effect in WZ production with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16365v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Letter presents the first study of the energy-dependence of diboson polarization fractions in $WZ \rightarrow \ell\nu \ell'\ell'~(\ell, \ell'=e, \mu)$ production. The data set used corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector. Two fiducial regions with an enhanced presence of events featuring two longitudinally-polarized bosons are defined. A non-zero fraction of events with two longitudinally-polarized bosons is measured with an observed significance of 5.2 standard deviations in the region with $100&lt;p_T^Z\leq200$ GeV and 1.6 standard deviations in the region with $p_T^Z&gt;200$ GeV, where $p_T^Z$ is the transverse momentum of the $Z$ boson. This Letter also reports the first study of the Radiation Amplitude Zero effect. Events with two transversely-polarized bosons are analyzed for the $\Delta Y(\ell_W Z)$ and $\Delta Y(WZ)$ distributions defined respectively as the rapidity difference between the lepton from the $W$ boson decay and the $Z$ boson and the rapidity difference between the $W$ boson and the $Z$ boson. Significant suppression of events near zero is observed in both distributions. Unfolded $\Delta Y(\ell_W Z)$ and $\Delta Y(WZ)$ distributions are also measured and compared to theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Measurement of attenuation length of the muon content in extensive air showers from 0.3 to 30 PeV with LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The attenuation length of the muon content in extensive air showers provides important information regarding the generation and development of air showers. This information can be used not only to improve the description of such showers but also to test fundamental models of hadronic interactions. Using data from the LHAASO-KM2A experiment, the development of the muon content in high-energy air showers was studied. The attenuation length of muon content in the air showers was measured from experimental data in the energy range from 0.3 to 30 PeV using the constant intensity cut method. By comparing the attenuation length of the muon content with predictions from high-energy hadronic interaction models (QGSJET-II-04, SIBYLL 2.3d, and EPOS-LHC), it is evident that LHAASO results are significantly shorter than those predicted by the first two models (QGSJET-II-04 and SIBYLL 2.3d) but relatively close to those predicted by the third model (EPOS-LHC). Thus, the LHAASO data favor the EPOS-LHC model over the other two models. The three interaction models confirmed an increasing trend in the attenuation length as the cosmic-ray energy increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive production of fully charmed tetraquarks, $T_{4c}(0^{++})$ or $T_{4c}(2^{++})$ radial excitations, in high-energy proton collisions. We build our study upon the collinear fragmentation of a single parton in a variable-flavor number scheme, suited to describe the tetraquark formation mechanism from moderate to large transverse-momentum regimes. To this extent, we derive a novel set of DGLAP-evolving collinear fragmentation functions, named TQ4Q1.0 determinations. They encode initial-scale inputs corresponding to both gluon and heavy-quark fragmentation channels, defined within the context of quark-potential and spin-physics inspired models, respectively. We work within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization and make use of the JETHAD numeric interface along with the symJETHAD symbolic calculation plugin. With these tools, we provide predictions for high-energy observables sensitive to $T_{4c}$ plus jet emissions at center-of-mass energies ranging from 14 TeV at the LHC to the 100 TeV nominal energy of the FCC.</description>

      <title>Elaborating Higgs to dimuon decay from gluon fusion by decorrelation and jet substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovery of the Higgs boson decay to dimuon is anticipated soon based on the current evidence. Precise categorization of the events without affecting the invariant mass shape is crucial in the analysis. Decorrelation of the invariant mass and the output of discriminators (the score of discriminators) is essential for consistent and precise analysis. In this paper we use distance correlation as the additional loss function to achieve the decorrelation for discriminators and examine various analysis methods. The analyses with and without jet substructure variables are presented. Adding jet substructure variables considerably improves the significance of the Higgs to dimuon signal from gluon fusion.</description>

      <title>Displaced vertex signals of low temperature baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the connection of baryogenesis at temperatures below the electroweak scale and signals for long-lived particles at the LHC. The model features new SM singlets, with a long-lived fermion decaying to quarks to generate the baryon asymmetry. The model avoids strong flavor physics bounds while predicting a rich diquark phenomenology, monojet signals, and displaced vertices. We show how the displaced vertex signals can be probed at the HL-LHC. The large transverse production makes a strong physics case for constructing far detector experiments such as MATHUSLA, ANUBIS, and CODEX-b, complementary to the central and forward long-lived particle program.</description>
