      <title>Rabinowitz Floer homology as a Tate vector space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the category of linearly topologized vector spaces over discrete fields constitutes the correct framework for algebraic structures on Floer homologies with field coefficients. Our case in point is the Poincar\'e duality theorem for Rabinowitz Floer homology. We prove that Rabinowitz Floer homology is a locally linearly compact vector space in the sense of Lefschetz, or, equivalently, a Tate vector space in the sense of Beilinson-Feigin-Mazur. Poincar\'e duality and the graded Frobenius algebra structure on Rabinowitz Floer homology then hold in the topological sense. Along the way, we develop in a largely self-contained manner the theory of linearly topologized vector spaces, with special emphasis on duality and completed tensor products, complementing results of Beilinson-Drinfeld, Beilinson, Rojas, Positselski, and Esposito-Penkov.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian cobordism functor in microlocal sheaf theory II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For an exact Lagrangian cobordism $L$ between Legendrians in $J^1(M)$ from $\Lambda_-$ to $\Lambda_+$ whose Legendrian lift is $\widetilde{L}$, we prove that sheaves in $Sh_{\widetilde{L}}(M \times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0})$ are equivalent to sheaves at the negative end $Sh_{\Lambda_-}(M \times \mathbb{R})$ together with the data of local systems $Loc({L})$ by studying sheaf quantizations for general noncompact Lagrangians. Thus we interpret the Lagrangian cobordism functor between $Sh_{\Lambda_\pm}(M \times \mathbb{R})$ as a correspondence parametrized by $Loc({L})$. This enables one to consider generalizations to immersed Lagrangian cobordisms. We also prove that the Lagrangian cobordism functor is action decreasing and recover results on the lengths of embedded Lagrangian cobordisms. Finally, using the construction of Courte-Ekholm, we obtain a family of Legendrians with sheaf categories Morita equivalent to chains of based loop spaces of the Lagrangian fillings.</description>

      <title>Foundation of Floer homotopy theory I: Flow categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a stable infinity category with objects flow categories and morphisms flow bimodules; our construction has many flavors, related to a choice of bordism theory, and we discuss in particular framed bordism and the bordism theory of complex oriented derived orbifolds. In this setup, the construction of homotopy types associated to Floer-theoretic data is immediate: the moduli spaces of solutions to Floer's equation assemble into a flow category with respect to the appropriate bordism theory, and the associated Floer homotopy types arise as suitable mapping spectra in this category. The definition of these mapping spectra is sufficiently explicit to allow a direct interpretation of the Floer homotopy groups as Floer bordism groups. In the setting of framed bordism, we show that the category we construct is a model for the category of spectra. We implement the construction of Floer homotopy types in this new formalism for the case of Hamiltonian Floer theory.</description>

      <title>Zoll magnetic systems on the two-torus: a Nash-Moser construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an infinite-dimensional family of smooth integrable magnetic systems on the two-torus which are Zoll, meaning that all the unit-speed magnetic geodesics are periodic. The metric and the magnetic field of such systems are arbitrarily close to the flat metric and to a given constant magnetic field. This extends to the magnetic setting a famous result by Guillemin on the two-sphere. We characterize Zoll magnetic systems as zeros of a suitable action functional $S$, and then look for its zeros by means of a Nash-Moser implicit function theorem. This requires showing the right-invertibility of the linearized operator $\mathrm{d} S$ in a neighborhood of the flat metric and constant magnetic field, and establishing tame estimates for the right inverse. As key step we prove the invertibility of the normal operator $\mathrm{d} S\circ \mathrm{d} S^*$ which, unlike in Guillemin's case, is pseudo-differential only at the highest order. We overcome this difficulty noting that, by the asymptotic properties of Bessel functions, the lower order expansion of $\mathrm{d} S \circ \mathrm{d}S^*$ is a sum of Fourier integral operators. We then use a resolvent identity decomposition which reduces the problem to the invertibility of $\mathrm{d} S \circ \mathrm{d} S^*$ restricted to the subspace of functions corresponding to high Fourier modes. The inversion of such a restricted operator is finally achieved by making the crucial observation that lower order Fourier integral operators satisfy asymmetric tame estimates.</description>

      <title>Untwisted Gromov-Witten invariants of Riemann-Finsler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09853v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a $\mathbb{Q}$-valued deformation invariant of certain complete Riemann-Finsler manifolds, in particular of complete Riemannian manifolds with non positive sectional curvature. It is proved that every rational number is the value of this invariant for some compact Riemannian manifold. We use this to find the first and mostly sharp generalizations, to non-compact products and fibrations, of Preissman's theorem on non-existence of negative sectional curvature metrics on compact products. For example, $\Sigma \times T ^{n}$ admits a metric of negative sectional curvature, where $\Sigma$ is a non-compact possibly infinite type surface, if and only if $\Sigma$ has genus zero. We also give novel estimates on counts of closed geodesics with restrictions on multiplicity. Along the way, we also prove that sky catastrophes of smooth dynamical systems are not geodesible by a certain class of forward complete Riemann-Finsler metrics, in particular by complete Riemannian metrics with non-positive sectional curvature. This partially answers a question of Fuller and gives important examples for our theory here.</description>

      <title>Localizations of the category of $A_\infty$ categories and internal Homs over a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, over an arbitrary commutative ring, the localizations of the categories of dg categories, of cohomologically unital, of unital and of strictly unital $A_\infty$ categories with respect to the corresponding classes of quasi-equivalences are all equivalent. The result is proven at the $\infty$-categorical level by considering the natural $\infty$-categorical models of the categories above. As an application, we provide a new proof of the existence of internal Homs for the homotopy category of dg categories in terms of the category of unital $A_\infty$ functors, thus yielding a complete proof of a claim by Kontsevich and Keller.</description>

      <title>Mapping Cone Connections and their Yang-Mills Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given closed two-form, we introduce the cone Yang-Mills functional which is a Yang-Mills-type functional for a pair $(A,B)$, a connection one-form $A$ and a scalar $B$ taking value in the adjoint representation of a Lie group. The functional arises naturally from dimensionally reducing the Yang-Mills functional over the fiber of a circle bundle with the two-form being the Euler class. We write down the Euler-Lagrange equations of the functional and present some of the properties of its critical solutions, especially in comparison with Yang-Mills solutions. We show that a special class of three-dimensional solutions satisfy a duality condition which generalizes the Bogomolny monopole equations. Moreover, we analyze the zero solutions of the cone Yang-Mills functional and give an algebraic classification characterizing principal bundles that carry such cone-flat solutions when the two-form is non-degenerate.</description>
