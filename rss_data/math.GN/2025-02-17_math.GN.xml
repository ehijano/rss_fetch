      <title>Weak variations of Baumgartner's axiom for Polish spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If $X$ is a topological space and $\kappa$ is a cardinal then $\mathsf{BA}_\kappa (X)$ is the statement that for each pair $A, B \subseteq X$ of $\kappa$-dense subsets there is an autohomeomorphism $h:X \to X$ mapping $A$ to $B$. In particular $\mathsf{BA}_{\aleph_1} (\mathbb R)$ is equivalent the celebrated Baumgartner axiom on isomorphism types of $\aleph_1$-dense linear orders. In this paper we consider two natural weakenings of $\mathsf{BA}_\kappa (X)$ which we call $\mathsf{BA}^-_\kappa (X)$ and $\mathsf{U}_\kappa (X)$ for arbitrary perfect Polish spaces $X$. We show that the first of these, though properly weaker, entails many of the more striking consequences of $\mathsf{BA}_\kappa (X)$ while the second does not. Nevertheless the second is still independent of $\mathsf{ZFC}$ and we show in particular that it fails in the Cohen and random models. This motivates several new classes of pairs of spaces which are ``very far from being homeomorphic" which we call ``disliking", ``hating", and ``loathing". The paper concludes by studying these classes, particularly in the context of forcing theory, in an attempt to gauge how different weak Baumgartner axioms may be separated.</description>

      <title>Point configurations in sets of sufficient topological structure and a topological {E}rd\H{o}s similarity conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the occurrence of point configurations within non-meager (second category) Baire sets. A celebrated result of Steinhaus asserts that $A+B$ and $A-B$ contain an interval whenever $A$ and $B$ are sets of positive Lebesgue measure in $\R^n$ for $n\geq 1$. A topological analogue attributed to Piccard asserts that both $AB$ and $AB^{-1}$ contain an interval when $A,B$ are non-meager (second category) Baire sets in a topological group. We explore generalizations of Piccard's result to more complex point configurations and more abstract spaces. In the Euclidean setting, we show that if $A\subset \R^d$ is a non-meager Baire set and $F=\{x_n\}_{n\in\N}$ is a bounded sequence, then there is an interval of scalings $t$ for which $tF+z\subset A$ for some $z\in \R^d$. That is, the set $$\Delta_F(A)=\{t\in\R: \exists z\text{ such that }tF+z\subset A\}$$ has nonempty interior. More generally, if $V$ is a topological vector space and $F=\{x_n\}_{n\in\N}\subset V$ is a bounded sequence, we show that if $A\subset V$ is non-meager and Baire, then $\Delta_F(A)$ has nonempty interior. The notion of boundedness in this context is described below. Note that the sequence $F$ can be countably infinite, which distinguishes this result from its measure-theoretic analogue. In the context of the topological version of Erd\H{o}s' similarity conjecture, we show that bounded countable sets are universal in non-meager Baire sets.</description>

      <title>Cauchy convergence in V-normed categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the notion of normed category as suggested by Lawvere, we introduce notions of Cauchy convergence and cocompleteness which differ from proposals in previous works. Key to our approach is to treat them consequentially as categories enriched in the monoidal-closed category of normed sets. Our notions largely lead to the anticipated outcomes when considering individual metric spaces as small normed categories, but they can be challenging when considering some large categories, like those of semi-normed or normed vector spaces and all linear maps, or of generalized metric spaces and all mappings. These are the key example categories discussed in detail in this paper. Working with a general commutative quantale V as a value recipient for norms, rather than only with Lawvere's quantale of the extended real half-line, we observe that the categorically atypical structure gap between objects and morphisms in the example categories is already present in the underlying normed category of the enriching category of V-normed sets. To show that this normed category and, in fact, all presheaf categories over it, are Cauchy cocomplete, we assume the quantale V to satisfy a couple of light alternative extra properties. Of utmost importance to the general theory is the fact that our notion of normed colimit is subsumed by the notion of weighted colimit of enriched category theory. With this theory we are able to prove that all V-normed categories have correct-size Cauchy cocompletions. We also prove a Banach Fixed Point Theorem for contractive endofunctors of Cauchy cocomplete normed categories.</description>

      <title>Menger and consonant sets in the Sacks model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using iterated Sacks forcing and topological games, we prove that the existence of a totally imperfect Menger set in the Cantor cube with cardinality continuum is independent from ZFC. We also analyze the structure of Hurewicz and consonant subsets of the Cantor cube in the Sacks model.</description>
