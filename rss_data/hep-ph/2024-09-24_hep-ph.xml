      <title>String Invention, Viable 3-3-1 Model, Dark Matter Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After very little memories we review slightly Paul Frampton's memories from the discovery of Veneziano model being indeed string theory with Y. Nambu and secondly his 3-3-1 theory.This latter is an indeed not excluded replacement for the Standard Model with triangle anomalies cancelling as they must in a truly viable theory. It even needs (essentially) 3 as the family number! Also primordial black holes as dark matter is mentioned, we end with review of a my own very speculative utterly recent idea, that for the purpose of the classical approximation, we could, using the functional integral as our rudimentary assumption taken over from quantum mechanics, obtain the equations of motion without the in our opinion very mysterious imaginary unit i, which usually occurs as a factor in the exponent of the functional integrand, which is this i times the action. The functional integral without the mysterious i leads to predicting some of the most strong features in cosmology, and also seems to argue for as little black holes as possible.</description>

      <title>Evaporating Axion Dark Matter and the Hubble Constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles are a well-motivated dark matter candidate that can form a condensate with low momentum and high occupation number. In the presence of dark radiation, this condensate loses energy, naturally increasing the energy density of the universe around matter-radiation equality without requiring additional inputs. This general mechanism may offer a solution to the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Light in the Shadows: Primordial Black Holes Making Dark Matter Shine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the possibility of indirect detection of dark sector processes by investigating a novel form of interaction between ambient dark matter (DM) and primordial black holes (PBHs). The basic scenario we envisage is that the ambient DM is ``dormant'', \ie, it has interactions with the SM, but its potential for an associated SM signal is not realized for various reasons. We argue that the presence of PBHs with active Hawking radiation (independent of any DM considerations) can act as a catalyst in this regard by overcoming the aforementioned bottlenecks. The central point is that PBHs radiate all types of particles, whether in the standard model (SM) or beyond (BSM), which have a mass at or below their Hawking temperature. The emission of such radiation is ``democratic" (up to the particle spin), since it is based on a coupling of sorts of gravitational origin. In particular, such shining of (possibly dark sector) particles onto ambient DM can then activate the latter into giving potentially observable SM signals. We illustrate this general mechanism with two specific models. First, we consider asymmetric DM, which is characterized by an absence of ambient anti-DM, and consequently the absence of DM indirect detection signals. In this case, PBHs can ``resurrect'' such a signal by radiating anti-DM, which then annihilates with ambient DM in order to give SM particles such as photons. In our second example, we consider the PBH emission of dark gauge bosons which can excite ambient DM into a heavier state (which is, again, not ambient otherwise), this heavier state later decays back into DM and photons. Finally, we demonstrate that we can obtain observable signals of these BSM models from asteroid-mass PBHs (Hawking radiating currently with $\sim \mathcal{O}(\mathrm{MeV})$ temperatures) at gamma-ray experiments such as AMEGO-X.</description>

      <title>Probing Celestial Energy and Charge Correlations through Real-Time Quantum Simulations: Insights from the Schwinger Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in the application of light-ray operators (LROs) in high energy physics, we propose a new strategy to study correlation functions of LROs through real-time quantum simulations. We argue that quantum simulators provide an ideal laboratory to explore the properties LROs in lower-dimensional quantum field theories (QFTs). This is exemplified in the 1+1-d Schwinger model, employing tensor network methods, focusing on the calculation of energy and charge correlators. Despite some challenges in extracting the necessary correlation functions from the lattice the methodology used can be extended to real quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Plausible constraints and inflationary production for dark photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generic constraints on dark photons are generally presented assuming they have Stueckelberg masses. These constraints are strengthened if instead the mass is due to the Higgs mechanism and the dark Higgs is light. First, we show that under reasonable assumptions on the origin of kinetic mixing $\epsilon$ and perturbativity, the strengthened constraints on $\epsilon$ cannot be arbitrarily relaxed by making the Higgs heavy. Second, we demonstrate a simple mechanism for generating dark photon dark matter after inflation, where fluctuations of a dark Higgs by stochastic misalignment can produce stable dark photons through $h\to A'A'$ decay. Third, we point out new lower bounds on $\epsilon$ in the case where the dark photon mediates thermal freeze-out of light dark matter by $s$-channel exchange, taking account of generic expectations for the size of $\epsilon$, and astrophysical upper bounds on the self-interaction cross section.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing for Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as powerful observables for probing the fragmentation dynamics of high-energy collisions. We introduce the first numerical strategy for calculating energy correlators using the Hamiltonian lattice approach, providing access to the intriguing nonperturbative dynamics of these observables. Furthermore, motivated by rapid advances in quantum computing hardware and algorithms, we propose a quantum algorithm for calculating energy correlators in quantum field theories. This algorithm includes ground state preparation, the application of source, sink, energy flux, real-time evolution operators, and the Hadamard test. We validate our approach by applying it to the SU(2) pure gauge theory in $2+1$ dimensions on $3\times 3$ and $5\times 5$ honeycomb lattices with $j_{\rm max} = \frac{1}{2}$ at various couplings, utilizing both classical methods and the quantum algorithm, the latter tested using the IBM emulator for specific configurations. The results are consistent with the expected behavior of the strong coupling regime and motivate a more comprehensive study to probe the confinement dynamics across the weak and strong coupling regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general analytical expression for the fixed-order structure of the distribution of a generic non-global observable with the k$_t$ jet algorithm at any perturbative order. This novel formulation is obtained within the framework of the Eikonal approximation, assuming strong-energy ordering of emitted partons. The proposed formula is applicable to a wide range of processes at both lepton and hadron colliders.</description>

      <title>Towards heavy double-gluon hybrid mesons with exotic quantum numbers in QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double-gluon hybrid meson configuration was recently proposed and investigated within QCD sum rules. In this talk, we discuss the color structures of the double-gluon hybrid meson and construct current operators with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ for two of the structures. In the framework of QCD sum rules, we consider the condensates up to dimension-8 at the leading order of $\alpha_{s}$ for both charmonium and the bottomonium systems. The results indicate that the masses of the $1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ charmonium double-gluon hybrid mesons are approximately $6.1-7.2$ GeV and $6.3-6.4$ GeV, respectively. As for the bottomonium systems, their masses fall within the range of $13.7-14.3$ GeV and $12.6-13.3$ GeV for the $1^{-+}$ and $2^{+-}$ channels, respectively. Additionally, the charmonium hybrids could be produced in the radiative decays of bottomonium mesons in BelleII experiment.</description>

      <title>T-Model Higgs Inflation and Metastable Cosmic Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the formation of metastable cosmic strings (CSs) in the context of a supersymmetric (SUSY) left-right model. The SU(2)R symmetry breaking occurs during a stage of T-model (Higgs) inflation (TI) driven by an SU(2)R triplet superfield which inflates away the produced monopoles. The subsequent breaking of the remaining U(1)R x U(1)B-L symmetry, triggered due to an instability arising in the system of a pair of SU(2)R doublet superfields, leads to the production of CSs. TI is based on a quartic potential, is consistent with data thanks to the adopted hyperbolic Kaehler geometry and may be followed by successful non-thermal leptogenesis. The decay of produced CSs interprets the recent observations from PTA experiments on the stochastic background of gravitational waves with values of the superpotential coupling constants close to 10^-6-10^-8 and symmetry-breaking scales a little lower than the SUSY grand unified theory scale. A solution to the mu problem of the MSSM is also accommodated provided that mu is two to three orders of magnitude lower than the gravitino mass.</description>

      <title>Exploring Nucleon Structure through Sub-threshold $\phi$-Meson Photoproduction at an Electron-Positron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to investigate short-range correlations (SRCs) in nuclei by studying sub-threshold photoproduction of $\phi$ particles in an electron-positron collision experiment. We present a direct experimental signature for SRCs, which is deemed achievable using the Beijing Spectrometer III (BESIII). The cross sections for sub-threshold production, as well as the likelihood of detection by BESIII, are calculated. These results underscore the substantial potential of BESIII in elucidating the fundamental physics behind the nuclear modification of parton distribution functions. This proposed experimental analysis of photon-nucleon interactions in electron-positron collisions represents uncharted territory, promising fresh prospects for applications in both particle and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Finding Interaction Mechanism between Exotic Molecule and Conventional Hadron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An intriguing and important question arises: how do hadronic molecules interact with conventional hadrons? In this Letter, we propose a novel mechanism to address this issue, focusing on the interactions between hidden-charm molecular pentaquarks ($P_c$) and nucleons ($N$). By applying this mechanism, we derive the corresponding interaction potentials, enabling the prediction of the bound state properties. Our results indicate the possible existence of $P_cN$ bound states--an entirely new form of matter, ripe for exploration in the era of high-precision hadron spectroscopy. Notably, this mechanism extends beyond the $P_cN$ systems and can be applied to any hadronic molecules interacting with conventional hadrons, offering the potential for discovering a variety of novel bound states.</description>

      <title>Universal critical dynamics near the chiral phase transition and the QCD critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a novel real-time formulation of the functional renormalization group (FRG) for dynamical systems with reversible mode couplings to study Model H, the conjectured dynamic universality class of the QCD critical point. We emphasize the structural similarities with Model G, conjectured to be the dynamic universality class of the chiral phase transition in the limit of two massless quark flavors. Importantly, our formulation of the real-time FRG preserves all relevant symmetries throughout the FRG flow which, e.g., guarantees the non-renormalization of the reversible mode couplings, as but one exact result. We derive non-perturbative RG flow equations for the kinetic coefficients of both, Model G and H, in parallel, and discuss commonalities and differences in the resulting fixed-point structure and dynamic critical exponents, such as weak-scaling relations which hold in either case versus the characteristic strong scaling of Model G which is absent in Model H.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from cosmological first-order phase transitions with precise hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the gravitational wave spectrum generated by sound waves during a cosmological phase transition, incorporating several advancements beyond the current state-of-the-art. Rather than relying on the bag model or similar approximations, we derive the equation of state directly from the effective potential. This approach enables us to accurately determine the hydrodynamic quantities, which serve as initial conditions in a generalised hybrid simulation. This simulation tracks the fluid evolution after bubble collisions, leading to the generation of gravitational waves. Our work is the first self-consistent numerical calculation of gravitational waves for the real singlet extension of the standard model. Our computational method is adaptable to any particle physics model, offering a fast and reliable way to calculate gravitational waves generated by sound waves. With fewer approximations, our approach provides a robust foundation for precise gravitational wave calculations and allows for the exploration of model-independent features of gravitational waves from phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Magnetic vacuum polarization effects in the supercritical QED: spontaneous generation of a stable highly magnetized phase of the vacuum state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous generation of axial vacuum current and corresponding magnetic field with multipole structure, caused by the supercritical Coulomb source with charge $Z$ and size $R$, is explored in essentially non-perturbative approach with emphasis on the vacuum energy $\cal{E}_{VP}$, considered as a function of $R$ with fixed $Z$. The properties of such highly magnetized vacuum phase are studied in detail. It is shown that the arising this way magnetic component of the supercritical vacuum polarization leads to a significant decrease of the total energy of the system, which could provide the formation of a stable extra-heavy nuclear cluster. Numerical calculations proving the latter in case of the specific spherically symmetric Coulomb source with $Z = 828$ are presented.</description>

      <title>Probing Ultralight Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter with XMM Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), originating from the gravitational collapse of large overdensities in the early Universe, emerge as a compelling dark matter (DM) candidate across a broad mass range. Of particular interest are ultra-light PBHs with masses around $10^{14}$ to $10^{17}$ g, which are typically probed by searching their evaporation products. Using the soft X-ray signal measured by the XMM telescopes, we derive constraints on the fraction of PBHs dark matter with masses in the range $10^{15}$-$10^{16}$ g. We find that observations exclude fraction $f&gt;10^{-6}$ at 95\% C.L. for mass $M_{\rm PBH}=10^{15}$ g.</description>

      <title>Charged current neutrino scattering from nucleons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the charged current induced neutrino and antineutrino scattering from the free nucleon target. This study has been performed in the energy range of a few GeV, relevant for the (anti)neutrino oscillation experiments with accelerator and atmospheric neutrinos. For a few GeV neutrino, the contribution to the cross section mainly comes from the quasielastic, the inelastic production of mesons like pion, kaon, eta, and hyperons as well as from the deep inelastic scattering by the weak currents in $\Delta S$=0 and $\Delta S$=1 sectors. The numerical results are presented for the $Q^2$ distribution of the differential cross section for all the aforementioned processes. The effect of the cut on the center of mass energy $W$ has been explicitly discussed.</description>

      <title>Effect of isoscalar and isovector scalar fields on baryon semileptonic decays in nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix elements is very important, because it could be a clue to new physics beyond Standard Theory. This is particular true of $V_{ud}$, because it is the main contribution to the unitary condition of the CKM matrix elements. The level of accuracy for the test of the unitarity involving the element $V_{ud}$ is now of the order of $10^{-4}$. Because the precise data for $V_{ud}$ is usually extracted from super-allowed nuclear $\beta$ decay, it is quite significant to investigate the breaking of SU(3) flavor symmetry on the weak vector coupling constant in nuclear matter. The purpose of this paper is to investigate how the isoscalar scalar ($\sigma$) and the isovector scalar ($\delta$ or $a_0$) mean-fields affect the weak vector and axial-vector coupling constants for semileptonic baryon (neutron, $\Lambda$ or $\Xi^-$) decay in asymmetric nuclear matter. To do so, we use the quark-meson coupling (QMC) model, where nuclear matter consists of nucleons including quark degrees of freedom bound by the self-consistent exchange of scalar and vector mesons. We pay careful attention to the center of mass correction to the quark currents in matter. We then find that, for neutron $\beta$ decay in asymmetric nuclear matter, the defect of the vector coupling constant due to the $\delta$ field can be of the order of $10^{-4}$ at the nuclear saturation density, which is the same amount as the level of the current uncertainty in the measurements. It is also interesting that, in neutron-rich matter, there exists a certain low density at which isospin symmetry is restored, that is, the $u$-$d$ quark mass difference vanishes. We conclude that the effect of the isoscalar scalar and the isovector scalar fields should be considered in baryon semileptonic decays in nuclei.</description>

      <title>Search for monopole-dipole interactions with atom interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light, weakly coupled bosonic particles such as axions can mediate long range monopole-dipole interactions between matter and spins. We propose a new experimental method using atom interferometry to detect such a force on a freely falling atom exerted by the spin of electrons. The intrinsic advantages of atom interferometry, such as the freely falling nature of the atom and the well-defined response of the atom to external magnetic fields, should enable the proposed method to overcome systematic effects induced by vibrations, magnetic fields, and gravity. This approach is most suited to probe forces with a range $\gtrsim$~10~cm. With current technology, our proposed setup could potentially extend probes of such forces by an order of magnitude beyond present laboratory limits.</description>

      <title>The impact of non-perturbative effects in dark matter production and detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter stands out as one of the most important unsolved mysteries in particle physics and cosmology. We investigate the influence of non-perturbative effects on the production of dark matter as well as their impact on direct and indirect detection to attain insight on its fundamental nature. Specifically, we focus on Sommerfeld enhancement and the formation of dark matter bound states both of which can alter the total dark matter annihilation cross section and thus modify dark matter observables in the early and late Universe. To this end, we conducted two studies focusing on different dark matter observables, which are likely to be probed by upcoming experiments.</description>

      <title>Big Bang Nucleosynthesis constraints on resonant DM annihilations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of BBN constraints from photodisintegration for scenarios in which dark-matter annihilations are resonantly-enhanced. To this end, we implement and make available a new class ResonanceModel within an updated version v1.3.0 of ACROPOLIS. While the corresponding implementation is done in a rather model-independent way, we also make available three benchmark models that can be used to calculate constraints for more concrete scenarios. Using this new version of ACROPOLIS, we present for the first time the corresponding constraints on resonantly-enhanced $s$-wave and $p$-wave annihilations. We show that for $s$-wave annihilations the bounds are usually very similar to the ones without a resonance, while for $p$-wave annihilations the bounds can be significantly stronger.
  The updated version v1.3.0 of ACROPOLIS can be found at https://github.com/hep-mh/acropolis .</description>

      <title>Status of the Aligned Two Higgs Doublet Model in the low mass region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) is a simple extension of the Standard Model (SM), which provides a rich and very interesting phenomenology. To remove the undesirable flavour-changing neutral currents (FCNCs), an additional $\mathcal Z_2$ symmetry is usually imposed into the 2HDM. However, FCNCs can be avoided in a much more general way by assuming a similar Yukawa structure for the two scalar doublets. But one can circumvent the issue of FCNCs by assuming similar Yukawa structure for the two scalar doublets too. The model with this intriguing feature is termed the Aligned Two Higgs Doublet Model (A2HDM). The phenomenological constraints on the A2HDM are much weaker than the ones on the usual $\mathcal Z_2$ models, opening a broader range of possible scenarios. Moreover, the A2HDM also provides a generic framework to study, as particular cases, the different varieties of $\mathcal Z_2$-symmetric 2HDMs. Here, we illustrate a global fit of the A2HDM using the package HEPfit. We study the possibility of having new scalar particles lighter than the SM Higgs. For this global fit we perform a Bayesian analysis, including stability and perturbativity bounds, flavour and electroweak precision observables, and scalar (and pseudoscalar) searches at LEP and LHC.</description>

      <title>Kolya: an open-source package for inclusive semileptonic $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the code kolya, an open-source tool for phenomenological analyses of inclusive semileptonic $B$ meson decays. It contains a library to compute predictions for the total rate and various kinematic moments within the framework of the heavy quark expansion, utilizing the so-called kinetic scheme. The library currently includes power corrections up to $1/m_b^5$. All available QCD perturbative corrections are implemented via interpolation grids for fast numerical evaluation. We also include effects from new physics parameterised as Wilson coefficients of dimension-six operators in the weak effective theory below the electroweak scale. The library is interfaced to CRunDec for easy evaluation of the quark masses and strong coupling constant at different renormalization scales. The library is developed in Python and does not require compilation. It can be used in an interactive Jupyter notebook session.</description>

      <title>Radiation by a laser-driven flying-focus electron wave packet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An exact solution of the Dirac equation in the presence of an arbitrary electromagnetic plane wave is found, which corresponds to a focused electron wave packet, with the focus of the wave packet moving at the speed of light in the opposite direction of the average momentum of the electron wave packet (unless the plane wave is so intense to reflect the electron). The photon spectrum emitted by such an electron wave packet in the presence of a linearly-polarized plane wave is studied both analytically and numerically. The spectrum is also compared with the one emitted by a single-momentum, plane-wave electron in the case of the electron being initially counter-propagating (on average for the flying-focus case) with the plane wave and within the locally-constant field approximation. It is found that if the electron flying-focus wave packet is focused beyond a Compton wavelength, the angular distribution of the emitted radiation along the magnetic field of the electromagnetic plane wave is broader than for an electron with definite momentum. Corresponding the maximum value of the photon yield on the transverse plane is smaller in the flying-focus electron case. This could represent an experimental signature of a laser-driven flying-focus electron wave packet.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present phenomenological findings on charm quark transport while including its energy loss in both pre-equilibrium and hydrodynamic stages of the evolution. We employed the MARTINI event generator for the production and evolution of heavy quarks in the relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The sensitivity of the heavy meson nuclear modification factor and flow coefficient to the early stage of heavy-ion collisions and bulk medium evolution is analyzed for Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV. Our study provides insights into the interaction strength of charm quarks during the early phase and within the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have carried out a study of the $\gamma ~ p \rightarrow p K^{+} K^{*-} (K^{*-} \rightarrow K^{-} \pi^{0}) $, $ \gamma ~p \rightarrow p K^{+} K^{*-} ( K^{*-} \rightarrow \bar{K}^{0} \pi^{-} )$ and $ \gamma ~p \rightarrow K^{+} K^{-}p$ reactions, producing the $K^+ \Lambda(1800)$ final state, from the perspective that the $\Lambda(1800)$ resonance is dynamically generated from the interaction of $\bar{K}^* N$ with its coupled vector-baryon channels, in complete analogy to the $\Lambda(1405)$ generated from the interaction of $\bar{K} N$ and its coupled pseudoscalar-baryon channels. The two reactions are complementary and their mass distributions are tied to the particular nature of this resonance in that framework. We provide much information on the shapes and strength of the invariant mass distributions of these reactions, and the energy dependence of the cross sections, that when contrasted with future experiments should shed valuable light on the nature of this resonance and its analogy to the $\Lambda(1405)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how hypothetical new physics influences primordial neutrinos is essential in light of interpreting past and ongoing CMB observations. To reach this goal, we present a novel approach to solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation in the Early Universe. It overcomes the limitations of existing methods by providing a model-independent, computationally efficient, and accurate framework capable of handling complex interactions and non-equilibrium neutrino distributions. We demonstrate its comprehensive applicability through several case studies. In particular, we resolve the existing discrepancy between state-of-the-art approaches regarding the dynamics of the number of ultrarelativistic degrees of freedom in the presence of injections of high-energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ pole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, several LQCD simulations have proven that the interaction in the isoscalar channel in $DD^*$ scattering is attractive. This channel is naturally connected to the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ which is observed in the $D^0D^0\pi^+$ invariant mass distribution. However, it remains an open question whether the virtual bound state found in the several LQCD simulations is actually linked to the LHCb experimental observation. In this article we perform an EFT-based analysis of the LQCD data and demostrate that a proper chiral extrapolation leads to a $T_{cc}$ pole compatible with experiment. At the physical pion mass, we find a virtual bound state with a binding energy $\Delta E=-0.06 \left(^{+1.30}_{-2.20}\right) \left(^{+0.50}_{-1.11}\right)$. Moreover, we extract from a global analysis both, the light and heavy quark mass dependence of the $T_{cc}$ pole, and study the role of the $\rho$ and $\pi$ meson exchanges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore constraints on the parameter space of the alternative left-right model originating from the leptonic sector. We analyse focuses on both lepton-flavour conserving observables, particularly the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, and lepton-flavour-violating processes like $\mu \to e \gamma $ decay and $\mu-e$ conversions in nuclei. While contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment fall below the measured values at 2$\sigma$, current and future experimental sensitivities to flavour-violating branching rations of the Standard Model leptons are expected to impose lower bounds on the mass of the peculiar $SU(2)_R$ gauge boson of the model. This provides complementary constraints relative to existing limits, which are indirect and derived from collider bounds on the mass of the associated neutral gauge boson $Z^\prime$.</description>

      <title>Bayesian forecasting with information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting techniques for assessing the power of future experiments to discriminate between theories or discover new laws of nature are of great interest in many areas of science. In this paper, we introduce a Bayesian forecasting method using information theory. We argue that mutual information is a suitable quantity to study in this context. Besides being Bayesian, this proposal has the advantage of not relying on the choice of fiducial parameters, describing the "true" theory (which is a priori unknown), and is applicable to any probability distribution. We demonstrate that the proposed method can be used for parameter estimation and model selection, both of which are of interest concerning future experiments. We argue that mutual information has plausible interpretation in both situations. In addition, we state a number of propositions that offer information-theoretic meaning to some of the Bayesian practices such as performing multiple experiments, combining different datasets, and marginalization.</description>

      <title>Gauge Loop-String-Hadron Formulation on General Graphs and Applications to Fully Gauge Fixed Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a gauge invariant, Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) based representation of SU(2) Yang-Mills theory defined on a general graph consisting of vertices and half-links. Inspired by weak coupling studies, we apply this technique to maximal tree gauge fixing. This allows us to develop a fully gauge fixed representation of the theory in terms of LSH quantum numbers. We explicitly show how the quantum numbers in this formulation directly relate to the variables in the magnetic description. In doing so, we will also explain in detail the way that the Kogut-Susskind formulation, prepotentials, and point splitting, work for general graphs. In the appendix of this work we provide a self-contained exposition of the mathematical details of Hamiltonian pure gauge theories defined on general graphs.</description>

      <title>Description of the first order phase transition region of an equation of state for QCD with a critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We map the mean-field Ising model equation of state onto the QCD phase diagram, and reconstruct the full coexistence region in the case of a first order phase transition. Beyond the coexistence line, we maintain access to the spinodal region in the phase diagram, thus providing a description of metastable and unstable phases of matter as well. In this way, our approach includes the super-heated hadronic phase and the super-cooled quark-gluon plasma, which are useful for hydrodynamic simulations of the fireball created in a heavy-ion collision at low collision energy, where a first order phase transition is expected. We discuss the features of the pressure and other thermodynamic observables as functions of temperature and baryonic chemical potential, in particular their behavior in the coexistence region. Finally, we compare our equation of state to other 3D-Ising model ones available in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest results of Higgs boson searches beyond the Standard Model from the ATLAS and CMS experiments are reviewed. This includes searches for additional neutral, charged, and double charged Higgs-like bosons, searches for dark matter produced in association with a Higgs boson, and searches for new physics in Higgs boson production and decay processes. Interpretations are given within the hMSSM, a special parameterization of the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model, in which the mass of the lightest Higgs boson is set to the value of 125 GeV measured at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Survival of the Fittest: Testing Superradiance Termination with Simulated Binary Black Hole Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superradiance instability of rotating black holes leads to the formation of an ultralight boson cloud with distinctive observational signatures, making black holes an effective probe of ultralight dark matter. However, around black holes in a binary system, the superradiance effect of such clouds can be terminated by tidal perturbations from the companion, leading to cloud depletion. In this study, we perform the first analysis of the impact of this termination effect on superradiant black hole binaries which are realistically modelled after their statistics in our Galaxy. Working with a dataset of approximately $10^7$ black hole binaries simulated using the Stellar EVolution for N-body (SEVN) population synthesis code, we identify the superradiant candidates and those that manage to survive the termination effect. We then calculate the cloud survival rate for various boson masses and black hole spin models. Our findings reveal that the $l=m=1$ cloud modes are generally stable against termination, whereas the $l=m=2$ modes can be significantly affected, with survival rates dropping below $10\%$ for boson masses below approximately $0.5\times 10^{-12}$ eV. In addition, our analysis indicates that clouds that overcome termination typically exhibit a higher superradiant growth rate and therefore a higher detectability.</description>

      <title>A new approach to handling factorial moment correlations through principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermittency analysis of factorial moments is a promising method used for the detection of power-law scaling in high-energy collision data. In particular, it has been employed in the search of fluctuations characteristic of the critical point (CP) of strongly interacting matter. However, intermittency analysis has been hindered by the fact that factorial moments measurements corresponding to different scales are correlated, since the same data are conventionally used to calculate them. This invalidates many assumptions involved in fitting data sets and determining the best fit values of power-law exponents. We present a novel approach to intermittency analysis, employing the well-established statistical and data science tool of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This technique allows for the proper handling of correlations between scales without the need for subdividing the data sets available.</description>

      <title>MSSM Based Theory for Planck Precision Results (2018), Dark Matter, Dark Energy and Solution of Cosmological Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that precision measurements of cosmological parameters from the Planck Satellite Observatory (2018) can be accurately reproduced by calculating the masses of gauge bosons and their superpartners within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM). Our approach utilizes combined decay product equations from these gauge supermultiplets. These results strongly support the Lambda-CDM cosmological standard model. Moreover, our equations predict the masses of the ordinary nucleon, a proposed anti-supersymmetric nucleon (as a dark matter candidate), and the Higgs boson in agreement with experimental values. Our theory addresses baryon number violation, lepton number violation, and the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. We anticipate that the masses of winos and anti-supersymmetric nucleons will be verified through Higgs boson decay in top-anti-top quark interactions at future high-energy hadron collider experiments.</description>

      <title>Shock breakouts from compact CSM surrounding core-collapse SN progenitors may contribute significantly to the observed $\gtrsim10$ TeV neutrino background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing observational evidence suggests that enhanced mass loss from the progenitors of core-collapse supernovae (SNe) is common during $\sim1$ yr preceding the explosion, creating an optically thick circum-stellar medium (CSM) shell at $\sim10^{14.5}$ cm radii. We show that if such mass loss is indeed common, then the breakout of the SN shock through the dense CSM shell produces a neutrino flux that may account for a significant fraction of the observed $\gtrsim10$ TeV neutrino background. The neutrinos are created within a few days from the explosion, during and shortly after the shock breakout, which produces also large UV (and later X-ray) luminosity. The compact size and large UV luminosity imply a pair production optical depth of $\sim10^4$ for $&gt;100$ GeV photons, naturally accounting for the lack of a high-energy gamma-ray background accompanying the neutrino background. SNe producing $&gt;1$ neutrino event in a 1 km$^2$ detector are expected at a rate of $\lesssim0.1$/yr. A quantitative theory describing the evolution of the electromagnetic spectrum during a breakout, as the radiation-mediated shock is transformed into a collisionless one, is required to enable (i) using data from upcoming surveys that will systematically detect large numbers of young, $&lt;1$ d old SNe, to determine the pre-explosion mass loss history of the SN progenitor population, and (ii) a quantitative determination of the neutrino luminosity and spectrum.</description>

      <title>Origin of Black Hole Spin in Lower-Mass-Gap Black Hole-Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the fourth observing run, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration reported the detection of a coalescing compact binary (GW230529$_{-}$181500) with component masses estimated at $2.5-4.5\, M_\odot$ and $1.2-2.0\, M_\odot$ with 90\% credibility. Given the current constraints on the maximum neutron star (NS) mass, this event is most likely a lower-mass-gap (LMG) black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binary. The spin magnitude of the BH, especially when aligned with the orbital angular momentum, is critical in determining whether the NS is tidally disrupted. An LMG BHNS merger with a rapidly spinning BH is an ideal candidate for producing electromagnetic counterparts. However, no such signals have been detected. In this study, we employ a detailed binary evolution model, incorporating new dynamical tide implementations, to explore the origin of BH spin in an LMG BHNS binary. If the NS forms first, the BH progenitor (He-rich star) must begin in orbit shorter than 0.35 days to spin up efficiently, potentially achieving a spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH} &gt; 0.3$. Alternatively, if a non-spinning BH (e.g., $M_{\rm BH} = 3.6\, M_\odot$) forms first, it can accrete up to $\sim 0.2\, M_\odot$ via Case BA mass transfer (MT), reaching a spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH} \sim 0.18$ under Eddington-limited accretion. With a higher Eddington accretion limit (i.e., 10.0 $\Dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), the BH can attain a significantly higher spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH} \sim\,0.65$ by accreting approximately $1.0\, M_\odot$ during Case BA MT phase.</description>

      <title>Simulating Schwinger model dynamics with quasi-one-dimensional qubit arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time dynamics of the Schwinger model provide an effective description of quark confinement out of equilibrium, routinely employed to model hadronization processes in particle-physics event generators. Ab-initio simulations of such non-perturbative processes are far beyond the reach of existing computational tools, and remain an outstanding open quest for quantum simulators to date. In this work we develop a general strategy to run Schwinger model dynamics on synthetic quantum spin lattices, such as neutral-atom or superconducting-qubit arrays. Our construction encodes the constrained fermionic and bosonic degrees of freedom of the model into the geometric shape of a magnetic interface. We show that global magnetic field patterns can drive coherent quantum dynamics of the interface equivalent to the lattice Schwinger Hamiltonian. We rigorously establish that the optimal array required for simulating real-time wave packet collisions and string fragmentation processes with accuracy $\epsilon$ in the continuum field-theory limit, is a quasi-one-dimensional ribbon with polynomial length and polylogarithmic width in $\epsilon^{-1}$. We finally discuss a concrete advantageous implementation using a state-of-the-art dual-species Rydberg atom array. This work opens up a path for near-term quantum simulators to address questions of immediate relevance to particle physics.</description>

Abstract: An excess of charged versus neutral kaons has been recently reported by the NA61/SHINE collaboration. Similar excesses were also present in previous experiments, even if with larger errors. Models for hadron productions in heavy ion collisions systematically underestimate the measured charge-to-neutral kaon ratio. In this report, we comment on the role of charge-symmetry as a specific isospin transformation. In particular, we show that the ensemble of the initial colliding nuclei being charge-symmetric is sufficient for producing an equal number of charged and neutral kaons in the isospin-symmetry exact limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present suppression results for high-$p_T$ $D$ and $\pi$ mesons produced in $p / d + A$ and $A+A$ collisions at RHIC and LHC. These results are computed using a convolved elastic and radiative energy loss model, which receives small system size corrections to both the elastic and radiative energy loss. We observe that suppression in small systems is almost entirely due to elastic energy loss; furthermore, we find that our model is acutely sensitive to the transition between hard thermal loop and vacuum propagators in the elastic energy loss. Finally, we consider the central limit theorem approximation, which is commonly used to model the elastic energy loss distribution as Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scalar Production At Large Center-Of-Mass Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.07744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum field theory, the probability of producing scalar particles grows factorially as a function of the number of the particles produced. This poses a problem theoretically, in maintaining unitarity, and is counter-intuitive phenomenologically. The factorial growth is a byproduct of the perturbation theory, but has been found in some of the semi-classical and non-perturbative calculations as well. Recently, it has been proposed that the factorial growth might be observable in the future 100 TeV hadron collider. After reviewing some of the past calculations, we analyze the cancelation of IR divergences to find Altarelli-Parisi function and the Sudakov form factor. We then use these to write an equation for the generating function of scalar jet rates. We further argue that we can turn the jet rates into particle cross section by swapping the opening angle with particle mass. We will present our results for $\phi^3$ theory in four and six spacetime dimensions, and $\phi^4$ in four spacetime dimensions. We find that, while the final particles are relativistic, the cross sections do not grow factorially.</description>

      <title>Transitioning from perturbative to non-perturbative splittings within QCD jets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at ultra-relativistic energies can be performed in a controlled environment through lepton-hadron deep inelastic scatterings. In such collisions, the high-energy partonic emissions that follow from the ejected hard partons are accurately described by perturbative QCD. However, the lower energy scales at which quarks and gluons experience colour confinement, i.e. hadronization mechanism, fall outside the validity regions for perturbative calculations, requiring phenomenological models tuned to data to describe it. As such, hadronization physics cannot be currently derived from first principles alone. Monte Carlo event generators are useful tools to describe these processes as they simulate both the perturbative and the non-perturbative interactions, with model-dependent energy scales that control parton dynamics. This work aims to use jets - experimental reconstructions of final-state particles likely to have a common partonic origin - to inspect this transition further. Although originally proposed to circumvent hadronization effects, we show that jets can be utilised as probes of non-perturbative phenomena via their substructure. The charge correlation ratio was recently shown to be sensitive to hadronization effects. Our work further improves this sensitivity to non-perturbative scales by introducing a new selection based on the relative placement of the \textit{resolved SoftDrop splitting} within the clustering tree, defined as the unclustering that resolves the jet's leading charged particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an extension of the Standard Model by three singlet fermions and one singlet real scalar field. The scalar is an ultralight dark matter candidate whose abundance is set by dynamically induced misalignment from the Higgs portal. We focus on parameter space where the Coleman-Weinberg potential both fixes the dark matter relic abundance, and predicts the mass scale of right-handed neutrinos. The model prefers scalar masses in the range of $10 ~{\rm {\mu}eV} \lesssim m_{\phi} \lesssim 10 ~{\rm meV}$, and can be tested via direct searches for a light scalar (e.g. fifth force tests), or by searching for right-handed neutrinos in laboratory experiments.</description>

Abstract: The current upper limit on $N_{\rm eff}$ at the time of CMB by Planck 2018 can place stringent constraints in the parameter space of BSM paradigms where their additional interactions may affect neutrino decoupling. Motivated by this fact in this paper we explore the consequences of light gauge boson ($Z'$) emerging from local $U(1)_X$ symmetry in $N_{\rm eff}$ at the time of CMB. First, we analyze the generic $U(1)_X$ models with arbitrary charge assignments for the SM fermions and show that, in the context of $N_{\rm eff}$ the generic $U(1)_X$ gauged models can be broadly classified into two categories, depending on the charge assignments of first generation leptons. We then perform a detailed analysis with two specific $U(1)_X$ models: $U(1)_{B_3-3L_e}$ and $U(1)_{B_3-3L_\mu}$ and explore the contribution in $N_{\rm eff}$ due to the presence of $Z'$ realized in those models. For comparison, we also showcase the constraints from low energy experiments like: Borexino, Xenon 1T, neutrino trident, etc. We show that in a specific parameter space, particularly in the low mass region of $Z'$, the bound from $N_{\rm eff}$ (Planck 2018) is more stringent than the experimental constraints. Additionally, a part of the regions of the same parameter space may also relax the $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy tetraquark states in a mass splitting model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Treating the $X(4140)$ as a compact $J^{PC}=1^{++}$ $cs\bar{c}\bar{s}$ state and using its mass as a reference scale, we systematically estimate the masses of doubly heavy tetraquark states $QQ\bar{q}\bar{q}$ where $Q=c,b$ and $q=u,d,s$. Their decay properties are studied with a simple rearrangement scheme. Based on our results, the lowest $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ $bb\bar{n}\bar{n}$ state is a stable tetraquark about 20 MeV below the $\bar{B}^*\bar{B}$ threshold. The mass and width of the low-mass $0(1^+)$ $cc\bar{n}\bar{n}$ ($n=u,d$) tetraquark are compatible with the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ observed by the LHCb Collaboration. The location of the lowest $0(0^+)$ and $0(1^+)$ $bc\bar{n}\bar{n}$ states are found to be close to the $\bar{B}D$ and $\bar{B}^*D$ thresholds, respectively. We hope that the predicted ratios between partial widths of different channels may be helpful to identify compact tetraquark states from future measurements.</description>

      <title>Impact of non-thermal phase-space distributions on dark matter abundance in secluded sectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many new physics models include secluded sectors that interact little with the Standard Model and whose internal interactions control the dark matter abundance. If these same interactions are responsible for maintaining kinematic equilibrium within the secluded sector, it is possible that the phase-space distributions will differ considerably from their thermal values during freeze-out. This can potentially result in deviations of the dark matter abundance from that computed under the assumption of thermal distributions. In this paper, we revisit dark matter abundance computations for a benchmark secluded sector by numerically tracking the phase-space distributions. Namely, we show that the dark matter abundance can deviate considerably from standard results during the freeze-out process, but that a longer period of annihilation ultimately leaves only a slight excess.</description>

      <title>Upper Limits on the Cosmic Neutrino Background from Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00985v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extragalactic and galactic cosmic rays scatter with the cosmic neutrino background during propagation to Earth, yielding a flux of relic neutrinos boosted to larger energies. If an overdensity of relic neutrinos is present in galaxies, and neutrinos are massive enough, this flux might be detectable by high-energy neutrino experiments. For a lightest neutrino of mass $m_{\nu} \sim 0.1$ eV, we find an upper limit on the local relic neutrino overdensity of $\sim 10^{13}$ and an upper limit on the relic neutrino overdensity at TXS 0506+056 of $\sim 10^{10}$. Future experiments like GRAND or IceCube-Gen2 could improve these bounds by orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Systematic local simulations of fast neutrino flavor conversions with scattering effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of fast neutrino flavor conversions (FFCs) in the one-dimensional (1D) and zero-dimensional (0D) models, in which spatial advection is considered and ignored, respectively. In this study, we employ snapshots obtained by our self-consistent, realistic Boltzmann-neutrino-radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. We show that the FFC growth rate is considerably larger in the 1D model than in the 0D model, as expected from the previous linear analysis results. We find that the momentum space dimension does not significantly influence the neutrino transition probability in 1D models. On the other hand, in the 0D model without collisions, the FFC depends on the momentum space, and the azimuthal angle dependence breaks the periodicity of the FFC. Our study demonstrates that collisional instability can lead to further flavor conversions on a long time scale in 1D models after the asymptotic state of FFC has been reached. Such an effect should be taken into consideration when the fast and collisional flavor instabilities coexist.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Variation of Physical Constants, Equivalence Principle Violation, and a Fifth Force from Atomic Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to derive limits on various forms of ``new physics'' using atomic experimental data. Interactions with dark energy and dark matter fields can lead to space-time variations of fundamental constants, which can be detected through atomic spectroscopy. In this study, we examine the effects of a varying nuclear mass $m_{N}$ and nuclear radius $r_{N}$ on two transition ratios: the comparison of the two-photon transition in atomic hydrogen with the hyperfine transition in $^{133}$Cs based clocks, and the ratio of optical clock frequencies in in Al$^{+}$ and Hg$^{+}$. The sensitivity of these frequency ratios to changes in $m_{N}$ and $r_{N}$ enables us to derive new limits on the variations of the proton mass, quark mass, and the QCD parameter $\theta$. Additionally, we consider the scalar field generated by the Yukawa-type interaction of feebly interacting hypothetical scalar particles with Standard Model particles in the presence of massive bodies such as the Sun and Moon. Using the data from the Al$^{+}$/Hg$^{+}$, Yb$^{+}$/Cs and Yb$^{+}$(E2)/Yb$^{+}$(E3) transition frequency ratios, we place constraints on the interaction of the scalar field with photons, nucleons, and electrons for a range of scalar particle masses. We also investigate limits on the Einstein Equivalence Principle (EEP) violating term ($c_{00}$) in the Standard Model Extension (SME) Lagrangian and the dependence of fundamental constants on gravity.</description>

      <title>Detecting a Fifth-Force Gauge Boson via Superconducting Josephson Junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new fifth force between particles carrying $B-L$ charges is well-motivated by the intriguing $U(1)_{B-L}$ extension of the standard model. The gauge boson mediator, F\'eeton, also serves as a dark matter candidate. In this letter, we propose a novel experimental design to detect the quantum phase difference caused by this fifth force using a superconducting Josephson junction. We find that the experiment has the best sensitivity to the gauge coupling when the gauge boson is within the mass range of $0.01\,$eV to $10\,$eV, which is an interesting mass region for the F\'eeton dark matter. This opens up a new avenue for the measurement of new physics at small scale below millimeter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High energy beams incident on a fixed target may scatter against atomic electrons. To a first approximation, one can treat these electrons as at rest. For precision experiments, however, it is important to be able to estimate the size of, and when necessary calculate, sub-leading corrections. We discuss atomic binding corrections to relativistic lepton-electron scattering. We analyze hydrogen in detail, before generalizing our analysis to multi-electron atoms. Using the virial theorem, and many-body sum rules, we find that the corrections can be reduced to measured binding energies, and the expectation value of a single one-body operator. We comment on the phenomenological impact for neutrino flux normalization and an extraction of hadronic vacuum polarization from elastic muon electron scattering at MUonE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04826v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ascribed as $\rho\rho$ and $K^* \bar{K}^*$ molecular states, respectively, iso-scalar $f_0(1500)$ and $f_0(1710)$ states are expected to have iso-vector partners, potentially identified as $a_0(1450)$ and $a_0(1710)$. The predicted dominant decay modes for these two $a_0$ resonances are $a_0(1450) \to \omega\pi\pi$ and $a_0(1710) \to \omega\pi\pi,\,\phi\pi\pi$. We estimate cross sections for two-photon production of these four resonances within the hadronic molecular picture, and demonstrate that SuperKEKB's luminosity is sufficient for their observation and more precise parameter measurements.</description>

      <title>The $N_{\rm eff}$ at CMB challenges $U(1)_X$ light gauge boson scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The relativistic degrees of freedom ($N_{\rm eff}$) is one of the crucial cosmological parameters. The precise measurement of $N_{\rm eff}$ at the time of cosmic microwave background formation, by Planck 2018 can be used to understand the new fundamental interactions, in particular involving light mediators. Presence of any new particle with sufficient energy density and sizeable interactions with Standard Model particles at the temperature around $\sim$ MeV can significantly alter the neutrino decoupling and hence $N_{\rm eff}$. Thus the bound on $N_{\rm eff}$ can place stringent constraints on various beyond Standard Model paradigms involving light particles. $U(1)_X$ models are among such scenarios and are widely studied in several aspects. In this work, we consider several popular $U(1)_X$ models with light $Z'$ boson like $U(1)_{B-L}$, $U(1)_{B - 3L_i}$, $U(1)_{B_i - 3 L_j}$, $U(1)_{L_i - L_j}$; $i,j =1,2,3$ being the flavour indices and study their impact on $N_{\rm eff}$. We also examine the constraints from ground based experiments like Xenon1T, Borexino, trident, etc. Our analysis shows that for light mass $M_{Z'} \lesssim \mathcal{O} (\rm{MeV})$ the $N_{\rm eff}$ provides the most stringent constraints on the $Z'$ mass and coupling, far exceeding the existing constraints from other experiments.</description>

      <title>Chiral-odd GPDs in the bag model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11563v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A study of chiral-odd generalized parton distributions (GPDs) of the nucleon is presented in the bag model demonstrating that in this model all four chiral-odd GPDs are non-zero contrary to other claims in literature. The bag model results for the GPDs $H_T^q(x,\xi,t)$, $E_T^q(x,\xi,t)$, $\tilde{H}_T^q(x,\xi,t)$ agree with other models within a typical quark model accuracy. We present one of the few quark model calculations where polynomiality is satisfied and the sum rule $\int dx\,\tilde{E}_T^q(x,\xi,t)=0$ holds. We confront our results with predictions from the large-$N_c$ limit, and with lattice QCD calculations. We conclude that the bag model successfully catches the main features of chiral-odd GPDs.</description>

      <title>EW one-loop corrections to the longitudinally polarized Drell-Yan process. Charged-current case II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12692v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complete one-loop electroweak radiative corrections to the charged-current Drell-Yan processes $pp \to \ell^{+}\nu_{\ell}(+X)$ and $pp \to \ell^{-}\bar{\nu}_{\ell}(+X)$ are presented for the case of longitudinal polarization of initial particles. The results can be used to obtain precise predictions for the kinematic distributions of polarized $W^{\pm}$ production cross sections, and single- and double-spin asymmetries. Numerical results are obtained using the Monte-Carlo generator {\tt ReneSANCe}. This research contributes to a global next-to-leading order analysis of polarized parton distributions in proton-proton collisions at RHIC. We proved that the impact of the one-loop electroweak radiative corrections to single- and double-spin asymmetries is negligible.</description>

      <title>Analysis of experimental data on neutron decay for the possibility of the existence of right vector boson $W_R$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03440v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analysis of the latest most accurate experimental data on neutron decay for the possibility of the existence of a right vector boson $W_R$ was carried out. As a result of the analysis, it was found that there is an indication of the existence of a right vector boson $W_R$ with a mass of $M_{W_R}\approx 304_{-22}^{+28} \text{GeV}$ and a mixing angle with $W_L: \zeta= -0.038\pm0.014$. This result should be considered, on the one hand, as a challenge to experimental physics at colliders, where the upper limit on the mass of the right vector boson $W_R$ is significantly higher, and on the other hand, it indicates the need for even more accurate measurements of neutron decay and its theoretical analysis. Possible consequences are considered, assuming that the result can be confirmed. First, an extension of the Standard Model by introducing right vector bosons $W_R^{\pm},Z_R$ and right neutrinos would be required. Second, right neutrinos can be considered as candidates for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino fast flavor evolution. I. Linear response theory and stability conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino-neutrino refraction leads to collective flavor evolution that can include fast flavor conversion, an ingredient still missing in numerical simulations of core-collapse supernovae. We provide a theoretical framework for the linear regime of this phenomenon using the language of response theory. In analogy to electromagnetic waves, we introduce a flavor susceptibility as the linear response to an external flavor field. By requiring self-consistency, this approach leads to the usual dispersion relation for growing modes, but differs from the traditional treatment in that it predicts Landau damping of subluminal collective modes. The new dispersion relation has definite analyticity properties and can be expanded for small growth rates. This approach simplifies and intuitively explains Morinaga's proof of sufficiency for the occurrence of growing modes. We show that weakly growing modes arise as soon as an angular crossing is formed, due to their resonant interaction with individual neutrino modes. For longitudinal plasma waves, a similar resonance causes Landau damping or conversely, the two-stream instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute three-loop corrections of $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{s}^3)$ to form factors with one massive and one massless quark coupling to an external vector, axialvector, scalar, pseudoscalar, or tensor current. We obtain analytic results for the color-planar contributions, for the contributions of light-quark loops, and the contributions with two heavy-quark loops. For the computation of the remaining master integrals we use the "expand and match" approach which leads to semi-analytic results for the form factors. We implement our results in a {\tt Mathematica} and a {\tt Fortran} code which allows for fast and precise numerical evaluations in the physically relevant phase space. The form factors are used to compute the hard matching coefficients in Soft-Collinear Effective Theory for all currents. The tensor coefficients at light-like momentum transfer are used to extract the hard function in $\bar B \to X_s \gamma$ to three loops.</description>

      <title>Dark matter-electron scattering and freeze-in scenarios in the light of $Z^\prime$ mediation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate dark matter (DM)-electron scattering in a minimal $U(1)_X$ extension of the Standard Model (SM), where the DM can appear as a Majorana fermion, a complex singlet scalar or a Dirac fermion. To study bounds on the $U(1)_X$ gauge coupling $(g_X)$ and new gauge boson mass $(M_{Z^\prime})$, from DM-electron scattering, we consider several direct search experiments like CDMS, DAMIC, SENSEI, PandaX-II, DarkSide-50 and XENON1T-S2 for different $U(1)_X$ charges. In this set-up we consider DM production via freeze-in both in radiation dominated and modified cosmological background to project sensitivities on $g_X-M_{Z^\prime}$ plane satisfying observed relic abundance. DM-electron scattering could provide comparable, or even stronger bounds than those obtained from the electron/ muon $(g-2)$, low energy scattering and intensity frontier experiments within 0.01 GeV $\lesssim M_{Z^\prime} \lesssim$ 0.1 GeV. Constrains from freeze-in could provide stronger sensitivities for $M_{Z^\prime}\gtrsim \mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV, however, these limits are comparable to those obtained from LHCb, LEP experiments for $\mathcal{O}(10)$ GeV $\lesssim M_{Z^\prime} \lesssim 150$ GeV. In future, electron-muon scattering (MUonE), proton (FASER, DUNE) and electron/positron (ILC) beam dump experiments could probe these parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the extreme large magnetic field produced in the initial stage of non-central heavy-ion collision, the dynamical process of gluon decay into heavy quark pair will take place under an external field rather than in vacuum. Unlike in the vacuum case, where the process is forbidden by energy momentum conservation, under the external field, a process emerges considering the background energy which recovers the conservation. We calculate the gluon decay rate at leading order under a uniform magnetic field.</description>

Abstract: We propose a hybrid inflationary scenario based on eight-flavor hidden QCD with the hidden colored fermions being in part gauged under $U(1)_{B-L}$. This hidden QCD is almost scale-invariant, so-called walking, and predicts the light scalar meson (the walking dilaton) associated with the spontaneous scale breaking, which develops the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) type potential as the consequence of the nonperturbative scale anomaly, hence plays the role of an inflaton of the small-field inflation. The $U(1)_{B-L}$ Higgs is coupled to the walking dilaton inflaton, which is dynamically induced from the so-called bosonic seesaw mechanism. We explore the hybrid inflation system involving the walking dilaton inflaton and the $U(1)_{B-L}$ Higgs as a waterfall field. We find that observed inflation parameters tightly constrain the $U(1)_{B-L}$ breaking scale as well as the walking dynamical scale to be $\sim 10^9$ GeV and $\sim 10^{14}$ GeV, respectively, so as to make the waterfall mechanism worked. The lightest walking pion mass is then predicted to be around 500 GeV. Phenomenological perspectives including embedding of the dynamical electroweak scalegenesis and possible impacts on the thermal leptogenesis are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Do neutrinos bend? Consequences of an ultralight gauge field as dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ultralight gauge boson could address the missing cosmic dark matter, with its transverse modes contributing to a relevant component of the galactic halo today. We show that, in the presence of a coupling between the gauge boson and neutrinos, these transverse modes affect the propagation of neutrinos in the galactic core. Neutrinos emitted from galactic or extra-galactic supernovae could be delayed by $\delta t = \left(10^{-8}-10^1\right)\,$s for the gauge boson masses $m_{A'} = \left(10^{-23}-10^{-19}\right)\,$eV and the coupling with the neutrino $g= 10^{-27}-10^{-20}$. While we do not focus on a specific formation mechanism for the gauge boson as the dark matter in the early Universe, we comment on some possible realizations. We discuss model-dependent current bounds on the gauge coupling from fifth-force experiments, as well as future explorations involving supernovae neutrinos. We consider the concrete case of the DUNE facility, where the coupling can be tested down to $g \simeq 10^{-27}$ for neutrinos coming from a supernova event at a distance $d = 10\,$kpc from Earth.</description>

      <title>Predictions for $h_c$ and $h_b$ production at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The production cross sections of $h_c$ and $h_b$, the ${}^1P_1$ quarkonia can be predicted in Non-Relativistic Quantum Chromodynamics (NRQCD) using heavy quark symmetry. Our study includes predictions for both the integrated cross-section and the transverse momentum ($p_T$) distribution of $h_c$ ($h_b$) production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), using the decay process $h_c (h_b) \rightarrow \eta_c (\eta_b) + \gamma$, $\eta_c (\eta_b) \rightarrow p \overline{p}$. We demonstrate substaintial discrepancies in integrated cross-section and the $p_T$ distribution of ${}^1P_1$ quarkonia production at the LHC using Colour-Singlet Model (CSM), NRQCD and modified NRQCD. Measuring these resonances at the LHC could discriminate between these models, thereby offering further insights into the dynamics of quarkonium production. In addition, we compare the recent LHCb data for the integrated cross-section of $h_c$ production at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV in the kinematic range 5.0 $&lt;$ $p_T$ $&lt;$ 20.0 GeV and 2.0 $&lt;$ $y$ $&lt;$ 4.0 with the theoretical predictions using NRQCD and modified NRQCD. Modified NRQCD gives an agreement with the recent LHCb experimental data.</description>

      <title>Undulators are ALP Factories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) are known to be produced through axion-photon conversion in the presence of a stationary external magnetic field. Devices such as undulators and wigglers, which are used widely for photon production, e.g., in synchrotron radiation facilities, inherently possess strong magnetic fields, making them potential sources for ALP production. In this paper, we establish formalisms and formulas for studying ALP production in the ALP-photon-charged current system based on quantum field theory. We demonstrate that ALP production is inevitable in any undulator with the standard designs due to the electron Coulomb potential as well as a resonance effect depending on the ALP mass. In particular, ALPs are predominantly produced in a direction slightly misaligned with the photons' main direction. We propose placing detectors in the desired directions during operations of the originally planned experiments as an efficient approach to simultaneously probing ALPs. The calculation methods and formulas developed in this study are applicable to ALP production from other environments and productions of other particles beyond the standard model relevant to synchrotron radiations.</description>

Abstract: We have derived the Wigner equations at global equilibrium with constant vorticity but space-time dependent electromagnetic fields up to second order in semiclassical expansion. We obtain the new second-order contributions to the charge currents and energy-momentum tensor from the varying electromagnetic fields. We also compute the new corrections to the spin polarization pesudo-vector from both contant and varying electromagnetic fields. We also find that the space-time dependent electromagnetic field provides a tighter constraint on the solutions of Wigner functions in global equilibrium compared with constant electromagnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positronium spectrum and lifetimes are known with a high precision. The situation is different for positronium moving across a magnetic field. The total momentum does not commute with the Hamiltonian and is replaced by conserved pseudomomentum. The internal dynamics is not separated from the motion of the system as a whole. The Coulomb potential well is distorted and a wide outer potential well is created. We analytically determine the energy spectrum for a broad range of the magnetic field and pseudomomentum values. We locate the region of these parameters for which the ground state resides in the outer well. The results may play a role in the suppression of pulsars radio emission (polar cap problem).</description>

      <title>Searches for long-lived dark photons at proton accelerator experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A systematic and unified study of the ability of lifetime frontier experiments to explore the parameter space of hypothetical long-lived particles is one of the main steps in defining their parameter space. Such an analysis has not been conducted for dark photons -- hypothetical massive particles that have kinetic mixing with Standard Model photons. Existing studies have varied in their assumptions about dark photon phenomenology, often using outdated models that do not reflect recent advancements. In this paper, we present a unified calculation of the parameter space for GeV-scale dark photons probed by lifetime frontier experiments, delineating the regions excluded by past experiments and those accessible to future experiments. Our approach incorporates the latest advances in studying dark photon production mechanisms, including proton bremsstrahlung and mixing with neutral mesons, and utilizes the full palette of hadronic decays. Additionally, we explore the impact of uncertainties in proton bremsstrahlung on the dark photon parameter space, and find that they may severely affect the reach of many past and future experiments, including the maximal probed mass. The results are provided in a publicly accessible format, specifically through the implementation of the updated phenomenological models in \texttt{SensCalc} - a unified tool for calculating event rates of new physics particles at lifetime frontier experiments, that has been supplemented by the module \texttt{EventCalc} that samples events similar to traditional Monte Carlo generators.</description>

Abstract: A symmetry preserving treatment of a vector $\otimes$ vector contact interaction (SCI) is used as the basis for calculations of the two pion transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs); namely, that for unpolarised valence degrees-of-freedom and the analogous Boer-Mulders (BM) function. Amongst other things, the analysis enables the following themes to be addressed: the quark current mass dependence of pion TMDs; the impact of the gauge link model on the positivity constraint that bounds the BM function relative to the unpolarised TMD; the equivalence of direct diagrammatic and light-front wave function TMD calculations; and the size of the BM shift. Interpreted astutely, these SCI results enable one to draw insightful pictures of pion TMDs.</description>

      <title>Consequences of Minimal Entanglement in Bosonic Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a recently discovered connection between scattering that minimally entangles and emergent symmetries. In a perturbative expansion, we have generalized the constraints of minimal entanglement scattering, beyond qubits, to general qudits of dimension $d.$ Interestingly, projecting on any qubit subspaces, the constraints factorize, so that it is consistent to analyze minimal entanglement by looking at all such subspaces. We start by looking at toy models with two scalar fields, finding that minimal entanglement only allows quartic couplings which have instabilities at large field values and no symmetries. For the two Higgs doublet model, by considering $H^+ H^-\to H^+ H^-$ scattering, we show that minimal entanglement in this channel does not allow an interacting parameter point with enhanced symmetries. These results show that the connection between minimal entanglement and symmetries depends strongly on the scattering channels analyzed and we speculate on the potential resolutions.</description>

Abstract: Compact stellar objects like supernovae and neutron stars cool by the emission of light particles like neutrinos and axions from their very dense interiors. In this article, we study in detail the photo-production of axions and neutrinos. We point out that this channel is an unavoidable consequence of the existence of the anomaly-induced Wess-Zumino-Witten term and compute the relevant cooling rates. We then perform a complementary data-driven study where the rate of photo-production can be estimated from low-energy pion photo-production data. We however conclude that the cooling rates induced by the photo-production of axions and neutrinos are typically sub-dominant with respect to the main channels usually included.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study classical lattice simulations of theories of electrodynamics coupled to charged matter at finite temperature, interpreting them using the higher-form symmetry formulation of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We compute transport coefficients using classical Kubo formulas on the lattice and show that the properties of the simulated plasma are in complete agreement with the predictions from effective field theories. In particular, the higher-form formulation allows us to understand from hydrodynamic considerations the relaxation rate of axial charge in the chiral plasma observed in previous simulations. A key point is that the resistivity of the plasma -- defined in terms of Kubo formulas for the electric field in the 1-form formulation of MHD -- remains a well-defined and predictive quantity at strong electromagnetic coupling. However, the Kubo formulas used to define the conventional conductivity vanish at low frequencies due to electrodynamic fluctuations, and thus the concept of the conductivity of a gauged electric current must be interpreted with care.</description>

Abstract: The percolation study offers valuable insights into the characteristics of phase transition, shedding light on the underlying mechanisms that govern the formation of global connectivity within the system. We explore the percolation phase transition in the 3D cubic Ising model by employing two machine learning techniques. Our results demonstrate the capability of machine learning methods in distinguishing different phases during the percolation transition. Through the finite-size scaling analysis on the output of the neural networks, the percolation temperature and a correlation length exponent in the geometrical percolation transition are extracted and compared to those in the thermal magnetization phase transition within the 3D Ising model. These findings provide a valuable way essential for enhancing our understanding of the property of the QCD critical point, which belongs to the same universality class as the 3D Ising model.</description>

      <title>Universal relations for anisotropic interacting quark stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12519v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interacting quark stars, which are entirely composed of interacting quark matter including perturbative QCD corrections and color superconductivity, can meet constraints from various pulsar observations. In realistic scenarios, pressure anisotropies are expected in the star's interior. Recently, the stellar structural properties of anisotropic interacting quark stars have been investigated. In this study, we further explore the universal relations (URs) related to the moment of inertia $I$, tidal deformability $\Lambda$, compactness $C$, and the $f$-mode nonradial pulsation frequency for such stars. Our results reveal that these approximate URs generally hold, being insensitive to both the EOS variations as well as to the presence of anisotropy. In contrast to previous studies on anisotropic neutron stars, we find that more positive anisotropy tends to enhance the $I-\Lambda$ and $I-C$ URs, but weakens the $C-\Lambda$ UR. For all the URs involving $f$-mode frequency, we find that they are enhanced by the inclusion of anisotropy (whether positive or negative). Utilizing these URs and the tidal deformability constraint from the GW170817 event, we put limits on the structural properties of isotropic and anisotropic quark stars, such as the moment of inertia $I_{1.4}$, the canonical radius $R_{1.4}$ and the canonical $f$-mode frequency $f_{f,1.4}$, all of which are very different compared to those of neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exploit the complete complementarity relations (CCR) to fully characterize various aspects of quantumness in QED scattering processes at tree level. As a paradigmatic example, we consider Bhabha scattering in two different configurations: in the first case, the initial state is factorized in the spin and we study the generation of entanglement due to the scattering. Then we consider the most general case in which the initial state can be entangled: we find that the scattering generates and distributes quantum information in a non-trivial way among the spin degrees of freedom of the particles, with CCR relations being preserved. An important outcome of our analysis is that maximal entanglement is conserved in the scattering process involving only fermions as input and output states, with a more complex situation if photons are present.</description>

Abstract: We propose a candidate Compton amplitude which is valid for any (integer) quantum spin and free from any spurious poles. We consider the cases of electromagnetism and gravity. We obtain such amplitudes by calculating the corresponding ones from superstring theory involving states on the leading Regge trajectory. To extract the associated field-theory amplitudes a few considerations in the form of simple physical constraints are required, such as: Soft momentum transfer, compactification of polarizations and consistent factorization in the physical channels. We believe the present exploration will be significantly relevant for the physics of compact binary systems with spin.</description>

Abstract: A novel theory was proposed earlier to model systems with thermal gradients, based on the postulate that the spatial and temporal variation in temperature can be recast as a variation in the metric. Combining the variation in the metric due to the thermal variations and gravity, leads to the concept of thermal gravity in a 5-D space-time-temperature setting. When the 5-D Einstein field equations are projected to a 4-D space, they result in additional terms in the field equations. This may lead to unique phenomena such as the spontaneous symmetry breaking of scalar particles in the presence of a strong gravitational field. This theory, originally conceived in a quantum mechanical framework, is now adapted to explain the galaxy rotation curves. A galaxy is not in a state of thermal equilibrium. A parameter called the "degree of thermalization" is introduced to model partially thermalized systems. The generalization of thermal gravity to partially thermalized systems, leads to the theory of many-body gravity. The theory of many-body gravity is now shown to be able to explain the rotation curves of the Milky Way and the M31 (Andromeda) galaxies, to a fair extent. The radial acceleration relation (RAR) for 63 galaxies, with their galactic masses spanning three orders of magnitude, has been replicated. Finally, the wide binary star (WBS) system is touched upon.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter Particles from Evaporating Primordial Black Holes via Electron Scattering in the CDEX-10 Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) is a major constituent of the Universe. However, no definite evidence of DM particles (denoted as ``$\chi$") has been found in DM direct detection (DD) experiments to date. There is a novel concept of detecting $\chi$ from evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs). We search for $\chi$ emitted from PBHs by investigating their interaction with target electrons. The examined PBH masses range from 1$\times$10$^{15}$ to 7$\times$10$^{16}$ g under the current limits of PBH abundance $f_{PBH}$. Using 205.4 kg$\cdot$day data obtained from the CDEX-10 experiment conducted in the China Jinping Underground Laboratory, we exclude the $\chi$--electron ($\chi$--$e$) elastic-scattering cross section $\sigma_{\chi e} \sim 5\times10^{-29}$ cm$^2$ for $\chi$ with a mass $m_{\chi}\lesssim$ 0.1 keV from our results. With the higher radiation background but lower energy threshold (160 eV), CDEX-10 fill a part of the gap in the previous work. If ($m_{\chi}$, $\sigma_{\chi e}$) can be determined in the future, DD experiments are expected to impose strong constraints on $f_{PBH}$ for large $M_{PBH}$s.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from low-scale cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmic strings are a common prediction in many grand unified theories and a promising source of stochastic gravitational waves (GWs) from the early Universe. In this paper, we point out that the GW signal from cosmic strings produced at a comparatively low energy scale, $v \lesssim 10^9 \textrm{GeV}$, exhibits several novel features that are not present in the case of high-scale cosmic strings. Our findings notably include (i) a sharp cutoff frequency $f_{\rm cut}$ in the GW spectrum from the fundamental oscillation mode on closed string loops and (ii) an oscillating pattern in the total GW spectrum from all oscillation modes whose local minima are located at integer multiples of $f_{\rm cut}$. These features reflect the fact that string loops produced in the early Universe fail to shrink to zero size because of GW emission within the age of the Universe, if their tension is low enough. In addition, they offer an exciting opportunity to directly probe the discrete spectrum of oscillation modes on closed string loops in GW observations. For strings produced at a scale $v \sim 10^9\textrm{GeV}$, the novel features in the GW spectrum are within the sensitivity reach of future experiments such as BBO and DECIGO.</description>

      <title>The Hanbury-Brown and Twiss effect in inflationary cosmological perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The simplest model of inflation is based around an inflaton field that starts in a coherent false vacuum state with a positive cosmological constant, rolls slowly to the true vacuum and relaxes to it via reheating. We examine whether the scale of the transition from coherence to chaoticity can be examined via the Hanbury-Brown and Twiss (HBT) effect, in parallel with analogous problems of heavy ion physics (the ``pion laser'' and the thermalizing glasma).
  We develop an ansatz which contains a definition of ''chaoticity'' which parallels that of the usual setups where HBT is used.
  However, we also discuss the differences between the inflationary setup and more mainstream uses of HBT and conclude that these are more significant than the similarities, making the use of the developed methodology uncertain.</description>

      <title>Covariant quantum field theory of tachyons is unphysical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14225v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tachyons have fascinated generations of physicists due to their peculiar behavior, but they did not solve any real physical problem. This changed with the recent work of Dragan and Ekert, who have shown that superluminal observers may be related to the foundations of quantum mechanics (QM), since they require introducing non-determinism and wave-like behavior at the fundamental level. In fact, both classical and quantum field theory of tachyons have been constructed. Unfortunately, we will show that the latter theory contains several flaws, mostly caused by adapting incorrect results due to other authors, which puts the aforementioned program in question. In particular, unlike Feinberg, we show that tachyon microcausality violation spoils fundamental features of QFT such as statistical independence of distant measurements, and it negatively affects constructing Lorentz invariant scattering theory of tachyons. Moreover, the Feynman propagator, which was adapted from Dhar and Sudarshan, is shown to violate unitarity, the tachyonic vacuum is unstable due to radiatively generated tachyon self-interactions, and an interpolating tachyon field likely does not satisfy the LSZ asymptotic condition. Our analysis indicates that a covariant QFT of tachyons seems impossible, hence superluminal observers are unphysical and cannot be used to derive QM.</description>

      <title>Combining pre- and post-recombination new physics to address cosmological tensions: case study with varying electron mass and sign-switching cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that the Hubble tension may call for a combination of both pre- and post-recombination new physics. Motivated by these considerations, we provide one of the first concrete case studies aimed at constructing such a viable combination. We consider models that have individually worked best on either end of recombination so far: a spatially uniform time-varying electron mass leading to earlier recombination (also adding non-zero spatial curvature), and a sign-switching cosmological constant inducing an AdS-to-dS transition within the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model. When confronted against Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations, and Type Ia Supernovae data, we show that no combination of these ingredients can successfully solve the Hubble tension. We find that the matter density parameter $\Omega_m$ plays a critical role, driving important physical scales in opposite directions: the AdS-to-dS transition requires a larger $\Omega_m$ to maintain the CMB acoustic scale fixed, whereas the varying electron mass requires a smaller $\Omega_m$ to maintain the redshift of matter-radiation equality fixed. Despite the overall failure, we use our results to draw general model-building lessons, highlighting the importance of assessing tension-solving directions in the parameter space of new physics parameters and how these correlate with shifts in other standard parameters, while underscoring the crucial role of $\Omega_m$ in this sense.</description>

Abstract: We calculate quantum corrections to the symmetry generators for the transversity operators in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in the two-loop approximation. Using this result, we obtain the evolution kernel for the corresponding operators at three loops. The explicit expression for the anomalous dimension matrix in the Gegenbauer basis is given for the first few operators.</description>

      <title>Fermion Masses and Mixings in String Theory with Dirac Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analyzing the supersymmetric Pati-Salam landscape on a $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)$ orientifold in IIA string theory, we have found only two models that accurately account for all standard model fermion masses and mixings. The models are dual to each other under the exchange of two SU(2) sectors and feature 12 adjoint scalars, the maximum number allowed in the landscape, whose linear combination yields the two light Higgs eigenstates. Dirac neutrino-masses in normal ordering $(50.4,~10.5,~6.1)~\mathrm{meV}$ satisfying the swampland constraints are predicted, a testable prospect for string phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Nonexponential decay law of the 2P-1S transition of the H-atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We evaluate numerically the survival probability $P(t)$ for the unstable 2P excited state of the hydrogen atom, which decays into the ground-state 1S emitting one photon ($\tau \sim 1.595$ ns), thus extending the analytic study of Facchi and Pascazio, Physics Letters A 241 (1998). To this end, we first determine the analytic expression of the spectral function of the unstable state, which allows for an accurate evaluation of $P(t)$. As expected, for short and long times $P(t)$ shows deviations from the exponential law: a `Zeno' region occurs at extremely short times (up to $\sim 0.3$ attosec, followed by a longer `anti-Zeno' domain (up to $\sim 50$ attosec); at long times above $125 \tau$, the decay law scales as $t^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>How new physics affects primordial neutrinos decoupling: Direct Simulation Monte Carlo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological observations from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) offer crucial insights into the Early Universe, enabling us to trace its evolution back to lifetimes as short as 0.01 seconds. Upcoming CMB spectrum measurements, such as those underway at the Simons Observatory, will achieve unprecedented precision, allowing for more accurate extraction of information about the properties of the primordial plasma and, in particular, primordial neutrinos. This provides an opportunity to test whether these properties align with the predictions of the standard cosmological model or indicate the presence of new physics that influenced the evolution of the MeV-temperature plasma. A key component in understanding how new physics may have affected primordial neutrinos is solving the neutrino Boltzmann equation. In this paper, we present a novel approach to solving this equation that offers model independence, transparency, and computational efficiency - features that current state-of-the-art methods lack. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept implementation and apply it to several toy scenarios, showcasing key aspects of the primordial plasma's evolution in the presence of new physics.</description>
