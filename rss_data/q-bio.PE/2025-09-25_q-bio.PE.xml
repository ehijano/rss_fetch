      <title>Evolution of phenocopying in a dynamical model of developmental trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developmental trajectories are known to be canalized, or robust to both environmental and genetic perturbations. However, even when these trajectories are decanalized by an environmental perturbation outside of the range of conditions to which they are robust, they often produce phenotypes similar to known mutants called phenocopies. This correspondence between the effect of environmental and genetic perturbations has received little theoretical attention. Here, we study an abstract regulatory model which is evolved to follow a specific trajectory. We then study the effect of both small and large perturbations to the trajectory both by changing parameters and by perturbing the state in a timed manner. We find, surprisingly, that the phenomenon of phenocopying emerges in evolved trajectories even though the alternative trajectories are not selected for. Our results suggest that evolution simplifies the structure of high-dimensional phenotypic landscapes which can simultaneously show robustness and phenocopying.</description>

      <title>First-Extinction Law for Resampling Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extinction times in resampling processes are fundamental yet often intractable, as previous formulas scale as $2^M$ with the number of states $M$ present in the initial probability distribution. We solve this by treating multinomial updates as independent square-root diffusions of zero drift, yielding a closed-form law for the first-extinction time. We prove that the mean coincides exactly with the Wright-Fisher result of Baxter et al., thereby replacing exponential-cost evaluations with a linear-cost expression, and we validate this result through extensive simulations. Finally, we demonstrate predictive power for model collapse in a simple self-training setup: the onset of collapse coincides with the resampling-driven first-extinction time computed from the model's initial stationary distribution. These results hint to a unified view of resampling extinction dynamics.</description>

      <title>Discrete vs. continuous dynamics in biology: When do they align and when do they diverge?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11602v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many biological systems are governed by difference equations and exhibit discrete-time dynamics. Examples include the size of a population when generations are non-overlapping, and the incidence of a disease when infections are recorded at fixed intervals. For discrete-time systems lacking exact solutions, continuous-time approximations are frequently employed when small changes occur between discrete time steps.
  Here, we present an approach motivated by exactly soluble discrete time problems. We show that such systems have continuous-time descriptions (governed by differential equations) whose solutions precisely agree, at the discrete times, with the discrete time solutions, irrespective of the size of changes that occur.
  For discrete-time systems lacking exact solutions, we develop approximate continuous-time models that can, to high accuracy, capture rapid growth and decay. Our approach employs mappings between difference and differential equations, generating functional solutions that exactly or closely preserve the original discrete time behaviour. It uncovers fundamental structural parallels and also distinctions between the difference equation and the `equivalent' differential equation. The findings we present cover both time-homogeneous and time-inhomogeneous systems.
  For completeness, we also consider discrete-time systems with the most rapid oscillatory behaviour possible, namely a sign change each time step. We show, for exactly soluble cases, that such systems also have a continuous-time description, but that this comes at the expense of generally complex-valued solutions.
  This work has applications in, for example, population genetics, ecology and epidemic modelling. By bridging discrete and continuous representations of a system, it enhances insights/analysis of different types of dynamics.</description>

      <title>Suppression of errors in collectively coded information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern life largely transmits genetic information from mother to daughter through the duplication of single physically intact molecules that encode information. However, copying an extended molecule requires complex copying machinery and high fidelity that scales with the genome size to avoid the error catastrophe. Here, we explore these fidelity requirements in an alternative architecture, the virtual circular genome, in which no one physical molecule encodes the full genetic information. Instead, information is encoded and transmitted in a collective of overlapping and interacting segments. Using a model experimental system of a complex mixture of DNA oligomers that can partly anneal and extend off each other, we find that mutant oligomers are suppressed relative to a model without collective encoding. Through simulations and theory, we show that this suppression of mutants can be explained by competition for productive binding partners. As a consequence, information can be propagated robustly in a virtual circular genome even at mutation rates expected under prebiotic conditions.</description>

      <title>Runtime Analysis of Competitive co-Evolutionary Algorithms for Maximin Optimisation of a Bilinear Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.15238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.15238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Co-evolutionary algorithms have a wide range of applications, such as in hardware design, evolution of strategies for board games, and patching software bugs. However, these algorithms are poorly understood and applications are often limited by pathological behaviour, such as loss of gradient, relative over-generalisation, and mediocre objective stasis. It is an open challenge to develop a theory that can predict when co-evolutionary algorithms find solutions efficiently and reliable.
  This paper provides a first step in developing runtime analysis for population-based competitive co-evolutionary algorithms. We provide a mathematical framework for describing and reasoning about the performance of co-evolutionary processes. To illustrate the framework, we introduce a population-based co-evolutionary algorithm called \pdcoea, and prove that it obtains a solution to a bilinear maximin optimisation problem in expected polynomial time. Finally, we describe settings where \pdcoea needs exponential time with overwhelmingly high probability to obtain a solution.</description>
