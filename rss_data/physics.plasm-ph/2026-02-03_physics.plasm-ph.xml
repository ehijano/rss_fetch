      <title>Self ordering to imposed ordering of dust -- a continuous spatial phase transition experiment in MDPX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous experiments conducted in the Magnetized Dusty Plasma eXperiment (MDPX) revealed an intriguing phenomenon first referred to as imposed ordering. This occurs when micron-sized dust particles become aligned with the geometry of a conducting mesh placed above the dust (at a distance much larger than the plasma Debye length or the ion-neutral or electron-neutral mean free paths) in the presence of a strong magnetic field perpendicular to the mesh. In this work, results of a transition experiment are presented wherein starting from a classical two-dimensional Coulomb crystal with hexagonal symmetry in an unmagnetized plasma $(B = 0\,T)$, dust transitions to a state in which it flows along the geometry of a conducting mesh placed above it, mapping out the 4-fold symmetry of the boundary condition. It is hypothesized that beyond a certain magnetization, elongated electric potential structures emanating from the mesh drive the dust motion to reflect the mesh morphology, transitioning from a 6-fold self ordering to 4-fold imposed ordering. The various dust phases are quantified and a critical value of magnetic field is identified in the transition experiment indicating the onset of imposed ordering.</description>

      <title>Drift-kinetic PIC model for simulations of longitudinal plasma confinement in mirror traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a 1D2V electrostatic PIC model with a drift-kinetic description of all particle types aiming at simulating classical longitudinal plasma transport in axially symmetric open traps. The model generalizes the semi-implicit particle-in-cell method with exact conservation of energy and charge to the case of collisional plasma and adapts it to boundary conditions on perfectly conducting walls with a floating potential. Implementation of Coulomb collisions is tested on the problem of temperature relaxation in a two-component plasma and demonstrates good agreement with the analytical theory. Since quasi-neutrality of plasma is not strictly determined, the model is able to correctly reproduce the ambipolar electric potential profile up to the walls. At the same time, the main advantage of implicit PIC simulations - the ability to use large grid steps, many times larger than the Debye radius - does not prevent the correct modeling of the near-wall electric potential jump. The model satisfactorily reproduces the known results of the Debye sheath theory and the Bohm criterion. A comparison of stationary plasma profiles formed in a mirror trap in the presence of a constant particle source with the results of simulations using the hybrid code MIDAS showed that self-consistent consideration of electron kinetics in expanders leads to noticeable (at the level of 15 %) differences in the electron temperature, potential, and density of the confined plasma.</description>

      <title>von Neumann entropy of phase space structures in gyrokinetic plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven diagnostic that combines the singular value decomposition (SVD) with an information-theoretic entropy to quantify the phase-space complexity of perturbed distribution functions in gyrokinetic turbulence. Applying this framework to nonlinear flux-tube simulations that solve the time evolution of the ion distribution function represented by Fourier modes with the wavenumber for real space, we define the von Neumann entropy (vNE) to analyze the velocity-space structure. A global survey in the wavenumber space reveals a wavenumber-dependent variation of the vNE in velocity-space structure: the vNE remains low at low wavenumber but increases across $k_\perp\rho_{t\mathrm{i}}\sim 1$. Hermite/Laguerre decompositions revealed that the finite Larmor radius (FLR) phase mixing in the perpendicular (magnetic-moment) direction is active. Simultaneously, the systematic increase in vNE for $k_\perp\rho_{t\mathrm{i}}$ correlates with the broadening of the Hermite spectrum, suggesting enhanced parallel phase mixing (Landau resonance) as the primary mechanism for the observed wave number dependence. These results demonstrate that the SVD-based vNE provides a compact measure of kinetic complexity without assuming a predefined basis and enables a global mapping of its wavenumber dependence of phase-mixing processes in gyrokinetic turbulence.</description>

      <title>Linear Magnetohydrodynamic Waves in a Magneto-Lattice: A Unified Theoretical Framework and Numerical Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic theoretical and numerical investigation of the propagation properties of linear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves in a spatially periodic magnetic field, referred to as a magneto-lattice. Two types of central equations, expressed in terms of $\left(\rho,\boldsymbol{B},\boldsymbol{v}\right)$ (where $\rho$ is perturbed mass density, $\boldsymbol{B}$ is perturbed magnetic field, and $\boldsymbol{v}$ is perturbed velocity) and the perturbation displacement $\boldsymbol{\xi}$, are established using the plane wave expansion (PWE) method. The validity of both equations is demonstrated through two numerical examples. This framework enables the identification of intrinsic frequency bandgaps and cutoff phenomena within the system. Our numerical results show that the bandgap width increases with the magnetic modulation ratio $B_{m}$, leading to the suppression of specific MHD wave modes. Furthermore, the periodicity of the magnetic field induces the splitting of Alfv\'{e}n waves into multiple branches\textemdash a phenomenon absent in uniform plasmas. These findings provide new insights for manipulating MHD waves in a crystalline lattice framework of structured plasmas.</description>

      <title>Irreversibility and Entropy Exclusion in Collisionless Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine entropy production in reduced descriptions of collisionless plasmas. Introducing a closure dependent entropy hierarchy, we show that non-conservative moment closures generate a residual entropy associated with irreversible information loss, whereas invariant closures remain reversible. The monotonic growth of this residual entropy imposes a statistical realizability constraint on macroscopic plasma states, excluding regions of phase space independent of dynamical stability. For anisotropic plasmas, we evaluate entropy production within a second-order moment closure, identifying contributions from transport and magnetic field inhomogeneity. The resulting entropy exclusion boundary is broadly consistent with observed anisotropy distributions in space plasmas. Statistical realizability thus emerges as an organizing principle for reduced collisionless plasma descriptions.</description>

      <title>A statistical theory of electronic degrees of freedom in wave packet molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive statistical distributions for the degrees of freedom in wave packet molecular dynamics models. Specifically, a theory is developed for the width distributions of Gaussian wavepackets in both isotropic and anisotropic formulations. The resulting distribution functions show good agreement with molecular dynamics data under warm dense matter conditions, providing practical guidance for constraining the confining potential, an empirical parameter in the model. We also discuss how these distributions influence the resulting effective Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>Flow Generation via Catastrophic Loss of Equilibrium in Weakly-Rotating Self-Gravitating Fluids: A Minimal Idealized Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the catastrophic energy transformations, in particular the ones leading to the generation of a flow in a weakly rotating self-gravitating fluid/gas found, for instance, in the vicinity of a massive compact object. Because of the similarity in the governing equations, the system dynamics is worked out exactly in parallel to the methods developed for investigating catastrophic relaxation in stellar plasmas [1-3]. In the latter a more ``complex" equilibrium state, on slow changes in the environment, can lose its equilibrium (catastrophe), and transform to a less complex state with a very different energy mix from the original. It is shown that a similar transformation in the weakly rotating self-gravitating fluid/gas will convert much of its gravitation energy into kinetic energy in the flow. Since flows are a perennial ingredient of high-energy astrophysical systems, the energy transformation processes revealed in present study, can advance our understanding of a variety of them. Some particularly relevant examples are: macro-scale flows / structures in galaxies, accretion discs, and the dynamics and stability of a rotating star / its atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Driven Origin of Super-Equipartition Magnetic Fields in Accretion Discs and Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields play a central role in accretion physics around black holes, yet their physical origin within accretion flows remains an open problem. In this work, we investigate the generation and subsequent evolution of magnetic fields triggered by anisotropic radiation fields in black hole accretion discs with compact rotating inner corona. We self-consistently evolve the magnetic field using the generalized field evolution MHD equation, including advection, shear-driven induction, and Hall effects. The radiation field acts as a primary field generator, while azimuthal rotation in the magnetized plasma provides rapid amplification. We find that radiation-generated fields efficiently reach a dominant toroidal component by Keplerian rotation, leading to magnetic field strengths of order $\sim 10^{8}\,\mathrm{G}$ in the vicinity of a 10 solar mass black hole and accretion disc-corona emitting at luminosity equivalent to the Eddington unit. These magnetic fields are achieved within viscous timescales and reach or exceed local equipartition estimates based on gas pressure. When vertical outflows are included, the amplified magnetic fields are advected into the corona, magnetizing disc-launched winds and jet precursors with field strengths of similar order. Our results demonstrate that radiation is not merely a passive component of accretion flows, but provides a robust and unavoidable trigger for the generation of dynamically significant magnetic fields. Our results provide a physically grounded explanation for the origin of large-scale, structured magnetic fields in and around accretion discs. This mechanism offers a pathway for magnetizing accretion discs and their outflows without invoking externally supplied magnetic flux, with broad implications for X-ray binaries, active galactic nuclei and other transients such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).</description>

      <title>Multigrid Poisson Solver for Complex Geometries Using Finite Difference Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an efficient numerical method, inspired by transformation optics, for solving the Poisson equation in complex and arbitrarily shaped geometries. The approach operates by mapping the physical domain to a uniform computational domain through coordinate transformations, which can be applied either to the entire domain or selectively to specific boundaries inside the domain. This flexibility allows both homogeneous (Laplace equation) and inhomogeneous (Poisson equation) problems to be solved efficiently using iterative or fast direct solvers, with only the material parameters and source terms modified according to the transformation. The method is formulated within a finite difference framework, where the modified material properties are computed from the coordinate transformation equations, either analytically or numerically. This enables accurate treatment of arbitrary geometric shapes while retaining the simplicity of a uniform grid solver. Numerical experiments confirm that the method achieves second-order accuracy , and offers a straightforward pathway to integrate fast solvers such as multigrid methods on the uniform computational grid.</description>

      <title>Do plasmoids induce fast magnetic reconnection in well-resolved current sheets in 2D MHD simulations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the development of tearing-mode instability using the highest-resolution two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations of reconnecting current sheets performed on a uniform grid, for Lundquist numbers of $10^3 \le S \le 5 \times 10^5$ , reaching up to $65,536^2$ grid cells. We demonstrate a Sweet--Parker scaling of the reconnection rate $V_{\text{rec}} \sim S^{-1/2}$ up to Lundquist numbers $S \sim 10^4$. For larger values of Lundquist number, between $2\times 10^4\le S \le 2 \times 10^5$, plasmoid formation sets in, leading to a slight enhancement of the reconnection rate, $V_{\text{rec}} \sim S^{-1/3}$, consistent with the prediction from linear tearing mode induced reconnection, indicating that reconnection remains resistivity-dependent and therefore slow. In this range of $S$-values, the plasmoids do not undergo a merger cascade, as they are rapidly advected out of the reconnection layer. Only for $S &gt; 2 \times 10^5$, we observe the nonlinear development of the tearing-mode instability, with plasmoid coalescence and a saturation of the reconnection rate at $V_\text{rec} / V_A \sim 0.01$. At such high $S$, however, the corresponding Reynolds number is large, reaching $\text{Re} &gt; 2000$ even on scales comparable to the current-sheet thickness. We therefore conclude that, in astrophysical systems, it is essential to account for the dominant influence of turbulence and three-dimensional effects in the reconnection process.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning approach to modeling of neutral particles transport in plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A propagator-based approach is investigated for Monte-Carlo (MC) modeling of neutral particles transport in fusion boundary plasmas. The propagator is essentially a Green function for the neutral kinetic equation, which depends on the plasma profiles. A Neural Network (NN) based model for the propagator provides a fast and accurate solution for the neutral distribution function in plasma. Furthermore, continuous and smooth dependence of NN-based reconstruction of the propagator on the plasma parameters opens the possibility for using this approach with Jacobian-based methods for time-integration and root finding. Initial results from a small 1D test problem look promising; however, important research questions are concerned with the scaling of the algorithm to larger systems.</description>

Abstract: Parametric data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) that embed dependencies in a large number of input parameters are crucial for enabling many-query tasks in large-scale problems. These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard grid-based data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality. This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron-temperature-gradient-driven micro-instability simulation with six input parameters, we demonstrate that a predictive parametric optDMD ROM that is up to three orders of magnitude cheaper to evaluate can be constructed using only 28 high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations, enabled by the use of sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</description>

Abstract: This work shows that the interiors of perturbed zero-helicity vortices display simply connected topology with a crescent-shaped boundary. Flux surfaces in fluid and magnetic vortices were explored analytically, while particle trajectories in the context of plasma confinement were examined numerically, demonstrating the existence of both toroidal and simply connected topologies. This new topology appears for perturbations in a broad class, with amplitudes and spatial variance allowed to be arbitrarily small. A corollary of this work proves the closedness of field lines under odd-parity perturbations of zero-helicity vortices in full three dimensional context.</description>

To achieve maximum implosion efficiency, a perfect capsule geometry is required. This paper presents a wall thickness measurement method based on zero-group velocity guided elastic wave resonances. They are measured with a non-destructive, contactless frequency domain laser ultrasound microscopy system. Wall thickness measurements along the equator of a high-density carbon capsule with a diameter of around 2 mm and a wall thickness of around 80 $\unicode{x00B5}$m excellently agree with infrared interferometry reference measurements. In addition, the multi-resonant nature of a spherical shell is studied by complementing experimental observations with plate dispersion calculations and finite element wave propagation simulations. The presented method is scalable and can be applied to a broad range of target materials, including metals, or metal-doped targets.</description>
