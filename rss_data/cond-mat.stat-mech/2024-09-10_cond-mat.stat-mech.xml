      <title>Quantum percolation on Lieb Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the quantum percolation problem on Lieb lattices in two and three dimensions. We study the statistics of the energy levels through random matrix theory, and determine the level spacing distributions, which, with the aid of finite-size scaling theory, allows us to obtain accurate estimates for site- and bond percolation thresholds and critical exponents. Our numerical investigation supports a localized-delocalized transition at finite threshold, which decreases as the average coordination number increases. The precise determination of the localization length exponent enables us to claim that quantum site- and bond-percolation problems on Lieb lattices belong to the same universality class, with $\nu$ decreasing with lattice dimensionality, $d$, similarly to the classical percolation problem. In addition, we verify that, in three dimensions, quantum percolation on Lieb lattices belongs to the same universality class as the Anderson impurity model.</description>

      <title>Stripe and Bubble Ratchets on Asymmetric Substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a variety of non-monotonic ratchet effects can arise when mesophase pattern-forming systems, which exhibit anisotropic crystal, stripe, and bubble reigmes, are coupled to one-dimensional asymmetric substrates under ac driving. The ratchet efficiency and direction of motion are determined by how well the mesophase morphology matches the periodicity and shape of the substrate. Stripe states that are aligned with the substrate show the strongest ratchet effect, large bubbles show a weak ratchet effect, and small bubbles show a strong ratchet effect with an efficiency that oscillates as a function of ac drive amplitude. We map out the different rectification phases as a function of the pattern morphology, substrate strength, and ac drive amplitude. The pronounced ratchet effects that we observe in some regimes can be exploited for pattern sorting in hard and soft matter systems.</description>

      <title>On the motion of passive and active particles with harmonic and viscous forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve the joint probability density for the passive and active particles with harmonic, viscous, and perturbative forces. After deriving the Fokker-Planck equation for a passive and a run-and-tumble particles, we approximately get and analyze the solution for the joint distribution density subject to an exponential correlated Gaussian force in three kinds of time limit domains. Mean squared displacement (velocity) for a particle with harmonic and viscous forces behaviors in the form of super-diffusion, consistent with a particle having viscous and perturbative forces. A passive particle with both harmonic, viscous forces and viscous, perturbative forces has the Gaussian form with mean squared velocity ~t. Particularly, In our case of a run-and-tumble particle, the mean squared displacement scales as super-diffusion, while the mean squared velocity has a normal diffusive form.In addition, the kurtosis, the correlation coefficient, and the moment from moment equation are numerically calculated.</description>

      <title>Cavity Control of Topological Qubits: Fusion Rule, Anyon Braiding and Majorana-Schr\"odinger Cat States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of introducing a local cavity within the center of a topological chain, revealing profound effects on the system's quantum states. Notably, the cavity induces a scissor-like effect that bisects the chain, liberating Majorana zero modes (MZMs) within the bulk. Our results demonstrate that this setup enables the observation of non-trivial fusion rules and braiding -- key signatures of non-Abelian anyons -- facilitated by the spatially selective ultra-strong coupling of the cavity photon field. These MZM characteristics can be directly probed through fermionic parity readouts and photon Berry phases, respectively. Furthermore, by leveraging the symmetry properties of fermion modes within a two-site cavity, we propose a novel method for generating MZM-polariton Schr\"odinger cat states. Our findings present a significant advancement in the control of topological quantum systems, offering new avenues for both fundamental research and potential quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>Colloidoscope: Detecting Dense Colloids in 3d with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colloidoscope is a deep learning pipeline employing a 3D residual Unet architecture, designed to enhance the tracking of dense colloidal suspensions through confocal microscopy. This methodology uses a simulated training dataset that reflects a wide array of real-world imaging conditions, specifically targeting high colloid volume fraction and low-contrast scenarios where traditional detection methods struggle. Central to our approach is the use of experimental signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), and point-spread-functions (PSFs) to accurately quantify and simulate the experimental data. Our findings reveal that Colloidoscope achieves superior recall in particle detection (finds more particles) compared to conventional heuristic methods. Simultaneously, high precision is maintained (high fraction of true positives.) The model demonstrates a notable robustness to photobleached samples, thereby prolonging the imaging time and number of frames than may be acquired. Furthermore, Colloidoscope maintains small scale resolution sufficient to classify local structural motifs. Evaluated across both simulated and experimental datasets, Colloidoscope brings the advancements in computer vision offered by deep learning to particle tracking at high volume fractions. We offer a promising tool for researchers in the soft matter community, this model is deployed and available to use pretrained: https://github.com/wahabk/colloidoscope.</description>

      <title>A geometric condition for robot-swarm cohesion and cluster-flock transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a geometric design rule for size-controlled clustering of self-propelled particles. Active particles that tend to rotate under an external force have an intrinsic signed-parameter with units of curvature, which we term curvity, derivable from first principles. Robot experiments and numerical simulations show that the properties of the individual robot alone -- radius and curvity -- control pair-cohesion in a binary system as well as the stability of flocking and clustering in a swarm. Our results have applications in meta-materials and embodied decentralized control.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Cluster Methods with Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and Tensor Networks (TN) are two powerful frameworks for numerically investigating many-body systems, each offering distinct advantages. MCMC, with its flexibility and theoretical consistency, is well-suited for simulating arbitrary systems by sampling. TN, on the other hand, provides a powerful tensor-based language for capturing the entanglement properties intrinsic to many-body systems, offering a universal representation of these systems. In this work, we leverage the computational strengths of TN to design a versatile cluster MCMC sampler. Specifically, we propose a general framework for constructing tensor-based cluster MCMC methods, enabling arbitrary cluster updates by utilizing TNs to compute the distributions required in the MCMC sampler. Our framework unifies several existing cluster algorithms as special cases and allows for natural extensions. We demonstrate our method by applying it to the simulation of the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Model and the three-dimensional Ising Model. This work is dedicated to the memory of Prof. David Draper.</description>

      <title>Dissipative self-assembly of patchy particles under nonequilibrium drive: a computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by biology and implemented using nanotechnology, the self-assembly of patchy particles has emerged as a pivotal mechanism for constructing complex structures that mimic natural systems with diverse functionalities. Here, we explore the dissipative self-assembly of patchy particles under nonequilibrium conditions, with the aim of overcoming the constraints imposed by equilibrium assembly. Utilizing extensive Monte Carlo (MC) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we provide insight into the effects of external forces that mirror natural and chemical processes on the assembly rates and the stability of the resulting assemblies comprising $8$, $10$, and $13$ patchy particles. Implemented by a favorable bond-promoting drive in MC or a pulsed square wave potential in MD, our simulations reveal the role these external drives play in accelerating assembly kinetics and enhancing structural stability, evidenced by a decrease in the time to first assembly and an increase in the duration the system remains in an assembled state. Through the analysis of an order parameter, entropy production, bond dynamics, and interparticle forces, we unravel the underlying mechanisms driving these advancements. We also validated our key findings by simulating a larger system of $100$ patchy particles. Our comprehensive results not only shed light on the impact of external stimuli on self-assembly processes but also open a promising pathway for expanding the application by leveraging patchy particles for novel nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric exclusion process with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider asymmetric simple exclusion processes with $N$ particles on the one-dimensional discrete torus with $L$ sites with following properties: (i) nearest-neighbor jumps on the torus, (ii) the jump rates depend only on the distance to the next particle in the direction of the jump, (iii) the jump rates are independent of $N$ and $L$. For measures with a long-range two-body interaction potential that depends only on the distance between neighboring particles we prove a relation between the interaction potential and particle jump rates that is necessary and sufficient for the measure to be invariant for the process. The normalization of the measure and the stationary current are computed both for finite $L$ and $N$ and in the thermodynamic limit. For a finitely many particles that evolve on $\mathbb{Z}$ with totally asymmetric jumps it is proved, using reverse duality, that a certain family of nonstationary measures with a microscopic shock and antishock evolves into a convex combination of such measures with weights given by random walk transition probabilities. On macroscopic scale this domain random walk is a travelling wave phenomenon tantamount to phase separation with a stable shock and stable antishock. Various potential applications of this result and open questions are outlined.</description>

      <title>Learning to Classify Quantum Phases of Matter with a Few Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the identification of quantum phases of matter, at zero temperature, when only part of the phase diagram is known in advance. Following a supervised learning approach, we show how to use our previous knowledge to construct an observable capable of classifying the phase even in the unknown region. By using a combination of classical and quantum techniques, such as tensor networks, kernel methods, generalization bounds, quantum algorithms, and shadow estimators, we show that, in some cases, the certification of new ground states can be obtained with a polynomial number of measurements. An important application of our findings is the classification of the phases of matter obtained in quantum simulators, e.g., cold atom experiments, capable of efficiently preparing ground states of complex many-particle systems and applying simple measurements, e.g., single qubit measurements, but unable to perform a universal set of gates.</description>

      <title>Ordering, spontaneous flows and aging in active fluids depositing tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing experimental evidence shows that cell monolayers can induce long-lived perturbations to their environment, akin to footprints, which in turn influence the global dynamics of the system. Inspired by these observations, we propose a comprehensive theoretical framework to describe systems where an active field dynamically interacts with a non-advected footprint field, deposited by the active field. We derive the corresponding general hydrodynamics for both polar and nematic fields. Our findings reveal that the dynamic coupling to a footprint field induces remarkable effects absent in classical active hydrodynamics, such as symmetry-dependent modifications to the isotropic-ordered transition, which may manifest as either second-order or first-order, alterations in spontaneous flow transitions, potentially resulting in oscillating flows and rotating fields, and initial condition-dependent aging dynamics characterized by long-lived transient states. Our results suggest that footprint deposition could be a key mechanism determining the dynamical phases of cellular systems, or more generally active systems inducing long-lived perturbations to their environment.</description>

      <title>Exact Bethe quantum numbers of the massive XXZ chain in the two down-spin sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every solution of the Bethe ansatz equations (BAE) is characterized by a set of quantum numbers called the Bethe quantum numbers, which are fundamental for evaluating it numerically. We rigorously derive the Bethe quantum numbers for the real solutions of the spin-1/2 massive XXZ spin chain in the two down-spin sector, assuming the existence of solutions to some form of BAE. In the sector the quantum numbers $J_1$ and $J_2$ were derived for complex solutions, but not for real solutions. We show the exact results in the sector as follows. (\si) When two Bethe quantum numbers are different, i.e., for $J_1 \ne J_2$, we introduce a graphical method, which we call a contour method, for deriving the solution of BAE to a given set of Bethe quantum numbers. By the method, we can readily show the existence and the uniqueness of the solution. (\sii) When two Bethe quantum numbers are equal, i.e. for $J_1 = J_2$, we derive the criteria for the collapse of two-strings and the emergence of an extra two-string by an analytic method. (\siii) We obtain the number of real solutions, which depends on the site number $N$ and the XXZ anisotropy parameter $\zeta$. (\siv) We derive all infinite-valued solutions of BAE for the XXX spin chain in the two down-spin sector through the XXX limit. (\sv) We explicitly show the completeness of the Bethe ansatz in terms of the Bethe quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>Hietarinta's classification of $4\times 4$ constant Yang-Baxter operators using algebraic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifying Yang-Baxter operators is an essential first step in the study of the simulation of integrable quantum systems on quantum computers. One of the earliest initiatives was taken by Hietarinta in classifying constant Yang-Baxter solutions for a two-dimensional local Hilbert space (qubit representation). He obtained 11 families of invertible solutions, including the one generated by the permutation operator. While these methods work well for 4 by 4 solutions, they become cumbersome for higher dimensional representations. In this work, we overcome this restriction by constructing the constant Yang-Baxter solutions in a representation independent manner by using ans\"{a}tze from algebraic structures. We use four different algebraic structures that reproduce 10 of the 11 Hietarinta families when the qubit representation is chosen. The methods include a set of commuting operators, Clifford algebras, Temperley-Lieb algebras, and partition algebras. We do not obtain the $(2,2)$ Hietarinta class with these methods.</description>

Abstract: Cloud observables such as precipitation efficiency and cloud lifetime are key quantities in weather and climate, but understanding their quantitative connection to initial conditions such as initial cloud water mass or droplet size remains challenging. Here we study the evolution of cloud droplets with a bin microphysics scheme, modeling both gravitational coagulation as well as fallout, and develop analytical formulae to describe the evolution of bulk cloud and rain water. We separate the dynamics into a mass-conserving and fallout-dominated regime, which reveals that the overall dynamics are governed by a single non-dimensional parameter $\mu$, the ratio of accretion and sedimentation time scales. Cloud observables from the simulations accordingly collapse as a function of $\mu$. We also find an unexpected relationship between cloud water and accumulated rain, and that fallout can be modeled with a bulk fall speed which is constant in time despite an evolving raindrop distribution.</description>

      <title>Systematic Coarse-Graining of Sequence-Dependent Structure and Elasticity of Double-Stranded DNA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse-grained models have played an important role in the study of the behavior of DNA at length scales beyond a few hundred base pairs. Traditionally, these models have relied on structurally featureless and sequence-independent approaches, such as the twistable worm-like chain. However, research over the past decade has illuminated the substantial impact of DNA sequence even at the kilo-base pair scale. Several robust sequence-dependent models have emerged, capturing intricacies at the base pair-step level. Here we introduce an analytical framework for coarse-graining such models to the 2 to 40-base pair scale while preserving essential structural and dynamical features. These faithful coarse-grained parametrizations enable efficient sampling of large molecules. Rather than providing a fully parametrized model, we present the methodology and software necessary for mapping any base pair-step model to the desired level of coarse-graining. Finally, we provide application examples of our method, including estimates of the persistence length and effective torsional stiffness of DNA in a setup mimicking a freely orbiting tweezer, as well as simulations of intrinsically helical DNA.</description>

      <title>Measuring temporal entanglement in experiments as a hallmark for integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel experimental approach to probe many-body quantum systems by developing a protocol to measure generalized temporal entropies. We demonstrate that the recently proposed generalized temporal entropies [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 033021] are equivalent to observing the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of a replicated system induced by a double quench protocol using local operators as probes. This equivalence, confirmed through state-of-the-art tensor network simulations for one-dimensional systems, validates the feasibility of measuring generalized temporal entropies experimentally. Our results reveal that the dynamics governed by the transverse field Ising model integrable Hamiltonian differ qualitatively from those driven by the same model with an additional parallel field, breaking integrability. They thus suggest that generalized temporal entropies can serve as a tool for identifying different dynamical classes. This work represents the first practical application of generalized temporal entropy characterization in one-dimensional many-body quantum systems and offers a new pathway for experimentally detecting integrability. We conclude by outlining the experimental requirements for implementing this protocol with state of the art quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics of Random Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformal field theories with central charge $c\le1$ on random surfaces have been extensively studied in the past. Here, this discussion is extended from their equilibrium distribution to their critical dynamics. This is motivated by the conjecture that these models describe the time evolution of certain social networks that are self-driven to a critical point. The time evolution of the surface area is identified as a Cox Ingersol Ross process. Planar surfaces shrink, while higher genus surfaces grow until the cosmological constant stops their growth. Three different equilibrium states are distingushed, dominated by (i) small planar surfaces, (ii) large surfaces with high but finite genus, and (iii) foamy surfaces, whose genus diverges. Time variations of the order parameter are analyzed and are found to have generalized hyperbolic distributions. In state (i), those have power law tails with a tail index close to 4. Analogies between the time evolution of the order parameter and a multifractal random walk are also pointed out.</description>

      <title>Transition path time over a barrier of a colloidal particle in a viscoelastic bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally study the statistics of the transition path time taken by a submicron bead to successfully traverse an energy barrier created by two optical tweezers in two prototypical viscoelastic fluids, namely, aqueous polymer and micellar solutions. We find a very good agreement between our experimental distributions and a theoretical expression derived from the generalized Langevin equation for the particle motion. Our results reveal that the mean transition path time measured in such viscoelastic fluids have a non-trivial dependence on the barrier curvature and they can be significantly reduced when compared with those determined in Newtonian fluids of the same zero-shear viscosity. We verify that the decrease of the mean transition path time can be described in terms of an effective viscosity that quantitatively coincides with that measured by linear microrheology at a frequency determined by the reactive mode that gives rise to the unstable motion over the barrier. Therefore, our results uncover the linear response of the particle during its thermally activated escape from a metastable state even when taking place in a non-Markovian bath.</description>

      <title>Input Space Mode Connectivity in Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the concept of loss landscape mode connectivity to the input space of deep neural networks. Mode connectivity was originally studied within parameter space, where it describes the existence of low-loss paths between different solutions (loss minimizers) obtained through gradient descent. We present theoretical and empirical evidence of its presence in the input space of deep networks, thereby highlighting the broader nature of the phenomenon. We observe that different input images with similar predictions are generally connected, and for trained models, the path tends to be simple, with only a small deviation from being a linear path. Our methodology utilizes real, interpolated, and synthetic inputs created using the input optimization technique for feature visualization. We conjecture that input space mode connectivity in high-dimensional spaces is a geometric effect that takes place even in untrained models and can be explained through percolation theory. We exploit mode connectivity to obtain new insights about adversarial examples and demonstrate its potential for adversarial detection. Additionally, we discuss applications for the interpretability of deep networks.</description>

      <title>Autonomous demon exploiting heat and information at the trajectory level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an electronic bipartite system consisting of a working substance, in which a refrigeration process is implemented, and of a nonthermal resource region, containing a combination of different thermal baths. In the working substance, heat is extracted from the coldest of two electronic reservoirs (refrigeration) via heat- and particle transport through a quantum dot. This quantum dot of the working substance is capacitively coupled to the resource region. In such a setup, a finite cooling power can be obtained in the working substance, while the energy exchange with the resource region exactly cancels out on average. At the same time, information is always exchanged, even on average, due to the capacitive coupling between the two parts of the bipartite system. The proposed system therefore implements an autonomous demon with fully vanishing heat extraction from the resource. Unlike macroscopic machines, nanoscale machines exhibit large fluctuations in performance, so precision becomes an important performance quantifier. We give a comprehensive description of the thermodynamic performance of the proposed autonomous demon in terms of stochastic trajectories and of full counting statistics and demonstrate that the precision of the cooling power strongly depends on the operation principle of the device. More specifically, the interplay of information flow and counter-balancing heat flows dramatically impacts the trade-off between cooling power, efficiency, and precision. We expect this insight to be of relevance for guiding the design of energy-conversion processes exploiting nonthermal resources.</description>

      <title>Limits on the computational expressivity of non-equilibrium biophysical processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological decision-making processes can be viewed as performing a classification task over a set of inputs, using various chemical and physical processes as "biological hardware." In this context, it is important to understand the inherent limitations on the computational expressivity of classification functions instantiated in biophysical media. Here, we model biochemical networks as Markov jump processes and train them to perform classification tasks, allowing us to investigate their computational expressivity. We reveal several unanticipated limitations on the input-output functions of these systems, which we further show can be lifted using biochemical mechanisms like promiscuous binding. We analyze the flexibility and sharpness of decision boundaries as well as the classification capacity of these networks. Additionally, we identify distinctive signatures of networks trained for classification, including the emergence of correlated subsets of spanning trees and a creased "energy landscape" with multiple basins. Our findings have implications for understanding and designing physical computing systems in both biological and synthetic chemical settings.</description>

      <title>Burgers turbulence in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08818v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove analytically and show numerically that the dynamics of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain is characterised by a transient Burgers turbulence regime on a wide range of time and energy scales. This regime is present at long wavelengths and energy per particle small enough that equipartition is not reached on a fast time scale. In this range, we prove that the driving mechanism to thermalisation is the formation of a shock that can be predicted using a pair of generalised Burgers equations. We perform a perturbative calculation at small energy per particle, proving that the energy spectrum of the chain $E_k$ decays as a power law, $E_k\sim k^{-\zeta(t)}$, on an extensive range of wavenumbers $k$. We predict that $\zeta(t)$ takes first the value $8/3$ at the Burgers shock time, and then reaches a value close to $2$ within two shock times. The value of the exponent $\zeta=2$ persists for several shock times before the system eventually relaxes to equipartition. During this wide time-window, an exponential cut-off in the spectrum is observed at large $k$, in agreement with previous results. Such a scenario turns out to be universal, i.e. independent of the parameters characterising the system and of the initial condition, once time is measured in units of the shock time.</description>

Abstract: The microstate of any degree of freedom of any classical dynamical system can be represented by a point in its two dimensional phase space. Since infinitely precise measurements are impossible, a measurement can, at best, constrain the location of this point to a region of phase space whose area is finite. This paper explores the implications of assuming that this finite area is bounded from below. I prove that if the same lower bound applied to every degree of freedom of a sufficiently cold classical dynamical system, the distribution of the system's energy among its degrees of freedom would be a Bose-Einstein distribution.</description>

Abstract: Spin parity effects refer to those special situations where a dichotomy in the physical behavior of a system arises, solely depending on whether the relevant spin quantum number is integral or half-odd integral. As is the case with the Haldane conjecture in antiferromagnetic spin chains, their pursuit often derives deep insights and invokes new developments in quantum condensed matter physics. Here, we put forth a simple and general scheme for generating such effects in any spatial dimension through the use of anisotropic interactions, and a setup within reasonable reach of state-of-the-art cold-atom implementations. We demonstrate its utility through a detailed analysis of the magnetization behavior of a specific one-dimensional spin chain model, an anisotropic antiferromagnet in a transverse magnetic field, unraveling along the way the quantum origin of finite-size effects observed in the magnetization curve that had previously been noted but not clearly understood.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12330v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) plays a major role in explaining thermalization of isolated quantum many-body systems. However, there has been no proof of the ETH in realistic systems due to the difficulty in the theoretical treatment of thermal energy eigenstates of nonintegrable systems. Here, we write down analytically thermal eigenstates of nonintegrable spin chains. We consider a class of theoretically tractable volume-law states, which we call entangled antipodal pair (EAP) states. These states are thermal, in the most fundamental sense that they are indistinguishable from the Gibbs state with respect to all local observables, with infinite temperature. We then identify Hamiltonians having the EAP state as an eigenstate and rigorously show that some of these Hamiltonians are nonintegrable. Furthermore, a thermal pure state at an arbitrary temperature is obtained by the imaginary time evolution of an EAP state. Our results offer a potential avenue for providing a provable example of the ETH.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04684v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how out-of-equilibrium states thermalize under quantum unitary dynamics is an important problem in many-body physics. In this work, we propose a statistical ansatz for the matrix elements of non-equilibrium initial states in the energy eigenbasis, in order to describe such evolution. The approach is inspired by the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis (ETH) but the proposed ansatz exhibits different scaling. Importantly, we point out the exponentially small cross-correlations between the observable and the initial state matrix elements that determine relaxation dynamics toward equilibrium. We numerically verify scaling and cross-correlation, point out the emergent universality of the high-frequency behavior, and outline possible generalizations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the behavior of two-time correlation functions at late times for finite system sizes considering observables whose (one-point) average value does not depend on energy. In the long time limit, we show that such correlation functions display a ramp and a plateau determined by the correlations of energy levels, similar to what is already known for the spectral form factor. The plateau value is determined, in absence of degenerate energy levels, by the fluctuations of diagonal matrix elements, which highlights differences between different symmetry classes. We show this behavior analytically by employing results from Random Matrix Theory and the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis, and numerically by exact diagonalization in the toy example of a Hamiltonian drawn from a Random Matrix ensemble and in a more realistic example of disordered spin glasses at high temperature. Importantly, correlation functions in the ramp regime do not show self-averaging behaviour, and, at difference with the spectral form factor the time average does not coincide with the ensemble average.</description>

Detailed simulations show that it is highly thermodynamically efficient while functioning as a Maxwell demon -- converting heat to work. The physically-calibrated design is targeted to direct experimental exploration. However, variations in Josephson junction fabrication introduce asymmetries that result in energy inefficiency and low operational fidelity. We provide a design solution that mitigates these practical challenges. The resulting platform is ideally suited to probe the thermodynamic foundations of information processing devices far from equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: The continuous time random walk model has been widely applied in various fields, including physics, biology, chemistry, finance, social phenomena, etc. In this work, we present an algorithm that utilizes a subordinate formula to generate data of the continuous time random walk in the long time limit. The algorithm has been validated using commonly employed observables, such as typical fluctuations of the positional distribution, rare fluctuations, the mean and the variance of the position, and breakthrough curves with time-dependent bias, demonstrating a perfect match.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of Quantum Particle Statistics: Bosons, Fermions, and Transtatistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identical quantum particles exhibit only two types of statistics: bosonic and fermionic. Theoretically, this restriction is commonly established through the symmetrization postulate or (anti)commutation constraints imposed on the algebra of creation and annihilation operators. The physical motivation for these axioms remains poorly understood, leading to various generalizations by modifying the mathematical formalism in somewhat arbitrary ways. In this work, we take an opposing route and classify quantum particle statistics based on operationally well-motivated assumptions. Specifically, we consider that a) the standard (complex) unitary dynamics defines the set of single-particle transformations, and b) phase transformations act locally in the space of multi-particle systems. We develop a complete characterization, which includes bosons and fermions as basic statistics with minimal symmetry. Interestingly, we have discovered whole families of novel statistics (dubbed transtatistics) accompanied by hidden symmetries, generic degeneracy of ground states, and spontaneous symmetry breaking -- effects that are (typically) absent in ordinary statistics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect refers to the accumulation of eigenstates near the boundary in open boundary lattice models, which can be systematically characterized using the non-Bloch band theory. Here, we apply the non-Bloch band theory to investigate the stochastic reaction-diffusion process by mapping it to a non-Hermitian Kitaev chain. We exactly obtain the open boundary spectrum and the generalized Brillouin zone, and identify a robust zero mode arising from the non-Bloch topology. Notably, distinct from its Hermitian counterpart in the quantum context, the zero mode supports anomalous dynamical crossover in the Markov process. We quantitatively demonstrate the intriguing dynamical effects through the spectral decomposition of the Hamiltonian on the non-Bloch eigenstates, and confirm our findings by conducting stochastic simulations with high accuracy. Our study highlights the significant and general role of non-Bloch topology in non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Classical Shadow Tomography through Many-body Localization Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01258v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical shadow tomography serves as a potent tool for extracting numerous properties from quantum many-body systems with minimal measurements. Nevertheless, prevailing methods yielding optimal performance for few-body operators necessitate the application of random two-qubit gates, a task that can prove challenging on specific quantum simulators such as ultracold atomic gases. In this work, we introduce an alternative approach founded on the dynamics of many-body localization, a phenomenon extensively demonstrated in optical lattices. Through an exploration of the shadow norm -- both analytically, employing a phenomenological model, and numerically, utilizing the TEBD algorithm -- we demonstrate that our scheme achieves remarkable efficiency comparable to shallow circuits or measurement-induced criticality, resulting in a significant improvement in the exponential exponent compared to the previous classical shadow protocol. Our findings are corroborated through direct numerical simulations encompassing the entire sampling and reconstruction processes. Consequently, our results present a compelling methodology for analyzing the output states of quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Phenotype selection due to mutational robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mutation-selection mechanism of Darwinian evolution gives rise not only to adaptation to environmental conditions but also to the enhancement of robustness against mutations. When two or more phenotypes have the same fitness value, the robustness distribution for different phenotypes can vary. Thus, we expect that some phenotypes are favored in evolution and that some are hardly selected because of a selection bias for mutational robustness. In this study, we investigated this selection bias for phenotypes in a model of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) using numerical simulations. The model had one input gene accepting a signal from the outside and one output gene producing a target protein, and the fitness was high if the output for the full signal was much higher than that for no signal. The model exhibited three types of responses to changes in the input signal: monostable, toggle switch, and one-way switch. We regarded these three response types as three distinguishable phenotypes. We constructed a randomly generated set of GRNs using the multicanonical Monte Carlo method originally developed in statistical physics and compared it to the outcomes of evolutionary simulations. One-way switches were strongly suppressed during evolution because of their lack of mutational robustness. By examining one-way switch GRNs in detail, we found that mutationally robust GRNs obtained by evolutionary simulations and non-robust GRNs obtained by McMC have different network structures. While robust GRNs have a common core motif, non-robust GRNs lack this motif. The bistability of non-robust GRNs is considered to be realized cooperatively by many genes, and these cooperative genotypes have been suppressed by evolution.</description>

      <title>Electric polarization evolution equation for antiferromagnetic multiferroics with the polarization proportional to the scalar product of the spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spin current model of electric polarization of multiferroics is justified via the quantum hydrodynamic method and the mean-field part of the spin-orbit interaction. The spin current model is applied to derive the electric polarization proportional to the scalar product of the spins of the near by ions, which appears to be caused by the Dzylaoshinskii-Moriya interaction. Symmetric tensor spin structure of the polarization is discussed as well. We start our derivations for the ferromagnetic multiferroic materials and present the further generalization for the antiferromagnetic multiferroic materials. We rederive the operator of the electric dipole moment, which provides the macroscopic polarization obtained via the spin current model. Finally, we use the quantum average of the found electric dipole moment operator in order to derive the polarization evolution equation for the antiferromagnetic multiferroic materials. Possibility of spiral spin structures is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Waiting time statistics for a double quantum dot coupled with an optical cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A double quantum dot coupled to an optical cavity is a prototypical example of a non-trivial open quantum system. Recent experimental and theoretical studies show that this system is a candidate for single-photon detection in the microwave domain. This motivates studies that go beyond just the average current, and also take into account the full counting statistics of photon and electron detections. With this in mind, here we provide a detailed analysis of the waiting time statistics of this system within the quantum jump unravelling, which allows us to extract analytical expressions for the success and failure probabilities, as well as for the inter detection times. Furthermore, by comparing single and multi-photon scenarios, we infer a hierarchy of occurrence probabilities for the different events, highlighting the role of photon interference events in the detection probabilities. Our results therefore provide a direct illustration of how waiting time statistics can be used to optimize a timely and relevant metrological task.</description>

      <title>Anomalous transport in the kinetically constrained quantum East-West model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a chaotic particle-conserving kinetically constrained model, with a single parameter which allows us to break reflection symmetry. Through extensive numerical simulations we find that the domain wall state shows a variety of dynamical behaviors from localization all the way to ballistic transport, depending on the value of the reflection breaking parameter. Surprisingly, such anomalous behavior is not mirrored in infinite-temperature dynamics, which appear to scale diffusively, in line with expectations for generic interacting models. However, studying the particle density gradient, we show that the lack of reflection symmetry affects infinite-temperature dynamics, resulting in an asymmetric dynamical structure factor. This is in disagreement with normal diffusion and suggests that the model may also exhibit anomalous dynamics at infinite temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we observe low-entangled eigenstates in the spectrum of the model, a telltale sign of quantum many body scars.</description>

      <title>Maxwell relation between entropy and atom-atom pair correlation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For many-particle systems with short-range interactions the local (same point) particle-particle pair correlation function represents a thermodynamic quantity that can be calculated using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. Here we exploit this property to derive a thermodynamic Maxwell relation between the local pair correlation and the entropy of an ultracold Bose gas in one dimension (1D). To demonstrate the utility of this Maxwell relation, we apply it to the computational formalism of the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE) to determine the entropy of a finite-temperature 1D Bose gas from its atom-atom pair correlation function. Such a correlation function is easy to compute numerically within the SPGPE and other formalisms, which is unlike computing the entropy itself. Our calculations can be viewed as a numerical experiment that serves as a proof-of-principle demonstration of an experimental method to deduce the entropy of a quantum gas from the measured atom-atom correlations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A procedure to find optimal regimes for quantum thermal engines (QTMs) is described and demonstrated. The QTMs are modelled as the periodically-driven non-equilibrium steady states of open quantum systems, whose dynamics is approximated in this work with Markovian master equations. The action of the external agent, and the couplings to the heat reservoirs can be modulated with control functions, and it is the time-dependent shape of these control functions the object of optimisation. Those functions can be freely parameterised, which permits to constrain the solutions according to experimental or physical requirements.</description>

      <title>Uncovering gauge-dependent critical order-parameter correlations by a stochastic gauge fixing at O($N$)$^*$ and Ising$^*$ continuous transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13485v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the O($N$)$^*$ transitions that occur in the 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauge $N$-vector model, and the analogous Ising$^*$ transitions occurring in the 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauge Higgs model, corresponding to an $N$-vector model with $N=1$. At these transitions, gauge-invariant correlations behave as in the usual $N$-vector/Ising model. Instead, the nongauge invariant spin correlations are trivial and therefore the spin order parameter that characterizes the spontaneous breaking of the O($N$) symmetry in standard $N$-vector/Ising systems is apparently absent. We define a novel gauge fixing procedure -- we name it stochastic gauge fixing -- that allows us to define a gauge-dependent vector field that orders at the transition and is therefore the appropriate order parameter for the O($N$) symmetry breaking. To substantiate this approach, we perform numerical simulations for $N=3$ and $N=1$. A finite-size scaling analysis of the numerical data allows us to confirm the general scenario: the gauge-fixed spin correlation functions behave as the corresponding functions computed in the usual $N$-vector/Ising model. The emergence of a critical vector order parameter in the gauge model shows the complete equivalence of the O($N$)$^*$/Ising$^*$ and O($N$)/Ising universality classes.</description>

      <title>On stability of k-local quantum phases of matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current theoretical framework for topological phases of matter is based on the thermodynamic limit of a system with geometrically local interactions. A natural question is to what extent the notion of a phase of matter remains well-defined if we relax the constraint of geometric locality, and replace it with a weaker graph-theoretic notion of $k$-locality. As a step towards answering this question, we analyze the stability of the energy gap to perturbations for Hamiltonians corresponding to general quantum low-density parity-check codes, extending work of Bravyi and Hastings [Commun. Math. Phys. 307, 609 (2011)]. A corollary of our main result is that if there exist constants $\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2&gt;0$ such that the size $\Gamma(r)$ of balls of radius $r$ on the interaction graph satisfy $\Gamma(r) = O(\exp(r^{1-\varepsilon_1}))$ and the local ground states of balls of radius $r\le\rho^\ast = O(\log(n)^{1+\varepsilon_2})$ are locally indistinguishable, then the energy gap of the associated Hamiltonian is stable against local perturbations. This gives an almost exponential improvement over the $D$-dimensional Euclidean case, which requires $\Gamma(r) = O(r^D)$ and $\rho^\ast = O(n^\alpha)$ for some $\alpha &gt; 0$. The approach we follow falls just short of proving stability of finite-rate qLDPC codes, which have $\varepsilon_1 = 0$; we discuss some strategies to extend the result to these cases. We discuss implications for the third law of thermodynamics, as $k$-local Hamiltonians can have extensive zero-temperature entropy.</description>

      <title>Unusual low-temperature behavior in the half-filled band of the one-dimensional extended Hubbard model in atomic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, a kind of finite-temperature pseudo-transition was observed in several quasi-one-dimensional models. In this work, we consider a genuine one-dimensional extended Hubbard model in the atomic limit, influenced by an external magnetic field and with the arbitrary number of particles controlled by the chemical potential. The one-dimensional extended Hubbard model in the atomic limit was initially studied in the seventies and has been investigated over the past decades, but it still surprises us today with its fascinating properties. We rigorously analyze its low-temperature behavior using the transfer matrix technique and provide accurate numerical results. Our analysis confirms that there is an anomalous behavior in the half-filled band, specifically occurring between the alternating pair (AP) and paramagnetic (PM) phases at zero temperature. Previous investigations did not deeply identify this anomalous behavior, maybe due to the numerical simplicity of the model, but from analytical point of view this is not so easy to manipulate algebraically because one needs to solve an algebraic cubic equation. In this study, we explore this behavior and clearly distinguish the pseudo-transition, which could easily be mistaken with a real phase transition. This anomalous behavior mimics features of both first- and second-order phase transitions. However, due to its nature, we cannot expect a finite-temperature phase transition in this model.</description>

Abstract: Stimulated by the successful descriptions of strongly correlated electron systems by fractionalized fermions, correspondence between interacting fermions and non-interacting multi-component fermions is formulated in examples of the Hubbard model. The formalism enables constructions of the neural network for a quantum many-body solver represented by coupled noninteracting fermions. After showing the exact correspondence of 1- and 2-site Hubbard model to two-component noninteracting fermions, numerical algorithm of the quantum machine learning for the Hubbard model is proposed. Benchmark for the 4-site systems is successfully presented and promising future directions as well as implications are discussed.</description>

Abstract: A comprehensive symmetry resolution of the entanglement entropy (EE) in $(1+1)$-d rational conformal field theories (RCFT) with categorical non-invertible symmetries is presented. This amounts to symmetry resolving the entanglement with respect to the generalized twisted and anyonic charge sectors of the theory. The anyonic sectors label the irreducible representations of a modular fusion category defining the symmetry and can be understood through the $(2+1)$-d symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT) that encodes the symmetry features of the CFT. Using this, we define the corresponding generalized boundary dependent charged moments necessary for the symmetry resolution of the entanglement entropy, which is the main result of this work. Furthermore, contrary to the case of invertible symmetries, we observe the breakdown of entanglement equipartition between different charged sectors at the next-to-leading order in the ultraviolet cutoff.</description>
