      <title>Deep-Ace: LSTM-based Prokaryotic Lysine Acetylation Site Predictor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acetylation of lysine residues (K-Ace) is a post-translation modification occurring in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. It plays a crucial role in disease pathology and cell biology hence it is important to identify these K-Ace sites. In the past, many machine learning-based models using hand-crafted features and encodings have been used to find and analyze the characteristics of K-Ace sites however these methods ignore long term relationships within sequences and therefore observe performance degradation. In the current work we propose Deep-Ace, a deep learning-based framework using Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) network which has the ability to understand and encode long-term relationships within a sequence. Such relations are vital for learning discriminative and effective sequence representations. In the work reported here, the use of LSTM to extract deep features as well as for prediction of K-Ace sites using fully connected layers for eight different species of prokaryotic models (including B. subtilis, C. glutamicum, E. coli, G. kaustophilus, S. eriocheiris, B. velezensis, S. typhimurium, and M. tuberculosis) has been explored. Our proposed method has outperformed existing state of the art models achieving accuracy as 0.80, 0.79, 0.71, 0.75, 0.80, 0.83, 0.756, and 0.82 respectively for eight bacterial species mentioned above. The method with minor modifications can be used for eukaryotic systems and can serve as a tool for the prognosis and diagnosis of various diseases in humans.</description>

      <title>The Power Stroke Mechanism of Muscle Contraction at the Confluence of Biology and Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While disproven by S. Carnot 200 years ago, corpuscularianism (the philosophy that the states of individual molecules determine the state of a system of those molecules) is still widely used to describe biological function. Nowhere is this more evident than in proposed power stroke mechanisms of muscle contraction. Muscle's power stroke occurs when muscle shortens against a mechanical load, performing work over time. While many mechanisms have been proposed, the actual power stroke mechanism of muscle contraction remains contested. Here I consider four distinctly different proposed mechanisms and assess their history and scientific merit. I show that over the past 65 years, molecular biologists have ignored Carnot for their corpuscular mechanic convictions in proposing a series of molecular power stroke mechanisms that regress from 19th century thermodynamics to an obsolete 17th century philosophy to a structural determinism invoked today that predates science. An isothermal power stroke in a thermodynamic muscle work loop, analogous to the power stoke in a Carnot cycle, rectifies this historic scientific blunder, defining the confluence of the bottom-up mechanics and chemistry of myosin motors and the top-down mechanics and chemistry of muscle. Specifically, created by thermal scaling, the increase in entropy with muscle's thermodynamic power stroke chemically exists within muscle and defines the irreversible energetics and kinetics of muscle contraction (the arrow of time).</description>

      <title>The positioning of stress fibers in contractile cells minimizes internal mechanical stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanics of animal cells is strongly determined by stress fibers, which are contractile filament bundles that form dynamically in response to extracellular cues. Stress fibers allow the cell to adapt its mechanics to environmental conditions and to protect it from structural damage. While the physical description of single stress fibers is well-developed, much less is known about their spatial distribution on the level of whole cells. Here, we combine a finite element method for one-dimensional fibers embedded in an elastic bulk medium with dynamical rules for stress fiber formation based on genetic algorithms. We postulate that their main goal is to achieve minimal mechanical stress in the bulk material with as few fibers as possible. The fiber positions and configurations resulting from this optimization task alone are in good agreement with those found in experiments where cells in 3D-scaffolds were mechanically strained at one attachment point. For optimized configurations, we find that stress fibers typically run through the cell in a diagonal fashion, similar to reinforcement strategies used for composite material.</description>
