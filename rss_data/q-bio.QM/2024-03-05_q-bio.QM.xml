      <title>Synthesizing study-specific controls using generative models on open access datasets for harmonized multi-study analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuroimaging consortia can enhance reliability and generalizability of findings by pooling data across studies to achieve larger sample sizes. To adjust for site and MRI protocol effects, imaging datasets are often harmonized based on healthy controls. When data from a control group were not collected, statistical harmonization options are limited as patient characteristics and acquisition-related variables may be confounded. Here, in a multi-study neuroimaging analysis of Alzheimer's patients and controls, we tested whether it is possible to generate synthetic control MRIs. For one case-control study, we used a generative adversarial model for style-based harmonization to generate site-specific controls. Downstream feature extraction, statistical harmonization and group-level multi-study case-control and case-only analyses were performed twice, using either true or synthetic controls. All effect sizes using synthetic controls overlapped with those based on true study controls. This line of work may facilitate wider inclusion of case-only studies in multi-study consortia.</description>

      <title>Few-shot genes selection: subset of PAM50 genes for breast cancer subtypes classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: In recent years, researchers have made significant strides in understanding the heterogeneity of breast cancer and its various subtypes. However, the wealth of genomic and proteomic data available today necessitates efficient frameworks, instruments, and computational tools for meaningful analysis. Despite its success as a prognostic tool, the PAM50 gene signature's reliance on many genes presents challenges in terms of cost and complexity. Consequently, there is a need for more efficient methods to classify breast cancer subtypes using a reduced gene set accurately.
  Results: This study explores the potential of achieving precise breast cancer subtype categorization using a reduced gene set derived from the PAM50 gene signature. By employing a "Few-Shot Genes Selection" method, we randomly select smaller subsets from PAM50 and evaluate their performance using metrics and a linear model, specifically the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. In addition, we aim to assess whether a more compact gene set can maintain performance while simplifying the classification process. Our findings demonstrate that certain reduced gene subsets can perform comparable or superior to the full PAM50 gene signature.
  Conclusions: The identified gene subsets, with 36 genes, have the potential to contribute to the development of more cost-effective and streamlined diagnostic tools in breast cancer research and clinical settings.</description>

      <title>FlowCyt: A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Approaches for Multi-Class Classification in Flow Cytometry Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents FlowCyt, the first comprehensive benchmark for multi-class single-cell classification in flow cytometry data. The dataset comprises bone marrow samples from 30 patients, with each cell characterized by twelve markers. Ground truth labels identify five hematological cell types: T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, Monocytes, Mast cells, and Hematopoietic Stem/Progenitor Cells (HSPCs). Experiments utilize supervised inductive learning and semi-supervised transductive learning on up to 1 million cells per patient. Baseline methods include Gaussian Mixture Models, XGBoost, Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks, and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs demonstrate superior performance by exploiting spatial relationships in graph-encoded data. The benchmark allows standardized evaluation of clinically relevant classification tasks, along with exploratory analyses to gain insights into hematological cell phenotypes. This represents the first public flow cytometry benchmark with a richly annotated, heterogeneous dataset. It will empower the development and rigorous assessment of novel methodologies for single-cell analysis.</description>

      <title>Non-Invasive Medical Digital Twins using Physics-Informed Self-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A digital twin is a virtual replica of a real-world physical phenomena that uses mathematical modeling to characterize and simulate its defining features. By constructing digital twins for disease processes, we can perform in-silico simulations that mimic patients' health conditions and counterfactual outcomes under hypothetical interventions in a virtual setting. This eliminates the need for invasive procedures or uncertain treatment decisions. In this paper, we propose a method to identify digital twin model parameters using only noninvasive patient health data. We approach the digital twin modeling as a composite inverse problem, and observe that its structure resembles pretraining and finetuning in self-supervised learning (SSL). Leveraging this, we introduce a physics-informed SSL algorithm that initially pretrains a neural network on the pretext task of solving the physical model equations. Subsequently, the model is trained to reconstruct low-dimensional health measurements from noninvasive modalities while being constrained by the physical equations learned in pretraining. We apply our method to identify digital twins of cardiac hemodynamics using noninvasive echocardiogram videos, and demonstrate its utility in unsupervised disease detection and in-silico clinical trials.</description>

      <title>Understanding the role of B-cells in CAR T-cell therapy in leukemia through a mathematical mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR-T) cell therapy has been proven to be successful against different leukaemias and lymphomas. This paper makes an analytical and numerical study of a mathematical model describing the competition of CAR-T, leukaemias tumor and B cells. Considering its significance in sustaining anti-CD19 CAR T-cell stimulation, we integrate a B-cell source term into the model. Through stability and bifurcation analyses, we reveal the potential for tumor eradication contingent on the continuous influx of B-cells, uncovering a transcritical bifurcation at a critical B-cell input. Additionally, we identify an almost heteroclinic cycle between equilibrium points, providing a theoretical basis for understanding disease relapse. Analyzing the oscillatory behavior of the system, we approximate the time-dependent dynamics of CAR T-cells and leukemic cells, shedding light on the impact of initial tumor burden on therapeutic outcomes. In conclusion, our study provides insights into CAR T-cell therapy dynamics for acute lymphoblastic leukemias, offering a theoretical foundation for clinical observations and suggesting avenues for future immunotherapy modeling research.</description>

      <title>Is your data alignable? Principled and interpretable alignability testing and integration of single-cell data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-cell data integration can provide a comprehensive molecular view of cells, and many algorithms have been developed to remove unwanted technical or biological variations and integrate heterogeneous single-cell datasets. Despite their wide usage, existing methods suffer from several fundamental limitations. In particular, we lack a rigorous statistical test for whether two high-dimensional single-cell datasets are alignable (and therefore should even be aligned). Moreover, popular methods can substantially distort the data during alignment, making the aligned data and downstream analysis difficult to interpret. To overcome these limitations, we present a spectral manifold alignment and inference (SMAI) framework, which enables principled and interpretable alignability testing and structure-preserving integration of single-cell data with the same type of features. SMAI provides a statistical test to robustly assess the alignability between datasets to avoid misleading inference, and is justified by high-dimensional statistical theory. On a diverse range of real and simulated benchmark datasets, it outperforms commonly used alignment methods. Moreover, we show that SMAI improves various downstream analyses such as identification of differentially expressed genes and imputation of single-cell spatial transcriptomics, providing further biological insights. SMAI's interpretability also enables quantification and a deeper understanding of the sources of technical confounders in single-cell data.</description>

      <title>Wireless Ear EEG to Monitor Drowsiness</title>

Abstract: Wireless, neural wearables can enable life-saving drowsiness, cognitive, and health monitoring for heavy machinery operators, pilots, and drivers. While existing systems use in-cabin sensors to alert operators before accidents, wearables may enable monitoring across many user environments. Current neural wearables are promising but limited by consumable electrodes and bulky, wired electronics. To improve neural wearable usability, scalability, and enable discreet use in daily and itinerant environments, this work showcases an end-to-end system for the first wireless, in-ear, dry-electrode earpiece for monitoring drowsiness. The proposed platform integrates additive manufacturing processes for gold-plated dry electrodes, user-generic earpiece designs, wireless electronics, and low-complexity machine learning algorithms. To evaluate the platform, thirty-five hours of ExG data were recorded across nine subjects performing repetitive drowsiness-inducing tasks. The data was used to train three, offline classifier models (logistic regression, support vector machine, and random forest) and evaluated with three training regimes (user-specific, leave-one-trial-out, and leave-one-user-out). The support vector machine classifier achieved an average accuracy of 93.2% while evaluating users it has seen before and 93.3% when evaluating a never-before-seen user. These results demonstrate for the first time that dry, 3D printed, user-generic electrodes can be used with wireless electronics to rapidly prototype wearable systems, which achieve comparable average accuracy (&gt;90%) to existing state-of-the-art in-ear and scalp ExG systems that utilize wet electrodes and wired, benchtop electronics. Further, this work demonstrates the feasibility of using population-trained machine learning models in future, wearable ear ExG applications focused on cognitive health and wellness tracking.</description>
