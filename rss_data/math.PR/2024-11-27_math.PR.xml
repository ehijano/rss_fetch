      <title>Entropies of the Poisson distribution as functions of intensity: "normal" and "anomalous" behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper extends the analysis of the entropies of the Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda$. It demonstrates that the Tsallis and Sharma-Mittal entropies exhibit monotonic behavior with respect to $\lambda$, whereas two generalized forms of the R\'enyi entropy may exhibit "anomalous" (non-monotonic) behavior. Additionally, we examine the asymptotic behavior of the entropies as $\lambda \to \infty$ and provide both lower and upper bounds for them.</description>

      <title>On the first hitting time of a high-dimensional orthant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a collection of independent standard Brownian particles (or random walks), starting from a configuration where at least one particle is positive, and study the first time they all become negative. This is clearly equivalent to studying the first hitting time from the negative orthant or the first exit time from the complement of the negative orthant. While it turns out to be possible to compute the distribution of these hitting times for one and two particles, the distribution (and even its tail asymptotics) is not known in closed form for three or more particles. In this paper we study the tail asymptotics of the distribution as the number of particles tends to infinity. Our main techniques come from spectral geometry: we prove new asymptotic estimates for the principal eigenvalue of the complement of a high-dimensional orthant, which we believe are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Two-barriers-reflected BSDE with Rank-based Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate two-barriers-reflected backward stochastic differential equations with data from rank-based stochastic differential equation. More specifically, we focus on the solution of backward stochastic differential equations restricted to two prescribed upper-boundary and lower-boundary processes. We rigorously show that this solution gives a probabilistic expression to the viscosity solution of some obstacle problems for the corresponding parabolic partial differential equations. As an application, the pricing problem of an American game option is studied.</description>

      <title>On the maximal correlation of some stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the maximal correlation coefficient $R(X,Y)$ between two stochastic processes $X$ and $Y$. When $(X,Y)$ is a random walk, the result is a consequence of Cs\'{a}ki-Fischer identity and lower-semi continuity of $\text{Law}(X,Y)\to R(X,Y)$. When $(X,Y)$ are two-dimensional L\'{e}vy processes, we give an expression of $R(X,Y)$ via the covariance $\Sigma$ and the L\'{e}vy measure $\nu$ appeared in the L\'{e}vy-Khinchine formula. As a consequence, for two-dimensional $\alpha$-stable random variables $(X,Y)$ with $0&lt;\alpha&lt;2$, we give an expression of $R(X,Y)$ via the spectral measure of the $\alpha$-stable distribution. We also prove analogs and generalizations of Dembo-Kagan-Shepp-Yu inequality and Madiman-Barron inequality. Roughly speaking, we investigate the maximal correlation coefficient between two random selected ``subvectors'' $Y$ and $Z$ of a common random vector $X$. Besides, by using above new results, we recover several classical results.</description>

      <title>Large deviations of the empirical measures of a strong-Feller Markov process inside a subset and quasi-ergodic distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we establish, for a strong Feller process, the large deviation principle for the occupation measure conditioned not to exit a given subregion. The rate function vanishes only at a unique measure, which is the so-called quasi-ergodic distribution of the process in this subregion. In addition, we show that the rate function is the Dirichlet form in the particular case when the process is reversible. We apply our results to several stochastic processes such as the solutions of elliptic stochastic differential equations driven by a rotationally invariant $\alpha$-stable process, the kinetic Langevin process, and the overdamped Langevin process driven by a Brownian motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stationary measures for variants of the Porous Medium Model in dimension 1. These are exclusion processes that belong to the class of kinetically constrained models, in which an exchange can occur between $x$ and $x+1$ only if there is a particle either at $x-1$ or $x+2$. We show that any stationary probability measure can be decomposed into a frozen part and a mixture of product measures (although there exist invariant sets which have zero probability under these measures).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional exclusion dynamics in mild contact with boundary reservoirs. In the diffusive scale, the particles' density evolves as the solution of the heat equation with non-linear Robin boundary conditions. For appropriate choices of the boundary rates, these partial differential equations have more than one stationary solution. We prove the dynamical large deviations principle.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by a $N$-dimension complex vector $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ whose entries are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear spectral problem and by $N$ nonzero complex norming constants. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support on the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the Zakharov-Shabat linear problem for the expectation of the random measure associated to the spectral data. We denote the corresponding solution of the fNLS equation by $\psi_\infty(x,t)$. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R \times \mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Quaternionic Green's Function and the Brown Measure of Atomic Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the Brown measure the non-normal operators $X = p + i q$, where $p$ and $q$ are Hermitian, freely independent, and have spectra consisting of finitely many atoms. We use the Quaternionic Green's function, an analogue of the operator-valued $R$-transform in the physics literature, to understand the support and the boundary of the Brown measure of $X$. We present heuristics for the boundary and support of the Brown measure in terms of the Quaternionic Green's function and verify they are true in the cases when the Brown measure of $X$ has been explicitly computed. In the general case, we show that the heuristic implies that the boundary of the Brown measure of $X$ is an algebraic curve, and provide an algorithm producing a polynomial defining this curve.</description>

In the one-dimensional case, this constant is even optimal. From these inequalities, we derive concentration results, which allow concluding the case of the pathological dimension two.</description>

      <title>Decision making in stochastic extensive form II: Stochastic extensive forms and games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A general theory of stochastic extensive forms is developed to bridge two concepts of information flow: decision trees and refined partitions on the one side, filtrations from probability theory on the other. Instead of the traditional "nature" agent, this framework uses a single lottery draw to select a tree of a given decision forest. Each "personal" agent receives dynamic updates from an own oracle on the lottery outcome and makes partition-refining choices adapted to this information. This theory addresses a key limitation of existing approaches in extensive form theory, which struggle to model continuous-time stochastic processes, such as Brownian motion, as outcomes of "nature" decision making. Additionally, a class of stochastic extensive forms based on time-indexed action paths is constructed, encompassing a wide range of models from the literature and laying the groundwork for an approximation theory for stochastic differential games in extensive form.</description>

Abstract: P\'olya trees are rooted, unlabeled trees on $n$ vertices. This paper gives an efficient, new way to generate P\'olya trees. This allows comparing typical unlabeled and labeled tree statistics and comparing asymptotic theorems with `reality'.
  Along the way, we give a product formula for the number of rooted labeled trees preserved by a given automorphism; this refines Cayley's formula.</description>

Abstract: We study the Karp--Sipser core of a random graph made of a configuration model with vertices of degree $1,2$ and $3$. This core is obtained by recursively removing the leaves as well as their unique neighbors in the graph. We settle a conjecture of Bauer &amp; Golinelli and prove that at criticality, the Karp--Sipser core has size $ \approx \mathrm{Cst} \cdot \vartheta^{-2} \cdot n^{3/5}$ where $\vartheta$ is the hitting time of the curve $t \mapsto \frac{1}{t^{2}}$ by a linear Brownian motion started at $0$. Our proof relies on a detailed multi-scale analysis of the Markov chain associated to Karp-Sipser leaf-removal algorithm close to its extinction time.</description>

      <title>Universality of global asymptotics of Jack-deformed random Young diagrams at varying temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04089v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes universal formulas describing the global asymptotics of two distinct discrete versions of $\beta$-ensembles in the high, low and fixed temperature regimes. Our results affirmatively answer a question posed by the second author and \'Sniady.
  We first introduce a special class of Jack measures on Young diagrams of arbitrary size, called the ``Jack--Thoma measures'', and prove the LLN and CLT in the three aforementioned limit regimes. In each case, we provide explicit formulas for polynomial observables of the limit shape and Gaussian fluctuations around the limit shape. These formulas have surprising positivity properties and are expressed as sums of weighted lattice paths. Second, we show that the previous formulas are universal: they also describe the limit shape and Gaussian fluctuations for the model of random Young diagrams of a fixed size derived from Jack characters with the approximate factorization property. Finally, in stark contrast with continuous $\beta$-ensembles, we show that the limit shapes at high and low temperatures of our random Young diagrams are one-sided infinite staircase shapes. For the Jack--Plancherel measure, we describe this shape explicitly by relating its local minima with the zeroes of Bessel functions.</description>

      <title>Coupling results and Markovian structures for number representations of continuous random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A general setting for nested subdivisions of a bounded real set into intervals defining the digits $X_1,X_2,...$ of a random variable $X$ with a probability density function $f$ is considered. Under the weak condition that $f$ is almost everywhere lower semi-continuous, a coupling between $X$ and a non-negative integer-valued random variable $N$ is established so that $X_1,...,X_N$ have an interpretation as the ``sufficient digits'', since the distribution of $R=(X_{N+1},X_{N+2},...)$ conditioned on $S=(X_1,...,X_N)$ does not depend on $f$. Adding a condition about a Markovian structure of the lengths of the intervals in the nested subdivisions, $R\,|\,S$ becomes a Markov chain of a certain order $s\ge0$. If $s=0$ then $X_{N+1},X_{N+2},...$ are IID with a known distribution. When $s&gt;0$ and the Markov chain is uniformly geometric ergodic, a coupling is established between $(X,N)$ and a random time $M$ so that the chain after time $\max\{N,s\}+M-s$ is stationary and $M$ follows a simple known distribution. The results are related to several examples of number representations generated by a dynamical system, including base-$q$ expansions, generalized L\"uroth series, $\beta$-expansions, and continued fraction representations. The importance of the results and some suggestions and open problems for future research are discussed.</description>

      <title>The Hausdorff measure of the boundary of the Brownian disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the boundary $\partial \mathbb D$ of the Brownian disk $\mathbb D$ as a metric space by endowing it with the (restriction of the) metric of $\mathbb D$. We show that the uniform measure on $\partial \mathbb D$ coincides with the Hausdorff measure associated with the gauge function $h(s)=\kappa s^2\log\log(1/s)$ for some deterministic constant $\kappa&gt;0$. We also state the analogous result for the boundary of the Brownian half-plane $\mathbb H$. This proves in particular that the uniform measure on the boundary of the Brownian disk (resp. the Brownian half-plane) is determined by the metric on $\mathbb D$ (resp. on $\mathbb H$).</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Error Analysis of Multilevel Stochastic Approximations for the Value-at-Risk and Expected Shortfall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15333v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cr\'epey, Frikha, and Louzi (2023) introduced a nested stochastic approximation algorithm and its multilevel acceleration to compute the value-at-risk and expected shortfall of a random financial loss. We hereby establish central limit theorems for the renormalized estimation errors associated with both algorithms as well as their averaged versions. Our findings are substantiated through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Limiting Spectral Distribution of a Random Commutator Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of a class of random matrices of the form $S_n^{-} = n^{-1}(X_1 X_2^* - X_2 X_1^*)$ where $X_k = \Sigma^{1/2}Z_k$, for $k=1,2$, $Z_k$'s are independent $p\times n$ complex-valued random matrices, and $\Sigma$ is a $p\times p$ positive semi-definite matrix, independent of the $Z_k$'s. We assume that $Z_k$'s have independent entries with zero mean and unit variance. The skew-symmetric/skew-Hermitian matrix $S_n^{-}$ will be referred to as a random commutator matrix associated with the samples $X_1$ and $X_2$. We show that, when the dimension $p$ and sample size $n$ increase simultaneously, so that $p/n \to c \in (0,\infty)$, there exists a limiting spectral distribution (LSD) for $S_n^{-}$, supported on the imaginary axis, under the assumptions that the spectral distribution of $\Sigma$ converges weakly and the entries of $Z_k$'s have moments of sufficiently high order. This nonrandom LSD can be described through its Stieltjes transform, which satisfies a coupled Mar\v{c}enko-Pastur-type functional equations. In the special case when $\Sigma = I_p$, we show that the LSD of $S_n^{-}$ is a mixture of a degenerate distribution at zero (with positive mass if $c &gt; 2$), and a continuous distribution with a symmetric density function supported on a compact interval on the imaginary axis. Moreover, we show that the companion matrix $S_n^{+} = \Sigma_n^\frac{1}{2}(Z_1Z_2^* + Z_2Z_1^*)\Sigma_n^\frac{1}{2}$, under identical assumptions, has an LSD supported on the real line, which can be similarly characterized.</description>

      <title>Median Based Unit Weibull (MBUW): a new unit distribution Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19019v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new 2 parameter unit Weibull distribution is defined on the unit interval (0,1). The methodology of deducing its PDF, some of its properties and related functions are discussed. The paper is supplied by many figures illustrating the new distribution and how this can make it illegible to fit a wide range of skewed data. The new distribution holds a name (Attia) as a nickname.</description>

      <title>The Brown Measure of Non-Hermitian Sums of Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the Brown measure of the non-normal operators $X = p + i q$, where $p$ and $q$ are Hermitian, freely independent, and have spectra consisting of $2$ atoms. The computation relies on the model of the non-trivial part of the von Neumann algebra generated by 2 projections as $2 \times 2$ random matrices. We observe that these measures are supported on hyperbolas and note some other properties related to their atoms and symmetries.</description>
