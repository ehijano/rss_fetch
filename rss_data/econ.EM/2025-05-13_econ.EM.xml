      <title>Exploring Monetary Policy Shocks with Large-Scale Bayesian VARs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I introduce a high-dimensional Bayesian vector autoregressive (BVAR) framework designed to estimate the effects of conventional monetary policy shocks. The model captures structural shocks as latent factors, enabling computationally efficient estimation in high-dimensional settings through a straightforward Gibbs sampler. By incorporating time variation in the effects of monetary policy while maintaining tractability, the methodology offers a flexible and scalable approach to empirical macroeconomic analysis using BVARs, well-suited to handle data irregularities observed in recent times. Applied to the U.S. economy, I identify monetary shocks using a combination of high-frequency surprises and sign restrictions, yielding results that are robust across a wide range of specification choices. The findings indicate that the Federal Reserve's influence on disaggregated consumer prices fluctuated significantly during the 2022-24 high-inflation period, shedding new light on the evolving dynamics of monetary policy transmission.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lee Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.12720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.12720v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lee (2009) is a common approach to bound the average causal effect in the presence of selection bias, assuming the treatment effect on selection has the same sign for all subjects. This paper generalizes Lee bounds to allow the sign of this effect to be identified by pretreatment covariates, relaxing the standard (unconditional) monotonicity to its conditional analog. Asymptotic theory for generalized Lee bounds is proposed in low-dimensional smooth and high-dimensional sparse designs. The paper also generalizes Lee bounds to accommodate multiple outcomes. Focusing on JobCorps job training program, I first show that unconditional monotonicity is unlikely to hold, and then demonstrate the use of covariates to tighten the bounds.</description>

      <title>Robust Estimation and Inference in Panels with Interactive Fixed Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.06639v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider estimation and inference for a regression coefficient in panels with interactive fixed effects (i.e., with a factor structure). We demonstrate that existing estimators and confidence intervals (CIs) can be heavily biased and size-distorted when some of the factors are weak. We propose estimators with improved rates of convergence and bias-aware CIs that remain valid uniformly, regardless of factor strength. Our approach applies the theory of minimax linear estimation to form a debiased estimate, using a nuclear norm bound on the error of an initial estimate of the interactive fixed effects. Our resulting bias-aware CIs take into account the remaining bias caused by weak factors. Monte Carlo experiments show substantial improvements over conventional methods when factors are weak, with minimal costs to estimation accuracy when factors are strong.</description>

      <title>Transformers Handle Endogeneity in In-Context Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the capability of transformers to address endogeneity in in-context linear regression. Our main finding is that transformers inherently possess a mechanism to handle endogeneity effectively using instrumental variables (IV). First, we demonstrate that the transformer architecture can emulate a gradient-based bi-level optimization procedure that converges to the widely used two-stage least squares $(\textsf{2SLS})$ solution at an exponential rate. Next, we propose an in-context pretraining scheme and provide theoretical guarantees showing that the global minimizer of the pre-training loss achieves a small excess loss. Our extensive experiments validate these theoretical findings, showing that the trained transformer provides more robust and reliable in-context predictions and coefficient estimates than the $\textsf{2SLS}$ method, in the presence of endogeneity.</description>

      <title>Design-Based Inference under Random Potential Outcomes via Riesz Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01324v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for design-based causal inference that accommodates random potential outcomes, thereby extending the classical Neyman-Rubin setup in which outcomes are treated as fixed. In our formulation, each unit's potential outcome is modelled as a function \( \tilde{y}_i(z, \omega) \), where \( \omega \) denotes latent randomness external to the treatment assignment. Building on recent work connecting design-based estimation with the Riesz representation theorem, we construct causal estimators by embedding potential outcomes in a Hilbert space and defining treatment effects as linear functionals. This approach yields unbiased and consistent estimators, even when outcomes exhibit random variation. The framework retains the key strength of design-based analysis, identification via a known randomisation scheme, while enabling inference in settings with outcome-level stochasticity. We establish large-sample properties under local dependence and propose plug-in variance estimators, including a correlation-based version that improves efficiency under sparse dependence. A simulation study illustrates the finite-sample behaviour of the estimator. Our results unify design-based reasoning with random outcome modelling, broadening the applicability of causal inference in complex experimental environments.</description>
