      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Massive Internet of Things (MIoT) envisions an interconnected ecosystem of billions of devices, fundamentally transforming diverse sectors such as healthcare, smart cities, transportation, agriculture, and energy management. However, the vast scale of MIoT introduces significant challenges, including network scalability, efficient data management, energy conservation, and robust security mechanisms. This paper presents a thorough review of existing and emerging MIoT technologies designed to address these challenges, including Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN), 5G/6G capabilities, edge and fog computing architectures, and hybrid access methodologies. We further investigate advanced strategies such as AI-driven resource allocation, federated learning for privacy-preserving analytics, and decentralized security frameworks using blockchain. Additionally, we analyze sustainable practices, emphasizing energy harvesting and integrating green technologies to reduce environmental impact. Through extensive comparative analysis, this study identifies critical innovations and architectural adaptations required to support efficient, resilient, and scalable MIoT deployments. Key insights include the role of network slicing and intelligent resource management for scalability, adaptive protocols for real-time data handling, and lightweight AI models suited to the constraints of MIoT devices. This research ultimately contributes to a deeper understanding of how MIoT systems can evolve to meet the growing demand for seamless, reliable connectivity while prioritizing sustainability, security, and performance across diverse applications. Our findings serve as a roadmap for future advancements, underscoring the potential of MIoT to support a globally interconnected, intelligent infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Fluid Volume Assignment for Flow-Based Biochips: State-of-the-Art and Research Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microfluidic biochips are replacing the conventional biochemical analysers integrating the necessary functions on-chip. We are interested in Flow-Based Microfluidic Biochips (FBMB), where a continuous flow of liquid is manipulated using integrated microvalves. Using microvalves and channels, more complex Fluidic Units (FUs) such as switches, micropumps, mixers and separators can be constructed. When running a biochemical application on a FBMB, fluid volumes are dispensed from input reservoirs and used by the FUs. Given a biochemical application and a biochip, one of the key problems which we are discussing in this paper, is in determining the fluid volume assignment for each operation of the application, such that the FUs' volume requirements are satisfied, while over- and underflow are avoided and the total volume of fluid used is minimized. We illustrate the main problems using examples, and provide a review of related work on volume management. We present algorithms for optimizing fluid volume assignments and for reusing leftover fluids to reduce waste. This also includes the optimization of mixing operations which significantly impact the required fluid volumes. We identify the main challenges related to volume management and discuss possible solutions. Finally we compare the outcome of volume management using fixed- and arbitrary-ratio mixing technology, demonstrating significant reductions in fluid consumption for real biochemical assays.</description>

      <title>DNA Tails for Molecular Flash Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DNA-based data storage systems face practical challenges due to the high cost of DNA synthesis. A strategy to address the problem entails encoding data via topological modifications of the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone. The DNA Punchcards system, which introduces nicks (cuts) in the DNA backbone, encodes only one bit per nicking site, limiting density. We propose \emph{DNA Tails,} a storage paradigm that encodes nonbinary symbols at nicking sites by growing enzymatically synthesized single-stranded DNA of varied lengths. The average tail lengths encode multiple information bits and are controlled via a staggered nicking-tail extension process. We demonstrate the feasibility of this encoding approach experimentally and identify common sources of errors, such as calibration errors and stumped tail growth errors. To mitigate calibration errors, we use rank modulation proposed for flash memory. To correct stumped tail growth errors, we introduce a new family of rank modulation codes that can correct ``stuck-at'' errors. Our analytical results include constructions for order-optimal-redundancy permutation codes and accompanying encoding and decoding algorithms.</description>

      <title>Iterative Resolution of Prompt Ambiguities Using a Progressive Cutting-Search Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI systems have revolutionized human interaction by enabling natural language-based coding and problem solving. However, the inherent ambiguity of natural language often leads to imprecise instructions, forcing users to iteratively test, correct, and resubmit their prompts. We propose an iterative approach that systematically narrows down these ambiguities through a structured series of clarification questions and alternative solution proposals, illustrated with input/output examples as well. Once every uncertainty is resolved, a final, precise solution is generated. Evaluated on a diverse dataset spanning coding, data analysis, and creative writing, our method demonstrates superior accuracy, competitive resolution times, and higher user satisfaction compared to conventional one-shot solutions, which typically require multiple manual iterations to achieve a correct output.</description>

      <title>Exploring the application of quantum technologies to industrial and real-world use cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing are leading to an era of practical utility, enabling the tackling of increasingly complex problems. The goal of this era is to leverage quantum computing to solve real-world problems in fields such as machine learning, optimization, and material simulation, using revolutionary quantum methods and machines. All this progress has been achieved even while being immersed in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, characterized by the current devices' inability to process medium-scale complex problems efficiently. Consequently, there has been a surge of interest in quantum algorithms in various fields. Multiple factors have played a role in this extraordinary development, with three being particularly noteworthy: (i) the development of larger devices with enhanced interconnections between their constituent qubits, (ii) the development of specialized frameworks, and (iii) the existence of well-known or ready-to-use hybrid schemes that simplify the method development process. In this context, this manuscript presents and overviews some recent contributions within this paradigm, showcasing the potential of quantum computing to emerge as a significant research catalyst in the fields of machine learning and optimization in the coming years.</description>

      <title>Modular Autonomous Virtualization System for Two-Dimensional Semiconductor Quantum Dot Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Arrays of gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots are among the leading candidates for building scalable quantum processors. High-fidelity initialization, control, and readout of spin qubit registers require exquisite and targeted control over key Hamiltonian parameters that define the electrostatic environment. However, due to the tight gate pitch, capacitive crosstalk between gates hinders independent tuning of chemical potentials and interdot couplings. While virtual gates offer a practical solution, determining all the required cross-capacitance matrices accurately and efficiently in large quantum dot registers is an open challenge. Here, we establish a modular automated virtualization system (MAViS) -- a general and modular framework for autonomously constructing a complete stack of multilayer virtual gates in real time. Our method employs machine learning techniques to rapidly extract features from two-dimensional charge stability diagrams. We then utilize computer vision and regression models to self-consistently determine all relative capacitive couplings necessary for virtualizing plunger and barrier gates in both low- and high-tunnel-coupling regimes. Using MAViS, we successfully demonstrate accurate virtualization of a dense two-dimensional array comprising ten quantum dots defined in a high-quality Ge/SiGe heterostructure. Our work offers an elegant and practical solution for the efficient control of large-scale semiconductor quantum dot systems.</description>

      <title>SemSpaceFL: A Collaborative Hierarchical Federated Learning Framework for Semantic Communication in 6G LEO Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00966v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, enhanced by artificial intelligence, promises ubiquitous connectivity through Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. These satellites are capable of collecting vast amounts of geographically diverse and real-time data, which can be immensely valuable for training intelligent models. However, limited inter-satellite communication and data privacy constraints hinder data collection on a single server for training. Therefore, we propose SemSpaceFL, a novel hierarchical federated learning (HFL) framework for LEO satellite networks, with integrated semantic communication capabilities. Our framework introduces a two-tier aggregation architecture where satellite models are first aggregated at regional gateways before final consolidation at a cloud server, which explicitly accounts for satellite mobility patterns and energy constraints. The key innovation lies in our novel aggregation approach, which dynamically adjusts the contribution of each satellite based on its trajectory and association with different gateways, which ensures stable model convergence despite the highly dynamic nature of LEO constellations. To further enhance communication efficiency, we incorporate semantic encoding-decoding techniques trained through the proposed HFL framework, which enables intelligent data compression while maintaining signal integrity. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed aggregation strategy achieves superior performance and faster convergence compared to existing benchmarks, while effectively managing the challenges of satellite mobility and energy limitations in dynamic LEO networks.</description>
