      <title>Bundling of bipartite entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate bipartite entanglement and prove that in constrained energy subspaces, the entanglement spectra of multiple bipartitions are the same across the whole subspace. We show that in quantum many-body systems the bipartite entanglement entropy is affected in such a way that it forms "bundles" under unitary time evolution. Leveraging the structure of the subspace, we present methods to verify whether the entanglement spectrum of two bipartitions is identical throughout the entire subspace. For the subspace defined by the parity embedding, we further provide an algorithm that can determine this in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Subsystems (in)dependence in GIE proposals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17024v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent proposals suggest that detecting entanglement between two spatially superposed masses would establish the quantum nature of gravity. However, these gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) experiments rely on assumptions about subsystem independence. We sharpen the theoretical underpinnings of such proposals by examining them through the lens of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT), distinguishing distinct operational and algebraic notions of independence. We argue that state and measurement independence of subsystems, essential to the experimental logic, is nontrivial in the presence of gauge constraints and gravitational dressing. Using gravitationally dressed fields, we recall that commutation relations between spacelike separated observables are nontrivial, undermining strict Hilbert space factorization. We further explore the implications for entanglement witnesses, investigating the Tsirelson bound when subsystem algebras fail to commute, and showing that the Tsirelson bound persists for a suitably symmetrized CHSH observable even though the operational status of such "joint" observables becomes delicate when commensurability fails. Our analysis highlights how even within linearized covariant quantum gravity, violations of microcausality may affect both the interpretation, modelling, and design of proposed laboratory tests of quantum gravity, despite remaining negligible for current experimental regimes. Although we consider GIE-style protocols as a concrete case study, the subsystem-independence issues we highlight are generic to low-energy (perturbative) quantum gravity. Finally, we derive estimates for dressing-induced microcausality violations, which suggest a complementary avenue to current proposals: in principle, bounding dressing-induced microcausality violations themselves as a probe of the quantum nature of gravity.</description>

      <title>Comparing Homodyne and Heterodyne Tomography of Quantum States of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian quantum states are critical resources in photonic quantum information processing, rendering their generation and characterization of increasing importance in quantum optics. In this work, we theoretically and numerically analyze the relative efficiency of homodyne versus heterodyne measurements for reconstructing non-Gaussian states, a major outstanding question in continuous-variable tomography. Combining a Fisher information-based formalism with simulated experiments, we find homodyne tomography to outperform heterodyne measurements for all non-Gaussian states tested, although the separation between the two modalities proves significantly narrower than suggested by the asymptotic Cramer-Rao lower bound. Our results should find use for optimizing measurement strategies in practical continuous-variable quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Attosecond Control of Squeezed Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Squeezed light has revolutionized quantum metrology by enhancing interferometry for sensitive applications such as the detection of gravitational waves. Squeezed light has also played a pivotal role in quantum information science with numerous applications in quantum computing and communication. Previously, squeezed light has been primarily generated using nonlinear optical interactions, where control of the degree of squeezing was possible by tuning the nonlinearity of the generating medium using suitable material engineering. Here, we modulate the third-order nonlinear response in dielectrics with strong ultrafast laser fields to control the degree of squeezing on attosecond time scales. We demonstrate the ability to change the ultrafast squeezed light generated in the nonlinear process from amplitude-squeezed to phase-squeezed by controlling the strong-field-driven nonlinear response of the material through a sub-cycle phase delay between the input femtosecond laser pulses. The squeezing of quantum noise is measured using a frequency-resolved balanced homodyne detection scheme capable of extracting the field quadratures in different frequency modes simultaneously. Using this frequency-resolved measurement we extract the complete coherency matrix containing the quantum correlations between field quadratures across different frequency modes of the femtosecond squeezed light pulse. These results have major implications for the development of quantum light sources with unprecedented levels of control over quadrature squeezing, for applications in multimode quantum information processing, and for measuring transient quantum matter correlations via transduction to quantum field correlations in an ultrafast light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Molecular Quantum Computations on a Protein</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the implementation of a fragment-based, quantum-centric supercomputing workflow for computing molecular electronic structure using quantum hardware. The workflow is applied to predict the relative energies of two conformers of the 300-atom Trp-cage miniprotein. The methodology employs wave function-based embedding (EWF) as the underlying fragmentation framework, in which all atoms in the system are explicitly included in the CI treatment. CI calculations for individual fragments are performed using either sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) for challenging fragments or full configuration interaction (FCI) for trivial fragments. To assess the accuracy of SQD for fragment CI calculations, EWF-(FCI,SQD) results are compared against EWF-MP2 and EWF-CCSD benchmarks. Overall, the results demonstrate that large-scale electronic configuration interaction (CI) simulations of protein systems containing hundreds or even thousands of atoms can be realized through the combined use of quantum and classical computing resources.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Sample-Based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization for Heisenberg Models with Applications to Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the Sample-based Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD) algorithm on one- and two-dimensional Heisenberg models, including strongly correlated regimes in which the ground state is dense. Using problem-informed initial states and magnetization-sector sweeps, SKQD accurately reproduces ground-state energies and field-dependent magnetization across a range of anisotropies. Benchmarks against DMRG and exact diagonalization show consistent qualitative agreement, with accuracy improving systematically in more anisotropic regimes. We further demonstrate SKQD on quantum hardware by implementing 18- and 30-qubit Heisenberg chains, obtaining magnetization curves that match theoretical expectations. Simulations on small 2D square-lattice systems further demonstrate that the method applies effectively beyond 1D geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a fractional time extension of the Quan tum Master Equation. We introduce a Caputo-type fractional derivative in time as an extension of the exponential decay of the Lindblad framework through the incorporation of fractional derivatives into the Lindblad framework. We show that the analytical and numerical results of our analytical and numerical models, demonstrate that fractional dynamics produces long-memory coherence decay naturally and provides an interpretable and flexible model of non-Markovianity.</description>

      <title>Zero-added-loss entanglement multiplexing using time-bin spectral shearing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-quality quantum communications that enable important capabilities, such as distributed quantum computing and sensing, will require quantum repeaters for providing high-quality entanglement. To realize high-rate heralded entanglement for quantum repeaters, Chen et al. [Phys. Rev. Appl. 19, 054209 (2023)] proposed a scheme for heralded-multiplexed generation of quasi-deterministic entangled photon pairs, called zero-added-loss multiplexing (ZALM). Here, we propose a design of ZALM source using time-bin entanglement and spectral shearing. Additionally, we provide an analysis of experimentally relevant spectral-shearing parameters to optimize the spectral multiplexing. Moreover, we experimentally verify the compatibility of time-bin pulses and spectral shearing, as supported by observation of no phase shift when the same shearing is applied to both time bins. These results expand the benefits of applying a ZALM source to time-bin entanglement use cases. Moreover, more fully demonstrating time-bin and spectral shearing compatibility clears a path towards a broader use of spectral shearing that provides a deterministic frequency shift of high utility.</description>

      <title>On-Demand Millisecond Storage of Spectro-Temporal Multimode Telecom Photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of scalable quantum networks for distribution of entanglement over long distances hinges on quantum repeaters. To outperform the exponential transmission loss in optical fibers, quantum repeaters must employ multiplexing schemes in the temporal, spectral, or spatial domain. The performance of such a multiplexed scheme is contingent on efficient quantum memories offering both extended storage times and large multimode capacities. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate such a memory operating at telecom wavelength using an Er$^{3+}$:Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$ crystal. Using single-photon detectors, we record on-demand storage and recall of weak coherent pulses for up to $1$ ms, exceeding that of previously reported quantum memories based on Er$^{3+}$. The memory exhibits an efficiency of 10.36\% at 300 $\mu$s storage time with a signal-to-noise ratio of $10.9$. We further showcase its multimode capacity by storing 20 temporal and 3 spectral modes simultaneously with on-demand and selective recall capabilities, essential for a scalable quantum repeater architecture.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced Information Retrieval from Reflective Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information retrieval from passive backscatter systems is widely used in digital applications with tight energy budgets, short communication distances, and low data rates. Due to the fundamental limits of classical wireless receivers, the achievable data rate cannot be increased without compromising either energy efficiency or communication range, thereby hindering the broader adoption of this technology. In this work, we present a novel time-resolving quantum receiver combined with a multi-mode probing signal to extract large-alphabet information modulated by a passive reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). The adaptive nature of the proposed receiver yields significant quantum advantages over classical receivers without relying on complex or fragile quantum resources such as entanglement. Simulation results show that the proposed technique surpasses the classical standard quantum limit (SQL) for modulation sizes up to M = 2^8, meanwhile halving the probing energy or increasing the communication distance by a factor of 1.41.</description>

      <title>Bound states and decay dynamics in $N$-level Friedrichs model with factorizable interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Considering an $N$-level system interacting factorizably with a continuous spectrum, we derive analytical expressions for the bound states and the dynamical evolution within this single-excitation Friedrichs model by using the projection operator formalism. First, we establish explicit criteria to determine the number of bound states, whose existence suppresses the complete spontaneous decay of the system. Second, we derive the open system's dissipative dynamics, which is naturally described by an energy-independent non-Hermitian Hamiltonian in the Markovian limit. As an example, we apply our framework to an atomic chain embedded in a photonic crystal waveguide, uncovering a rich variety of decay dynamics and realizing an anti-$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Hamiltonian in the system's evolution.</description>

      <title>Emergent Universality Class in Dissipative Quantum Systems with Dipole Moment Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems remains one of the grand challenges of modern physics. In particular, increasing attention has been devoted to the emergence of non-equilibrium universality classes that have no equilibrium counterparts. A prominent example is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class realized in dissipative Bose-Einstein condensates. In this Letter, motivated by recent experimental advances, we investigate the universal dynamics of dissipative quantum systems with dipole moment conservation. We develop an effective field theory description, supported by a concrete quantum spin model, to capture the resulting universal behaviors. Our analysis unveils a novel strongly interacting non-equilibrium fixed point that governs the equal-time phase fluctuations in systems with either strong or weak dipole symmetries. Moreover, charge transport becomes subdiffusive in the presence of strong dipole symmetry, while it remains diffusive in the weakly symmetric case. Our results reveal the intricate interplay between kinetic constraints and dissipation in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>An edge-based and subspace reduction encoding scheme to solve the traveling salesman problem in quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel edge-based encoding technique for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) on a quantum computer, reducing the required number of qubits. For implementation in real quantum devices, we applied the subspace reduction encoding to further reduce the dimension of the TSP solution space. We attack the TSP for 4-, 5-, and 6-city instances in both simulators and real quantum computers across different encoding frameworks. Optimal solutions of the 4-city TSP instance are obtained on state-of-the art IQM quantum computer. Our study presents a comparative analysis between edge-based encoding scheme and the node-based encoding methodology in the literature. Our findings indicate that the proposed encoding scheme outperforms conventional methods in terms of statistical measures, quantum resource utilization, and computational efficiency when applied to smaller TSP instances.</description>

      <title>Spin minimum uncertainty states for refined uncertainty relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimum uncertainty states of the conventional Heisenberg uncertainty relation have been extensively studied and are often regarded as the most classical quantum states from the perspective of uncertainty, providing valuable insight into the nature of quantumness and its potential applications. In this work, we investigate the minimum uncertainty states associated with an information-theoretic refinement of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation in general spin systems. Using two different approaches, the matrix formulation and the Wick symbol representation, we derive explicit expressions for the states that saturate the uncertainty bound. We show that spin coherent states indeed achieve minimum uncertainty, consistent with their conventional identification as the classical states of spin systems. Moreover, we also identify additional classes of minimum uncertainty states beyond the coherent family. Finally, we compare the spin-system results with the previously studied bosonic case and elucidate the origin of the differences between the two settings.</description>

      <title>Microcomb-driven large-scale fully connected quantum network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fully connected quantum networks enable simultaneously connecting every user to every other user and are the most versatile and robust networking architecture. However, the scalability of such networks remains great challenge for practical applications. Here we construct a large-scale fully connected quantum network founded on two-photon Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interference, where user-to-user security is guaranteed even with untrusted network provider. Using integrated soliton microcomb (SMC) and photonic encoding chips, we realize precise massive parallel frequency generation and locking, high-visibility HOM interferences and measurement-device-independent (MDI) quantum key distribution. The proposed architecture enables a 200-user fully connected quantum network over 200 kilometers with strict information-theoretic security via untrusted network provider. The implemented networking architecture paves the way for realizing large-scale fully connected MDI quantum networks across metropolitan and intercity regions.</description>

      <title>The Standard Model Symmetry and Qubit Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research at the intersection of quantum gravity and quantum information theory has seen significant success in describing the emergence of spacetime and gravity from quantum states whose entanglement entropy approximately obeys an area law. In a different direction, the Kaluza-Klein proposal aims to recover gauge symmetries by means of dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional gravitational theories. Integrating both, gravitational and gauge degrees of freedom in $3+1$ dimensions may be obtained upon dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional emergent gravity. To this end, we show that entangled systems of two and three qubits can be associated with $5+1$ and $9+1$ dimensional spacetimes respectively, which are reduced to $3+1$ dimensions upon singling out a preferred complex direction. In the latter case, this reduction is invariant under a residual $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1) /\mathbb{Z}_6$ symmetry, the Standard Model gauge group. This motivates a picture in which spacetime emerges from the area law-contribution to the entanglement entropy, while gauge and matter degrees of freedom are due to area law-violating terms. We remark on a possible natural origin of the chirality of the weak force in the given construction. Furthermore, we highlight the possibility of using this construction in quantum simulations of Standard Model fields.</description>

      <title>Validating the calibrated creation of heralded single photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coincidence-count discrimination have turned utterly practical in the characterization of photon-pair processes and heralded single photons. Here, we implement a heralded single photon source based on parametric down-conversion (PDC) in a PP-KTP waveguide in the telecom wavelength range involving a low number of optical modes. We extend the toolbox for the loss-tolerant state characterization by combining conventional figures-of-merit in order to access the heralded state's mean photon number and its photon-number parity. Our experiment demonstrates that an accurate determination of these characteristics is possible just through simple photon-correlation measurements. We believe that our results can find usage in the calibrated creation of heralded single photons and in determining the expectation values of observables that are crucial for denoting a single quantum.</description>

Abstract: Rydberg atom-based RF sensors offer distinct advantages over conventional dipole antennas for electric field detection. This paper presents a system model and performance analysis of a Rydberg atom-based quantum radar, which employs optical readout via lasers and photon detectors instead of circuit-based receivers. We derive the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), compare it with classical radar, and estimate Doppler frequency using an invariant function-based method. Simulations show that the quantum radar achieves higher SNR and lower RMSE in velocity estimation than conventional radar.</description>

      <title>Single-Photon Scattering in a Waveguide Coupled to a Lossy or Gain Giant Atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates single-photon scattering in a one-dimensional coupled-resonator waveguide coupled to a giant atom with a complex on-site energy. Within the generalized projection operator formalism, we derive analytical expressions for the scattering coefficients. We find that a lossy giant atom absorbs the incident wave, whereas a gain giant atom not only amplifies the incident wave but also leads to scattering divergence at certain energies, corresponding to spectral singularities. We explore the critical scattering dynamics associated with these singularities, and attribute the persistent wave emission to the existence of a stationary bound state in the continuum. Due to the presence of this bound state, the conventional time-independent scattering theory proves inadequate for such a non-Hermitian system. Furthermore, we show that the system with gain always features at least one time-growing bound state, which dominates the long-time dynamics, and we verify our time-dependent theoretical predictions via numerical simulations of Gaussian wave packet scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient transfer of quantum states into a long-lived storage unit such as solid-state spin ensembles is widely recognized as a critical challenge with significant implications for quantum communication, sensing and computing applications. Here, we experimentally investigate the interaction of propagating squeezed microwaves with an electron spin resonance transition in order to evaluate the use of spin ensembles as quantum memories for GHz signals. We generate continuous variable microwave states with a squeezing of up to 5dB below the vacuum level and let this signal interrogate a spin ensemble, which is inductively coupled to a lumped element superconducting microwave resonator with a cooperativity of C=0.3. Analyzing this signal using Wigner tomography, we observe a transfer efficiency of around 61% between the squeezed microwaves and the spin excitation. We successfully model our experimental results with a dedicated steady-state model based on the quantum input-output formalism and provide guidance for design parameters required to enable spin-based quantum memories.</description>

      <title>Bias-Class Discrimination of Universal QRAM Boolean Memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the discrimination of Boolean memory configurations via a fixed Universal QRAM (U-QRAM) interface. Given query access to a quantum memory storing an unknown Boolean function $f:[N]\to\{0,1\}$, we ask: what can be inferred about the bias class of $f$ (its imbalance from $1/2$, up to complement symmetry) using coherent, addressable queries? We show that for exact-weight bias classes, the induced single-query ensemble state on the address register has a two-eigenspace structure that yields closed-form expressions for the single-copy Helstrom-optimal measurement and success probability. Because complementing $f$ changes the state $|\psi\rangle$ only by a global phase, hypotheses $p$ and $1-p$ are information-theoretically identical in this model; thus the natural discriminand is the phase-bias magnitude $|\mu|$ (equivalently $\mu^2$). This goes beyond the perfect-discrimination case of Deutsch-Jozsa and complements exact-identification settings such as Bernstein-Vazirani.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Picosecond-Precision Synchronization in Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurement-device-independent quantum key distribution (MDI-QKD) eliminates detector side-channel attacks by relocating all measurements to an untrusted intermediate node. However, its practical implementation critically relies on picosecond-level temporal synchronization between spatially separated users. In this work, we present a physically motivated autonomous synchronization algorithm for fiber-based MDI-QKD networks that does not require auxiliary optical channels or shared clock references. The method exploits round-trip optical pulse propagation and statistical signal detection in the presence of Gaussian noise. We derive analytical expressions for false-alarm probabilities, quantify detection reliability, and demonstrate through numerical modeling that synchronization accuracy better than 10~ps is achievable for channel lengths up to 100~km with realistic optical power levels. The proposed approach improves the scalability and robustness of MDI-QKD architectures and is directly applicable to metropolitan and backbone quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Refrigeration of a 1D gas of microwave photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss a conceptually simple scheme for cooling a one dimensional gas of microwave photons in a superconducting transmission line. By shunting one end of the transmission line by a nonlinear Josephson element, we show how a cooling mechanism can be engineered that transfers photons from high- into low-frequency modes, while preserving their total number. We evaluate the resulting nonequilibrium steady state of the photon gas, which arises from a competition between this engineered cooling process and the natural, number non-conserving thermalization with the surrounding bath. Our analysis predicts that for realistic experimental parameters, this mechanism can be used to prepare photonic gases at sub-millikelvin temperatures, considerably below the typical base temperature of a dilution refrigerator. In addition, the system exhibits a new type of condensation transition that does not occur in the corresponding equilibrium scenario. As an outlook, we discuss potential applications of this cooling approach for quantum simulation schemes with interacting microwave photons.</description>

      <title>Coherent phase control of orbital-angular-momentum light-induced torque in a double-tripod atom-light coupling scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a phase-controllable mechanism for generating optical torque in a five-level double-tripod (DT) atom-light coupling scheme interacting with four strong coherent control fields as well as two weak optical vortex probe beams carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM). The spatial phase gradients of the OAM-carrying probes induce a quantized torque that is transferred to the atoms, rotating them and generating a directed atomic flow within an annular geometry. Analytical solutions of the optical Bloch equations under steady-state conditions show that the induced torque and resulting rotational motion exhibit high sensitivity to phase variations. We show that the DT system coherently reconfigures into either coupled {\Lambda} or double-{\Lambda} schemes depending on the relative phases, with each configuration exhibiting distinct quantized torque characteristics. This enables precise phase control of the atomic current flow, with potential applications in quantum control, precision measurement, and quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the dynamics of closed quantum systems in the Bloch vector representation using methods from rigid body dynamics and the theory of integrable systems. To this end, equations of motion for Bloch components are derived from the von Neumann equation, which are mathematically equivalent to equations of motion for a distribution of point masses from classical mechanics. Furthermore, using the Heisenberg equation, another system of Bloch vector equations is derived, which forms an Euler-Poinsot system, as is commonly encountered in the theory of torque-free spinning tops. This is used to prove the Liouville integrability of the corresponding Hamilton equations of motion, whereby formal connections to the Neumann model of classical Hamiltonian dynamics and the Hamiltonian Euler-Poinsot model are drawn to identify the first integrals of motion. Within the same framework, stability criteria for quantum dynamics are then derived which correspond to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion resp. other criteria following from the Energy-Casimir method of classical Newtonian mechanics. Following that, specific solutions to the equations of motion are constructed that encode the complex dynamics of composite quantum systems. Eventually, to show that this formalism provides concrete physical predictions, an analogue of the intermediate axis theorem is derived and the effect of oscillating entanglement is discussed. As a basis for this, special types of solutions to the equations of motion are derived that constitute oscillating entangled states, i.e., dynamical quantum states that change their entanglement structure from maximally entangled to separable and vice versa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent rapid development of complexity theory applied to quantum mechanical processes we present the complete derivation of Nielsen's complexity of unitaries belonging to the representations of oscillator group. Our approach is based on the observation that the whole problem refers to the structure of the underlying group. The questions concerning the complexity of particular unitaries are solved by lifting the abstract structure to the operator level by considering the relevant unitary representation. For the class of right-invariant metrics obeying natural invariance condition we solve the geodesic equations on oscillator group. The solution is given explicitly in terms of elementary functions. Imposing the boundary conditions yield a transcendental equation and the length of the geodesic is given in terms of the solutions to the latter. Since the unitary irreducible representations of oscillator group are classified this allows us to compute, at least in principle, the complexity of any unitary operator belonging to the representation.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics in a Spherical Wedge: Complete Solution and Implications for Angular Momentum Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve the stationary Schr\"odinger equation for a particle confined to a 3D spherical wedge -- the region $\{(r,\theta,\phi): 0 \leq r \leq R,\, 0 \leq \theta \leq \pi,\, 0 \leq \phi \leq \Phi\}$ with Dirichlet BCs on all surfaces. This exactly solvable constrained-domain model exhibits spectral reorganisation under symmetry-breaking BCs and provides an operator-domain viewpoint on angular momentum quantisation. We obtain three main results. First, the stationary states are standing waves in the azimuthal coordinate and consequently are \emph{not} eigenstates of $\hat{L}_z$; we prove $\langle L_z \rangle = 0$ with $\Delta L_z = \hbar n_\phi\pi/\Phi \neq 0$, demonstrating that angular momentum projection becomes an observable with genuine quantum uncertainty rather than a good quantum number. Second, the effective azimuthal quantum number $\mu = n_\phi\pi/\Phi$ is generically non-integer, and square-integrability of the polar wavefunctions at both poles requires the angular eigenvalue parameter $\nu$ to satisfy $\nu - \mu \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$. This regularity constraint yields a hierarchy: sectoral solutions ($\nu = \mu$, satisfying the first-order highest-weight condition) exist for any real $\mu &gt; 0$, while tesseral and zonal solutions require integer steps, appearing only when $\mu$ itself is integer. Third, application to a Coulomb potential shows that the familiar integer angular momentum spectrum of hydrogen arises from the periodic identification $\phi \sim \phi + 2\pi$ that defines the full-sphere Hilbert space domain; modified boundary conditions yield a reorganised spectrum with non-integer effective angular momentum. The model clarifies the distinct roles of single-valuedness (selecting integer $m$ via azimuthal topology) and polar regularity (selecting integer $\ell \geq |m|$ via analytic constraints) in the standard quantisation of orbital angular momentum.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates quantum computing approaches for solving the windfarm layout optimization (WFLO) problems formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. We investigate two encoding methods that require fewer than one qubit per grid point: the previously developed Pauli correlation encoding (PCE) and a novel single-qubit operator encoding (SQOE). These methods are tested on three windfarm configurations - two from prior WFLO scaling studies and a new real-world model based on an existing windfarm in Wales. The improved encoding methods allow us to solve WFLO problems on $9\times 9$ grids using up to 20 qubits on a quantum computer simulator. The results show that both encoding methods perform competitively and demonstrate favorable scaling characteristics across the tested systems.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Multiplexed Millimeter-Wave Fault-Tolerant Superconducting Qubits Enabled by an On-Chip Nonreciprocal Control Bus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling superconducting quantum processors is fundamentally limited by the escalating complexity of cryogenic wiring and the debilitating effects of microwave crosstalk and Purcell decay. This paper proposes the concept of frequency-multiplexed millimeter-wave superconducting qubits and demonstrates a novel architecture that integrates an on-chip cryogenic nonreciprocal space-time-periodic superconducting frequency multiplier as a universal control bus for a frequency-multiplexed qubit array. The bus replaces multiple high-frequency XY drive lines with a single low-frequency input tone, which the multiplier converts into a comb of high-order harmonics, each resonantly addressing a distinct qubit. Crucially, the dynamic and nonreciprocal nature of the bus provides signal gain and intrinsic isolation that simultaneously suppresses Purcell decay, enhancing T1 times across all distinct-frequency qubits, and reduces coherent crosstalk by more than two orders of magnitude. The spatiotemporal modulation enables parametric frequency multiplication and creates wave-propagation dynamics analogous to cosmological expansion, with observed redshift-like broadening and deceleration of magnetic-field wavepackets. Theoretical modeling based on a non-Markovian master equation confirms that the engineered memory kernel extends coherence while reshaping the noise spectrum. Full error-budget analysis shows that the architecture maintains gate errors below the fault-tolerance threshold for arrays exceeding 25 qubits, converting a crosstalk-dominated error budget into one limited by intrinsic material coherence. This integrated, frequency-multiplexed, and nonreciprocal control bus therefore offers a path toward unprecedented I/O simplification, noise resilience, and scalable high-coherence quantum processin</description>

      <title>The threshold for quantum-classical correspondence is $D \sim \hbar^{\frac43}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In chaotic quantum systems, an initially localized quantum state can deviate strongly from the corresponding classical phase-space distribution after the Ehrenfest time $t_{\mathrm{E}} \sim \log(\hbar^{-1})$, even in the limit $\hbar \to 0$. Decoherence by the environment is often invoked to explain the persistence of the quantum-classical correspondence at longer timescales. Recent rigorous results for Lindblad dynamics with phase-space diffusion strength $D$ show that quantum and classical evolutions remain close for times that are exponentially longer than the Ehrenfest time whenever $D \gg \hbar^{\frac43}$, in units set by the classical Hamiltonian. At the same time, some heuristic arguments have suggested the weaker condition $D \gg \hbar^{2}$ always suffices. Here we construct an explicit Lindbladian that demonstrates that the scaling $D \sim \hbar^{\frac43}$ is indeed the threshold for quantum-classical correspondence beyond the Ehrenfest time. Our example uses a smooth time-dependent Hamiltonian and linear Lindblad operators generating homogeneous isotropic diffusion. It exhibits an $\hbar$-independent quantum-classical discrepancy at the Ehrenfest time whenever $D \ll \hbar^{\frac43}$, even for $\hbar$-independent "macroscopic" smooth observables.</description>

      <title>Fraud detection in credit card transactions using Quantum-Assisted Restricted Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Use cases for emerging quantum computing platforms become economically relevant as the efficiency of processing and availability of quantum computers increase. We assess the performance of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) assisted by quantum computing, running on real quantum hardware and simulators, using a real dataset containing 145 million transactions provided by Stone, a leading Brazilian fintech, for credit card fraud detection. The results suggest that the quantum-assisted RBM method is able to achieve superior performance in most figures of merit in comparison to classical approaches, even using current noisy quantum annealers. Our study paves the way for implementing quantum-assisted RBMs for general fault detection in financial systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum heat current in Terahertz-driven phonon systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of high-intensity ultrafast laser pulses has opened new opportunities for controlling and designing quantum materials. In particular, terahertz (THz) pulses can resonantly drive optical phonon modes, enabling dynamic manipulation of lattice degrees of freedom. In this work, we investigate the ultrafast quantum thermodynamics of optical phonon mode driven by a THz pulse by treating the phonon as an open quantum system coupled to a thermal environment within a Caldeira-Leggett-type framework. We derive the quantum heat current between the phonon and the bath and analyze its behavior under realistic pulse protocols. Our results demonstrate that ultrafast laser driving can reveal and even induce significant deviations from the commonly adopted Markovian approximation, thereby providing a pathway to probe and control non-Markovian dissipation in driven solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting non-Gaussian entanglement beyond Gaussian criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement is central to quantum theory, yet detecting it reliably in non-Gaussian systems remains a long-standing challenge. In continuous-variable platforms, inseparability tests based on Gaussian statistics - such as those of Duan and Simon - fail when quantum correlations are encoded in higher moments of the field quadratures. Here we introduce an inseparability criterion that exposes non-Gaussian entanglement that escapes covariance-based criteria by incorporating higher-order quadrature cumulants. The criterion extends Gaussian theory without requiring full state tomography and can be evaluated directly from homodyne and heterodyne data and is possible to extend to arbitrary superpositions of Fock states in two modes. This provides an experimentally viable approach for identifying non-Gaussian resources in continuous-variable platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital-analog quantum computing with two-level systems is a computational paradigm that combines an analog Hamiltonian with single-qubit gates to achieve universality. We extend this framework to $d$-level systems by conjugating an analog Hamiltonian block with single-qudit gates drawn from the Weyl-Heisenberg basis, which provides a natural set of operations for qudit architectures. More specifically, we propose a protocol to simulate arbitrary two-body Hamiltonians with at most $O(d^4 n^2)$ analog blocks. The power of this approach is illustrated by the simulation of many-body qudit spin Hamiltonians including magnetic quadrupolar terms.</description>

      <title>Inclusion constants for free spectrahedra with applications to quantum incompatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the matrix cube problem, inclusions of free spectrahedra have been used successfully to obtain relaxations of hard spectrahedral inclusion problems. The quality of such a relaxation is quantified by the inclusion constant associated with each free spectrahedron. While optimal values of inclusion constants were known in certain highly symmetric cases, no general method for computing them was available. In this work, we show that inclusion constants for Cartesian products of free simplices can be computed using methods from non-commutative polynomial optimization, together with a detailed analysis of the extreme points of the associated free spectrahedra. This analysis also yields new closed-form analytic expressions for these constants. As an application to quantum information theory, we prove new bounds on the amount of white noise that incompatible measurements can tolerate before they become compatible. In particular, we study the case of one dichotomic and one $k$-outcome measurement, as well as the case of four dichotomic qubit measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semidefinite relaxations of polynomial optimization have become a central tool for addressing the non-convex optimization problems over non-commutative operators that are ubiquitous in quantum information theory and, more in general, quantum physics. Yet, as these global relaxation methods rely on floating-point methods, the bounds issued by the semidefinite solver can - and often do - exceed the global optimum, undermining their certifiability. To counter this issue, we introduce a rigorous framework for extracting exact rational bounds on non-commutative optimization problems from numerical data, and apply it to several paradigmatic problems in quantum information theory. An extension to sparsity and symmetry-adapted semidefinite relaxations is also provided and compared to the general dense scheme. Our results establish rational post-processing as a practical route to reliable certification, pushing semidefinite optimization toward a certifiable standard for quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Continuum Limits of Lazy Open Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the continuous spacetime limit of the one dimensional lazy discrete time quantum walk, obtaining explicit macroscopic evolution equations for a three state model in the presence of decoherence. While continuum limits of two state quantum walks are well established, an explicit continuous spacetime formulation for the lazy three state walk, particularly including noise, has not previously been constructed. Using an SU(3) representation of a Grover type coin together with a Lindblad formulation of decoherence acting either on the coin or the spatial subspace, we systematically expand the discrete dynamics in both space and time to obtain continuum master equations governing the coarse grained evolution. The resulting generators yield a genuine partial differential equation description of the walk, going beyond purely probabilistic or spectral correspondences. We show that the unitary limit is governed by a Dirac-type SU(3) Hamiltonian describing ballistic advection of left and right moving modes coupled by local symmetric mixing, with the rest state acting as an additional internal degree of freedom. Coin dephasing selectively damps internal coherences while preserving coherent spatial transport, whereas spatial dephasing suppresses long range spatial interference and rapidly drives the dynamics toward classical behaviour. This continuum framework clarifies how internal symmetry, rest state coupling, and distinct decoherence channels shape large scale transport in lazy open quantum walks, and provides a foundation for future extensions toward multichannel quantum transport models and quantum-inspired algorithms.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a quantum comparator on an ion-trap quantum device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers are believed to solve a class of computational problems that are based on modular arithmetic faster than classical computers. Among the arithmetic building blocks, comparison of integer pairs is a primitive. Here we report its demonstration in the Reimei quantum computer at RIKEN, whose trapped-ion architecture provides all-to-all qubit connectivity together with high gate fidelities. We observe high success probabilities for bit widths n = 3, 5, 7, and 9: Under a conventional output-only success criterion we obtain 95% at n=9; under a stricter criterion additionally requiring the ancilla to be correct, the success is 69% at n=9. These results demonstrate reliable quantum comparison at scales far beyond those previously achieved experimentally, not only for comparators but also in the broader context of quantum arithmetic circuits.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic preparation of many-body quantum states: getting the beginning and ending right</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present numerical calculations, and simulations performed on a Rydberg atom quantum simulator, of the adiabatic evolution of many-body quantum systems around a quantum phase transition. We demonstrate that the end-to-end transfer error, for a given process duration and dissipative losses, can be suppressed by adopting smooth initial and final scheduling functions for the Hamiltonian. We consider a one-dimensional mixed-field Ising model, as well as a chain of Rydberg atoms, and compare numerical calculations and experimental results for the end-to-end transfer error with different schedule functions. We show, in particular, that if the time dependent Hamiltonian is $n$ times differentiable with vanishing $1^{st}$ to $n^{th}$ order derivatives in the beginning and in the end, the infidelity with respect to the final adiabatic eigenstate scales as $1/T^{n+1}$ when evolving for time $T$.</description>

      <title>Kerr-induced non-Gaussianity of ultrafast bright squeezed vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Gaussian states of light are a critical resource for fault-tolerant quantum computing and enhanced metrology, but are typically faint and often obtained via post-selection. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic generation of a bright non-Gaussian state by introducing a Kerr nonlinearity to a macroscopic state of light called bright squeezed vacuum (BSV). To characterize the resulting state, we use a single-shot f-2f interferometer to sample its Husimi function. We observe a clear transformation from a 2D Gaussian distribution to an 'S'-shaped non-Gaussian profile, which is the direct statistical evidence of the intensity-dependent nonlinear phase. The negativity of the Wigner function, which is an intrinsic property of any pure non-Gaussian state, cannot be observed because BSV is a mixed state even under minute optical loss. However, we show that BSV can be considered as a mixture of pure squeezed coherent states, for some of which Kerr-induced Wigner-function negativity is quite tolerant to loss. This work bridges the gap between quantum optics and ultrafast nonlinear optics, opening a path to quantum applications that require high photon flux.</description>

      <title>Domain-Aware Quantum Circuit for QML</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) that are expressive, trainable, and robust to hardware noise is a central challenge for quantum machine learning (QML) on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. We present a Domain-Aware Quantum Circuit (DAQC) that leverages image priors to guide locality-preserving encoding and entanglement via non-overlapping DCT-style zigzag windows. The design employs interleaved encode-entangle-train cycles, where entanglement is applied among qubits hosting neighboring pixels, aligned to device connectivity. This staged, locality-preserving information flow expands the effective receptive field without deep global mixing, enabling efficient use of limited depth and qubits. The design concentrates representational capacity on short-range correlations, reduces long-range two-qubit operations, and encourages stable optimization, thereby mitigating depth-induced and globally entangled barren-plateau effects. We evaluate DAQC on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and PneumoniaMNIST datasets. On quantum hardware, DAQC achieves performance competitive with strong classical baselines (e.g., ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) and substantially outperforming Quantum Circuit Search (QCS) baselines. To the best of our knowledge, DAQC, which uses a quantum feature extractor with only a linear classical readout (no deep classical backbone), currently achieves the best reported performance on real quantum hardware for QML-based image classification tasks. Code and pretrained models are available at: https://github.com/gurinder-hub/DAQC.</description>

      <title>Quantum Wasserstein distance for Gaussian states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal transport between classical probability distributions has been proven useful in areas such as machine learning and random combinatorial optimization. Quantum optimal transport, and the quantum Wasserstein distance as the minimal cost associated with transforming one quantum state to another, is expected to have implications in quantum state discrimination and quantum metrology. In this work, following the formalism introduced in [De Palma, G. and Trevisan, D. Ann. Henri Poincar\'e, {\bf 22} (2021), 3199-3234] to compute the optimal transport plan between two quantum states, we give a general formula for the Wasserstein distance of order 2 between any two one-mode Gaussian states. We discuss how the Wasserstein distance between classical Gaussian distributions and the quantum Wasserstein distance by De Palma and Trevisan for thermal states can be recovered from our general formula for Gaussian states. This opens the path to directly compare various known distance measures with the Wasserstein distance through their closed-form solutions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ge/SiGe heterostructures represent a promising platform for hosting various quantum devices such as hole spin qubits and Andreev spin qubits. However, the compatibility of such heterostructures with high-quality-factor microwave superconducting cavities remains a challenge due to defects in the material stack. In this work, we present an approach to enhance the coherence of cavity modes on a reverse-graded Ge/SiGe heterostructure, which consists of etching the full $\sim 1.6~\mathrm{\mu m}$-thick Ge/SiGe stack down to its starting high-resistivity Si substrate, in order to pattern superconducting cavities directly on it. We engineer the mesa step to be tapered, so that it can be easily climbed by the superconducting cavities to reach the quantum devices potentially hosted in the Ge quantum well. Using this approach, we observe internal quality factors of $Q_\mathrm{i} \approx 10000-20000$ for high-impedance frequency-tunable Josephson junction array resonators, limited by the junctions' fabrication, and $Q_\mathrm{i} \approx 100000$ for $50~\mathrm{\Omega}$ coplanar waveguide Nb lift-off resonators. These $Q_\mathrm{i}$ are preserved despite the overlap with the mesa structure in the climbing region, and are comparable to the ones obtained for identical resonators fabricated on a high-resistivity Si wafer reference. Thereby, this work paves a practical path toward superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices, immediately applicable to emerging technologies on planar Ge.</description>

      <title>Witnessing Entanglement in Mixed-Particle Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an entanglement witness that identifies off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) -- a distinctive form of entanglement -- in systems containing both fermionic and bosonic particles. By analyzing the particle-hole reduced density matrices of each subsystem, the approach detects ODLRO independently in both fermionic and bosonic sectors and identifies when long-range order develops across the entire mixed-particle system. The witness also quantifies the magnitude of ODLRO within each particle type, revealing how fermionic and bosonic correlations combine to form the total entanglement of the system, including a bosonic condensation of particle-hole pairs driven by many-body correlations rather than particle statistics. Using the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick spin model, we show how the transition from ODLRO localized to one particle type to ODLRO shared by both particle types captures the onset of collective entanglement in a mixed-particle environment, providing new insight into systems where fermionic and bosonic correlations coexist.</description>

      <title>Simulation of topological superconductors and their competing orders using photon-mediated interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing and controlling the unconventional pairing featured by topological superconductors remains a central challenge. We introduce a cavity QED quantum simulator that engineers competing chiral $p_x+ip_y$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ orders by tailoring cavity-mediated couplings between atomic pseudospins that emulate momentum-dependent pairing channels. The desired spatially inhomogeneous cavity-mediated couplings can be engineered in a 2D optical lattice using incommensurate cavity-lattice wavelengths naturally occurring in cavity QED systems. This minimal and fully tunable platform enables controlled state preparation and continuous measurement of superconducting order parameters, revealing phases in both equilibrium and sudden-quench settings with a single dominant pairing channel, as well as coexistence regimes with competing pairing channels. Crucially, our implementation allows direct observation of topological transitions in and out of equilibrium, providing a powerful route to the quantum simulation of competing topological superconducting phases that remain elusive in solid-state and ultracold-atom systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) use neural networks to represent wavefunctions of quantum many-body systems, but their performance depends on the choice of basis, yet the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. We use a fully solvable one-dimensional Ising model to show that local basis rotations leave the loss landscape unchanged while relocating the exact wavefunction in parameter space, effectively increasing its geometric distance from typical initializations. By sweeping a rotation angle, we compute quantum Fisher information and Fubini-Study distances to quantify how the rotated wavefunction moves within the loss landscape. Shallow architectures (with focus on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)) trained with quantum natural gradient are more likely to fall into saddle-point regions depending on the rotation angle: they achieve low energy error but fail to reproduce correct coefficient distributions. In the ferromagnetic case, near-degenerate eigenstates create high-curvature barriers that trap optimization at intermediate fidelities. We introduce a framework based on an analytically solvable rotated Ising model to investigate how relocating the target wavefunction within a fixed loss landscape exposes information-geometric barriers,such as saddle points and high-curvature regions,that hinder shallow NQS optimization, underscoring the need for landscape-aware model design in variational training.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Detection Efficiency in Optomechanical Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many optical measurement techniques, such as light scattering from wavelength-scale particles or detecting motion from a surface with an optical lever, encode information in a complex radiation pattern. Extracting all available information is essential for many quantum-enhanced sensing protocols but is often impractical, as it requires many channels to spatially resolve the scattered signal. We present a new method to visualize how efficiently a practical measurement scheme captures the information available in the scattered light by mapping out the local contribution to the detection efficiency on the detector surface. We use this tool to experimentally optimize the free space measurement of the amplitude of motion of an optomechanical resonator with a quadrant photodiode. We show that blocking sections of the photodetector enhances sensitivity, counterintuitively yielding a significant improvement in detecting higher-order mechanical modes in the system. We also show how our method can be applied to light scattering measurements of small particles.</description>

      <title>Quantum Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for Semidefinite Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10056v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semidefinite programming (SDP) is a fundamental convex optimization problem with wide-ranging applications. However, solving large-scale instances remains computationally challenging due to the high cost of solving linear systems and performing eigenvalue decompositions. In this paper, we present a quantum alternating direction method of multipliers (QADMM) for SDPs, building on recent advances in quantum computing. An inexact ADMM framework is developed, which tolerates errors in the iterates arising from block-encoding approximation and quantum measurement. Within this robust scheme, we design a polynomial proximal operator to address the semidefinite conic constraints and apply the quantum singular value transformation to accelerate the most costly projection updates. We prove that the scheme converges to an $\epsilon$-optimal solution of the SDP problem under the strong duality assumption. A detailed complexity analysis shows that the QADMM algorithm achieves favorable scaling with respect to dimension compared to the classical ADMM algorithm and quantum interior point methods, highlighting its potential for solving large-scale SDPs.</description>

      <title>Women in Theoretical Quantum Physics in Brazil:demographics, career profiles, recognition, and leadership</title>

Abstract: Gender imbalance in Physics remains a persistent global challenge, and Brazil is no exception. While women account for only 24% of Physics faculty in the country, their representation in Quantum Physics is even smaller. In this work, we provide the first comprehensive overview of women working in Theoretical Quantum Physics in Brazil, here referred to as the SheQ (She + Quantum) community. Using data from the CNPq Lattes platform, we identify 93 researchers and analyze their geographic distribution, academic trajectories, scientific productivity, international experience, recognition through awards and fellowships, and engagement with initiatives promoting gender equity. Our results reveal both progress and persistent disparities: SheQ researchers have a strong scientific output, leadership roles, and international training; yet, their recognition through productivity fellowships remains modest, and their involvement in gender-related initiatives, although increasing among younger generations, remains limited. By combining quantitative indicators with institutional perspectives, we highlight structural barriers as well as opportunities for fostering a more inclusive environment in Quantum Physics. his study thus contributes to a broader reflection on how diversity not only promotes fairness but also strengthens creativity, innovation, and scientific progress.</description>

      <title>QSMOTE-PGM/kPGM: QSMOTE Based PGM and kPGM for Imbalanced Dataset Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-inspired machine learning (QiML) leverages mathematical frameworks from quantum theory to enhance classical algorithms, with particular emphasis on inner product structures in high-dimensional feature spaces. Among the prominent approaches, the Kernel Trick, widely used in support vector machines, provides efficient similarity computation, while the Pretty Good Measurement (PGM), originating from quantum state discrimination, enables classification grounded in Hilbert space geometry. Building on recent developments in kernelized PGM (KPGM) and direct PGM-based classifiers, this work presents a unified theoretical and empirical comparison of these paradigms. We analyze their performance across synthetic oversampling scenarios using Quantum SMOTE (QSMOTE) variants. Experimental results show that both PGM and KPGM classifiers consistently outperform a classical random forest baseline, particularly when multiple quantum copies are employed. Notably, PGM with stereo encoding and n_copies=2 achieves the highest overall accuracy (0.8512) and F1-score (0.8234), while KPGM demonstrates competitive and more stable behavior across QSMOTE variants, with top scores of 0.8511 (stereo) and 0.8483 (amplitude). These findings highlight that quantum-inspired classifiers not only provide tangible gains in recall and balanced performance but also offer complementary strengths: PGM benefits from encoding-specific enhancements, whereas KPGM ensures robustness across sampling strategies. Our results advance the understanding of kernel-based and measurement-based QiML methods, offering practical guidance on their applicability under varying data characteristics and computational constraints.</description>

      <title>Irrelevant carrots and non-existent sticks: trust, governance, and security in the transition to quantum-safe systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing poses an urgent and widely recognised threat to global cybersecurity, enabling encrypted government, financial, and healthcare data harvested today to be decrypted in the near future. Transitioning to quantum-safe cryptography is therefore essential, demanding coordinated action across a complex, multi-actor innovation system. Drawing on insights from an expert workshop in Amsterdam, this study develops a socially informed vision for a quantum-safe future and analyses the current innovation landscape to identify critical gaps and the actions needed to address them. We map twelve key actor groups involved in the migration process, finding that regulators exert the strongest direct influence, while standardisation bodies play a crucial indirect role. This research provides one of the first system-level mappings of actors, influence pathways and governance responsibilities shaping the quantum-safe transition, revealing several responsibilities with unclear ownership. Although centred on the Netherlands, our findings are applicable to other national contexts navigating quantum-safe transitions.</description>

      <title>Continuum canonical purifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct and characterize canonical purifications for general algebraic states, extending prior constructions by Woronowicz and by Dutta/Faulkner to general quantum field theories. Given a quantum state on a *-algebra, the canonical purification is a state on a "doubled" algebra that admits an interpretation in terms of CRT reflection. We study the conditions under which these enlarged states are "pure" in the technical sense, compute their modular conjugations, and relate them to GNS and natural-cone purifications in certain settings. In a forthcoming paper with Caminiti and Capeccia, we provide an application of this general theory to the problem of excitability in quantum field theory.</description>

Abstract: The Nobel Prize in Physics 2025 has been awarded to John Clarke, John Martinis, and Michel Devoret for "the discovery of macroscopic quantum mechanical tunnelling and energy quantisation in an electric circuit". The paper explains the essence of their studies and shows in a historical context the importance of earlier research in superconductivity and quantum physics of macroscopic systems by other physicists, particularly, Ukrainian scientists, including employees of the B. Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics and Engineering of the NAS of Ukraine (ILTPE). The role of the Fizyka Nyzkykh Temperatur (FNT) journal issued by ILTPE in Kharkiv and its translation as AIP Low Temperature Physics (LTP) in dissemination of results of the theoretical and experimental studies in the field is emphasized as well.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic Dielectric Metasurface-Integrated Superconducting Nanowire Single-Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, multi-element superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) have emerged as the leading single-photon detection technology due to their exceptional system detection efficiency (SDE), ultrahigh timing precision, negligible dark counts, etc. However, achieving these performances with a \textit{single-element} SNSPD has been an outstanding challenge due to a fundamental trade-off: a large active area is necessary for high SDE, while a smaller area is crucial for higher photon count rates, lower dark counts, and lower jitter. Here, we introduce an all-dielectric cryogenic metalens integrated with a single-element SNSPD to achieve high SDE with a smaller active area. Furthermore, we leverage a bifunctional metalens to demonstrate polarization-resolved photodetection at the telecommunication wavelength theoretically. Integrating multifunctional cryogenic metaurfaces with the state-of-the-art SNSPDs may enable novel capabilities with reduced size, weight, power, cost, and cooling (SWaP-C$^{2}$) requirements.</description>

      <title>Realism and Ontology in Quantum Mechanics and String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dualities in physics have challenged traditional forms of scientific realism by undermining the idea that theories describe a unique underlying ontology. In this paper, we develop a new perspective on scientific realism that responds to this challenge. We argue that while realist commitment remains appropriate at the level of a theory's full formal structure, ontological commitment should be treated as tied to specific empirical contexts rather than to a fixed, real ontology. Our proposal draws inspiration from Dennett's notion of a "compression algorithm" as a defining criterion of a scientific theory. On this basis, we separate realism from ontological commitment. To clarify the stakes of this distinction, we contrast our approach with common core realism, which locates ontology in the invariant structure shared by dual models. Focusing on dualities in quantum mechanics and string theory, we show how our view accommodates ontological pluralism while preserving a robust form of structural realism.</description>

      <title>A Lindblad-Pauli Framework for Coarse-Grained Chaotic Binary-State Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17200v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse-graining a chaotic bistable oscillator into a binary symbol sequence is a standard reduction, but it often obscures the geometry of the reduced state space and structural constraints of physically meaningful stochastic evolution. We develop a two-state framework that embeds coarse-grained left/right statistics of the driven Duffing oscillator into a $2\times2$ density-matrix representation and models inter-well switching by a two-rate Gorini--Kossakowski--Sudarshan--Lindblad (GKSL) generator. For diagonal states the GKSL dynamics reduces to the classical two-state master equation.The density-matrix language permits an operational ``Bloch half-disk'' embedding with overlap parameter $c(\varepsilon)$ quantifying partition fuzziness; the GKSL model is fitted to diagonal marginals treating $c(\varepsilon)$ as diagnostic. We derive closed-form solutions, an explicit Kraus representation (generalized amplitude damping with dephasing and rotation), and practical diagnostics for the time-homogeneous first-order Markov assumption (order tests, Chapman--Kolmogorov consistency, run-length statistics, stationarity checks). When higher-order memory appears, we extend the framework via augmented Markov models, constructing CPTP maps through discrete-time Kraus representations; continuous-time GKSL generators may not exist for all empirical transition matrices. We provide a numerical pipeline with templates for validating the framework on Duffing simulations. The density-matrix formalism is an organizational convenience rather than claiming quantum-classical equivalence.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel quantum sensing approach to search for axion-electron interactions around the axion mass of 6 \mueV. In this region, laboratory searches are relatively scarce, and our direct experiment measuring the axion-electron coupling constant reaches the sensitivity of 8 \times 10^{-6} GeV^{-1}. The method, based on an organic molecular maser establishes a proof-of-principle for quantum-enhanced detection, with a corresponding magnetic field sensitivity of 0.85 fT/\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}. The methodology is generic and can be readily extended to other physical systems, further broadening its applicability in quantum sensing and dark matter searches.</description>

      <title>Quantum quenches across continuous and first-order quantum transitions in one-dimensional quantum Ising models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics generated by quantum quenches (QQs) of the Hamiltonian parameters in many-body systems, focusing on protocols that cross first-order and continuous quantum transitions, both in finite-size systems and in the thermodynamic limit. As a paradigmatic example, we consider the quantum Ising chain in the presence of homogeneous transverse ($g$) and longitudinal ($h$) magnetic fields. This model exhibits a continuous quantum transition (CQT) at $g=g_c$ and $h=0$, and first-order quantum transitions (FOQTs) driven by $h$ along the line $h=0$ ($g&lt;g_c$). In the integrable limit $h=0$, the system can be mapped onto a quadratic fermionic theory; however, any nonvanishing longitudinal field breaks integrability and the spectrum of the resulting Hamiltonian is generally expected to enter a chaotic regime. We analyze QQs in which the longitudinal field is suddenly changed from a negative value $h_i &lt; 0$ to a positive value $h_f&gt;0$. We focus on values of $h_f$ such that the spectrum of the post-QQ Hamiltonian ${\hat H}(g,h_f)$ lies in the chaotic regime, where thermalization may emerge at asymptotically long times. We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics for different values of $g$, finding qualitatively distinct behaviors for $g &gt; g_c$ (where the chain is in the disordered phase), for $g = g_c$ (QQ across the CQT), and for $g&lt;g_c$ (QQ across the FOQT line).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact solution of the quantum kinetic equation of a weakly interacting Fermi gas in the crossover from the degenerate Fermi-liquid regime to the classical Boltzmann gas. We construct families of orthogonal polynomials tailored to each angular momentum channel, enabling a fast and systematically improvable decomposition of the phase-space distribution. This approach yields accurate, non-variational predictions for the shear viscosity, thermal diffusivity, and spin diffusivity to leading order in the scattering length. We demonstrate that the commonly used relaxation-time approximation fails dramatically at low temperature--by up to 25%. Our method provides a numerically efficient framework for benchmarking transport in strongly correlated regimes and for simulating the kinetics of quantum gases beyond hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Advantages and disadvantages of maximally entangled states in dilaton black hole background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate quantum entanglement and coherence for four classes of Bell-like fermionic states in the vicinity of the event horizon of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. Contrary to the common expectation that maximally entangled states always provide superior quantum resources, our results show that their entanglement can be lower than that of suitably chosen non-maximally entangled states in this curved spacetime background. This reveals that non-maximally entangled states may offer operational advantages for entanglement-based tasks under gravitational effects. In contrast, quantum coherence exhibits monotonic behavior: larger initial coherence leads to systematically enhanced robustness against the dilaton induced degradation. These results indicate that the optimal choice of initial quantum states depends sensitively on the specific quantum resource, either quantum entanglement or quantum coherence, required for quantum information processing near a dilaton black hole.</description>

Abstract: We investigate how interactions affect the quantum state of scalar perturbations during inflation and the quantum correlations they may exhibit. Focusing on the case of scalar perturbations in single-field inflation, we model interactions using a Lindblad equation with a non-unitary contribution quadratic in the scalar perturbations, and of parametrisable amplitude and time dependence. We compute the quantum state of these interacting perturbations, which is fully described by its purity and squeezing parameters. First, we show that, in most of the parameter space, not only the purity but also the squeezing parameter is significantly reduced by interactions. Second, we show that this de-squeezing induced by the interactions, on top of the purity loss, causes a further suppression of quantum correlations. We thus emphasise that the quantum or classical character of the correlations exhibited by the perturbations cannot be correctly determined by computing the effect of interactions on the purity alone. Since the phenomenological framework adopted in this paper encompasses a wide class of possible interactions, our results provide general insights into the nature of decoherence processes in primordial fluctuations.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda$-Enhanced Gray Molasses Cooling of $^{85}$Rb Atoms in Tweezers Using the D$_2$ Line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the implementation of $\Lambda$-enhanced gray molasses cooling on the D$_2$ line of $^{85}$Rb atoms in an optical tweezer array. This technique yields lower atomic temperatures of 4.0(2) $\mu$K compared to red-detuned polarization gradient cooling, and consequently extends the $T_2^*$ coherence time of the hyperfine clock qubit by a factor of 1.5. The method is alignment-free and can be readily implemented on laser beams used for magneto-optical trapping, as it only requires frequency and phase modulation control. Our experimental observations are corroborated by a numerical model based on a semi-classical force approach extended to a four-level system, including two hyperfine states of the upper manifold that are 120 MHz apart.</description>

      <title>Signatures of coherent energy transfer and exciton delocalization in time-resolved optical cross correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how optical second-order cross correlations witness the quantum features of a prototype donor-acceptor light-harvesting unit. By considering a pair of detuned two-level emitters electronically coupled and incoherently driven to a non-equilibrium steady-state, we gain insight into how electronic quantum properties such as exciton eigenstate delocalization, coherent energy transfer and steady-state electronic coherence, are manifested in the joint probability of emission or optical second-order cross correlation. Specifically, we show that the frequency associated with oscillations present in time-resolved second-order cross correlation functions quantifies not only the time scale of coherent energy transfer but also the degree of delocalization of the exciton eigenstates. Furthermore, we show that time-resolved cross correlations directly witness steady-state electronic coherence. Our work strengthens the idea that measurements of the intensity quantum cross correlations can provide distinctive signatures of the quantum behavior of biophysical emitters.</description>

      <title>Methods and Tools for Secure Quantum Clouds with a specific Case Study on Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17748v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of quantum computing/technology potentially introduces significant security challenges to cloud computing, necessitating quantum-resistant encryption strategies as well as protection schemes and methods for cloud infrastructures offering quantum computing time and services (i.e. quantum clouds). This research explores various options for securing quantum clouds and ensuring privacy, especially focussing on the integration of homomorphic encryption (HE) into Eclipse Qrisp, a high-level quantum computing framework, to enhance the security of quantum cloud platforms. The study addresses the technical feasibility of integrating HE with Qrisp, evaluates performance trade-offs, and assesses the potential impact on future quantum cloud architectures. The successful implementation and Qrisp integration of three post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms demonstrates the feasibility of integrating HE with quantum computing frameworks. The findings indicate that while the Quantum One-Time Pad (QOTP) offers simplicity and low overhead, other algorithms like Chen and Gentry-Sahai-Waters (GSW) present performance trade-offs in terms of runtime and memory consumption. The study results in an overall set of recommendations for securing quantum clouds, e.g. implementing HE at data storage and processing levels, developing Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), and enforcing stringent access control and authentication mechanisms as well as participating in PQC standardization efforts.</description>

      <title>Proximity effect in asymmetric-gap superconducting bilayers and regularization of transition rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard mean-field treatment of low-temperature superconductors leads to a square-root divergent density of states at the gap value. This feature can lead to unphysical logarithmic divergences in various quantities, such as currents and qubit transition rates. We revisit their possible regularization based on the proximity effect between two superconducting films with different gaps. We derive analytical approximations for the density of states in each superconducting film. We find that the smearing of the density of states grows with the gap asymmetry. As a concrete example, we discuss the regularization of transition rates in qubits with frequency close to resonance with the gap asymmetry between the two films, and the consequent smoothening of the jump discontinuity in the qubit frequency shift.</description>

      <title>Momentum correlations of the Hawking effect in a quantum fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hawking effect -- the spontaneous emission of correlated quanta from horizons -- can be observed in laboratory systems where an acoustic horizon forms when a fluid transitions from subcritical to supercritical flow. Although most theoretical and experimental studies have relied on real-space observables, the frequency-dependent nature of the Hawking process motivates a momentum-space analysis to access its spectral structure and entanglement features. Here, we numerically compute the momentum-space two-point correlation function in a quantum fluid using the truncated Wigner approximation, a general method applicable to both conservative and driven-dissipative systems. We consider a polaritonic fluid of light in a realistic configuration known to yield strong real-space correlations between Hawking, partner, and witness modes. We find signatures that are directly accessible in state-of-the-art experiments and offer a robust diagnostic of spontaneous emission. Our results form the basis for a new theoretical framework to assess a variety of effects, such as quasi-normal mode emission or modifications of the horizon structure on the Hawking spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative coupling refers to the effect where two systems interact with each other mediated by dissipation channels. Recent advances in controlling light-matter systems have opened new avenues to explore non-Hermitian effects arising from dissipative coupling, such as level attraction and anomalous dispersions. In this work, we perform a parametric study of these effects in a polariton system, i.e., a light-matter superposition, under both dissipative and coherent coupling. We characterize the effects of different sources of non-Hermitian behavior and analytically identify the conditions for the emergence of negative effective mass, exceptional points, and bound states in the continuum as a function of the light-matter detuning, the coherent-to-dissipative coupling ratio, and the relative decay rate of the non-interacting subsystems. We also analyze the classical limit of the polariton system within a non-Hermitian framework, employing coherent states.</description>

      <title>A Concept of Two-Point Propagation Field of a Single Photon: A Way to Picometer X-ray Displacement Sensing and Nanometer Resolution 3D X-ray Micro-Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the two-point propagation field (TPPF), a real-valued, phase-sensitive quantity defined as the functional derivative of the single-photon detection probability with respect to an infinitesimal opaque perturbation placed between source and detection slits. The TPPF is analytically derived and shown to exhibit a stable, high-frequency sinusoidal structure (6.7 nm period) near the detection slit. This structure enables shot-noise-limited displacement sensing at ~15 pm precision using routinely available synchrotron fluxes and practical nanofabricated slit/comb geometries, requiring mechanical stability only over the final 0.5 mm. The same principle provides a foundation for future nanometer-resolution 3D X-ray microtomography of bulk samples, potentially resulting in a reduced radiation dose. Two conceptual strategies, a central blocker and off-axis multi-slit arrays, are estimated to lower the required incident fluence by more than one order of magnitude each, yielding combined reductions of two to three orders of magnitude with near-term detector development. The TPPF concept, originally developed in a perturbative study of single-particle propagation, thus bridges fundamental quantum measurement questions with practical high-resolution X-ray metrology and imaging.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Rashomon Effect: A Strengthened Frauchiger-Renner Argument</title>

      <description>arXiv:2011.12716v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Frauchiger-Renner argument aims to show that `quantum theory cannot consistently describe the use of itself': in many-party settings where agents are themselves subject to quantum experiments, agents may make predictions that contradict observations. Here, we introduce a simplified setting using only three agents, that is independent of the initial quantum state, thus eliminating in particular any need for entanglement, and furthermore does not need to invoke any final measurement and resulting collapse. Nevertheless, the predictions and observations made by the agents cannot be integrated into a single, consistent account. We propose that the existence of this sort of \emph{Rashomon effect}, i.e. the impossibility of uniting different perspectives, is due to failing to account for the limits put on the information available about any given system as encapsulated in the notion of an \emph{epistemic horizon}.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Bistability in Coupled Nonlinear Cavity Magnonics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09245v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a coupled nonlinear cavity-magnon system, consisting of two cavities, a second-order nonlinear element, and a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere that supports Kerr magnons, to realize the sought-after highly tunable nonreciprocity. We first derive the critical condition for switching between reciprocity and nonreciprocity in the absence of magnon driving, and then numerically demonstrate that strong magnonic nonreciprocity can be achieved by violating this critical condition. When magnons are driven, we show that strong magnonic nonreciprocity can also be attained even within the critical condition. Compared to previous studies, the introduced nonlinear element not only relaxes the critical condition in both the weak and strong coupling regimes, but also offers an alternative means to tune magnonic nonreciprocity. Our work provides a promising avenue for realizing highly tunable nonreciprocal devices based on Kerr magnons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08590v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that the zero-fidelity, an approximation to the process fidelity, when combined with randomized benchmarking, becomes robust to state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. However, as randomized benchmarking requires randomly choosing an increasingly large number of Clifford elements from the Clifford group when the qubit number increases, this combination is also limited to quantum systems with up to three qubits. To make the zero-fidelity independent of SPAM errors and, at the same time, applicable to multi-qubit systems, we employ a channel noise scaling method similar to the method of global unitary folding, or identity scaling, used for quantum error mitigation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement-breaking channels (equivalently, measure-and-prepare channels) are an important class of quantum operations noted for their ability to destroy multipartite spatial quantum correlations. Inspired by this property, they have also been employed in defining notions of "classical memory", under the assumption that such channels effectively act as a classical resource. We show that, in a single-system multi-time scenario, entanglement-breaking channels are still a quantum memory resource: a qudit going through an entanglement-breaking channel cannot be simulated by a classical system of same dimension. We provide explicit examples of memory-based output generation tasks where entanglement-breaking channels outperform classical memories of the same size. Our results imply that entanglement-breaking channels cannot be generally employed to characterize classical memory effects in temporal scenarios without additional assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05912v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The entropy accumulation theorem, and its subsequent generalized version, is a powerful tool in the security analysis of many device-dependent and device-independent cryptography protocols. However, it has the drawback that the finite-size bounds it yields are not necessarily optimal, and furthermore it relies on the construction of an affine min-tradeoff function, which can often be challenging to construct optimally in practice. In this work, we address both of these challenges simultaneously by deriving a new entropy accumulation bound. Our bound yields significantly better finite-size performance, and can be computed as an intuitively interpretable convex optimization, without any specification of affine min-tradeoff functions. Furthermore, it can be applied directly at the level of R\'enyi entropies if desired, yielding fully-R\'enyi security proofs. Our proof techniques are based on elaborating on a connection between entropy accumulation and the frameworks of quantum probability estimation or $f$-weighted R\'enyi entropies, and in the process we obtain some new results with respect to those frameworks as well. In particular, those findings imply that our bounds apply to prepare-and-measure protocols without the virtual tomography procedures or repetition-rate restrictions previously required for entropy accumulation.</description>

Abstract: The quantum mechanics postulate called the Born Rule attributes a probabilistic meaning to a wave function. This paper derives the Born Rule from other quantum principles along with a model of the measurement process.
  The nondeterministic nature of quantum measurements is hypothesized to arise from an ignorance of the quantum states of a measuring device's microscopic components. Their interactions with a system to be measured are modeled heuristically with any member of a particular class of stochastic processes, each of which generate the Born Rule. One member of the class appears particularly compatible with properties expected of quantum interactions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic robustness of entanglement in noisy quantum networks and graph connectivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum networks are promising venues for quantum information processing. This motivates the study of the entanglement properties of the particular multipartite quantum states that underpin these structures. In particular, it has been recently shown that when the links are noisy two drastically different behaviors can occur regarding the global entanglement properties of the network. While in certain configurations the network displays genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) for any system size provided the noise level is below a certain threshold, in others GME is washed out if the system size is big enough for any fixed non-zero level of noise. However, this difference has only been established considering the two extreme cases of maximally and minimally connected networks (i.e. complete graphs versus trees, respectively). In this article we investigate this question much more in depth and relate this behavior to the growth of several graph theoretic parameters that measure the connectivity of the graph sequence that codifies the structure of the network as the number of parties increases. The strongest conditions are obtained when considering the degree growth. Our main results are that a sufficiently fast degree growth (i.e. $\Omega(N)$, where $N$ is the size of the network) is sufficient for asymptotic robustness of GME, while if it is sufficiently slow (i.e. $o(\log N)$) then the network becomes asymptotically biseparable. We also present several explicit constructions related to the optimality of these results.</description>

      <title>Minimizing resource overhead in fusion-based quantum computation using hybrid spin-photon devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present three schemes for constructing a (2,2)-Shor-encoded 6-ring photonic resource state for fusion-based quantum computing, each relying on a different type of photon source. We benchmark these architectures by analyzing their ability to achieve the loss tolerance threshold for fusion-based quantum computation using the target resource state. More precisely, we estimate their minimum hardware requirements for fault-tolerant quantum computation in terms of the number of photon sources to achieve on-demand generation of resource states with a desired generation period. Notably, we find that a group of 12 deterministic single-photon sources containing a single matter qubit degree of freedom can produce the target resource state near-deterministically by exploiting entangling gates that are repeated until success. The approach is fully modular, eliminates the need for lossy large-scale multiplexing, and reduces the overhead for resource-state generation by several orders of magnitude compared to architectures using heralded single-photon sources and probabilistic linear-optical entangling gates. Our work shows that the use of deterministic single-photon sources embedding a qubit substantially shortens the path toward fault-tolerant photonic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Q-Fly: An Optical Interconnect for Modular Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09299v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Much like classical supercomputers, scaling up quantum computers requires an optical interconnect. However, signal attenuation leads to irreversible qubit loss, making quantum interconnect design guidelines and metrics different from conventional computing. Inspired by the classical Dragonfly topology, we propose a multi-group structure where the group switch routes photons emitted by computational end nodes to the group's shared pool of Bell state analyzers (which conduct the entanglement swapping that creates end-to-end entanglement) or across a low-diameter path to another group. We present a full-stack analysis of system performance, a combination of distributed and centralized protocols, and a resource scheduler that plans qubit placement and communications for large-scale, fault-tolerant systems. We implement a prototype three-node switched interconnect to justify hardware-side scalability and to expose low-level architectural challenges. We create two-hop entanglement with fidelities of 0.6-0.76. Our design emphasizes reducing network hops and optical components to simplify system stabilization while flexibly adjusting optical path lengths. Based on evaluated loss and infidelity budgets, we find that moderate-radix switches enable systems meeting expected near-term needs, and large systems are feasible. Our design is expected to be effective for a variety of quantum computing technologies, including ion traps and neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>Optimal control in phase space applied to minimal-time transfer of thermal atoms in optical traps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10494v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an optimal control procedure for the non-adiabatic transport of ultracold neutral thermal atoms in optical tweezers arranged in a one-dimensional array, with focus on reaching minimal transfer time. The particle dynamics are modeled first using a classical approach through the Liouville equation and second through the quantum Wigner equation to include quantum effects. Both methods account for typical experimental noise described as stochastic effects through Fokker-Planck terms. The optimal control process is initialized with a trajectory computed for a single classical particle and determines the phase-space path that minimizes transport time and ensures high transport fidelity to the target trap. This approach provides the fastest and most efficient method for relocating atoms from an initial configuration to a desired target arrangement, minimizing time and energy costs while ensuring high fidelity. Such an approach may be highly valuable to initialize large atom arrays for quantum simulation or computation experiments.</description>

      <title>Computing Efficiently in QLDPC Codes</title>

Abstract: It is the prevailing belief that quantum error correcting techniques will be required to build a utility-scale quantum computer able to perform computations that are out of reach of classical computers. The QECCs that have been most extensively studied and therefore highly optimized, surface codes, are extremely resource intensive in terms of the number of physical qubits needed. A promising alternative, QLDPC codes, has been proposed more recently. These codes are much less resource intensive, requiring significantly fewer physical qubits per logical qubit than practical surface code implementations. A successful application of QLDPC codes would therefore drastically reduce the timeline to reaching quantum computers that can run algorithms with proven exponential speedups like Shor's algorithm and QPE. However to date QLDPC codes have been predominantly studied in the context of quantum memories; there has been no known method for implementing arbitrary logical Clifford operators in a QLDPC code proven efficient in terms of circuit depth. In combination with known methods for implementing T gates, an efficient implementation of the Clifford group unlocks resource-efficient universal quantum computation. In this paper, we introduce a new family of QLDPC codes that enable efficient compilation of the full Clifford group via transversal operations. Our construction executes any m-qubit Clifford operation in at most O(m) syndrome extraction rounds, significantly surpassing state-of-the-art lattice surgery methods. We run circuit-level simulations of depth-126 logical circuits to show that logical operations in our QLDPC codes attains near-memory performance. These results demonstrate that QLDPC codes are a viable means to reduce the resources required to implement all logical quantum algorithms, thereby unlocking a reduced timeline to commercially valuable quantum computing.</description>

      <title>EHands: Quantum Protocol for Polynomial Computation on Real-Valued Encoded States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15928v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present EHands, a quantum-native protocol for implementing multivariable polynomial transformations on quantum processors. The protocol introduces four fundamental, reversible operators: multiplication, addition, negation, and parity flip, and employs the Expectation Value ENcoding (EVEN) scheme to represent real numbers as quantum states. Unlike discretization or binary encoding methods, EHands operates directly on vectorized real-valued inputs prepared in the initial state and applies a shallow quantum circuit that depends only on the polynomial coefficients. The result is obtained from the expectation value measured on a single qubit, enabling efficient parallel evaluation of a polynomial across multiple data points using a single circuit. We introduce both a reversible implementation for degree-$d$ polynomials, requiring $3d$ qubits, and a non-reversible variant that uses qubit resets to reduce the requirements to $d+1$ qubits. Both implementations exhibit linear depth scaling in $d$ and are explicitly decomposed into one- and two-qubit gates for direct execution on current quantum processing units. The protocol's effectiveness is demonstrated through experimental validation on IBM's Heron-class quantum processors, showing reliable polynomial approximations of functions like ReLU and arctan.</description>

      <title>Scalable architecture for measurement induced squeezed light interferometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14449v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalable interferometers lie at the heart of photonic quantum technologies, but their expansion has been fundamentally limited by optical losses that grow with circuit depth. Here, we introduce and experimentally demonstrate a measurement-induced architecture for multimode squeezed-light interferometers that overcomes this barrier. By shifting complexity from deep optical networks to programmable homodyne measurements, we realize effective transformations within a shallow, low-loss platform. We validate the principle with a six-mode device and extend it to a 400-mode interferometer, marking a leap in scale beyond conventional designs. Crucially, this strategy not only enables scalable squeezed light interferometry but also provides a powerful route to the generation of large-scale entangled states - a key requirement for quantum computing, simulation, and communication. Our results establish measurement-induced circuits as a practical pathway toward noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) applications, and future demonstrations of quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking weak randomness in Quantum and Natural Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Private randomness is a fundamental resource for cryptography, security proofs, and information processing. Quantum devices offer a unique advantage by amplifying weak randomness sources in regimes unattainable by classical means. A central theoretical model for such sources is the Santha-Vazirani (SV) model, yet identifying natural processes that satisfy this model remains a major challenge. Here we take three steps toward addressing this problem. First, we introduce an axiomatic framework for quantifying weak randomness, providing a unified basis for estimating an SV-type source. Second, we develop SVTest, a general-purpose software tool for estimating the SV parameter of an arbitrary data sequence. Third, we apply this framework to both engineered and natural sources. Using data from a self-certifying commercial quantum random number generator with guaranteed min-entropy as a benchmark, we validate the accuracy and limitations of our estimation method. We then analyze geophysical signals associated with seismic activity and find that, depending on the discretization, both earthquakes and local seismic noise can exhibit SV-type randomness. Our results indicate that geophysical phenomena may constitute viable sources of cryptographic randomness, establishing an unexpected connection between quantum information theory and geophysics.</description>

      <title>Simulation of a rapid qubit readout dependent on the transmission of a single fluxon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The readout speed of qubits is a major limitation for error correction in quantum information science. We show simulations of a proposed device that gives readout of a fluxonium qubit using a ballistic fluxon with an estimated readout time of less than 1 nanosecond, without the need for an input microwave tone. This contrasts the prevalent readout based on circuit quantum electrodynamics, but is related to previous studies where a fluxon moving in a single long Josephson junction (LJJ) can exhibit a time delay depending on the state of a coupled qubit. Our readout circuit contains two LJJs and a qubit coupled at their interface. We find that the device can exhibit single-shot readout of a qubit -- one qubit state leads to a single dynamical bounce at the interface and fluxon reflection, and the other qubit state leads to a couple of bounces at the interface and fluxon transmission. Dynamics are initially computed with a separate degree of freedom for all Josephson junctions of the circuit. However, a collective coordinate model reduces the dynamics to three degrees of freedom: one for the fluxonium Josephson junction and one for each LJJ. The large mass imbalance in this model allows us to simulate the mixed quantum-classical dynamics, as an approximation for the full quantum dynamics. Calculations give backaction on the qubit at $\leq 0.1\%$.</description>

      <title>On Dequantization of Supervised Quantum Machine Learning via Random Fourier Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15902v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the quest for quantum advantage, a central question is under what conditions can classical algorithms achieve a performance comparable to quantum algorithms--a concept known as dequantization. Random Fourier features (RFFs) have demonstrated potential for dequantizing certain quantum neural networks (QNNs) applied to regression tasks, but their applicability to other learning problems and architectures remained unexplored. In this work, we derive bounds on the true risk gap between classical RFF models and quantum models for regression and classification tasks with both QNN and quantum kernel architectures. Furthermore, we provide sufficient conditions under which this gap is small and thus the quantum system can be dequantized via the RFF method. We support our findings with numerical experiments that illustrate the practical dequantization of existing quantum kernel-based methods. Our findings not only broaden the applicability of RFF-dequantization but also enhance the understanding of potential quantum advantages in practical machine-learning tasks.</description>

      <title>New Paradigm for Integrated Sensing and Communication with Rydberg Atomic Receiver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13304v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The RYDberg Atomic Receiver (RYDAR) has been demonstrated to surmount the limitation on both the sensitivity and operating bandwidth of the classical electronic counterpart, which can theoretically detect indiscernible electric signals below -174 dBm/Hz with optical measurement through Rydberg-state atoms. Such miracle has established a new quantum-based paradigm for communications and sensing, which motivates a revolution of the transceiver design philosophies to fully unleash the potential of RYDAR towards next-generation networks. Against this background, this article provides a thorough investigation of Rydberg atomic communications and sensing from theory to hardware implementations. Specifically, we highlight the great opportunities from the hybridization between the RYDAR and the cutting-edge integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), followed by essential preliminaries of the quantum-based receiver. Then we propose a theoretical framework for broadband ISAC based on RYDAR, demonstrated by the proof-of-concept experiments. Afterwards, the enabling technologies for the ISAC framework are explored ranging from channel characterization, waveform design to array-based receiver configurations, where the open problems are also summarized. Finally, the future applications of RYDAR-based ISAC are envisioned, indicating its significant potential for both civilian and military purposes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Randomized compilation protocols have recently attracted attention as alternatives to traditional deterministic Trotter-Suzuki methods, potentially reducing circuit depth and resource overhead. These protocols determine gate application probabilities based on the strengths of Hamiltonian terms, as measured by the trace norm. However, relying solely on the trace norm to define sampling distributions may not be optimal, especially for continuous-variable and hybrid-variable systems involving unbounded operators, where quantifying Hamiltonian strengths is challenging. In this work, we propose an adaptive randomized compilation algorithm that dynamically updates sampling weights via low-order moment measurements of Hamiltonian terms, assigning higher probabilities to terms with greater uncertainty. This approach improves accuracy without significantly increasing gate counts and extends randomized compilation to continuous-variable and hybrid-variable systems by addressing the difficulties in characterizing the strengths of unbounded Hamiltonian terms. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

Abstract: Noise is a hindering factor for current-era quantum computers. In this study, we experimentally validate the theoretical relationships between amplitude noise of the control signal and qubit state fidelity. The experiment comprises a 10x10 site optical tweezer array stochastically loaded with single rubidium-85 atoms. A global microwave field is used to manipulate the state of the hyperfine qubits. With precise control of the time-dependent amplitude of the microwave drive, we apply control signals featuring artificial noise. We systematically analyze the impact of various noise profiles on the fidelity distribution of the quantum states. The measured fidelities are compared against theoretical predictions made using the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation. Our results show a good agreement between the experimentally measured and theoretically predicted results. This validation is consequential, as the model provides critical information on noise identification and optimal control protocols in NISQ-era quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Instability of explicit time integration for strongly quenched dynamics with neural quantum states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural quantum states have recently demonstrated significant potential for simulating quantum dynamics beyond the capabilities of existing variational ans\"{a}tze. However, studying strongly driven quantum dynamics with neural networks has proven challenging so far. Here, we focus on assessing several sources of numerical instabilities that can appear in the simulation of quantum dynamics based on the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) with the computationally efficient explicit time integration scheme. Focusing on the restricted Boltzmann machine architecture, we compare solutions obtained by TDVP with analytical solutions and implicit methods as a function of the quench strength. Interestingly, we uncover a quenching strength that leads to a numerical breakdown in the absence of Monte Carlo noise, despite the fact that physical observables don't exhibit irregularities. This breakdown phenomenon appears consistently across several different TDVP formulations, even those that eliminate small eigenvalues of the Fisher matrix or use geometric properties to recast the equation of motion. We provide evidence that the nature of the instability stems from stiffness of the dynamics of the variational parameters, despite the absence of stiffness in the exact quantum dynamics. We conclude that alternative methods need to be developed to leverage the computational efficiency of explicit time integration of the TDVP equations for simulating strongly nonequilibrium quantum dynamics with neural-network quantum states.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and Mitigating Flux Crosstalk in Superconducting Qubits-Couplers System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03434v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits have achieved exceptional gate fidelities, exceeding the error-correction threshold in recent years. One key ingredient of such improvement is the introduction of tunable couplers to control the qubit-to-qubit coupling through frequency tuning. Moving toward fault-tolerant quantum computation, increasing the number of physical qubits is another step toward effective error correction codes. Under a multiqubit architecture, flux control (Z) lines are crucial in tuning the frequency of the qubits and couplers. However, dense flux lines result in magnetic flux crosstalk, wherein magnetic flux applied to one element inadvertently affects neighboring qubits or couplers. This crosstalk obscures the idle frequency of the qubit when flux bias is applied, which degrades gate performance and calibration accuracy. In this study, we characterize flux crosstalk and suppress it in a multiqubit-coupler chip with multi-Z lines without adding additional readout for couplers. By quantifying the mutual flux-induced frequency shifts of qubits and couplers, we construct a cancellation matrix that enables precise compensation of non-local flux, demonstrating a substantial reduction in Z-line crosstalk from 56.5$\,$permille$\,$to 0.13$\,$permille$\,$ which is close to statistical error. Flux compensation corrects the CZ SWAP measurement, leading to a symmetric map with respect to flux bias. Compared with a crosstalk-free calculated CZ SWAP map, the measured map indicates that our approach provides a near-zero crosstalk for the coupler-transmon system. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing flux crosstalk-free control and supporting its potential for scaling superconducting quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Quasiprobability Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a quantum extension of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation where dynamical fluctuations are quantified by the Terletsky-Margenau-Hill quasiprobability, a quantum generalization of the classical joint probability. The obtained inequality plays a complementary role to existing quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relations, focusing on observables' change rather than exchange of charges through jumps and respecting initial coherence. Quasiprobabilities show anomalous behaviors that are forbidden in classical systems, such as negativity; we reveal that negativity or a non-classically enhanced escape rate is necessary to increase an output-to-dissipation ratio beyond classical limitations and show that the requirements are basis-independent and stronger than quantum coherence. To illustrate these statements, we employ a model that can exhibit a dissipationless heat current, which would be prohibited in classical systems; we construct a state that has much coherence but does not lead to a dissipationless current due to the absence of anomalous behaviors in quasiprobabilities.</description>

      <title>From Chiral Topological Dynamics to Chiral Topological Amplification: Real vs Imaginary Parameters in a Hermitian Bosonic Chain</title>

Abstract: We propose a Hermitian quadratic bosonic model (QBH) whose dynamical matrix exhibits distinct topological and dynamical phenomena depending on whether the hopping and pairing amplitudes are real or purely imaginary. In the real-parameter regime, the dynamical matrix is unitarily equivalent to four decoupled copies of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (nSSH2) model, thereby inheriting its topological phases and energy spectrum-including the M\"obius phase, a gapless topological phase with fractional winding number, having no Hermitian counterpart. We show that the dynamics generated by the QBH Hamiltonian naturally reproduce non-Hermitian time evolution, without invoking nonlinear Schr\"odinger dynamics or ad hoc normalization. It is demonstrated by analytically calculating the Loschmidt amplitude and computing the dynamical topological order parameter under periodic boundary conditions, which displays a distinct chiral response in the M\"obius phase. In contrast, when the hopping and pairing terms are taken to be purely imaginary, the dynamical matrix becomes unitarily equivalent to a different version of the sublattice-symmetric non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (nSSH1) model that supports only two topological phases: trivial and non-trivial, and the M\"obius phase disappears. The latter system exhibits sublattice-dependent chiral amplification under open boundary conditions. We show that this amplification arises from the non-trivial topology of the dynamical matrix, establishing a clear link between topological phase and amplification behavior in the imaginary-parameter regime.</description>

      <title>Out-of-time-order correlators bridge classical transport and quantum dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20235v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC) has emerged as a central tool for quantifying decoherence across wide-ranging physical platforms. Here we demonstrate its direct measurement in a classical ensemble using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with a modulated gradient spin echo (MGSE) sequence and extend the method into a multidimensional correlation to track exchange phenomena. Position is encoded through magnetic field gradients and momentum through the velocity autocorrelation function, enabling experimental access to OTOCs for proton motion confined within the self-similar lattice of the metal-organic framework MOF-808. Here, water confined to specified geometries within the MOF pores gives rise to spatially distinct diffusive eigenmodes with characteristic relative entropies. We demonstrate that periodic radiofrequency (rf) driving combined with gradient modulation yields entropy evolution through the selection of distinct diffusion modes. Frequency-resolved diffusion spectra connect these entropy dynamics to classical heat-exchange laws, revealing how operational features of quantum systems are mirrored in confined, macroscopic spin ensembles.</description>

      <title>Composable logical gate error in approximate quantum error correction: reexamining gate implementations in Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying the accuracy of logical gates is paramount in approximate error correction, where perfect implementations are often unachievable with the available set of physical operations. To this end, we introduce a single scalar quantity we call the (composable) logical gate error. It captures both the deviation of the logical action from the desired target gate as well as leakage out of the code space. It is subadditive under successive application of gates, providing a simple means for analyzing circuits. We show how to bound the composable logical gate error in terms of matrix elements of physical unitaries between (approximate) logical computational basis states. In the continuous-variable context, this sidesteps the need for computing energy-bounded norms.
  As an example, we study the composable logical gate error for linear optics implementations of Paulis and Cliffords in approximate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. We find that the logical gate error for implementations of Paulis depends linearly on the squeezing parameter. This implies that their accuracy improves monotonically with the amount of squeezing. For some Cliffords, however, linear optics implementations which are exact for ideal GKP codes fail in the approximate case: they have a constant logical gate error even in the limit of infinite squeezing. This is consistent with previous results about the limitations of certain gate implementations for approximate GKP codes. It shows that findings applicable to ideal GKP codes do not always translate to the realm of physically realizable approximate GKP codes.</description>

Abstract: Quantum network protocol development is crucial to realizing a production-grade network that can support distributed sensing, secure communication, and utility-scale quantum computation. However, the transition from laboratory demonstration to deployable networks requires software implementations of architectures and protocols tailored to the unique constraints of quantum systems. This paper reviews the current state of software implementations for quantum networks, organized around the three-plane abstraction of infrastructure, logical, and control/service planes. We cover software for both designing quantum network protocols (e.g., SeQUeNCe, QuISP, and NetSquid) and operating them, with a focus on essential control/service plane functions such as entanglement, topology, and resource management, in a proposed taxonomy. Our review highlights a persistent gap between theoretical protocol proposals and their realization in simulators or testbeds, particularly in dynamic topology and network management. We conclude by outlining open challenges and proposing a roadmap for developing scalable software architectures to enable hybrid, large-scale quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Chaotic many-body quantum dynamics, spectral correlations, and energy diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study chaotic many-body quantum dynamics in a minimal model with spatial structure and local interactions. It has a time-independent Hamiltonian, in contrast to quantum circuits and Brownian models, and is simple at the single-site level, in contrast to Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev chains. It is analytically tractable for large local Hilbert space dimension and weak intersite coupling. In this limit we show that energy dynamics is described by a classical master equation and is diffusive. We also show that the spectral form factor can be expressed exactly in terms of the solution to this master equation. For a two-site system we obtain closed-form expressions for both the two-point correlator of energy density and the spectral form factor, in essentially perfect agreement with numerical simulations. For an $L$-site system we show at late times how a linear ramp emerges in the spectral form factor, as universally expected from level repulsion in chaotic quantum systems. Conversely, at earlier times we identify two distinct mechanisms for an increase of the spectral form factor above its ramp value. One of these is associated with energy diffusion and is effective until the Thouless time, which varies as $L^2$. The other involves contributions like those that would appear if the system were composed of many uncoupled subsystems: they generate a large enhancement of the spectral form factor, and are suppressed on a timescale varying as $(\ln L)^2$. Besides being exact for the limit considered, we believe our approach provides the natural approximation even for small local Hilbert space dimension and strong intersite coupling. We present a numerical study of a spin-half chain, finding an early-time enhancement of the spectral form factor which is qualitatively similar to that in our solvable model.</description>

      <title>Exploiting higher-order correlation functions for photon-statistics-based characterization and reconstruction of arbitrary Gaussian states</title>

Abstract: Gaussian states are an essential building block for various applications in quantum optics and quantum information science, yet the precise relation between their second- and third-order correlation functions remains not fully explored. We discuss connections between these correlation functions by constructing an explicit decomposition formula for arbitrary sixth-order moments of ladder operators for general Gaussian states and demonstrate how the derived relations enable state classification from correlation data alone. Whereas violating these relations certifies non-Gaussianity, satisfying them provides evidence for a Gaussian-state description and allows a direct distinction among non-displaced, non-squeezed, and displaced-squeezed sectors of the Gaussian state space. Further, we show that it is not possible to uniquely extract state parameters solely from correlation-function measurements without prior assumptions about the Gaussian state. Resolving this ambiguity requires additional loss-sensitive information, e.g., measuring the mean intensity or the vacuum overlap of each mode. In particular, we show under which circumstances these measurements can be used to reconstruct a generic Gaussian state.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovianity in Quantum Information Processing: Interplay with Quantum Error Mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics are typically present in the dynamics of open quantum systems. Despite the rich structure of non-Markovian dynamics, their relevance to quantum information processing (QIP) has been rarely discussed. In this work, we demonstrate that the negativity of the dynamics, a characteristic of non-Markovian dynamics, naturally arises in quantum error correction (QEC) and quantum teleportation. The negativity in open quantum systems is naturally attributed to the information backflow from the environment. We partition the whole Hilbert space into the logical subsystem and the gauge subsystem. The logical subsystem stores the quantum information for QIP, while the gauge subsystem stores the information for recovery of the logical information, i.e., the syndrome measurement outcomes for quantum error correction and Bell measurement outcomes for successful teleportation. We then show that the negativity in quantum information processing appears as a consequence of the feedback operation based on the measurement outcomes of the gauge subsystem. Finally, we show that the negativity of non-Markovianity in QIP reduces the sampling cost of quantum error mitigation (QEM), shedding light on the importance of combination strategies of QEC and QEM in a practical QIP.</description>

      <title>Universal Limits on Quantum Correlations</title>

Abstract: Quantum correlations are the singular, defining resource of quantum information science and metrology, forming the basis of every operational advantage that quantum systems hold over classical ones. Yet exact bounds on these correlations-such as the Lieb-Robinson bound on entanglement propagation and the Heisenberg limit on metrological precision-are known only in special cases and have long appeared to arise from unrelated mechanisms. Here we show that these limits share a common geometric origin. We identify a positivity invariant of the block correlation matrix, denoted $\chi$, that quantifies how far a bipartite state lies from the positivity boundary of quantum state space. For any system with a specified observable algebra and parameter-encoding map, every correlation measure determined solely by the positive correlation matrix obeys a $\chi$-dependent inequality. For systems with simple symmetry structures these inequalities take closed analytic form, reproducing the structure of the Heisenberg and Cram\'er-Rao limits and producing new results, including an exact entanglement floor and a universal Fisher-information ceiling even in all-to-all connected quantum networks. We thus demonstrate that positive geometry provides a unified framework for the attainable strength of quantum correlations, linking entanglement, metrological sensitivity, and dynamical causal structure through a single invariant.</description>

      <title>Fermionic dynamics on a trapped-ion quantum computer beyond exact classical simulation</title>

Abstract: Simulation of the time-dynamics of fermionic many-body systems has long been predicted to be one of the key applications of quantum computers. Such simulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical to advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and materials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to clean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of all previous digital quantum simulations of fermions has been matched by classical methods, and it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale quantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we implement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit system that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the periodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge separation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the limited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical simulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum device. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the effective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between charge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by classical tensor network methods. Our results herald the use of quantum computing for simulating strongly correlated electronic systems beyond the capacity of classical computing.</description>

Abstract: Simulating the time-dynamics of quantum many-body systems was the original use of quantum computers proposed by Feynman, motivated by the critical role of quantum interactions between electrons in the properties of materials and molecules. Accurately simulating such systems remains one of the most promising applications of general-purpose digital quantum computers, in which all the parameters of the model can be programmed and any desired physical quantity output. However, performing such simulations on today's quantum computers at a scale beyond the reach of classical methods requires advances in the efficiency of simulation algorithms and error mitigation techniques. Here we demonstrate programmable digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of the 2D Fermi-Hubbard model -- one of the best-known simplified models of electrons in crystalline solids -- at a scale beyond exact classical state-vector simulation. We implement simulations of this model on lattice sizes up to ${6\times 6}$ using 72 qubits on Google's Willow quantum processor, across a range of physical parameters, including different on-site electron-electron interaction strengths and magnetic flux values, and study phenomena including formation of magnetic polarons (charge carriers surrounded by local magnetic polarisation), dynamical symmetry-breaking in stripe-ordered states, attraction of charge carriers on an entangled background state known as a valence bond solid, and the approach to equilibrium through thermalisation. We validate our results against exact calculations in parameter regimes where these are feasible, and compare them to approximate classical simulations performed using tensor network and operator propagation methods. Our results demonstrate that meaningful programmable digital quantum simulation of many-body interacting electron models is now feasible on state-of-the-art quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: Nonstabilizerness, or magic, constitutes a fundamental resource for quantum computation and a crucial ingredient for quantum advantage. Recent progress has substantially advanced the characterization of magic in many-body quantum systems, with stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) emerging as a computable and experimentally accessible measure. In this work, we investigate the spreading of SRE in terms of single-qubit reduced density matrices, where an initial product state that contains magic in a local region evolves under brickwork random Clifford circuits. For the case with Haar-random local Clifford gates, we find that the spreading profile exhibits a diffusive structure within a ballistic light cone when viewed through a normalized version of single-qubit SRE, despite the absence of explicit conserved charges. We further examine the robustness of this non-ballistic behavior of the normalized single-qubit SRE spreading by extending the analysis to a restricted Clifford circuit, where we unveil a superdiffusive spreading.</description>

Abstract: Scaling quantum computers to large sizes requires the implementation of many parallel qubit readouts. Here we present an ultrastable superconducting-qubit readout method using the multi-tone self-phase-referenced Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH) technique, originally developed for use with optical cavities. In this work, we benchmark PDH readout of a single transmon qubit, using room-temperature heterodyne detection of all tones to reconstruct the PDH signal. We demonstrate that PDH qubit readout is insensitive to microwave phase drift, displaying $0.73^\circ$ phase stability over 2 hours, and capable of single-shot readout in the presence of phase errors exceeding the phase shift induced by the qubit state. We show that the PDH sideband tones do not cause unwanted measurement-induced state transitions for a transmon qubit, leading to a potential signal enhancement of at least $14$~dB over traditional heterodyne readout.</description>

Abstract: Quantum communication protocols seek to leverage the unique properties of quantum systems for coordination or communication tasks, usually with guarantees of security or anonymity that exceed what is possible classically. One promising domain of application is elections, where strong such guarantees are essential to ensure legitimacy. We experimentally implement a recently proposed election protocol from Centrone et al. such that no one, including a potential central authority, can know the preferred candidate of any voter other than themself. We conduct a four-party election, generating and distributing four-partite GHZ states with $\approx 89\%$ fidelity and successfully recording voters' intentions $\approx 87\%$ of the time.</description>

We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Quantumness via Discrete Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum theory departs from classical probabilistic theories in foundational ways. These departures--termed quantumness here--power quantum information and computation. This thesis charts the role of discrete structures in assessing quantumness, synthesizing elements of my postdoctoral research through this lens. After an introduction to the necessary background concepts, I present my work under three broad categories. First, I present work on contextuality that extensively relies on (undirected) graphs and hypergraphs as the discrete structures of interest; more specifically, it relies on invariants associated with them. This work includes Kochen-Specker (KS) contextuality and its operationalization to generalized contextuality, expressed via (hyper)graph-theoretic frameworks. I also present work on KS-contextuality in multiqubit systems and an application of generalized contextuality to a one-shot communication task, both of which rely on hypergraphs. Second, I present work on causality, where the discrete structures of interest are directed graphs. This includes work on indefinite causal order, specifically its connections to the gap between local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and separable operations (SEP), and a device-independent notion of nonclassicality--termed antinomicity--that generalizes Bell nonlocality without global causal assumptions. Finally, I present work on the incompatibility of quantum measurements, its connection to Bell nonlocality, and its role in discriminating between quantum and almost quantum correlations in the single-system setting. The discrete structures of interest here are hypergraphs that model joint measurability relations between quantum measurements. I conclude with a summary and an overview of work that is not covered in this thesis.</description>

      <title>TreeVQA: A Tree-Structured Execution Framework for Shot Reduction in Variational Quantum Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are promising for near- and intermediate-term quantum computing, but their execution cost is substantial. Each task requires many iterations and numerous circuits per iteration, and real-world applications often involve multiple tasks, scaling with the precision needed to explore the application's energy landscape. This demands an enormous number of execution shots, making practical use prohibitively expensive. We observe that VQA costs can be significantly reduced by exploiting execution similarities across an application's tasks. Based on this insight, we propose TreeVQA, a tree-based execution framework that begins by executing tasks jointly and progressively branches only as their quantum executions diverge. Implemented as a VQA wrapper, TreeVQA integrates with typical VQA applications. Evaluations on scientific and combinatorial benchmarks show shot count reductions of $25.9\times$ on average and over $100\times$ for large-scale problems at the same target accuracy. The benefits grow further with increasing problem size and precision requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically derive the fundamental lower bound for the preparation fidelity of a maximally-entangled (Bell) state of two atoms involving Rydberg-state interactions. This bound represents the minimum achievable error $E \geq ( 1 + \pi/2 ) \Gamma/B$ due to spontaneous decay $\Gamma$ of the Rydberg states and their finite interaction strength $B$. Using quantum optimal control methods, we identify laser pulses for preparing a maximally-entangled state of a pair of atomic qubits with an error only $1\%$ above the derived fundamental bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16580v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent paper by Sharoglazova et al. reports an energy-dependent parameter $\nu$ extracted from the spatial distribution of photons in a coupled-waveguide experiment. The authors interpret $\nu$ as the speed of quantum particles, even in the classically forbidden regime, and claim that its finite value contradicts the Bohmian mechanics prediction of zero particle velocity. This challenge arises from a fundamental misunderstanding of the operational meaning of v within the Bohmian ontological framework. We demonstrate that v quantifies the spatial gradient of the wavefunctions amplitude, a geometric property of the guiding field, not the kinematical velocity of point-like particles. The experiment therefore does not challenge but rather illustrates the clean ontological separation between the wave and particle aspects inherent to Bohmian mechanics.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Pauli Propagation for Gradient-Enabled Pre-Training of Quantum Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning models typically require expensive on-chip training procedures and often lack efficient gradient estimation methods. By employing Pauli propagation, it is possible to derive a symbolic representation of observables as analytic functions of a circuit's parameters. Although the number of terms in such functional representations grows rapidly with circuit depth, suitable choices of ansatz and controlled truncations on Pauli weights and frequency components yield accurate yet tractable estimators of the target observables. With the right ansatz design, this approach can be extended to system sizes beyond the reach of classical simulation, enabling scalable training for larger quantum systems. This also enables a form of classical pre-training through gradient-based optimization prior to deployment on quantum hardware. The proposed approach is demonstrated on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver for obtaining the ground state of a spin model, showing that accurate results can be achieved with a scalable and computationally efficient procedure.</description>

      <title>Emergent topological re-entrant phase transition in a generalized quasiperiodic modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the topological properties of the one-dimensional generalized quasiperiodic modulated Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. The results reveal that topological re-entrant phase transition emerges. Through the analysis of a real-space winding number , we divide the emergent topological re-entrant phase transitions into two types. The first is the re-entrant phase transition from the traditional topological insulator phase into the topological Anderson insulator phase, and the second is the re-entrant phenomenon from one topological Anderson insulator phase into another topological Anderson insulator phase. These two types of re-entrant phase transition correspond to bounded and unbounded cases of quasiperiodic modulation, respectively. Furthermore, we verify the above topological re-entrant phase transitions by analyzing the Lyapunov exponent and bulk gap. Since Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models have been realized in various artificial systems (such as cold atoms, optical waveguide arrays, ion traps, Rydberg atom arrays, etc.), the two types of topological re-entrant phase transition predicted in this paper are expected to be realized in the near future.</description>

      <title>Probing non-ergodicity and symmetry via coherent forward scattering in a shaken rotor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Coherent Backscattering (CBS) peak is a well-known interferential signature of weak localization in disordered or chaotic systems. More recently, a second interference feature -- the Coherent Forward Scattering (CFS) peak -- was predicted to emerge in the regime of strong localization. However, it has never been directly observed. Here we report the first direct observation of the CFS peak and demonstrate its dual role as a signature of non-ergodicity and as a probe of symmetries in quantum chaotic systems. Using a shaken rotor model realized with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of ultracold atoms in a modulated optical lattice, we investigate dynamical localization in momentum space. The CFS peak emerges in the position distribution as a consequence of non-ergodic dynamics, while its growth timescale reveals the underlying localization length. By finely tuning the modulation, we control time-reversal and parity symmetries and measure their distinct effects on both CBS and CFS peaks. Our results highlight the strong link of both the temporal growth and contrast of the CFS with symmetry and localization, making it a robust probe of these properties. This work opens new directions for characterizing non-ergodicity and symmetries in quantum chaotic or disordered systems, with possible applications in many-body localization and chaos.</description>

      <title>An Optimally Accurate Lanczos Algorithm in the Matrix Product State Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21786v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm using the matrix product state representation. As an alternative to the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), the Lanczos algorithm avoids local minima and can directly find multiple low-lying eigenstates. However, its performance and accuracy are affected by the truncation required to maintain the efficiency of the tensor network representation. In this work, we propose the modified thick-block Lanczos method to enhance the convergence of the Lanczos algorithm with MPS representation. We benchmark our method on one-dimensional instances of the Fermi-Hubbard model and the Heisenberg model in an external field, using numerical experiments targeting the first five lowest eigenstates. Across these tests, our approach attains the best possible accuracy permitted by the given bond dimension. This work establishes the Lanczos method as a reliable and accurate framework for finding multiple low-lying states within a tensor-network representation</description>

      <title>Impact of the honeycomb spin-lattice on topological magnons and edge states in ferromagnetic 2D skyrmion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnons have been intensively studied in two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion crystals (SkXs) stabilized on Bravais lattices, particularly triangular and square lattices, where the first magnon gaps are topologically trivial and do not support topological edge states (TESs). In this context, antiferromagnetic (AFM) SkXs on the triangular spin lattice have been considered potentially more interesting for applications, since TESs emerge in the first magnon gap. Meanwhile, the magnon topology of SkXs on non-Bravais spin lattices remains largely unexplored. In this work, we theoretically investigate the magnon band structure and TESs in 2D FM SkXs stabilized on the honeycomb spin lattice, including experimentally motivated parameter sets relevant to van der Waals magnets. We show that TESs emerge in the first magnon gap over significant ranges of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and single-ion magnetic anisotropy. Field-induced topological phase transitions modify the number of these TESs before eventually trivializing them, thereby enabling controlled switching of magnonic edge transport. These findings highlight the role of lattice geometry in shaping the magnon topology of noncollinear spin textures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a Lieb-Robinson bound for lattice fermion models with polynomially decaying interactions, which can be used to show the locality of the quasi-local inverse Liouvillian. This allows us to prove automorphic equivalence and the local perturbations perturb locally (LPPL) principle for these systems. The proof of the Lieb-Robinson bound is based on the work of Else et al. (2020), and our results also apply to spin systems. We explain why some newer Lieb-Robinson bounds for long-range spin systems cannot be used to prove the locality of the quasi-local inverse Liouvillian, and in some cases may not even hold for fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Quasinormal Mode Theory for Dissipative Nano-Optics and Magnetodielectric Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unprecedented pace of evolution in nanoscale architectures for cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has posed crucial challenges for theory, where the quantum dynamics arising from the non-perturbative dressing of matter by cavity electric and magnetic fields, as well as the fundamentally non-hermitian character of the system are to be treated without significant approximation. The lossy electromagnetic resonances of photonic, plasmonic or magnonic nanostructures are described as quasinormal modes (QNMs), whose properties and interactions with quantum emitters and spin qubits are central to the understanding of dissipative nano-optics and magnetodielectric cQED. Despite recent advancements toward a fully quantum framework for QNMs, a general and universally accepted approach to QNM quantization for arbitrary linear media remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a unified theoretical framework, based on macroscopic QED and complex coordinate transformations, that achieves QNM quantization for a wide class of spatially inhomogeneous, dissipative (with possible gain components) and dispersive, linear, magnetodielectric resonators. The complex coordinate transformations equivalently convert the radiative losses into non-radiative material dissipation, and via a suitable transformation that reflects all the losses of the resonator, we define creation and annihilation operators that allow the construction of modal Fock states for the joint excitations of field-dressed matter. By directly addressing the intricacies of modal loss in a fully quantum theory of magnetodielectric cQED, our approach enables the exploration of modern, quantum nano-optical experiments utilizing dielectric, plasmonic, magnetic or hybrid cQED architectures, and paves the way towards a rigorous assessment of room-temperature quantum nanophotonic technologies without recourse to ad hoc quantization schemes.</description>

      <title>Squeezed gravitons from superradiant axion fields around rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose, in (3+1)-dimensional spacetimes, a novel astrophysical source of squeezed graviton states, due to superradiant axionic clouds surrounding rotating (Kerr-type) black holes (BH). The microscopic origin of these axions is diverse, ranging from the Kalb-Ramond (model-independent) axions and compactification axions in string theory, to \cm contorted geometries exemplified by a totally antisymmetric component of torsion in Einstein-Cartan theory. The axion fields couple to chiral gauge and gravitational Chern-Simons (CS) anomaly terms in the effective gravitational actions. In the presence of a Kerr BH background, such axions lead, upon acquiring a mass, to superradiance and the production of pairs of entangled gravitons in a squeezed state. The specific microscopic origin of the axions is not important, provided they are massive. This multimode squeezed-graviton state is examined through a Takagi-like decomposition, used in quantum optics. In the effective action it is shown that squeezing effects associated with conventional general relativity (GR) dominate, by many orders of magnitude, the corresponding effects due to the CS gravitational anomaly terms. For a sufficiently long lifetime of the axionic cloud of the BH, we find that significant squeezing (quantified through the average number of gravitons with respect to the appropriate vacuum) can be produced from the GR effects. It is also demonstrated explicitly that the structure of the entangled states (when the latter are expressed in a left-right polarization basis) depends highly on whether the GR or the anomalous CS effects produce the entanglement.</description>

      <title>Search for Dark Matter Scattering from Optically Levitated Nanoparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00815v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of levitated optomechanics has enabled precise force sensors that operate in the quantum measurement regime, opening up unique opportunities to search for new physics whose weak interactions may have evaded existing sensors. We demonstrate the detection of impulsive forces acting on optically levitated nanoparticles, where the dominant noise source is provided by measurement backaction. Using these sensors, we search for momentum transfers that may originate from scattering of passing particlelike dark matter. For dark matter that couples to Standard Model neutrons via a generic long-range interaction, this search constrains a range of models in the mass range $1$-$10^7~\mathrm{GeV/}c^2$, placing upper limits on single neutron coupling strength as low as $\leq 1 \times 10^{-7}$ at the 95% confidence level. We also demonstrate the ability of using the inherent directional sensitivity of these sensors to separate possible dark matter signals from backgrounds. Future extensions of the techniques developed here can enable searches for light dark matter and massive neutrinos that can reach sensitivity several orders of magnitude beyond existing searches.</description>

Abstract: Radiation during strong-field tunneling ionization is investigated. The spontaneous as well as the coherent components of the radiation are calculated describing the ionization dynamics via the strong field approximation and the role of the quantum dynamics at tunneling is analyzed. The competition between different mechanisms in different spectral regions is examined. Transition-like radiation (Brunel radiation) is dominated at low-frequencies, Thomson scattering at the laser frequency, and radiative recombination via the three-step process at high-order harmonics. To distinguish the role of the quantum dynamics, simple man Drude models are developed for the coherent as well as for spontaneous radiation, which are based on the electron trajectory out of the tunneling barrier. The quantum dynamics is shown to modify the coherent Brunel radiation for near-zero-frequencies in asymmetric laser pulses. The significant role of free-free transitions is demonstrated for the spontaneous radiation in the low-frequency region.</description>

      <title>Crystal-Field--Driven Magnetoelectricity in the Triangular Quantum Magnet CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$</title>

Abstract: We report dielectric and magnetoelectric studies of single-crystalline \ce{CeMgAl11O19}, a Kramers triangular magnet embedded in a polarizable hexaaluminate lattice. In zero magnetic field, the permittivity $\varepsilon'(T)$ follows the Barrett law of a quantum paraelectric down to 25 K, below which a broad minimum develops near 3 K without evidence of static ferroelectric or magnetic order. Application of magnetic fields up to \SI{9}{\tesla} shifts this minimum to higher temperatures and broadens it, evidencing a tunable magnetoelectric response.The magnetoelectric coupling was characterized using results from magnetization measurements. The anomaly temperature $T^*$, extracted from the local minimum of $\varepsilon'(T)$, exhibits a linear dependence on the squared magnetization $M^2$, consistent with the biquadratic magnetoelectric coupling allowed in centrosymmetric systems. This magnetoelectric effect, mediated by spin-orbit-entangled Kramers doublets interacting with a frustrated antipolar liquid, establishes \ce{CeMgAl11O19} as a prototype for exploring quantum magnetoelectricity in frustrated systems.</description>

      <title>Herman-Kluk-Like Semi-Classical Initial-Value Representation for Boltzmann Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coherent-state initial-value representation (IVR) for the semi-classical real-time propagator of a quantum system, developed by Herman and Kluk (HK), is widely used in computational studies of chemical dynamics. On the other hand, the Boltzmann operator $e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)}$, with $\hat{H}$,$k_B$, and $T$ representing the Hamiltonian, Boltzmann constant, and temperature, respectively, plays a crucial role in chemical physics and other branches of quantum physics. One might naturally assume that a semi-classical IVR for the matrix element of this operator in the coordinate representation (i.e., $ \langle \tilde{x} | e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)} | x \rangle$, or the imaginary-time propagator) could be derived via a straightforward ``real-time $\rightarrow$ imaginary-time transformation'' from the HK IVR of the real-time propagator. However, this is not the case, as such a transformation results in a divergence in the high-temperature limit $(T \rightarrow \infty)$. In this work, we solve this problem and develop a reasonable HK-like semi-classical IVR for $ \langle \tilde{x} | e^{-\hat{H}/(k_B T)} | x \rangle$ specifically for systems where either the gradient of the potential energy (i.e., the force intensity) has a finite upper bound, or the potential becomes harmonic in the long-range limit. The integrand in this IVR is a real Gaussian function of the positions $x$ and $\tilde{x}$, which facilitates its application to realistic problems. Our HK-like IVR is exact for free particles and harmonic oscillators, and its effectiveness for other systems is demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>
