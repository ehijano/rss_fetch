      <title>Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) Science: Resolving the Hot and Ionized Universe through the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An omnipresent feature of the multi-phase ``cosmic web'' is that warm/hot (&gt;$10^5$ K) ionized gas pervades it. This gas constitutes a relevant contribution to the overall universal matter budget across multiple scales, from the several tens of Mpc-scale IGM filaments, to the Mpc ICM, all the way down to the CGM surrounding individual galaxies, on scales from ~1 kpc up to their respective virial radii (~100 kpc). The study of the hot baryonic component of cosmic matter density represents a powerful means for constraining the intertwined evolution of galactic populations and large-scale cosmological structures, for tracing the matter assembly in the Universe and its thermal history. To this end, the SZ effect provides the ideal observational tool for measurements out to the beginnings of structure formation. The SZ effect is caused by the scattering of the photons from the cosmic microwave background off the hot electrons embedded within cosmic structures, and provides a redshift-independent perspective on the thermal and kinematic properties of the warm/hot gas. Still, current and future (sub)mm facilities have been providing only a partial view of the SZ Universe due to any combination of: limited angular resolution, spectral coverage, field of view, spatial dynamic range, sensitivity. In this paper, we motivate the development of a wide-field, broad-band, multi-chroic continuum instrument for the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST) by identifying the scientific drivers that will deepen our understanding of the complex thermal evolution of cosmic structures. On a technical side, this will necessarily require efficient multi-wavelength mapping of the SZ signal with an unprecedented spatial dynamic range (from arcsecond to degree scales) and we employ theoretical forecasts to determine the key instrumental constraints for achieving our goals.

      <title>Redshift evolution and covariances for joint lensing and clustering studies with DESI Y1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) and clustering measurements from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Year 1 (DESI Y1) dataset promise to yield unprecedented combined-probe tests of cosmology and the galaxy-halo connection. In such analyses, it is essential to identify and characterise all relevant statistical and systematic errors. In this paper, we forecast the covariances of DESI Y1 GGL+clustering measurements and characterise the systematic bias due to redshift evolution in the lens samples. Focusing on the projected clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing correlations, we compute a Gaussian analytical covariance, using a suite of N-body and log-normal simulations to characterise the effect of the survey footprint. Using the DESI One Percent Survey data, we measure the evolution of galaxy bias parameters for the DESI Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) and Bright Galaxy Survey (BGS) samples. We find mild evolution in the LRGs in 0.4 &lt; z &lt; 0.8, subdominant compared to the expected statistical errors. For BGS, we find less evolution effects for brighter absolute magnitude cuts, at the cost of reduced sample size. We find that with a fiducial redshift bin width delta z = 0.1, evolution effects on GGL is negligible across all scales, all fiducial selection cuts, all fiducial redshift bins, given DESI Y1 sample size. Galaxy clustering is more sensitive to evolution due to the bias squared scaling. Nevertheless the redshift evolution effect is insignificant for clustering above the 1-halo scale of 0.1Mpc/h. For studies that wish to reliably access smaller scales, additional treatment of redshift evolution is likely needed. This study serves as a reference for GGL and clustering studies using the DESI Y1 sample</description>

      <title>The origin of lopsided satellite galaxy distribution around isolated systems in MillenniumTNG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf satellites in galaxy groups are distributed in an anisotropic and asymmetric manner, which is called the ``lopsided satellite distribution''. This lopsided signal has been observed not only in galaxy pairs but also in isolated systems. However, the physical origin of the lopsided signal in isolated systems is still unknown. In this work, we investigate this in the state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulation of the MillenniumTNG Project by tracing each system back to high redshift. We find that the lopsided signal is dominated by satellites located in the outer regions of the halo and is also dominated by recently accreted satellites. The lopsided signal originates from the anisotropic accretion of galaxies from the surrounding large-scale structure and that, after accretion, the nonlinear evolution of satellites inside the dark-matter halo weakens the lopsidedness. The signal decreases as cosmic time passes because of a competition between anisotropic accretion and internal evolution within dark matter halos. Our findings provide a useful perspective for the study of galaxy evolution, especially for the origin of the spatial satellite galaxy distributions.</description>

      <title>Improving Convolutional Neural Networks for Cosmological Fields with Random Permutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have recently been applied to cosmological fields -- weak lensing mass maps and galaxy maps. However, cosmological maps differ in several ways from the vast majority of images that CNNs have been tested on: they are stochastic, typically low signal-to-noise per pixel, and with correlations on all scales. Further, the cosmology goal is a regression problem aimed at inferring posteriors on parameters that must be unbiased. We explore simple CNN architectures and present a novel approach of regularization and data augmentation to improve its performance for lensing mass maps. We find robust improvement by using a mixture of pooling and shuffling of the pixels in the deep layers. The random permutation regularizes the network in the low signal-to-noise regime and effectively augments the existing data. We use simulation-based inference (SBI) to show that the model outperforms CNN designs in the literature. We find a 30% improvement in the constraints of the $S_8$ parameter for simulated Stage-III surveys, including systematic uncertainties such as intrinsic alignments. We explore various statistical errors corresponding to next-generation surveys and find comparable improvements. We expect that our approach will have applications to other cosmological fields as well, such as galaxy maps or 21-cm maps.</description>

      <title>An analytical approximation of the evolution of the primordial curvature perturbation in the ultraslow-roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation can enter an ultraslow-roll (USR) stage, if there is a plateau on the inflaton potential. During this stage, the primordial curvature perturbation ${\mathcal R}_k$ and its power spectrum ${\mathcal P}_{\mathcal R}$ can be remarkably enhanced on small scales. In this work, an analytical approximation is provided to systematically study the evolution of ${\mathcal R}_k$ in the USR inflation. We first discuss the asymptotic solutions of the moduli and arguments of ${\mathcal R}_k$ and its time derivative ${\mathcal R}_{k,N}$ on the sub- and super-horizon scales separately and find that all these solutions have simple exponential forms. Then, ${\mathcal R}_k$ on five typical scales are investigated in order. Our analytical approximation predicts that ${\mathcal R}_k$ first revolves around the origin in the complex plane, but if it crosses the horizon around the start of the USR stage, there appears a subsequent linear evolution towards or away from the origin. This behavior naturally explains the shape of ${\mathcal P}_{\mathcal R}$ from the sharp dip to the peak and matches the numerical results perfectly. Moreover, the minimum of ${\mathcal P}_{\mathcal R}$ is exactly proved to be nonvanishing. Our analytical approximation will help the model building in primordial black hole and gravitational wave physics.</description>

      <title>Cosmological evolution of matter with interacting dust fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We split the total matter fluid into a bound (halo) component and an unbound (free particles) fluid component that is accreted by the halos. We adopt a different framework that treats the structure formation problem as a gravitational interaction between these virialised cold dark matter halos and the unbound inter-halo cold dark matter (and cold baryon) particles. This interaction involves in general an exchange of energy and momentum during the accretion process. We then explore the evolution of the average matter density and of large-scale structure formation, using a simplified phenomenological model that is based on results from extended Press-Schechter and N-body simulations. At high redshifts most matter is in diffuse form and is not part of the haloes. As particles are accreted by the virialised halos, the particle number density decreases and that of the bound matter increases. We also present a general analysis of the background and linear perturbations for the interacting fluids, showing in detail the energy and momentum exchange terms.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on the Dark Energy with a Quadratic Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce a novel late-time effective dark energy model characterized by a quadratic equation of state (EoS) and rigorously examine its observational constraints. Initially, we delve into the background dynamics of this model, tracing the evolution of fluctuations in linear order. Our approach involves substituting the conventional cosmological constant with a dynamically effective dark energy fluid. Leveraging a diverse array of observational datasets encompassing the Planck 2018 Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), Type Ia Supernovae (SNe), Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO), and a prior on the Hubble constant $H_0$ (R21), we constrain the model parameters. We establish the model's consistency by comparing the Hubble parameter as a function of redshift against observational Hubble data (OHD), benchmarking its performance against the Standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Additionally, our investigation delves into studies of the model's dynamical behavior by computing cosmological parameters such as the deceleration parameter, relative Hubble parameter, and the evolution of the Hubble rate. Furthermore, employing Bayesian analysis, we determine the Bayesian Evidence for our proposed model compared to the reference $\Lambda$CDM model. While our analysis unveils the favorable behavior of the model in various observational tests, the well-known cosmological tensions persist when the full dataset combination is explored.</description>

      <title>Exploration of the polarization angle variability of the Crab Nebula with POLARBEAR and its application to the search for axion-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Crab Nebula, also known as Tau A, is a polarized astronomical source at millimeter wavelengths. It has been used as a stable light source for polarization angle calibration in millimeter-wave astronomy. However, it is known that its intensity and polarization vary as a function of time at a variety of wavelengths. Thus, it is of interest to verify the stability of the millimeter-wave polarization. If detected, polarization variability may be used to better understand the dynamics of Tau A, and for understanding the validity of Tau~A as a calibrator. One intriguing application of such observation is to use it for the search of axion-light particles (ALPs). Ultralight ALPs couple to photons through a Chern-Simons term, and induce a temporal oscillation in the polarization angle of linearly polarized sources. After assessing a number of systematic errors and testing for internal consistency, we evaluate the variability of the polarization angle of the Crab Nebula using 2015 and 2016 observations with the 150 GHz POLARBEAR instrument. We place a median 95% upper bound of polarization oscillation amplitude $A &lt; 0.065^\circ$ over the oscillation frequencies from $0.75~\mathrm{year}^{-1}$ to $0.66~\mathrm{hour}^{-1}$. Assuming that no sources other than ALP are causing Tau A's polarization angle variation, that the ALP constitutes all the dark matter, and that the ALP field is a stochastic Gaussian field, this bound translates into a median 95% upper bound of ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma\gamma} &lt; 2.16\times10^{-12}\,\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}\times(m_a/10^{-21} \mathrm{eV})$ in the mass range from $9.9\times10^{-23} \mathrm{eV}$ to $7.7\times10^{-19} \mathrm{eV}$. This demonstrates that this type of analysis using bright polarized sources is as competitive as those using the polarization of cosmic microwave background in constraining ALPs.</description>

      <title>The radial orbits of ram-pressure-stripped galaxies in clusters from the GASP survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a sample of 244 ram-pressure-stripped candidate galaxy members within the virial radius of 62 nearby clusters, to determine their velocity anisotropy profile $\beta(r)$. We use previously determined mass profiles for the 62 clusters to build an ensemble cluster by stacking the 62 cluster samples in projected phase-space. We solve the Jeans equation for dynamical equilibrium by two methods, MAMPOSSt and the Jeans inversion technique, and determine $\beta(r)$ both in parametric form and non-parametrically. The two methods consistently indicate that the orbits of the ram-pressure-stripped candidates are increasingly radial with distance from the cluster center, from almost isotropic ($\beta \simeq 0$) at the center, to very radial at the virial radius ($\beta \simeq 0.7$). The orbits of cluster galaxies undergoing ram-pressure stripping are similar to those of spiral cluster galaxies, but more radially elongated at large radii.</description>

      <title>Constraining primordial non-Gaussianity using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to estimate the value of primordial non-Gaussianity ($f_{\rm NL}$) parameter directly from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps using a convolutional neural network (CNN). While traditional methods rely on complex statistical techniques, this study proposes a simpler approach that employs a neural network to estimate $f_{\rm NL}$. The neural network model is trained on simulated CMB maps with known $f_{\rm NL}$ in range of $[-50,50]$, and its performance is evaluated using various metrics. The results indicate that the proposed approach can accurately estimate $f_{\rm NL}$ values from CMB maps with a significant reduction in complexity compared to traditional methods. With $500$ validation data, the $f^{\rm output}_{\rm NL}$ against $f^{\rm input}_{\rm NL}$ graph can be fitted as $y=ax+b$, where $a=0.980^{+0.098}_{-0.102}$ and $b=0.277^{+0.098}_{-0.101}$, indicating the unbiasedness of the primordial non-Gaussianity estimation. The results indicate that the CNN technique can be widely applied to other cosmological parameter estimation directly from CMB images.</description>

      <title>Evaluating extensions to LCDM: an application of Bayesian model averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) as a powerful statistical framework to address key cosmological questions about the universe's fundamental properties. We explore extensions beyond the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, considering a varying curvature density parameter $\Omega_{\rm k}$, a spectral index $\mathrm{n}_{\rm s}=1$ with running $d\mathrm{n}_{\rm s}/d\mathrm{k}$, a constant dark energy equation of state (EOS) $w_0-\Lambda$CDM and a time-dependent one $w_0w_a-\Lambda$CDM. We also test cosmological data against a varying effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm eff}$. Data from different combinations of cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from the last Planck PR4 analysis, CMB lensing from Planck 2018, baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) and the Bicep-KECK 2018 results, are used. We find that the standard $\Lambda$CDM model is favoured when combining CMB data with CMB lensing, BAO and Bicep-KECK 2018 data against $k-\Lambda$CDM model $N_{\rm eff}-\Lambda$CDM with a probability $&gt; 80\%$. When investigating the dark energy EOS, we find that this dataset is not able to express a strong preference between the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and the constant dark energy EOS model $w_0-\Lambda$CDM, with an approximately split model posterior probability of $\approx 60\%:40\%$ in favour of $\Lambda$CDM, whereas the time-varying dark energy EOS model is ruled out. Finally, we find that the CMB data alone show a strong preference for a model that includes the running of the spectral index $d\mathrm{n}_{\rm s}/d\mathrm{k}$, with a probability $\approx 90\%$, when compared to the $n_{\rm s}=1$ model and the standard $\Lambda$CDM. Overall, we find that including the model uncertainty in the considered cases does not significantly impact the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Predicting large scale cosmological structure evolution with GAN-based autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations play a key role in the prediction and understanding of large scale structure formation from initial conditions. We make use of GAN-based Autoencoders (AEs) in an attempt to predict structure evolution within simulations. The AEs are trained on images and cubes issued from respectively 2D and 3D N-body simulations describing the evolution of the dark matter (DM) field. We find that while the AEs can predict structure evolution for 2D simulations of DM fields well, using only the density fields as input, they perform significantly more poorly in similar conditions for 3D simulations. However, additionally providing velocity fields as inputs greatly improves results, with similar predictions regardless of time-difference between input and target.</description>

      <title>Incompatibility of fine-structure constant variations at recombination with local observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some attempts of easing the critical Hubble tension present in modern cosmology have resorted to using variations of fundamental constants, such as the fine-structure constant, at the time of recombination. In this article we demonstrate that there are critical hurdles to construct such viable models using scalar fields, due to the striking precision of local constraints on the fine-structure constant stability. These hurdles demonstrate that in single-field models one has to extremely fine-tune the shape of the potential and/or the initial conditions. Indeed, for single field models in a potential that is not fine-tuned we can put a generic bound at recombination of $\Delta \alpha/\alpha &lt; 5\cdot 10^{-4}$ (95\% CL).</description>

      <title>Constraining Cosmological Parameters with Needlet Internal Linear Combination Maps I: Analytic Power Spectrum Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal linear combination (ILC) method is a popular approach for constructing component-separated maps in cosmic microwave background (CMB) analyses. It optimally combines observed maps at different frequencies to produce an unbiased minimum-variance map of a component. When performed in harmonic space, it is straightforward to analytically compute the contributions of individual sky components to the power spectrum of the resulting ILC map. ILC can also be performed on a basis of needlets, spherical wavelets that have compact support in both pixel and harmonic space, capturing both scale-dependent and spatially varying information. However, an analytic understanding of the power spectra of needlet ILC (NILC) component-separated maps, as needed to enable their use in cosmological parameter inference, has remained an outstanding problem. In this paper, we derive the first analytic expression for the power spectra of NILC maps, as well as an expression for the cross-spectrum of a NILC map with an arbitrary second map, in terms of contributions from individual sky components. We validate our result using simulations, finding that it is exact. These results contain useful insights: we explicitly see how NILC power spectra contain information from contaminant fields beyond the two-point level, and we obtain a formalism with which to parameterize NILC power spectra. However, because this parameter dependence is complicated by correlations and higher-point functions of the component maps and weight maps, we find that it is intractable to perform parameter inference using these analytic expressions. Instead, numerical techniques are needed to estimate parameters using NILC maps -- we explore the use of likelihood-free inference with neural posterior estimation in a companion paper. Our code to produce the results in this paper is available in https://github.com/kmsurrao/NILC-PS-Model.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 3 results: likelihood-free, simulation-based $w$CDM inference with neural compression of weak-lensing map statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present simulation-based cosmological $w$CDM inference using Dark Energy Survey Year 3 weak-lensing maps, via neural data compression of weak-lensing map summary statistics: power spectra, peak counts, and direct map-level compression/inference with convolutional neural networks (CNN). Using simulation-based inference, also known as likelihood-free or implicit inference, we use forward-modelled mock data to estimate posterior probability distributions of unknown parameters. This approach allows all statistical assumptions and uncertainties to be propagated through the forward-modelled mock data; these include sky masks, non-Gaussian shape noise, shape measurement bias, source galaxy clustering, photometric redshift uncertainty, intrinsic galaxy alignments, non-Gaussian density fields, neutrinos, and non-linear summary statistics. We include a series of tests to validate our inference results. This paper also describes the Gower Street simulation suite: 791 full-sky PKDGRAV dark matter simulations, with cosmological model parameters sampled with a mixed active-learning strategy, from which we construct over 3000 mock DES lensing data sets. For $w$CDM inference, for which we allow $-1&lt;w&lt;-\frac{1}{3}$, our most constraining result uses power spectra combined with map-level (CNN) inference. Using gravitational lensing data only, this map-level combination gives $\Omega_{\rm m} = 0.283^{+0.020}_{-0.027}$, ${S_8 = 0.804^{+0.025}_{-0.017}}$, and $w &lt; -0.80$ (with a 68 per cent credible interval); compared to the power spectrum inference, this is more than a factor of two improvement in dark energy parameter ($\Omega_{\rm DE}, w$) precision.</description>

      <title>First Constraints on the Epoch of Reionization Using the non-Gaussianity of the Kinematic Sunyaev-Zel{'}dovich Effect from the South Pole Telescope and {\it Herschel}-SPIRE Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report results from an analysis aimed at detecting the trispectrum of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel{'}dovich (kSZ) effect by combining data from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) and {\it Herschel}-SPIRE experiments over a 100 ${\rm deg}^{2}$ field. The SPT observations combine data from the previous and current surveys, namely SPTpol and SPT-3G, to achieve depths of 4.5, 3, and 16 $\mu {\rm K-arcmin}$ in bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. For SPIRE, we include data from the 600 and 857 GHz bands. We reconstruct the velocity-induced large-scale correlation of the small-scale kSZ signal with a quadratic estimator that uses two cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature maps, constructed by optimally combining data from all the frequency bands. We reject the null hypothesis of a zero trispectrum at $10.3\sigma$ level. However, the measured trispectrum contains contributions from both the kSZ and other undesired components, such as CMB lensing and astrophysical foregrounds, with kSZ being sub-dominant. We use the \textsc{Agora} simulations to estimate the expected signal from CMB lensing and astrophysical foregrounds. After accounting for the contributions from CMB lensing and foreground signals, we do not detect an excess kSZ-only trispectrum and use this non-detection to set constraints on reionization. By applying a prior based on observations of the Gunn-Peterson trough, we obtain an upper limit on the duration of reionization of $\Delta z_{\rm re, 50} &lt; 4.5$ (95\% C.L). We find these constraints are fairly robust to foregrounds assumptions. This trispectrum measurement is independent of, but consistent with, {\it Planck}'s optical depth measurement. This result is the first constraint on the epoch of reionization using the non-Gaussian nature of the kSZ signal.</description>

      <title>A New Determination of the Millisecond Pulsar Gamma-Ray Luminosity Function and Implications for the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess (GCE) could be produced by a large number of centrally-located millisecond pulsars. The fact that no such pulsar population has been detected implies that these sources must be very faint and very numerous. In this study, we use the contents of Fermi's recently released Third Pulsar Catalog (3PC) to measure the luminosity function of the millisecond pulsars in the Milky Way's Disk. We find that this source population exhibits a luminosity function with a mean gamma-ray luminosity of $\langle L_\gamma \rangle \sim 6 \times 10^{32}$ erg/s (integrated above 0.1 GeV). If the GCE were generated by millisecond pulsars with the same luminosity function, we find that $\sim$ 20 such sources from the Inner Galaxy population should have already been detected by Fermi and included in the 3PC. Given the lack of such observed sources, we exclude the hypothesis that the GCE is generated by pulsars with the same luminosity function as those in the Galactic Disk with a significance of $3.4\sigma$. We conclude that either less than 39% of the GCE is generated by pulsars, or that the millisecond pulsars in the Inner Galaxy are at least 5 times less luminous on average than those found in the Galactic Disk.</description>

      <title>Star-forming and Quiescent Central Galaxies Cluster Similarly: Implications for the Galaxy-Halo Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure the clustering of low-redshift SDSS galaxies as a function of stellar mass ($10.0&lt;\log(M_*/M_\odot)&lt;11.5$) and specific star formation rate (sSFR) and compare the results to models of the galaxy--halo connection. We find that the auto-correlation functions of central galaxies exhibit little dependence on sSFR, with the well-known stronger clustering of quiescent galaxies mainly attributable to satellites. Because halo assembly history is known to affect distinct halo clustering, this result implies that there is little net correlation between halo assembly history and central galaxy sSFR. However, cross-correlations with satellites are stronger for quiescent centrals than star-forming centrals, consistent with quiescent centrals having more satellites in their haloes at fixed $M_*$, as found in SDSS group catalogues. We model the galaxy--halo connection in an $N$-body simulation by assigning sSFRs to central galaxies in three different ways. Two of the models depend on halo assembly history (being based on halo accretion rate or concentration), while the third is independent of halo assembly history (being based on peak halo circular velocity, $V_\text{peak}$, a proxy for halo mass). All three models replicate the observed auto-correlations of central galaxies, while only the $V_\text{peak}$ model reproduces the observed cross-correlations with satellites. This further suggests that the effects of halo assembly history may not be easily seen in auto-correlations of centrals and implies that a more complete understanding of central galaxy clustering may require more than auto-correlations of centrals alone. Additionally, the good agreement with the $V_\text{peak}$ model supports the idea that quiescent galaxies reside in more massive haloes than star-forming galaxies at fixed $M_*$.</description>

      <title>Phase space analysis of sign-shifting interacting dark energy models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of non-gravitational interaction between a pressure-less dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) is a phenomenologically rich cosmological domain which has received magnificent attention in the community. In the present article we have considered some interacting scenarios with some novel features: the interaction functions do not depend on the external parameters of the universe, rather, they depend on the intrinsic nature of the dark components; the assumption of unidirectional flow of energy between DM and DE has been extended by allowing the possibility of bidirectional energy flow characterized by some sign shifting interaction functions; and the DE equation of state has been considered to be either constant or dynamical in nature. These altogether add new ingredients in this context, and, we performed the phase space analysis of each interacting scenario in order to understand their global behaviour. According to the existing records in the literature, this combined picture has not been reported elsewhere. From the analyses, we observed that the DE equation of state as well as the coupling parameter(s) of the interaction models can significantly affect the nature of the critical points. It has been found that within these proposed sign shifting interacting scenarios, it is possible to obtain stable late time attractors which may act as global attractors corresponding to an accelerating expansion of the universe. The overall outcomes of this study clearly highlight that the sign shifting interaction functions are quite appealing in the context of cosmological dynamics and they deserve further attention.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the arbitrary dimensional FRW universe: Joule-Thomson expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the thermodynamics especially the Joule-Thomson expansion of the $n$-dimensional FRW (Friedmann-Robertson-Walker) universe with a perfect fluid. We derive the thermodynamic equations of state $P=P(V, T)$ for the $n$-dimensional FRW universe in Einstein gravity and Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, where the thermodynamic pressure $P$ defined by the work density $W$ of the perfect fluid, $i.e.$ $P\equiv W$. Furthermore, we present the Joule-Thomson expansion as an application of these equations of state to elucidate the cooling-heating properties of the $n$-dimensional FRW universe. We determine the inversion temperature and inversion pressure in the FRW universe with arbitrary dimensions for the first time, and illustrate the characteristics of inversion curves and isenthalpic curves in the $T$-$P$ plane. This study offers insights into deepening our comprehension of cooling and heating regions in the FRW universe, thereby revealing its expansion mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Phase Transition in Singlet Extensions of The Standard Model with Dimension-Six Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The significance of the electroweak phase transition is undeniable, and although initially it was believed that it was second-order, it is now believed that it is a first-order transition. However, it is not a strong first-order phase transition in the context of the Standard Model and the remedy to this issue is to use the Higgs portal and directly couple the Higgs to a hidden scalar sector. This can result in a strong electroweak phase transition, while the couplings to a hidden scalar are constrained by several phenomenological constraints, such as the sphaleron rate criterion and the branching ratio of the Higgs to invisible channels. In this work, we consider the standard singlet extensions of the Standard Model, including dimension-six non-renormalizable operators that couple a real singlet scalar field with the Higgs doublet. As a result, we examine the effects of those Higgs-singlet couplings on the electroweak phase transition. The effective theory, where the non-renormalizable couplings originate from, is considered to be active beyond 15$\,$TeV. As we show, the Universe experiences a two-step electroweak phase transition, a primary phase transition in the singlet sector at a high temperature, and then a subsequent first-order phase transition from the singlet vacuum to the electroweak vacuum. The singlet's phase transition can either be second-order or first-order, depending on the singlet mass and its couplings to the Higgs. In particular, we show that the dimension-six operator assists in generating a strong electroweak phase transition in regions of the parameter space that were excluded in the previous singlet extensions of the Standard Model. This is further apparent for low singlet masses \(m_S &lt; m_H/2\) which are rarely taken into account in the literature due to the invisible branching ratio of the Higgs boson.</description>

      <title>MeV gamma rays from Q-ball decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the supersymmetric Q balls which decay at present and find that they create a distinctive spectrum of gamma rays at around O(10) MeV. The charge of the Q ball is lepton numbers in order for the lifetime to be as long as the present age of the universe, and the main decay products are light leptons. However, as the charge of the Q ball decreases, the decay channel into pions becomes kinematically allowed towards the end of the decay, and the pions are produced at rest. Immediately, $\pi^0$ decays into two photons with the energy of 67.5 MeV, half the pion mass, which exhibits a unique emission line. In addition, $\pi^\pm$ decay into $\mu^\pm$, which further decay with emitting internal bremsstrahlung, whose spectrum has a sharp cutoff at $\sim$50 MeV. If the observations would find these peculiar features of the gamma-ray spectrum in the future, it could be a smoking gun of the supersymmetric Q-ball decay at present.</description>

Abstract: Dilaton and axion are ubiquitous in extended supergravities and closed superstrings. We propose new models of modular inflation in four-dimensional $N=1$ supergravity coupled to the chiral dilaton-axion-goldstino supermultiplet, which fit some necessary conditions of superstring cosmology. The model parameters are tuned to obey precision measurements of the cosmic microwave background radiation. We employ the modular-invariant superpotentials and asymptotically modular-invariant K\"ahler potentials, and achieve axion stabilization with high-scale supersymmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Probing the Circum-Galactic Medium with Fast Radio Bursts: Insights from the CAMELS Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most diffuse baryons, including the circumgalactic medium (CGM) surrounding galaxies and the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the cosmic web, remain unmeasured and unconstrained. Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) offer an unparalleled method to measure the electron dispersion measures (DMs) of ionized baryons. Their distribution can resolve the missing baryon problem, and constrain the history of feedback theorized to impart significant energy to the CGM and IGM. We analyze the Cosmology and Astrophysics in Machine Learning (CAMEL) Simulations, using three suites: IllustrisTNG, SIMBA, and Astrid, each varying 6 parameters (2 cosmological &amp; 4 astrophysical feedback), for a total of 183 distinct simulation models. We find significantly different predictions between the fiducial models of the suites, owing to their different implementations of feedback. SIMBA exhibits the strongest feedback, leading to the smoothest distribution of baryons, reducing the sightline-to-sightline variance in DMs between z=0-1. Astrid has the weakest feedback and the largest variance. We calculate FRB CGM measurements as a function of galaxy impact parameter, with SIMBA showing the weakest DMs due to aggressive AGN feedback and Astrid the strongest. Within each suite, the largest differences are due to varying AGN feedback. IllustrisTNG shows the most sensitivity to supernova feedback, but this is due to the change in the AGN feedback strengths, demonstrating that black holes, not stars, are most capable of redistributing baryons in the IGM and CGM. We compare our statistics directly to recent observations, paving the way for the use of FRBs to constrain the physics of galaxy formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Cosmological forecasts for future galaxy surveys with the linear point standard ruler: Toward consistent BAO analyses far from a fiducial cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.09098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The linear point (LP) standard ruler was identified as the basis of a purely geometric method for exploiting the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The LP exploits the BAO feature imprinted in the galaxy two-point correlation function to measure cosmological distances independent of any specific cosmological model. We forecast the expected precision of future and ongoing spectroscopic galaxy surveys to measure distances leveraging the linear point. We investigate the cosmological implications of our forecasted results. We focus in particular on a relevant working example: the detection of the late-time cosmic acceleration independent of other cosmological probes. Our findings show that, even within the LCDM standard cosmological paradigm, estimated distances need to be reliable over a very wide parameter range in order to realize their maximum utility. This is particularly relevant if we aim to properly characterize cosmological tensions. The LP is a promising candidate approach to achieve this reliability. In contrast, widely employed procedures in BAO analysis estimate distances keeping fixed cosmological parameters to fiducial values close to cosmic-microwave-background constraints in flat-LCDM. It is unclear whether they are purely geometric methods. Moreover, they rely on untested extrapolations to explore the parameter space away from those fiducial flat-LCDM values. We recommend that all BAO methodologies be validated across the full range of models and parameters over which their results are quoted, first by means of linear predictions and then N-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Testing Linearly Coasting Cosmology by Strong Lensing System and Pantheon+ Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06714v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard model of cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM) is facing a serious crisis caused by the inconsistencies in the measurements of some fundamental cosmological parameters (Hubble constant $H_{0}$ and cosmic curvature parameter $\Omega_{k}$ for example). On the other hand, a strictly linear evolution of the cosmological scale factor is found to be an excellent fit to a host of observations. Any model that can support such a coasting presents itself as a falsifiable model as far as the cosmological tests are concerned. In this article the observational data of strong gravitational lensing (SGL) systems from SLACS, BELLS, LSD and SL2S surveys has been used to test the viability of linearly coasting cosmology. Assuming the spherically symmetric mass distribution in lensing galaxies, the ratio of angular diameter distance from lens to source and angular diameter distance of the source is evaluated and is used to constrain the power law cosmology. Further, updated type Ia supernovae dataset (Pantheon+) with covariance matrix incorporating all statistical and systematic uncertainties is used to constrain the power law cosmology. It is found that the linear coasting is consistent with the SGL data within 1-$\sigma$ uncertainties but Pantheon+ sample does not support linear coasting.</description>

      <title>Small amplitude red giants elucidate the nature of the Tip of the Red Giant Branch as a standard candle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) is an important standard candle for determining luminosity distances. Although several $10^5$ small amplitude red giant stars (SARGs) have been discovered, variability was previously considered irrelevant for the TRGB as a standard candle. Here, we show that all stars near the TRGB are SARGs that follow several period-luminosity sequences, of which sequence A is younger than sequence B as predicted by stellar evolution. We measure apparent TRGB magnitudes, m$_{\mathrm{TRGB}}$, in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), using Sobel filters applied to photometry from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment and the ESA Gaia mission, and we identify several weaknesses in a recent LMC-based TRGB calibration used to measure the Hubble constant. We consider four samples: all Red Giants (RGs), SARGs, and sequences A &amp; B. The B-sequence is best suited for measuring distances to old RG populations, with M$_{\mathrm{F814W,0}}$ = -4.025 $\pm$ 0.014(stat.) $\pm$ 0.033(syst.) mag assuming the LMC's geometric distance. Control of systematics is demonstrated using detailed simulations. Population diversity affects m$_{\mathrm{TRGB}}$ at a level exceeding the stated precision: the SARG and A-sequence samples yield 0.039 mag and 0.085 mag fainter (at 5{\sigma} significance) m$_{\mathrm{TRGB}}$ values, respectively. Ensuring equivalent RG populations is crucial to measuring accurate TRGB distances. Additionally, luminosity function smoothing ($\sim$ 0.02 mag) and edge detection response weighting (as much as -0.06 mag) can further bias TRGB measurements, with the latter introducing a tip-contrast relation. We are optimistic that variable red giants will enable further improvements to the TRGB as a standard candle.</description>

      <title>Dark matter vorticity and velocity dispersion from truncated Dyson$\unicode{x2013}$Schwinger equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale structure formation is studied in a kinetic theory approach, extending the standard perfect pressureless fluid description for dark matter by including the velocity dispersion tensor as a dynamical degree of freedom. The evolution of power spectra for density, velocity and velocity dispersion degrees of freedom is investigated in a non-perturbative approximation scheme based on the Dyson$\unicode{x2013}$Schwinger equation. In particular, the generation of vorticity and velocity dispersion is studied and predictions for the corresponding power spectra are made, which qualitatively agree well with results obtained from $N$-body simulations. It is found that velocity dispersion grows strongly due to non-linear effects and at late times its mean value seems to be largely independent of the initial conditions. By taking this into account, a rather realistic picture of non-linear large-scale structure formation can be obtained, albeit the numerical treatment remains challenging, especially for very cold dark matter models.</description>

      <title>DEMNUni: cross-correlating the nonlinear ISWRS effect with CMB-lensing and galaxies in the presence of massive neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an analytical modelling of the angular cross-correlations between the Integrated Sachs Wolfe-Rees Sciama (ISWRS) effect and large-scale structure tracers in the presence of massive neutrinos. Our method has been validated against large N-body simulations with a massive neutrino particle component, namely the DEMNUni suite. We investigate the impact of different neutrino masses on the cross-correlations between the ISWRS effect and both the galaxy clustering and the lensing of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). We also test the ability of current nonlinear matter power spectrum modellings to reproduce neutrino effects in such cross-correlations. We show that the multipole position of a characteristic sign inversion in the cross-spectra, due to nonlinear effects, is strongly related to the total neutrino mass $M_\nu$ and depends almost linearly on it. While these nonlinear cross-correlation signals may not be able alone to constrain the neutrino mass, our approach paves the way to the detection of such cross-spectra on small scales for their exploitation in combination with main probes from future galaxy surveys and CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes in non-canonical scalar field inflation driven by quartic potential in the presence of bump</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, generation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) from quartic potential in the presence of a tiny bump in non-canonical inflationary model has been inquired. It is demonstrated that, a viable inflationary era can be driven through the quartic potential in non-canonical framework with a power-law Lagrangian density. Furthermore, setting a suitable function of inflaton field as a correction term (like a bump) to the quartic potential, causes the inflaton to slow down for a while. In such a short time span, the amplitude of the scalar perturbations power spectrum on small scales grows up sufficiently versus CMB scales. In addition to the bump feature, the enhancing effect of the $\alpha$ parameter of the Lagrangian on the amplitude of the scalar power spectrum has been shown. Fine tuning of three parameter Cases of the model results in generating of three Cases of PBHs. In addition, we investigate the secondary Gravitational Waves (GWs) produced during generation of PBHs and show that their contemporary density parameter spectra $(\Omega_{\rm GW_0})$ can be tracked down by GWs detectors.</description>

      <title>Scrutinizing coupled vector dark energy in light of data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since current challenges faced by $\Lambda$CDM might be hinting at new unravelled physics, here we investigate a plausible cosmological model where a vector field acts as source of dark energy. In particular, we examine whether an energy-momentum exchange between dark energy and dark matter could provide an explanation for current discrepancies in cosmological parameters. We carefully work out equations governing background and linear order perturbations and implement them in a Boltzmann code. We found that a negative coupling makes the dark energy equation of state less negative and closer to a cosmological constant during the matter dominated epoch than an uncoupled vector dark energy model. While the effect of the coupling is hardly noticeable through its effect on matter density perturbations, matter velocity perturbations and gravitational potentials are enhanced at late-times when dark energy dominates. Therefore, data of redshift space distortions help to narrow down these kinds of couplings in the dark sector. We computed cosmological constraints and found common parameters also present in $\Lambda$CDM are in good agreement with the Planck Collaboration baseline result. Our best fit for a negatively coupled vector field predicts a higher growth rate of matter perturbations at low redshift, thus exacerbating the disagreement with redshift space distortions data. While a positively coupled vector field can lead to power suppression of $P_{\rm{m}}(k,z=0)$ on small scales as well as a lower growth rate of matter perturbations than the standard model, it might compromise the goodness of fit to the CMB angular power spectrum on small scales. We conclude that our negatively coupled vector dark energy model does not solve current tensions (i.e., $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$). (abridged)</description>

      <title>A model-independent tripartite test of cosmic distance relations</title>

Abstract: Cosmological distances are fundamental observables in cosmology. The luminosity ($D_L$), angular diameter ($D_A$) and gravitational wave ($D_{\rm GW}$) distances are all trivially related in General Relativity assuming no significant absorption of photons in the extragalactic medium, also known as cosmic opacity. Supernovae have long been the main cosmological standard candle, but bright standard sirens are now a proven alternative, with the advantage of not requiring calibration with other astrophysical sources. Moreover, they can also measure deviations from modified gravity through discrepancies between $D_L$ and $D_{\rm GW}$. However, both gravitational and cosmological parameters are degenerate in the Hubble diagram, making it hard to properly detect beyond standard model physics. Finally, recently a model-independent method named FreePower was proposed to infer angular diameter distances from large-scale structure which is independent of both early universe and dark energy physics. In this paper we propose a tripartite test of the ratios of these three distances with minimal amount of assumptions regarding cosmology, the early universe, cosmic opacity and modified gravity. We proceed to forecast this test with a combination of LSST and Roman supernovae, Einstein Telescope bright sirens and a joint DESI-like + Euclid-like galaxy survey. We find that even in this very model-independent approach we will be able to detect, in each of many redshift bins, percent-level deviations in these ratios of distances, allowing for very precise consistency checks of $\Lambda$CDM and standard physics. It can also result in sub-percent measurements of $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Dark Matter in Light of the NICER Precise Mass-Radius Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the presence of self-interacting bosonic dark matter (DM) within neutron stars (NSs) in light of the latest multi-messenger observations of the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and LIGO/Virgo detectors. The bosonic DM is distributed as a core inside the NS or as a halo around it leading to formation of a DM admixed NS. We focus on the variation of the visible and dark radius of the mixed object due to DM model parameters and fractions. It is shown that DM core formation reduces the visible radius and the total mass pushing them below observational limits while halo formation is in favor of the latest mass-radius observations. Moreover, we scan over the parameter space of the bosonic DM model considering two nuclear matter equation of states by applying the radius, maximum mass and tidal deformability constraints. Our investigation allows for the exclusion of a range of DM fractions, self-coupling constant and sub-GeV boson masses, which limits the amount of accumulated DM to relatively low values to be consistent with astrophysical bounds. In this paper, we introduce main features of the pulse profile corresponding to the DM admixed NS as a novel observable quantity. We find that the depth of minimum fluxes in the pulse profiles crucially depends on the amount of DM around NS and its compactness. The current/future astrophysics missions may test the possibility of the existence of DM within NSs and break the degeneracies between different scenarios via multiple observations.</description>

We show that the average equation of state can be solved analytically. We discover that when $\alpha$ is small, the average equation of state of the oscillating inflaton field approaches that of a cosmological constant.

      <title>Primordial magnetic field as a common solution of nanohertz gravitational waves and the Hubble tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of interstellar and intergalactic magnetic fields remains largely unknown. One possibility is that they are related to the primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) produced by, for instance, the phase transitions of the early Universe. In this paper, we show that the PMF-induced turbulence generated at around the QCD phase transition epoch--the characteristic magnetic field strength $B_{\rm ch}^* \sim \mathcal{O}(1)~\rm{\mu G}$ and coherent length scale $\ell_{\rm ch}^* \sim \mathcal{O}(1)~\rm{pc}$--can naturally accommodate nanohertz gravitational waves reported by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations. Moreover, the evolution of the PMFs to the recombination era with the form of $B_{\rm ch}\sim \ell_{\rm ch}^{-\alpha}$ can induce baryon density inhomogeneities, alter the recombination history, and alleviate the tension of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter clumpiness parameter $S_8$ between early- and late-time measurements for $0.88\leq \alpha \leq 1.17$ (approximate 95\% credible region based on three PTA likelihoods). The further evolved PMFs may account for the $\sim {\cal O}(10^{-16})$ Gauss extragalactic magnetic field inferred with GRB 221009A.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons near rotating black holes can grow significantly via superradiant energy extraction, potentially reaching field values close to the Planck scale, thereby turning black holes into effective transducers for these fields. The interaction between a boson field and fermions can initiate a parametric production of fermions, potentially halting the exponential growth and leading to a saturated state of the boson cloud. This dynamic offers a framework for establishing limits on boson-neutrino interactions, which have traditionally been restricted by neutrino self-interaction considerations. At the saturation phase, boson clouds have the capacity to propel neutrinos to TeV-scale energies, generating fluxes that surpass atmospheric neutrino fluxes from nearby black holes. This mechanism extends to dark sector fermions, leading to the generation of boosted dark matter. These fluxes open novel avenues for observation through high-energy neutrino detectors like IceCube, as well as through dark matter direct detection, by directing observational efforts towards targeted black holes.</description>

      <title>Clumpy star formation and an obscured nuclear starburst in the luminous dusty z=4 galaxy GN20 seen by MIRI/JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dusty star-forming galaxies emit most of their light at far-IR to mm wavelengths as their star formation is highly obscured. Far-IR and mm observations have revealed their dust, neutral and molecular gas properties. The sensitivity of JWST at rest-frame optical and near-infrared wavelengths now allows the study of the stellar and ionized gas content. We investigate the spatially resolved distribution and kinematics of the ionized gas in GN20, a dusty star forming galaxy at $z$=4.0548. We present deep MIRI/MRS integral field spectroscopy of the near-infrared rest-frame emission of GN20. We detect spatially resolved \paa, out to a radius of 6 kpc, distributed in a clumpy morphology. The star formation rate derived from \paa\ (144 $\pm$ 9 \msunperyear) is only 7.7 $\pm 0.5 $\% of the infrared star formation rate (1860 $\pm$ 90 \msunperyear). We attribute this to very high extinction (A$_V$ = 17.2 $\pm$ 0.4 mag, or A$_{V,mixed}$ = 44 $\pm$ 3 mag), especially in the nucleus of GN20, where only faint \paa\ is detected, suggesting a deeply buried starburst. We identify four, spatially unresolved, clumps in the \paa\ emission. Based on the double peaked \paa\ profile we find that each clump consist of at least two sub-clumps. We find mass upper limits consistent with them being formed in a gravitationally unstable gaseous disk. The UV bright region of GN20 does not have any detected \paa\ emission, suggesting an age of more than 10 Myrs for this region of the galaxy. From the rotation profile of \paa\ we conclude that the gas kinematics are rotationally dominated and the $v_{rot}/\sigma_{m} = 3.8 \pm 1.4$ is similar to low-redshift LIRGs. We speculate that the clumps seen in GN20 could contribute to building up the inner disk and bulge of GN20.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we put forward a connection between the self-interacting dark matter and the Dirac nature of neutrinos. Our exploration involves a $Z_4 \otimes Z_4'$ discrete symmetry, wherein the Dirac neutrino mass is produced through a type-I seesaw mechanism. This symmetry not only contributes to the generation of the Dirac neutrino mass but also facilitates the realization of self-interacting dark matter with a light mediator that can alleviate small-scale anomalies of the $\Lambda {\rm CDM}$ while being consistent with the latter at large scales, as suggested by astrophysical observations. Thus the stability of the DM and Dirac nature of neutrinos are shown to stem from the same underlying symmetry. The model also features additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ of either thermal or non-thermal origin, within the reach of cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment providing a complementary probe in addition to the detection prospects of DM.</description>

      <title>The Redshift Evolution of the $M_\bullet-M_\star$ Relation for JWST's Supermassive Black Holes at $z &gt; 4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04159</link>

Abstract: JWST has detected many overmassive galactic systems at $z &gt; 4$, where the mass of the black hole, $M_\bullet$, is $10-100$ times larger than expected from local relations, given the host's stellar mass, $M_\star$. This Letter presents a model to describe these overmassive systems in the high-$z$ Universe. We suggest that the black hole mass is the main driver of high-$z$ star formation quenching. SMBHs globally impact their high-$z$ galaxies because their hosts are physically small, and the black holes have duty cycles close to unity at $z &gt; 4$. In this regime, we assume that black hole mass growth is regulated by the quasar's output, while stellar mass growth is quenched by it and uncorrelated to the global properties of the host halo. We find that the ratio $M_\bullet/M_\star$ controls the average star formation efficiency: if $M_\bullet/M_\star &gt; 8\times 10^{18} (n \Lambda/f_{edd})[(\Omega_b M_h)/(\Omega_m M_\star) - 1]$, then the galaxy is unable to form stars efficiently. Once this ratio exceeds the threshold, a runaway process brings the originally overmassive system towards the local $M_\bullet - M_\star$ relation. Furthermore, the $M_\bullet - M_\star$ relation evolves with redshift as $\propto (1+z)^{5/2}$. At $z \sim 5$, we find an overmassive factor of $\sim 55$, in excellent agreement with current JWST data and the high-$z$ relation inferred from those. Extending the black hole horizon farther in redshift and lower in mass will test this model and improve our understanding of the early co-evolution of black holes and galaxies.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Wavefunction of the Universe in Inflation with (Resonant) Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the statistics of scalar perturbations in models of inflation with small and rapid oscillations in the inflaton potential (resonant non-Gaussianity). We do so by deriving the wavefunction $\Psi[\zeta(\boldsymbol{x})]$ non-perturbatively in $\zeta$, but at first order in the amplitude of the oscillations. The expression of the wavefunction of the universe (WFU) is explicit and does not require solving partial differential equations. One finds qualitative deviations from perturbation theory for $ |\zeta| \gtrsim \alpha^{-2}$, where $\alpha \gg 1$ is the number of oscillations per Hubble time. Notably, the WFU exhibits distinct behaviours for negative and positive values of $\zeta$ (troughs and peaks respectively). While corrections for $\zeta &lt;0$ remain relatively small, of the order of the oscillation amplitude, positive $\zeta$ yields substantial effects, growing exponentially as $e^{\pi\alpha/2}$ in the limit of large $\zeta$. This indicates that even minute oscillations give large effects on the tail of the distribution.</description>

      <title>Cosmelkology: Elko fermions in FLRW space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmelkology is the study of Elko in cosmology. Elko is a massive spin-half field of mass dimension one. Elko differs from the Dirac and Majorana fermions because it furnishes the irreducible representation of the extended Poincare group with a two-fold Wigner degeneracy where the particle and anti-particle states both have four degrees of freedom. Elko has a renormalizable quartic self interaction which makes it a candidate for self-interacting dark matter. We study Elko in the spatially flat FLRW space-time and find exact solutions in the de Sitter space. By choosing the appropriate solutions and phases, the fields satisfy the canonical anti-commutation relations and have the correct time evolutions in the flat space limit.</description>

      <title>Holographic Inflation, Primordial Black Holes and Early Structure Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence has accumulated that there are supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the centers of most galaxies, and that these were formed in the very early universe by some as yet unknown process. In particular, there is evidence [15] that at least some galaxies formed as early as $10^8$ to $10^9$ years after the Big Bang host SMBHs. We suggest that the holographic model of inflation, whose dark matter candidates are primordial black holes carrying a discrete gauge charge, which originated as a small subset of the inflationary horizon volumes in the very early universe, can provide the seeds for this early structure formation. Aspects of the model pointed out long ago suggested an early era of structure formation, with structures dominated by dark matter. The additional assumption that the dark matter consists of discretely charged black holes implies black hole dominance of early structures, which seems to be implied by JWST data.</description>

      <title>Revisiting formation of primordial black holes in a supercooled first-order phase transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reexamine production of primordial black holes in a supercooled phase transition. While a mere overdensity associated with a surviving false-vacuum patch does not imply formation of a black hole, it is possible for such a patch to evolve and create a black hole, thanks to the gradient energy stored in the bubble wall.</description>

      <title>Primordial Rotating Disk Composed of $\geq$15 Dense Star-Forming Clumps at Cosmic Dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early galaxy formation, initiated by the dark matter and gas assembly, evolves through frequent mergers and feedback processes into dynamically hot, chaotic structures. In contrast, dynamically cold, smooth rotating disks have been observed in massive evolved galaxies merely 1.4 billion years after the Big Bang, suggesting rapid morphological and dynamical evolution in the early Universe. Probing this evolution mechanism necessitates studies of young galaxies, yet efforts have been hindered by observational limitations in both sensitivity and spatial resolution. Here we report high-resolution observations of a strongly lensed and quintuply imaged, low-luminosity, young galaxy at $z=6.072$ (dubbed the Cosmic Grapes), 930 million years after the Big Bang. Magnified by gravitational lensing, the galaxy is resolved into at least 15 individual star-forming clumps with effective radii of $r_{\rm e}\simeq$ 10--60 parsec (pc), which dominate $\simeq$ 70\% of the galaxy's total flux. The cool gas emission unveils a smooth, underlying rotating disk characterized by a high rotational-to-random motion ratio and a gravitationally unstable state (Toomre $Q \simeq$ 0.2--0.3), with high surface gas densities comparable to local dusty starbursts with $\simeq10^{3-5}$ $M_{\odot}$/pc$^{2}$. These gas properties suggest that the numerous star-forming clumps are formed through disk instabilities with weak feedback effects. The clumpiness of the Cosmic Grapes significantly exceeds that of galaxies at later epochs and the predictions from current simulations for early galaxies. Our findings shed new light on internal galaxy substructures and their relation to the underlying dynamics and feedback mechanisms at play during their early formation phases, potentially explaining the high abundance of bright galaxies observed in the early Universe and the dark matter core-cusp problem.</description>
