      <title>Notes on gauging noninvertible symmetries, part 2: higher multiplicity cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss gauging noninvertible zero-form symmetries in two dimensions, extending our previous work. Specifically, in this work we discuss more general gauged noninvertible symmetries in which the noninvertible symmetry is not multiplicity free, and discuss the case of Rep$(A_4)$ in detail. We realize Rep$(A_4)$ gaugings for the $c = 1$ CFT at the exceptional point in the moduli space and find new self-duality under gauging a certain non-group algebra object, leading to a larger noninvertible symmetry Rep$(SL(2, Z_3))$. We also discuss more general examples of decomposition in two-dimensional gauge theories with trivially-acting gauged noninvertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>The particle content of (scalar curvature)$^2$ metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linearizing metric-affine~(scalar curvature)$^2$ gravity -- an ``umbrella'' theory that includes as special cases the metrical, Einstein-Cartan, and Weyl quadratic models -- on top of Minkowski spacetime leads to (numerous) accidental~\emph{gauged}~symmetries. This suggests that the analysis of the spectrum on flat background is hindered by strong coupling effects.
  Such undesirable symmetries are absent already at the leading nontrivial order in perturbations on non-flat backgrounds, e.g. de Sitter spacetime, which are the appropriate ones for studying the particle dynamics of all these theories.</description>

      <title>Modular anomaly of BPS back holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating functions of BPS indices, counting states of D4-D2-D0 black holes in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type IIA string theory and identified with rank 0 Donaldson- Thomas invariants, are examples of mock modular forms. They have a quite complicated modular anomaly expressed as a sum over three different types of trees weighted by generalized error functions and their derivatives. We show that this anomaly can be significantly simplified, which in turn simplfies finding the corresponding mock modular generating functions.</description>

      <title>Correlation Functions and Trace Anomalies in Weakly Relevant Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study abstract weakly relevant flows in a general number of dimensions. They arguably provide the simplest example of renormalization group (RG) flows between two non-trivial fixed points. We compute several two-point correlation functions in position space valid along the whole RG flow. This is done by using conformal perturbation theory together with the solution of the Callan-Symanzik equation. From the explicit expressions of the two-point functions of conserved currents and the stress-tensor we extract the change in the central charges between the UV and IR fixed points. This immediately gives us $\Delta c$, the change of the $c-$trace anomaly between the UV and IR fixed points in 4d. We also discuss three-point functions.
  We couple weakly relevant flows to non-dynamical dilaton and graviton background fields in 4d. We compute the three-dilaton vertex in terms of the scalar two-point function and extract the value of $\Delta a$, the change of the $a$-trace anomaly between the UV and IR fixed points. We also compute the graviton-graviton-dilaton vertex in terms of the three-point function of two stress-tensors and a scalar, and extract the value of $\Delta c$.
  The $\Delta c$ values obtained with the two different methods agree.</description>

      <title>Foundations of ghost stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method to analytically prove global stability in ghost-ridden dynamical systems. Our proposal encompasses all prior results and consequentially extends them. In particular, we show that stability can follow from a conserved quantity that is unbounded from below, contrary to expectation. Novel examples illustrate all our results. Our findings take root on a careful examination of the literature, here comprehensively reviewed for the first time. This work lays the mathematical basis for ulterior extensions to field theory and quantization, and it constitutes a gateway for inter-disciplinary research in dynamics and integrability.</description>

      <title>Four-point correlators in N=4 SYM from AdS$_5$ bubbling geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Four-point correlation functions are observables of significant interest in holographic field theories. We compute an infinite family of four-point correlation functions of operators in short multiplets of 4D N=4 super Yang-Mills theory in the supergravity regime, by studying the quadratic fluctuations around non-trivial supergravity backgrounds. The supergravity backgrounds are supersymmetric smooth geometries in the family derived by Lin, Lunin and Maldacena. The light probes comprise an infinite sequence of Kaluza-Klein harmonics of the dilaton/axion. For generic parameter values, the supergravity backgrounds are dual to heavy CFT states. However we focus on the limit in which the dual CFT states become light single-particle states. The resulting all-light four-point correlators are related by superconformal Ward identities to previously known four-point correlators of half-BPS chiral primary operators. By verifying that the Ward identities are satisfied, we confirm the validity of the supergravity method.</description>

      <title>A Universal Feature for the Higgs Phenomenon in Anti de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Anti de Sitter space both massive and massless high-spin particles can have consistent local interactions. Both can couple to conserved currents. In this paper we show that when the particles have spin one or greater, there exists a universal feature associated to the particle becoming massive: the currents possess a non-vanishing boundary flux.</description>

      <title>Tunnelling and the Casimir effect on a $D$-dimensional sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two fundamental signatures of Quantum Mechanics are tunnelling and the Casimir effect. We examine the ground state energetic properties of a scalar field confined on a $D$-dimensional sphere, and subjected to these two effects. We focus on $D=2$ and $D=3$, with a non-minimal coupling of a massless scalar field to curvature, which provides a radius-dependent effective mass. This scenario allows tunnelling to be more important than the Casimir effect, in a certain regime of parameters, and potential implications in Early Cosmology are discussed for the case $D=3$, which could avoid a cosmological singularity.</description>

      <title>${\cal N}=(4,4)$ supersymmetric AdS$_3$ solutions in $d=11$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for AdS$_3$ solutions of $d=11$ supergravity to preserve ${\cal N}=(1,1)$ supersymmetry in terms of G-structures. Such solutions necessarily support an SU(3)-structure on the internal 8-manifold M$_8$, in terms of which we phrase the conditions for supersymmetry preservation. We use this to derive the local form of all ${\cal N}=(4,4)$ supersymmetric AdS$_3$ solutions in $d=11$, for which M$_8$ decomposes as a foliation of a 3-sphere over a 5 dimensional base. There are 3 independent classes, 2 of which preserve the small superconformal algebra and one preserving its large counterpart for which M$_5$ contains a second 3-sphere. We show that for each solution with large (4,4) supersymmetry there are two corresponding solutions with small $(4,4)$, one for which M$_5$ maintains its 3-sphere, one where this blows up to $\mathbb{R}^3$ which can be compactified to $\mathbb{T}^3$. We use our results to construct several new solutions that lie within our derived classes as well as recovering some existing solutions.</description>

      <title>Vertex operators for the kinematic algebra of Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kinematic algebra of Yang-Mills theory can be understood in the framework of homotopy algebras: the $L_{\infty}$ algebra of Yang-Mills theory is the tensor product of the color Lie algebra and a kinematic space that carries a $C_{\infty}$ algebra. There are also hidden structures that generalize Batalin-Vilkovisky algebras, which explain color-kinematics duality and the double copy but are only partially understood. We show that there is a representation of the $C_{\infty}$ algebra, in terms of vertex operators, on the Hilbert space of a first-quantized worldline theory. To this end we introduce $A_{\infty}$ morphisms, which define the vertex operators and which inject the $C_{\infty}$ algebra into the strictly associative algebra of operators on the Hilbert space. We also take first steps to represent the hidden structures on the same space.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological CPT Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The CPT theorem states that a unitary and Lorentz-invariant theory must also be invariant under a discrete symmetry $\mathbf{CRT}$ which reverses charge, time, and one spatial direction. In this article, we study a $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry group, in which two of the nontrivial symmetries (``Reflection Reality'' and a 180 degree rotation) are implied by Unitarity and Lorentz Invariance respectively, while the third is $\mathbf{CRT}$. (In cosmology, Scale Invariance plays the role of Lorentz Invariance.) This naturally leads to converses of the CPT theorem, as any two of the discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries will imply the third one. Furthermore, in many field theories, the Reflection Reality $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry is actually sufficient to imply the theory is fully unitary, over a generic range of couplings. Building upon previous work on the Cosmological Optical Theorem, we derive non-perturbative reality conditions associated with bulk Reflection Reality (in all flat FLRW models) and $\mathbf{CRT}$ (in de Sitter spacetime), in arbitrary dimensions. Remarkably, this $\mathbf{CRT}$ constraint suffices to fix the phase of all wavefunction coefficients at future infinity (up to a real sign) -- without requiring any analytic continuation, or comparison to past infinity -- although extra care is required in cases where the bulk theory has logarithmic UV or IR divergences. This result has significant implications for de Sitter holography, as it allows us to determine the phases of arbitrary $n$-point functions in the dual CFT.</description>

      <title>Mellin amplitudes for $AdS_3 \times S^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are holographic superconformal theories in all dimensions between two and six which allow arbitrary tree-level four-point functions to be fixed by basic consistency conditions. Although Mellin space is usually the most efficient setting for imposing these contraints, four-point functions in two dimensions have thus far been an exception due to their more intricate dependence on the conformal cross-ratios. In this paper, we introduce a simple fix which exploits the relation between a parity-odd conformal block in two dimensions and a parity-even conformal block in four dimensions. We then apply the resulting toolkit to a study of the paradigmatic holographic theory in two dimensions which is the D1-D5 CFT. For correlators involving Kaluza-Klein modes of the tensor multiplet, this analysis reproduces results which were previously obtained using hidden conformal symmetry. With four Kaluza-Klein modes of the graviton multiplet, it yields new results including a compact formula for the correlators of all pairwise identical operators,</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the annihilation process of an electron-positron pair into a heavier lepton-antilepton pair, taking into account the presence of an external classical magnetic field. Additionally, it investigates corrections arising from the breakdown of Lorentz symmetries and the existence of Electric Dipole Moments (EDM) for leptons. Graphics are constructed to illustrate the influence of EDM and Lorentz violation on the cross section. Strong magnetic field limit is analyzed. Furthermore, the investigation utilizes experimental data on EDM values to explore the upper limits of the Lorentz violation parameters.</description>

      <title>Effective geometry of Bell-network states on a dipole graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bell-network states are a class of entangled states of the geometry that satisfy an area-law for the entanglement entropy in a limit of large spins and are automorphism-invariant, for arbitrary graphs. We present a comprehensive analysis of the effective geometry of Bell-network states on a dipole graph. Our main goal is to provide a detailed characterization of the quantum geometry of a class of diffeomorphism-invariant, area-law states representing homogeneous and isotropic configurations in loop quantum gravity, which may be explored as boundary states for the dynamics of the theory. We found that the average geometry at each node in the dipole graph does not match that of a flat tetrahedron. Instead, the expected values of the geometric observables satisfy relations that are characteristic of spherical tetrahedra. The mean geometry is accompanied by fluctuations with considerable relative dispersion for the dihedral angle, and perfectly correlated for the two nodes.</description>

      <title>Inflation models with Peccei-Quinn symmetry and axion kinetic misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a consistent framework with the $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry for obtaining the initial condition for axion kinetic misalignment from inflation. We introduce a PQ complex scalar field and an extra Higgs doublet, which are conformally coupled to gravity, and three right-handed neutrinos for the seesaw mechanism. In the DFSZ type scenarios for the axion, we obtain the PQ anomalies from the Standard Model quarks carrying nonzero PQ charges in some of two Higgs doublet models, solving the strong CP problem by the QCD potential for the axion. Assuming that the PQ symmetry is explicitly violated in the scalar potential by quantum gravity effects, we show that a sufficiently large initial axion velocity can be obtained at the end inflation while avoiding the axion quality problem. As inflation is driven by the radial distance from the origin in the space of scalar fields close to the pole of the kinetic terms in the Einstein frame, we obtain successful inflationary predictions and set the initial axion velocity at the end of inflation. Focusing on the pure PQ inflation with a small running quartic coupling for the PQ field, we discuss the post-inflationary dynamics for the inflaton and the axion. As a result, we show that a sufficiently high reheating temperature, can be obtained dominantly from the Higgs-portal couplings to the PQ field, while being consistent with axion kinetic misalignment, the stability for the Higgs fields during inflation and the non-restoration of the PQ symmetry after reheating.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave signatures of gravito-electromagnetic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) can undoubtedly serve as a messenger from the early Universe acting as well as a novel probe of the underlying gravity theory. In this work, motivated by one-loop vacuum-polarization effects on curved spacetime, we investigate a gravitational theory with non-minimal curvature-electromagnetic coupling terms of the form $\xi R F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}$, where $R$ is the scalar curvature and $F_{\mu\nu}$ the Faraday tensor, which can be responsible for the generation of primordial electromagnetic fields. We study then the GW signatures of such coupling terms deriving in particular for the first time to the best of our knowledge the modified tensor modes equation of motion. Remarkably, we find a universal infrared (IR) frequency scaling $f^5$ of the electromagnetically induced GW (EMIGW) signal, which, depending on the energy scale of inflation, the duration of inflation and reheating as well as the dynamical behaviour of the gauge coupling function $\xi$, can be well within the detection sensitivity bands of GW experiments such as SKA, LISA, ET and BBO, being thus potentially detectable in the future by GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Scant evidence for thawing quintessence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New constraints on the expansion rate of the Universe seem to favor evolving dark energy in the form of thawing quintessence models, i.e., models for which a canonical, minimally coupled scalar field has, at late times, begun to evolve away from potential energy domination. We scrutinize the evidence for thawing quintessence by exploring what it predicts for the equation of state. We show that, in terms of the usual Chevalier-Polarski-Linder parameters, ($w_0$, $w_a$), thawing quintessence is, in fact, only marginally consistent with a compilation of the current data. Despite this, we embrace the possibility that thawing quintessence is dark energy and find constraints on the microphysics of this scenario. We do so in terms of the effective mass $m^2$ and energy scale $V_0$ of the scalar field potential. We are particularly careful to enforce un-informative, flat priors on these parameters so as to minimize their effect on the final posteriors. While the current data favors a large and negative value of $m^2$, when we compare these models to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model we find that there is scant evidence for thawing quintessence.</description>

      <title>Local renormalisation from causal loop-tree duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report recent progress on the development of a local renormalisation formalism based on causal loop-tree duality (cLTD). By performing an expansion around the UV-propagator in an Euclidean space, we manage to build counter-terms to cancel the non-integrable terms in the UV limit. This procedure is then combined with the so-called causal representation, and the UV expansion is performed at the level of on-shell energies. The resulting expressions are more compact, and they retain nice properties of the original causal representation. The proposed formalism is tested up to three-loops, with relevant families of topologies. In all the cases, we successfully cancel the UV divergences and achieve a smooth numerical implementation. These results constitute a first step towards a new renormalisation program in four space-time dimensions (by-passing DREG), perfectly suitable for fully numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Magnetogenesis from axion-SU(2) inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a novel proposal for inflationary magnetogenesis by identifying the non-Abelian sector of Spectator Chromo Natural Inflation (SCNI) with the $\rm{SU(2)}_{\rm L}$ sector of the Standard Model. This mechanism relies on the recently discovered attractor of SCNI in the strong backreaction regime, where the gauge fields do not decay on super-horizon scales and their backreaction leads to a stable new trajectory for the rolling axion field. The large super-horizon gauge fields are partly transformed after the electroweak phase transition into electromagnetic fields. The strength and correlation length of the resulting helical magnetic fields depend on the inflationary Hubble scale and the details of the SCNI sector. For suitable parameter choices we show that the strength of the resulting magnetic fields having correlation lengths around $1\, {\rm {Mpc}}$ are consistent with the required intergalactic magnetic fields for explaining the spectra of high energy $\gamma$ rays from distant blazars.</description>

      <title>Comparing Inflationary Models in Extended Metric-Affine Theories of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study slow-roll inflation as a common feature in Metric-affine Theories of Gravity. In particular, we take into account extended metric, teleparallel and symmetric-teleparallel theories of gravity, based on different geometric invariants, discussing analogies and differences. The analysis for each model is performed in two approaches. First, we focus on the {\it potential-slow-roll approach} by studying the reconstructed potentials for different forms of the extended models related to the considered gravitational theory in the Einstein frame. Secondly, we investigate the {\it Hubble-slow-roll approach} for some conventional inflationary potentials related to the specific extended model in the Jordan frame. We compare all results with cosmic microwave background anisotropy observations coming from Planck 2018 and BICEP2/Keck array satellites in order to find the observational constraints on the parameters space of the models as well as their prediction from the spectral parameters. Eventually, we attempt to present a qualitative comparison between three classes of considered modified gravities using the obtained inflationary results. The aim is to select, in principle, cosmological signatures capable of discriminating among concurrent models in view to point out the representation of gravity, according with geometric invariants, which better addresses the early universe dynamics.</description>

      <title>Signatures of topology in generic transport measurements for Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the signatures of the topological properties of the bandstructures for nodal-point semimetals are embedded in the response coefficients, arising in two distinct experimental set-ups, by taking the Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl semimetal as an example. The first scenario involves the computation of third-rank tensors representing second-order response coefficients, relating the charge/thermal current densities to the combined effects of the gradient of the chemical potential and an external electric field/temperature gradient. On the premises that internode scatterings can be ignored, the relaxation-time approximation leads to a quantized value for the nonvanishing components of each of these nonlinear response tensors, characterizing a single untilted RSW node. Furthermore, the final expressions turn out to be insensitive to the specific values of the chemical potential and the temperature. The second scenario involves computing the magnetoelectric conductivity under the action of collinear electric ($\mathbf E$) and magnetic ($\mathbf B$) fields, representing a planar Hall set-up. In particular, our focus is in bringing out the dependence of the linear-in-$|\mathbf B|$ parts of the conductivity tensor on the intrinsic topological properties of the bandstructure, which are nonvanishing only in the presence of a nonzero tilt in the energy spectrum.</description>

Abstract: We look for UV fixed points of non-abelian $SU(n_c)$ gauge theories in $4+2\epsilon$ dimensions with $n_f$ Dirac fermions in the fundamental representation, using the available five-loop $\overline{{\rm MS}}$ $\beta$-function and employing Pad\'e-Borel resummation techniques and Pad\'e approximants to the series expansion in $\epsilon$. We find evidence for a $5d$ UV-fixed point for $SU(2)$ theories with $n_f\leq 4$. We also compute the anomalous dimensions $\gamma$ and $\gamma_g$ of respectively the fermion mass bilinear and the gauge kinetic term operator at the UV fixed point.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04827v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown previously, that the spatial thermal variation of a thermal medium can be recast as a variation in the Euclidean metric. It is now extended to temporal variations in temperature, for a non-relativistic thermal bath, which remains in local thermal equilibrium. This is achieved by examining the thermal field theory in a five-dimensional space-time-temperature. The bulk thermodynamic quantity, namely the energy density, is calculated for a neutral scalar field with a time-dependent Hamiltonian. Furthermore, the concept of recasting thermal variations as a variation in the metric is extended to thermal systems in a gravitational field. The Einstein field equations, in the 5-D space-time-temperature, is determined. It is shown that the resulting Ricci scalar can lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking, leading to the Higgs mechanism. In essence, the asymmetry in the distribution of temperature in space-time can translate to spontaneous symmetry breaking of particle fields, in a very strong gravitational field.</description>

      <title>Patchwork Conditions for Holographic Nonlinear Responses: A Computational Method for Electric Conductivity and Friction Coefficient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02633v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method to compute nonlinear transport coefficients in holography, such as nonlinear DC conductivity and nonlinear friction coefficient. The conventional method can be applied only to the models whose action in the gravity dual has the ``square-root structure,'' i.e., the Dirac-Born-Infeld action of the probe D-branes or the Nambu-Goto action of the probe strings. Our method is applicable to a wider range of holographic models whose action does not have such a square-root structure. We propose a condition to obtain regular physical configurations in the gravity dual in the form of two simultaneous equations, which we call the patchwork condition. Our method also enables us to estimate the effective temperature of the nonequilibrium steady states in a wider range of holographic models. We show that a general model exhibits different effective temperatures for different fluctuation modes.</description>

      <title>The Bestiary of 6d (1,0) SCFTs: Nilpotent Orbits and Anomalies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many six-dimensional $(1,0)$ SCFTs are known to fall into families labelled by nilpotent orbits of certain simple Lie algebras. For each of the three infinite series of such families, we show that the anomalies for the continuous zero-form global symmetries of a theory labelled by a nilpotent orbit $O$ of $\mathfrak{g}$ can be determined from the anomalies of the theory associated to the trivial nilpotent orbit (the parent theory), together with the data of $O$. In particular, knowledge of the tensor branch field theory is bypassed completely. We show that the known anomalies, previously determined from the geometric/atomic construction, are reproduced by analyzing the Nambu--Goldstone modes inside of the moment map associated to the $\mathfrak{g}$ flavor symmetry of the parent SCFT. This provides further evidence for the physics underlying the labelling of the SCFTs by nilpotent orbits. We remark on some consequences, such as the reinterpretation of the 6d $a$-theorem for such SCFTs in terms of group theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that quantum error correction is realized by the renormalization group in scalar field theories. We construct $q$-level states by using coherent states in the IR region. By acting on them the inverse of the unitary operator $U$ that describes the renormalization group flow of the ground state, we encode them into states in the UV region. We find the situations in which the Knill-Laflamme condition is satisfied for operators that create coherent states. We verify this to the first order in the perturbation theory. This result suggests a general relationship between the renormalization group and quantum error correction and should give insights into understanding the role played by them in the gauge/gravity correspondence.</description>

Abstract: Non-relativistic conformal field theory describes many-body physics at unitarity. The correlation functions of the system are fixed by the requirement of conformal invariance. In this article, we discuss the correlation functions of scalar operators in non-relativistic conformal field theories in momentum space. We discuss the solution of conformal Ward identities and express 2,3, and 4-point functions as a function of energy and momentum. We also express the 3- and 4-point functions in the momentum space as the one-loop and three-loop Feynman diagram computations, respectively. Lastly, we generalize the discussion to the momentum space correlation functions in the presence of a boundary.</description>

Abstract: We study the Restricted Phase Space Thermodynamics (RPST) of magnetically charged Anti de Sitter (AdS) black holes sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics(NED). The first law and the corresponding Euler relation are examined using the scaling properties. While the mass is homogeneous in the first order, the intensive variables are observed to follow zeroth order homogeneity. We use numerical and graphical techniques to find the critical points of the various thermodynamic quantities. By utilizing the re-scaling properties of the equation of states, we study the thermodynamic processes using different pairs of variables. From our analysis, we infer that although the RPS thermodynamics of NED-AdS black hole resembles those of RN-AdS, Kerr-AdS, Kerr-Sen-Ads black holes in most of its aspects, hinting at a possible universality, there exists one particular $\mu-C$ process that differs in its behaviour from its counterparts in earlier reported works.</description>

Abstract: We apply a formulation of Einstein's general relativity with only cubic interactions for deriving the metric of a Schwarzschild black hole to all orders in perturbation theory. This cubic interactions formulation coupled to effective worldline action of a massive point particle allows to derive a recursion relation for the form factors of the off-shell graviton emission current. The unique solution to the recursion relation leads to the Schwarzschild black-hole solution in four dimensions. This provides the first derivation of the black hole metric from a matter source to all orders in perturbation theory from an amplitude approach.</description>

Abstract: We study the pair production, string breaking, and hadronization of a receding electron-positron pair using the bosonized version of the massive Schwinger model in quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 space-time dimensions. Specifically, we study the dynamics of the electric field in Bjorken coordinates by splitting it into a coherent field and its Gaussian fluctuations. We find that the electric field shows damped oscillations, reflecting pair production. Interestingly, the computation of the asymptotic total particle density per rapidity interval for large masses can be fitted using a Boltzmann factor, where the temperature can be related to the hadronization temperature in QCD. Lastly, we discuss the possibility of an analog quantum simulation of the massive Schwinger model using ultracold atoms, explicitly matching the potential of the Schwinger model to the effective potential for the relative phase of two linearly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

Abstract: We study Polchinski's "fermion-rotor system" as an accurate description of charged Weyl fermions scattering on a magnetic monopole core in the limit of zero gauge coupling. Traditionally it was thought such scattering could lead to fractional particle numbers ("semitons"). By direct calculations we show those semitonic processes are in fact free propagation, facilitated by composite fermion-rotor operators interpolating the "forbidden" states, effectively "recovering" both ingoing and outgoing states in every lowest partial wave. Non-semitonic Callan-Rubakov processes are unchanged.</description>

      <title>Note on $\mathcal{N}=8$ supersymmetric mechanics with dynamical and semi-dynamical multiplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a Hamiltonian formulation of the new model of $\mathcal{N}=8$ supersymmetric mechanics recently proposed by S.Fedoruk and E.Ivanov and show that it possesses the dynamical $\mathcal{N}=8$ superconformal symmetry $osp(8|2)$. The bosonic part of the Hamiltonian is just a free particle on eight-dimensional Euclidean space, while the fermionic part can be interpreted as a spin-orbit interaction term.</description>

      <title>Detecting single gravitons with quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantization of gravity is widely believed to result in gravitons -- particles of discrete energy that form gravitational waves. But their detection has so far been considered impossible. Here we show that signatures of single graviton exchange can be observed in laboratory experiments. We show that stimulated and spontaneous single-graviton processes can become relevant for massive quantum acoustic resonators and that stimulated absorption can be resolved through continuous sensing of quantum jumps. We analyze the feasibility of observing the exchange of single energy quanta between matter and gravitational waves. Our results show that single graviton signatures are within reach of experiments. In analogy to the discovery of the photo-electric effect for photons, such signatures can provide the first experimental clue of the quantization of gravity.</description>

      <title>Isospectrality and configurational entropy as testing tools for bottom-up AdS/QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16007v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work discusses the connection between isospectrality and configurational entropy in holographic bottom-up models. We analyze the effect of monoparametric isospectral transformation in holographic decay constants and configurational entropy for a set of softwall-like models at zero temperature. We conclude that the isospectral parameter $\lambda$ defines a window of possible holographic models suitable to describe spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Ghost-free Electroweak Symmetry Breaking with Weakly Nonlocal Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08311v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weakly nonlocal (WNL) Quantum Field Theories (QFT's) may define a new class of UV-completions in particle physics and gravity, without introducing any new elementary particle. One problematic issue is how to realize spontaneous symmetry breaking without introducing an infinite tower of ghosts in the perturbative spectrum. In this article, a WNL extension of the Standard Model (SM) is proposed: the Fuzzy Standard Model (FSM). It is a smooth deformation of the SM based on covariant star-products of fields. This new formalism realizes electroweak symmetry breaking without ghosts at tree-level. We give evidences that the FSM exhibits Vainshtein screening, aka classicalization, in the deep-UV. This could solve the electroweak hierarchy problem if it occurs at the TeV-scale.</description>

      <title>Ringdowns for black holes with scalar hair: the large mass case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deviations from General Relativity can alter the quasi-normal mode (QNM) ringdown of perturbed black holes. It is known that a shift-symmetric (hence massless) scalar can only introduce black hole hair if it couples to the Gauss-Bonnet invariant, in which case the scalar charge is fixed with respect to the black hole mass and controlled by the strength of that coupling. The charge per unit mass decreases with the mass and can, therefore, be used as a perturbative parameter for black holes that are sufficiently large with respect to the scale suppressing the deviation from General Relativity or the Standard model. We construct an effective field theory scheme for QNMs using this perturbative parameter to capture deviations from Kerr for both the background and the perturbations. We demonstrate that up to second order in the charge per unit mass, QNMs can be calculated by solving standard linearised perturbation equations for the Kerr metric with sources depending on solutions of the same equations up to first order. It follows that corrections to the QNM frequencies are heavily suppressed for sufficiently massive black holes, meaning that LISA is very unlikely to detect any evidence of scalar hair in ringdown signals.</description>

      <title>FeynCalc 10: Do multiloop integrals dream of computer codes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we report on a new version of FeynCalc, a Mathematica package widely used in the particle physics community for manipulating quantum field theoretical expressions and calculating Feynman diagrams. Highlights of the new version include greatly improved capabilities for doing multiloop calculations, including topology identification and minimization, optimized tensor reduction, rewriting of scalar products in terms of inverse denominators, detection of equivalent or scaleless loop integrals, derivation of Symanzik polynomials, Feynman parametric as well as graph representation for master integrals and initial support for handling differential equations and iterated integrals. In addition to that, the new release also features completely rewritten routines for color algebra simplifications, inclusion of symmetry relations between arguments of Passarino--Veltman functions, tools for determining matching coefficients and quantifying the agreement between numerical results, improved export to LaTeX and first steps towards a better support of calculations involving light-cone vectors.</description>

      <title>A Collinear Perspective on the Regge Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high energy (Regge) limit provides a playground for understanding all loop structures of scattering amplitudes, and plays an important role in the description of many phenomenologically relevant cross-sections. While well understood in the planar limit, the structure of non-planar corrections introduces many fascinating complexities, for which a general organizing principle is still lacking. We study the structure of multi-reggeon exchanges in the context of the effective field theory for forward scattering, and derive their factorization into collinear operators (impact factors) and soft operators. We derive the structure of the renormalization group consistency equations in the effective theory, showing how the anomalous dimensions of the soft operators are related to those of the collinear operators, allowing us to derive renormalization group equations in the Regge limit purely from a collinear perspective. The rigidity of the consistency equations provides considerable insight into the all orders organization of Regge amplitudes in the effective theory, as well as its relation to other approaches. Along the way we derive a number of technical results that improve the understanding of the effective theory. We illustrate this collinear perspective by re-deriving all the standard BFKL equations for two-Glauber exchange from purely collinear calculations, and we show that this perspective provides a number of conceptual and computational advantages as compared to the standard view from soft or Glauber physics. We anticipate that this formulation in terms of collinear operators will enable a better understanding of the relation between BFKL and DGLAP in gauge theories, and facilitate the analysis of renormalization group evolution equations describing Reggeization beyond next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunneling in a quintessence background and the role of GUP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we studied quantum tunneling of massless and massive particles pertaining to a Schwarzschild black hole in a quintessence background, and explored the consequences emerging from a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP). For the quintessence scenario, we considered two specific cases of $w$, which is the ratio of the pressure and energy density, namely $w=-1/3$ and $w=-2/3$. For the GUP, we used a modified Schwarzschild metric and employed a unique choice of contour integration to compute the tunneling amplitudes. An analysis and comparative study of the respective temperature profiles have been made.</description>
