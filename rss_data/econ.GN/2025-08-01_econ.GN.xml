      <title>Will Compute Bottlenecks Prevent an Intelligence Explosion?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of a rapid, "software-only" intelligence explosion brought on by AI's recursive self-improvement (RSI) is a subject of intense debate within the AI community. This paper presents an economic model and an empirical estimation of the elasticity of substitution between research compute and cognitive labor at frontier AI firms to shed light on the possibility. We construct a novel panel dataset for four leading AI labs (OpenAI, DeepMind, Anthropic, and DeepSeek) from 2014 to 2024 and fit the data to two alternative Constant Elasticity of Substitution (CES) production function models. Our two specifications yield divergent results: a baseline model estimates that compute and labor are substitutes, whereas a 'frontier experiments' model, which accounts for the scale of state-of-the-art models, estimates that they are complements. We conclude by discussing the limitations of our analysis and the implications for forecasting AI progress.</description>

      <title>Are EU low-carbon structural funds efficient in reducing emissions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effectiveness of low-carbon expenditures from the European Structural and Investment Funds in reducing greenhouse gas emissions across EU regions. Using trend and cycle decomposition of two indicators -- per capita emissions and emissions intensity -- we find highly heterogeneous effects. In less developed regions, investments are linked to long-term increases in per capita emissions, while in transition and developed regions, effects are weak or not significant. Instrumental variable estimates confirm this pattern. When disaggregated by gas type, results remain inconsistent. Overall, our findings highlight the limited climate effectiveness of EU funding and the need for region-specific strategies.</description>

      <title>Keeping in Place After the Storm-Emergency Assistance and Evictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We offer evidence that federal emergency assistance (FEMA) in the days following natural disasters mitigate evictions in comparison to similar emergency scenarios where FEMA aid is not provided. We find an approximate 16.5% increase in overall evictions after hurricane natural disaster events that increases to 19.7% when excluding ZIP codes that receive FEMA rental assistance. Furthermore, we also show that FEMA aid acts as a liquidity buffer to other forms of emergency credit, specifically we find that both transactions volumes and defaults decrease during hurricane events in locations that do receive FEMA aid. This effect largely reverses in areas that do not receive FEMA aid, where the magnitude of transaction volumes drop by less and default rates remain similar relative to the baseline. Overall, this suggests that the availability of emergency liquidity during natural disaster events is indeed a binding constraint with real household financial consequences, in particular through our documented channel of evictions and in usage of high-cost credit.</description>

      <title>Attention vs Choice in Incomplete Welfare Take-Up: What Works for WIC?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two approaches to decompose the reasons for welfare program non-participation among eligible households into two latent mechanisms: attention and choice. Approach I applies the attention-choice model from the consumer economics literature to the welfare take-up problem. Approach II incorporates random effects into Approach I, allowing for unobserved household-level heterogeneity and conditional dependence between attention and choice. We show that critical aspects of Approach II are semiparametrically identifiable through a novel strategy we call coherent shuffle. Applied to NLSY data for WIC participation, both approaches show that a choice-inducing solution is more effective in promoting take-up than an attention-raising solution. We validate our claims using the Vermont WIC2FIVE quasi-experimental data. The permutation test and DiD estimate strongly support that choice-inducing text messages are highly effective in retaining eligible households in the WIC program, while attention-raising text messages hardly have any effect on the retention rate.</description>

      <title>Quotas for scholarship recipients: an efficient race-neutral alternative to affirmative action?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since 2018, France's centralized higher education platform, Parcoursup, has implemented quotas for scholarship recipients, with program-specific thresholds based on the applicants' composition. Using difference-in-differences methods, I find that these quotas enabled scholarship students to access more selective programs, although the intention-to-treat effects remain modest. Matching methods reveal that the policy improved the scholarship students' waiting list positions relative to those of comparable non-scholarship peers, and simulations suggest that the modest effect could be attributed to the low intensity of the treatment. However, I detect no robust or lasting effects on the extensive margin of higher education access. Despite high policy salience, quotas did not affect the application behavior or pre-college investment of scholarship students, even among high achievers. These findings align with research on affirmative action, suggesting that such policies primarily benefit disadvantaged students who access selective institutions, rather than expanding total enrollment. Nevertheless, scholarship quotas demonstrate that race-neutral alternatives can effectively promote socioeconomic diversity in prestigious programs.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Spatial Distribution Dynamics: A Comprehensive Theoretical and Empirical Framework for Analyzing Productivity Agglomeration Effects in Japan's Aging Society</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19911v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops the first comprehensive theoretical and empirical framework for analyzing AI-driven spatial distribution dynamics in metropolitan areas undergoing demographic transition. We extend New Economic Geography by formalizing five novel AI-specific mechanisms: algorithmic learning spillovers, digital infrastructure returns, virtual agglomeration effects, AI-human complementarity, and network externalities. Using Tokyo as our empirical laboratory, we implement rigorous causal identification through five complementary econometric strategies and develop machine learning predictions across 27 future scenarios spanning 2024-2050. Our theoretical framework generates six testable hypotheses, all receiving strong empirical support. The causal analysis reveals that AI implementation increases agglomeration concentration by 4.2-5.2 percentage points, with heterogeneous effects across industries: high AI-readiness sectors experience 8.4 percentage point increases, while low AI-readiness sectors show 1.2 percentage point gains. Machine learning predictions demonstrate that aggressive AI adoption can offset 60-80\% of aging-related productivity declines. We provide a strategic three-phase policy framework for managing AI-driven spatial transformation while promoting inclusive development. The integrated approach establishes a new paradigm for analyzing technology-driven spatial change with global applications for aging societies.</description>
