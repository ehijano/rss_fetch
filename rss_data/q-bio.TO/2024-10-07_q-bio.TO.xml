      <title>An asymmetric surface coating strategy for promotes rapid endothelialization in the rabbit carotid artery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying surface modification has long been a key area for enhancing the effects of vascular stents after surgery. The study aimed to develop an asymmetric drug-eluting stent (ADES) with differential drug loading on its inner and outer surfaces, hypothesizing that this design would enhance drug delivery efficacy for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs) compared to uniformly coated drug-eluting stents (UDES). An ultrasonic atomization spraying device was utilized to fabricate the ADES, which was subsequently evaluated for drug release patterns, hemocompatibility, and biocompatibility. In vitro, assessments demonstrated favorable hemocompatibility and showed targeted drug delivery capabilities of ADES within artificial blood vessels. Furthermore, in vivo testing using a rabbit carotid artery model revealed significant endothelialization on stented segments treated with the ADES. These findings suggest that the ADES holds promise as a minimally invasive platform for improving cardiovascular disease treatment outcomes by addressing thrombus formation and neointima proliferation more effectively than traditional stents.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling of hydrogel scaffold anisotropy during extrusion-based 3D printing for tissue engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02734v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extrusion-based 3D printing is a recent and widely used tissue engineering tool that provides precise 3D control of bioinks to create organ-size biomaterial-based objects composed of hierarchically organized cellularized scaffolds. The internal organization of scaffold constituents should mimic the structural anisotropy of targeted tissue to stimulate proliferative cellular behavior during 3D cell culture. Both the choice of polymers constituting the bioink and the topological properties during the extrusion process greatly influence the structural anisotropy and cellular response of tissue engineering constructs. The bioink used in our study was a hydrogel made of three constituents: fibrinogen, alginate and gelatin. These components provide biocompatibility, printability and conservation of 3D shape after printing. The topological properties in flowing polymers are dictated by macromolecule conformation i.e. their orientation and degree of stretch. In this study, we used the micro-macro approach to describe the orientation state of hydrogel macromolecules during the extrusion process, offering a two-scale description of fluid behavior. The goal of our study was to use the Fokker-Planck equation, which describes the evolution of probability distribution function over time, to represent the real state of the constituent population in the representative elementary volume within a hydrogel during extrusion-based 3D printing. Our data suggest that for a tubular nozzle syringe, constituent orientation is driven by a high shear rate, which overcomes the fluid rheological behavior. Also, the interaction coefficient, which represents the microscopic interaction between fluid particles overcomes hydrogel behavior for constituent orientation in the prediction model.</description>
