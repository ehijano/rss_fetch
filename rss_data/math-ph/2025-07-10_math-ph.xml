      <title>Mutual Influence of Symmetries and Topological Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the fusion 2-category symmetry of a fermionic (2+1)d QFT can be affected when one allows for stacking with TQFTs to be an equivalence relation for QFTs. Focusing on a simple kind of fermionic fusion 2-category described purely by group theoretical data, our results reveal that by allowing for stacking with $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_1$ as an equivalence relation enables a finite set of inequivalent modifications to the original fusion 2-categorical-symmetry. To put our results in a broader context, we relate the order of the symmetry modifications to the image of a map between groups of minimal nondegenerate extensions, and to the tangential structure set by the initial categorical symmetry on the background manifold for the QFT.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable inhomogeneous XY spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytical expressions for the eigenvalues of certain inhomogeneous XY spin chains are computed. These models are rewritten in terms of free-fermion models using a well-known Jordan-Wigner transformation. Finding the spectrum of such models amounts to diagonalizing a matrix whose size is equal to the number of sites in the chain. This is achieved by recognizing and exploiting contiguity relations satisfied by specific orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>Linear and Regular Kepler-Manev Dynamics via Projective Transformations: A Geometric Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a geometric formulation for transforming nonconservative mechanical Hamiltonian systems and introduces a new method for regularizing and linearizing central force dynamics -- in particular, Kepler and Manev dynamics -- through a projective transformation. The transformation is formulated as a configuration space diffeomorphism (rather than a submersion) that is lifted to a cotangent bundle (phase space) symplectomorphism and used to pullback the original mechanical Hamiltonian system, Riemannian kinetic energy metric, and other key geometric objects. Full linearization of both Kepler and Manev dynamics (in any finite dimension) is achieved by a subsequent conformal scaling of the projectively-transformed Hamiltonian vector field. Two such conformal scalings are given, both achieving linearization. Arbitrary conservative and nonconservative perturbations are included, with closed-form solutions readily obtained in the unperturbed Kepler or Manev cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to generalize the isomonodromic-isospectral correspondence for meromorphic connections of rank $2$ over $\mathbb{P}^1$ to the twisted case. More specifically, the construction of the isospectral approach is provided for the Painlev\'{e} I hierarchy, then two maps are constructed, one linking the sets of isomonodromic and isospectral Hamiltonians, another linking the set of apparent singularities to a set of isospectral coordinates.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures on the transversal hull of cone semigroups and some applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\LL_{\bf v}\subset \Z^D$ be a suitable cone semigroup and $\A_{\bf v}$ its reduced semigroup $C^*$-algebra. In this paper, we compute the $\LL_{\bf v}$-invariant measures in the transversal hull of the semigroup $\LL_{\bf v}$ that exhibit regularity in the boundaries of $\LL_{\bf v}.$ These measures enable the construction of a trace per-unit hypersurface for observables in $\A_{\bf v}$ supported near the boundaries of $\LL_{\bf v}$, leading to the construction of appropriate Chern cocycles in the "boundary" ideals of $\A_{\bf v}$. Our approach applies to both finitely and non-finitely generated cone semigroups. Applications for the bulk-defect correspondence of lattice models of topological insulators are also provided.</description>

      <title>Group structure as a foundation for entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy can signify different things: For instance, heat transfer in thermodynamics or a measure of information in data analysis. Many entropies have been introduced and it can be difficult to ascertain their different importance and merits. Here we consider entropy in an abstract sense, as a functional on a probability space and we review how being able to handle the trivial case of non-interacting systems together with the subtle requirement of extensivity allows a systematic classification of the functional form.</description>

      <title>Discontinuity calculus and applications to two-body coupled-channel scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method, termed discontinuity calculus, for computing discontinuities of complex functions. This framework enables a systematic investigation of both analytic continuation and the topological structure of Riemann surfaces. We apply this calculus to analyze the analytic continuation of partial-wave amplitudes in two-body coupled-channel scattering problems and discuss their uniformization of the corresponding Riemann surfaces. This methodology offers new perspectives and tools for analyzing coupled-channel scattering problems in quantum scattering theory.</description>

      <title>On the statistical nature of Betti numbers and Euler characteristic of smooth random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We represent excursion sets of smooth random fields as unions of a topological basis consisting of a sequence of simply and multiply connected compact subsets of the underlying manifold. The associated coefficients, which are non-negative discrete random variables, reflect the randomness of the field. Betti numbers of the excursion sets can be expressed as summations over the coefficients, and the Euler characteristic and the sum of Betti numbers can also be expressed as their (alternating) sum. This enables understanding their statistical properties as sums (or differences) of discrete random variables. We examine the conditions under which each topological statistic can be asymptotically Gaussian as the size of the manifold and the resolution increase. The coefficients of the basis elements are then modeled as Binomial variables, and the statistical natures of Betti numbers, Euler character and sum of Betti numbers follow from this fundamental property. We test the validity of the modeling using numerical calculations, and identify threshold regimes where the topological statistics can be approximated as Gaussian variables. The new representation of excursion sets thus maps the properties of topological statistics to combinatorial structures, thereby providing mathematical clarity on their use for physical inference, particularly in cosmology.</description>

      <title>Balanced multi-species spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify a special class of multi-species spin glass models: ones in which the species proportions serve to ``balance'' out the interaction strengths. For this class, we prove a free energy lower bound that does not require any convexity assumption, and applies to both Ising and spherical models. The lower bound is the free energy of a single-species model whose $p$-spin inverse-temperature parameter is exactly the variance of the $p$-spin component of the multi-species Hamiltonian. We further demonstrate that this lower bound is actually an equality in many cases, including: at high temperatures for all models, at all temperatures for convex models, and at zero temperature for pure bipartite spherical models. When translated to a statement about the injective norm of a nonsymmetric Gaussian tensor, our lower bound matches an upper bound recently established by Dartois and McKenna.</description>

      <title>Landau theory for lattice higher gauge theory and Kramers-Wannier duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a Landau field theory for a lattice higher gauge theory defined on $p$-dimensional open cells (i.e., sites, links, faces, cubes, etc.), and study its continuum-limit and phases. In this approach, the $p$-dimensional Wilson-surface operator of the higher gauge theory is promoted to a fundamental functional field that is charged under the $p$-form global symmetry. By explicitly solving the functional equation of motion, we show that the classical solution exhibits the area~(perimeter) law in the strong (weak) gauge coupling limit. In the deconfined phase, we also construct topological defects for both $\mathrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_N^{}$ higher gauge theories, as analogs of vortex and domain-wall solutions in conventional field theories with $0$-form global symmetries. Besides, we examine low-energy effective theory by identifying the phase modulations of the functional field as low-energy modes, and discuss the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem for higher-form global symmetries. Finally, we discuss infrared duality among Landau field theories, which originates from Kramers-Wannier duality in lattice higher gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the inverse problem of determining a potential coefficient in an abstract wave equation that includes a lower-order term. The equation incorporates a time-fractional derivative in the Caputo sense, as well as a fractional power of an abstract operator defined on a Hilbert space. Using the Fourier decomposition method, we analyze the solvability of the direct problem. Leveraging the properties of the solution to the direct problem, we conduct an examination of the inverse problem. By applying the fixed point theorem within a suitable Banach space, we derive results concerning the local existence, uniqueness, and stability of the solution.</description>

      <title>An optimal fractional Hardy inequality on the discrete half-line</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of Hardy inequalities for the fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta_{\mathbb{N}})^{\sigma}$ on the discrete half-line $\mathbb{N}$, we provide an optimal Hardy-weight $W^{\mathrm{op}}_{\sigma}$ for exponents $\sigma\in\left(0,1\right]$. As a consequence, we provide an estimate of the sharp constant in the fractional Hardy inequality with the classical Hardy-weight $n^{-2\sigma}$ on $\mathbb{N}$. It turns out that for $\sigma =1$ the Hardy-weight $W^{\mathrm{op}}_{1}$ is pointwise larger than the optimal Hardy-weight obtained by Keller--Pinchover--Pogorzelski near infinity. As an application of our main result, we obtain unique continuation results at infinity for the solutions of some fractional Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

Abstract: We prove a splitting theorem for globally hyperbolic, weighted spacetimes with metrics and weights of regularity $C^1$ by combining elliptic techniques for the negative homogeneity $p$-d'Alembert operator from our recent work in the smooth setting with the concept of line-adapted curves introduced here. Our results extend the Lorentzian splitting theorem proved for smooth globally hyperbolic spacetimes by Galloway -- and variants of its weighted counterparts by Case and Woolgar--Wylie -- to this low regularity setting.</description>

      <title>Analytic toolkit for the Anderson model with arbitrary disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred numerous developments in diverse branches of physics. The literature is silent, however, on practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here, supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the localization length.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-enhanced Lieb-Robinson bounds for a class of Bose-Hubbard type Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several recent works have derived Lieb-Robinson bounds (LRBs) for Bose-Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. For certain structured initial states, e.g., vacuum perturbations or near-stationary states, information propagates with velocity $v \leq C$ . However, for general bounded-density initial states, it was shown by the first author, Vu, and Saito that the velocity can grow in time as $v \sim t^{D-1}$, where $D$ is the spatial dimension -- demonstrating the possibility of accelerated information spreading in bosonic systems. In this work, we introduce a new perspective on this phenomenon: we show that translation invariance combined with local $p$-body repulsion ($n^p$ with $p &gt; D+1$) qualitatively alters the propagation behavior, leading to a bound of the form $v \sim t^{\frac{D}{p - D - 1}}$ for general bounded-energy-density initial states. In particular, this establishes for an almost-linear light cone at large $p$, in stark contrast to the previously found accelerated regimes. Our result identifies symmetry-driven constraints as a new mechanism for suppressing propagation speed in bosonic systems and thereby reframes the scope of what types of LRBs can hold. We further provide matching examples showing that, under the given assumptions, this bound is sharp -- no further improvement in the power of $t$ is possible without invoking additional dynamical constraints.</description>

      <title>On Gromov--Witten invariants of $\mathbb{P}^1$-orbifolds and topological difference equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16375v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(m_1, m_2)$ be a pair of positive integers. Denote by $\mathbb{P}^1$ the complex projective line, and by $\mathbb{P}^1_{m_1,m_2}$ the orbifold complex projective line obtained from $\mathbb{P}^1$ by adding $\mathbb{Z}_{m_1}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{m_2}$ orbifold points. In this paper we introduce a matrix linear difference equation, prove existence and uniqueness of its formal Puiseux-series solutions, and use them to give conjectural formulas for $k$-point ($k\ge2$) functions of Gromov--Witten invariants of $\mathbb{P}^1_{m_1,m_2}$. Explicit expressions of the unique solutions are also obtained. We carry out concrete computations of the first few invariants by using the conjectural formulas. For the case when one of $m_1, m_2$ equals 1, we prove validity of the conjectural formulas.</description>

      <title>Spin-weighted spherical harmonics as massless angular momentum eigenstates and their role in obstructing spin-orbital decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12765v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that for massless helicity $h$ particles, the angular momentum eigenstates are given in an appropriate coordinate system by the spin-weighted spherical harmonics ${_{-h}Y_{jm}}$ of spin-weight $-h$. In particular, these are simultaneous eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, helicity, $J^2$, and $J_z$. The appearance of the spin-weighted spherical harmonics as opposed to the ordinary spherical harmonics reflects the nontrivial topological structure of massless particles with nonzero helicity. The resultant angular momentum multiplet structure is quite different than that of massive particles, with at most one multiplet for each angular momentum $j$ and with $|h|$ acting as a lower bound on $j$. This illustrates the obstruction to a spin-orbital decomposition of the angular momentum for massless particles, as such a sparse multiplet structure is not consistent with any reasonable spin-orbital splitting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.03029v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the first connection between $2d$ Liouville quantum gravity and natural dynamics of random matrices. In particular, we show that if $(U_t)$ is a Brownian motion on the unitary group at equilibrium, then the measures $$ |\det(U_t - e^{i \theta})|^{\gamma} dt d\theta $$ converge in the limit of large dimension to the $2d$ LQG measure, a properly normalized exponential of the $2d$ Gaussian free field. Gaussian free field type fluctuations associated with these dynamics were first established by Spohn (1998) and convergence to the LQG measure in $2d$ settings was conjectured since the work of Webb (2014), who proved the convergence of related one dimensional measures by using inputs from Riemann-Hilbert theory.
  The convergence follows from the first multi-time extension of the result by Widom (1973) on Fisher-Hartwig asymptotics of Toeplitz determinants with real symbols. To prove these, we develop a general surgery argument and combine determinantal point processes estimates with stochastic analysis on Lie group, providing in passing a probabilistic proof of Webb's $1d$ result. We believe the techniques will be more broadly applicable to matrix dynamics out of equilibrium, joint moments of determinants for classes of correlated random matrices, and the characteristic polynomial of non-Hermitian random matrices.</description>

      <title>Casimir Energy and Modularity in Higher-dimensional Conformal Field Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14866v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important problem in Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is to understand the structures of observables on spacetime manifolds of nontrivial topology. Such observables arise naturally when studying physical systems at finite temperature and/or finite volume and encode subtle properties of the underlying microscopic theory that are often obscure on the flat spacetime. Locality of the QFT implies that these observables can be constructed from more basic building blocks by cutting-and-gluing along a spatial slice, where a crucial ingredient is the Hilbert space on the spatial manifold. In Conformal Field Theory (CFT), thanks to the operator-state correspondence, we have a non-perturbative understanding of the Hilbert space on a spatial sphere. However it remains a challenge to consider more general spatial manifolds. Here we study CFTs in spacetime dimensions $d&gt;2$ on the spatial manifold $T^2\times \mathbb{R}^{d-3}$ which is one of the simplest manifolds beyond the spherical topology. We focus on the ground state in this Hilbert space and analyze universal properties of the ground state energy, also commonly known as the Casimir energy, which is a nontrivial function of the complex structure moduli $\tau$ of the torus. The Casimir energy is subject to constraints from modular invariance on the torus which we spell out using $PSL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ spectral theory. Moreover we derive a simple universal formula for the Casimir energy in the thin torus limit using the effective field theory (EFT) from Kaluza-Klein reduction of the CFT, with exponentially small corrections from worldline instantons. We illustrate our formula with explicit examples from well-known CFTs including the critical $O(N)$ model in $d=3$ and holographic CFTs in $d\geq 3$.</description>

      <title>Cycling in the forest with Wilson's algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a probability measure on cycle-rooted spanning forests (CRSFs) introduced by Kenyon. CRSFs are spanning subgraphs, each connected component of which has a unique cycle; they generalize spanning trees. A generalization of Wilson's celebrated CyclePopping algorithm for uniform spanning trees has been proposed for CRSFs, and several concise proofs have been given that the algorithm samples from Kenyon's distribution. In this survey, we flesh out all the details of such a proof of correctness, progressively generalizing a proof by Marchal for spanning trees. This detailed proof has several interests. First, it serves as a modern tutorial on Wilson's algorithm, suitable for applied probability and computer science audiences. Compared to uniform spanning trees, the more sophisticated motivating application to CRSFs brings forth connections to recent research topics such as loop measures, partial rejection sampling, and heaps of cycles. Second, the detailed proof \emph{\`a la} Marchal yields the law of the time complexity of the sampling algorithm, shedding light on practical situations where the algorithm is expected to run fast.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we show that the completeness relation for the eigenvectors, which is an essential assumption of quantum mechanics, remains true if the initial Hamiltonian, having a discrete spectrum, is modified by a delta potential (to be made precise by a renormalization scheme) supported at a point in two and three-dimensional compact manifolds or Euclidean spaces. The formulation can be easily extended to $N$ center case, and the case where delta interaction is supported on curves in the plane or space.</description>

      <title>Bridging 4D QFTs and 2D VOAs via 3D high-temperature EFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high-temperature limit of the superconformal index, especially on higher sheets, often captures useful universal information about a theory. In 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories with fractional r-charges, there exists a special notion of high-temperature limit on higher sheets that captures data of three-dimensional topological quantum field theories arising from r-twisted circle reduction. These TQFTs are closely tied with the VOA of the 4d SCFT. We study such high-temperature limits. More specifically, we apply Di~Pietro-Komargodski type supersymmetric effective field theory techniques to r-twisted circle reductions of $(A_1,A_{2n})$ Argyres-Douglas theories, leveraging their Maruyoshi-Song Lagrangian with manifest $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry. The result on the second sheet is the Gang-Kim-Stubbs family of 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SUSY enhancing rank-$0$ theories with monopole superpotentials, whose boundary supports the Virasoro minimal model VOAs $M(2,2n+3)$. Upon topological twist, they give non-unitary TQFTs controlled by the $M(2,2n+3)$ modular tensor category (MTC). The high-temperature limit on other sheets yields their unitary or non-unitary Galois conjugates. This opens up the prospect of a broader four-supercharge perspective on the celebrated correspondence between 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs and 2d VOAs via interpolating 3d EFTs. Several byproducts follow, including a systematic approach to 3d SUSY enhancement from 4d SUSY enhancement, and a 3d QFT handle on Galois orbits of various MTCs associated with 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs.</description>

      <title>Spectral Bounds on Entropy and Ergotropy via Statistical Effective Temperature in Classical Polarization and Quantum Thermal States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a unified definition of the statistical effective temperature (SET) for finite-dimensional classical and quantum systems using dimension-dependent indices of purity derived from the eigenvalue spectrum. This spectral approach bypasses the need for Hamiltonians or energy gaps and remains applicable to both quantum density matrices and classical polarization coherency matrices. The SET framework naturally describes the divergence of inverse temperature near pure, non-degenerate states, consistent with the third law. Using entropy-SET diagrams, we explore spectral bounds in two-, three-, and four-level systems, which reveal physically realizable entropy regions, rank-dependent constraints, and cusp-like features. A Hamiltonian-free parametric spectrum ansatz provides a universal reference curve within these bounds. Furthermore, we derive spectral bounds on ergotropy as a function of entropy and SET, which quantify the maximum extractable work under passive constraints and introduce the notion of structured-states, engineered spectral configurations that saturate these bounds. Our analysis shows that SET serves as a thermodynamically meaningful and operationally relevant quantity for bounding entropy and ergotropy in both classical polarization systems and quantum thermal states.</description>

      <title>Axiomatization of R\'enyi Entropy on Quantum Phase Space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15976v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase-space versions of quantum mechanics -- from Wigner's original distribution to modern discrete-qudit constructions -- represent some states with negative quasi-probabilities. Conventional Shannon and R\'enyi entropies become complex-valued in this setting and lose their operational meaning. Building on the axiomatic treatments of R\'enyi (1961) and Dar\'oczy (1963), we develop a conservative extension that applies to signed finite phase spaces and identify a single admissible entropy family, which we call signed R\'enyi $\alpha$-entropy (for a free parameter $\alpha &gt; 0$). The obvious signed Shannon candidate is ruled out because it violates extensivity. We prove four results that bolster the usefulness of the new measure. (i) It serves as a witness of negative probability. (ii) For $\alpha &gt; 1$, it is Schur-concave, delivering the intuitive property that mixing increases entropy. (iii) The same parametric family obeys a quantum H-theorem, namely, that under de-phasing dynamics entropy cannot decrease. (iv) The $2$-entropy is conserved under discrete Moyal-bracket dynamics, mirroring conservation of von Neumann entropy under unitary evolution on Hilbert space. We also comment on interpreting the R\'enyi order parameter as an inverse temperature. Overall, we believe that our investigation provides good evidence that our axiomatically derived signed R\'enyi entropy may be a useful addition to existing entropy measures employed in quantum information, foundations, and thermodynamics.</description>

Abstract: We elucidate the different mechanisms of wave localisation in disordered finite systems of subwavelength resonators, where the disorder is in the spatial arrangement of the resonators. To do so, we employ the capacitance matrix formalism and develop a variety of tools to understand localisation in this setting. Namely, we adapt the Thouless criterion of localisation to quantify the various mechanisms of localisation. We also employ a propagation matrix approach to prove a Saxon-Hutner type theorem ensuring the existence of band gaps for disordered systems and to predict the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. We further investigate the stabilities of bandgaps and localised eigenmodes with respect to fluctuations in the system by introducing a method of defect mode prediction based on the discrete Green function and illuminating the phenomena of Anderson localisation and level repulsion under global disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing accessible information for an ensemble of quantum states is a basic problem in quantum information theory. The optimality criterion recently obtained in [7], when applied to specific ensembles of states, leads to nontrivial tight lower bounds for the Shannon entropy that are discrete relatives of the famous log-Sobolev inequality. In this light, the hypothesis of globally information-optimal measurement for an ensemble of equiangular equiprobable states (quantum pyramids) put forward and numerically substantiated in [2] is reconsidered and the corresponding tight entropy inequalities are proposed and proved. Via the optimality criterion, this provides also the first proof of the conjecture concerning globally information-optimal observables for quantum pyramids put forward in [2].</description>

      <title>SDEs with critical general distributional drifts: sharp solvability and blow ups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish weak well-posedness for SDEs having discontinuous diffusion coefficients and general distributional drifts that may introduce blow up effects. Our drifts satisfy minimal assumptions, i.e.\,we assume only that the Cauchy problem for the Kolmogorov backward equation is well-posed in the standard Hilbert triple $W^{1,2} \hookrightarrow L^2 \hookrightarrow W^{-1,2}$. By a result of Mazya and Verbitsky, these assumptions are precisely those drifts that can be represented as the sum of a form-bounded component (encompassing, for example, Morrey or Chang-Wilson-Wolff drifts) and a divergence-free distributional component in the ${\rm BMO}^{-1}$ space of Koch and Tataru.
  We apply our results to finite particle systems with strong attracting interactions immersed in a turbulent flow. This includes particle systems of Keller-Segel type. Crucially, in dimensions $d \geq 3$, we cover almost the entire admissible range of attraction strengths, reaching nearly to the blow-up threshold.
  As a further application of our results for SDEs and of the theory of Bessel processes, we obtain an improved upper bound on the constant in the many-particle Hardy inequality. Consequently, the lower bound previously derived by Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Hoffmann-Ostenhof, Laptev, and Tidblom is shown to be close to optimal.</description>

Abstract: We develop an existence and regularity theory for solutions to a geometric free boundary problem motivated by models of tumor growth. In this setting, the tumor invades an accessible region $D$, its motion is directed along a constant vector $V$, and it cannot penetrate another region $K$ acting as an obstacle to the spread of the tumor. Due to the non variational structure of the problem, we show existence of viscosity solutions via Perron's method. Subsequently, we prove interior regularity for the free boundary near regular points by means of an improvement of flatness argument. We further analyze the boundary regularity and we prove that the free boundary meets the obstacle as a $C^{1,\alpha}$ graph. A key step in the analysis of the boundary regularity involves the study of a thin obstacle problem with oblique boundary conditions, for which we establish $C^{1,\alpha}$ estimates.</description>
