      <title>Small Decision Trees for MDPs with Deductive Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markov decision processes (MDPs) describe sequential decision-making processes; MDP policies return for every state in that process an advised action. Classical algorithms can efficiently compute policies that are optimal with respect to, e.g., reachability probabilities. However, these policies are then given in a tabular format. A longstanding challenge is to represent optimal or almost-optimal policies concisely, e.g., as decision trees. This paper makes two contributions towards this challenge: first, an SMT-based approach to encode a given (optimal) policy as a small decision tree, and second, an abstraction-refinement loop that searches for policies that are optimal within the set of policies that can be represented with a small tree. Technically, the latter combines the SMT encoding with verification approaches for families of Markov chains. The empirical evaluation demonstrates the feasibility of these approaches and shows how they can outperform the state-of-the-art on various benchmarks, yielding up to 20 times smaller trees representing (almost) optimal policies for models with up to 10k states and 19 variables.</description>

      <title>A Formally Verified IEEE 754 Floating-Point Implementation of Interval Iteration for MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning about quantitative properties of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) inevitably requires computations on real or rational numbers. On modern hardware, these are usually efficiently implemented by floating-point numbers. However, due to their finite precision, many floating-point operations lead to small imprecisions. Probabilistic model checkers claim trustworthiness on the ground of a solid theoretical basis, yet prior work has uncovered discrepancies between the claimed and actual accuracy of these systems. How can we trust implementations of model checkers? Our answer is an efficiently executable, formally verified implementation of interval iteration for MDPs. Our correctness proofs span the entire development from the high-level abstract semantics of MDPs to the low-level implementation in LLVM that uses floating-point arithmetic. We use the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant to verify the abstract definition of interval iteration. Next, we employ step-wise refinement to derive an efficient implementation in LLVM code. To that end, we extend the Isabelle Refinement Framework with support for reasoning about floating point arithmetic and directed rounding modes. We experimentally evaluate our implementation on a set of benchmark MDPs. Our results show that the verified implementation is competitive with state-of-the-art tools for MDPs, while providing formal guarantees on the correctness of the results.</description>

      <title>Visualizing Game-Based Certificates for Hyperproperty Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperproperties relate multiple executions of a system and are commonly used to specify security and information-flow policies. While many verification approaches for hyperproperties exist, providing a convincing certificate that the system satisfies a given property is still a major challenge. In this paper, we propose strategies as a suitable form of certificate for hyperproperties specified in a fragment of the temporal logic HyperLTL. Concretely, we interpret the verification of a HyperLTL property as a game between universal and existential quantification, allowing us to leverage strategies for the existential quantifiers as certificates. We present HyGaViz, a browser-based visualization tool that lets users interactively explore an (automatically synthesized) witness strategy by taking control over universally quantified executions.</description>

      <title>FC-Datalog as a Framework for Efficient String Querying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core spanners are a class of document spanners that capture the core functionality of IBM's AQL. FC is a logic on strings built around word equations that when extended with constraints for regular languages can be seen as a logic for core spanners. The recently introduced FC-Datalog extends FC with recursion, which allows us to define recursive relations for core spanners. Additionally, as FC-Datalog captures P, it is also a tractable version of Datalog on strings. This presents an opportunity for optimization.
  We propose a series of FC-Datalog fragments with desirable properties in terms of complexity of model checking, expressive power, and efficiency of checking membership in the fragment. This leads to a range of fragments that all capture LOGSPACE, which we further restrict to obtain linear combined complexity. This gives us a framework to tailor fragments for particular applications. To showcase this, we simulate deterministic regex in a tailored fragment of FC-Datalog.</description>

      <title>Temporal Causal Reasoning with (Non-Recursive) Structural Equation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structural Equation Models (SEM) are the standard approach to representing causal dependencies between variables in causal models. In this paper we propose a new interpretation of SEMs when reasoning about Actual Causality, in which SEMs are viewed as mechanisms transforming the dynamics of exogenous variables into the dynamics of endogenous variables. This allows us to combine counterfactual causal reasoning with existing temporal logic formalisms, and to introduce a temporal logic, CPLTL, for causal reasoning about such structures. We show that the standard restriction to so-called \textit{recursive} models (with no cycles in the dependency graph) is not necessary in our approach, allowing us to reason about mutually dependent processes and feedback loops. Finally, we introduce new notions of model equivalence for temporal causal models, and show that CPLTL has an efficient model-checking procedure.</description>

      <title>The structure of polynomial growth for tree automata/transducers and MSO set queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ambiguity of a tree automaton is the number of distinct accepting runs over a given input. We show that, in polynomial time, one can decide whether the ambiguity grows polynomially or exponentially in the input size, and, in the former case, one can compute the exact polynomial degree. Equivalently, this amounts to studying the growth of the number of results of set queries in Monadic Second-Order logic (MSO) over ranked trees; we also prove a reparameterization theorem for such queries in the case of polynomial growth.
  This property of MSO set queries leads directly to a generalization of Boja\'nczyk's dimension minimization theorem for string-to-string polyregular functions. Our generalization applies to MSO set interpretations from trees, which subsume (as we show) tree-walking transducers and invisible pebble tree-to-string transducers. Finally, with a bit more work we obtain the following:
  * a new, short and conceptual proof that macro tree transducers of linear growth compute only tree-to-tree MSO transductions (a seminal theorem of Engelfriet and Maneth);
  * a procedure to decide polynomial size-to-height increase for macro tree transducers and compute the polynomial degree, which extends the recent decidability result of Gallot, Maneth, Nakano and Peyrat concerning linear size-to-height increase.</description>

      <title>The Parameterized Complexity of Learning Monadic Second-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the model-theoretic framework for supervised learning introduced by Grohe and Tur\'an (TOCS 2004), we study the parameterized complexity of learning concepts definable in monadic second-order logic (MSO). We show that the problem of learning an MSO-definable concept from a training sequence of labeled examples is fixed-parameter tractable on graphs of bounded clique-width, and that it is hard for the parameterized complexity class para-NP on general graphs.
  It turns out that an important distinction to be made is between 1-dimensional and higher-dimensional concepts, where the instances of a k-dimensional concept are k-tuples of vertices of a graph. For the higher-dimensional case, we give a learning algorithm that is fixed-parameter tractable in the size of the graph, but not in the size of the training sequence, and we give a hardness result showing that this is optimal. By comparison, in the 1-dimensional case, we obtain an algorithm that is fixed-parameter tractable in both.</description>

      <title>Certifying rings of integers in number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Number fields and their rings of integers, which generalize the rational numbers and the integers, are foundational objects in number theory. There are several computer algebra systems and databases concerned with the computational aspects of these. In particular, computing the ring of integers of a given number field is one of the main tasks of computational algebraic number theory. In this paper, we describe a formalization in Lean 4 for certifying such computations. In order to accomplish this, we developed several data types amenable to computation. Moreover, many other underlying mathematical concepts and results had to be formalized, most of which are also of independent interest. These include resultants and discriminants, as well as methods for proving irreducibility of univariate polynomials over finite fields and over the rational numbers. To illustrate the feasibility of our strategy, we formally verified entries from the $\textit{Number fields}$ section of the $\textit{L-functions and modular forms database}$ (LMFDB). These concern, for several number fields, the explicitly given $\textit{integral basis}$ of the ring of integers and the $\textit{discriminant}$. To accomplish this, we wrote SageMath code that computes the corresponding certificates and outputs a Lean proof of the statement to be verified.</description>

      <title>Verified and Optimized Implementation of Orthologic Proof Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the development of an optimized and verified decision procedure for orthologic equalities and inequalities. This decision procedure is quadratic-time and is used as a sound, efficient and predictable approximation to classical propositional logic in automated reasoning tools. We start by formalizing, in the Coq proof assistant, a proof system in sequent-calculus style for orthologic. We then prove its soundness and completeness with respect to the algebraic variety of ortholattices, and we formalize a cut-elimination theorem (in doing so, we discover and fix a missing case in a previously published proof).
  We then implement and verify a complete proof search procedure for orthologic. A naive implementation is exponential, and to obtain an optimal quadratic runtime, we optimize the implementation by memoizing its results and simulating reference equality testing. We leverage the resulting correctness theorem to implement a reflective Coq tactic. We present benchmarks showing the procedure, under various optimizations, matches its theoretical complexity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11967v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clans are representations of generalized algebraic theories that contain more information than the finite-limit categories associated to the locally finitely presentable categories of models via Gabriel-Ulmer duality. Extending Gabriel-Ulmer duality to account for this additional information, we present a duality theory between clans and locally finitely presentable categories equipped with a weak factorization system of a certain kind.</description>

      <title>Slightly Non-Linear Higher-Order Tree Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tree-to-tree functions computed by "affine $\lambda$-transducers": tree automata whose memory consists of an affine $\lambda$-term instead of a finite state. They can be seen as variations on Gallot, Lemay and Salvati's Linear High-Order Deterministic Tree Transducers.
  When the memory is almost purely affine ($\textit{\`a la}$ Kanazawa), we show that these machines can be translated to tree-walking transducers (and with a purely affine memory, we get a reversible tree-walking transducer). This leads to a proof of an inexpressivity conjecture of Nguy\^en and Pradic on "implicit automata" in an affine $\lambda$-calculus. We also prove that a more powerful variant, extended with preprocessing by an MSO relabeling and allowing a limited amount of non-linearity, is equivalent in expressive power to Engelfriet, Hoogeboom and Samwel's invisible pebble tree transducers.
  The key technical tool in our proofs is the Interaction Abstract Machine (IAM), an operational avatar of Girard's geometry of interaction, a semantics of linear logic. We work with ad-hoc specializations to $\lambda$-terms of low exponential depth of a tree-generating version of the IAM.</description>
