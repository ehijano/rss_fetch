      <title>Carbon and Iron Deficiencies in Quiescent Galaxies at z=1-3 from JWST-SUSPENSE: Implications for the Formation Histories of Massive Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the stellar metallicities and multi-element abundances (C, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Fe) of 15 massive (log M/M$_\odot$=10.2-11.2) quiescent galaxies at z=1-3, derived from ultradeep JWST-SUSPENSE spectra. Compared to quiescent galaxies at z~0, these galaxies exhibit a deficiency of 0.25 dex in [C/H], 0.16 dex in [Fe/H], and 0.07 dex in [Mg/H], implying rapid formation and quenching before significant enrichment from asymptotic giant branch stars and Type Ia supernovae. Additionally, we find that galaxies that form at higher redshift have higher [Mg/Fe] and lower [Fe/H] and [Mg/H], irrespective of their observed redshift. The evolution in [Fe/H] and [C/H] is therefore primarily explained by lower redshift samples naturally including galaxies with longer star-formation timescales. On the other hand, the lower [Mg/H] can be explained by galaxies forming at earlier epochs expelling larger gas reservoirs during their quenching phase. Consequently, the mass-metallicity relation, primarily reflecting [Mg/H], is also lower at z=1-3 compared to the lower redshift relation, though the slopes are similar. Finally, we compare our results to standard stellar population modeling approaches employing solar abundance patterns and non-parametric star-formation histories (using Prospector). Our SSP-equivalent ages agree with the mass-weighted ages from Prospector, while the metallicities disagree significantly. Nonetheless, the metallicities better reflect [Fe/H] than total [Z/H]. We also find that star-formation timescales inferred from elemental abundances are significantly shorter than those from Prospector, and we discuss the resulting implications for the early formation of massive galaxies.</description>

      <title>JADES: The star-formation and chemical enrichment history of a luminous galaxy at z~9.43 probed by ultra-deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse ultra-deep JWST observations of the galaxy JADES-GS-z9-0 at z = 9.4327, and derive detailed stellar and interstellar medium (ISM) properties of this luminous (MUV=-20.43) high-redshift system. Complementary information from NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec (both low- and medium-resolution) spectroscopy reveal a compact system (Re ~110 pc) characterised by a steeply rising star formation history, which is reflected in the inferred young stellar age (t ~ 3 Myr, light-weighted), high star-formation rate surface density ({\Sigma}SFR ~ 72 M yr-1 kpc-2), high ionisation parameter (log(U) ~ -1.5), low metallicity (12+log(O/H) ~ 7.5), and low carbon-over-oxygen abundance ([C/O] = -0.64). Leveraging the detection of N iii]1750 we derive nitrogen-over-oxygen abundance ([N/O] ~ 0) higher than the plateau followed by low-redshift galaxies of similar metallicity, possibly revealing the imprint from (very) massive stars on the ISM enrichment and favouring a top-heavy Initial Mass Function (IMF) scenario. Massive stars powering a hard radiation field are also required to explain the rest-frame UV line ratios, though the presence of the high-excitation [Ne v]{\lambda}3426 emission line possibly hints at additional ionization from an AGN. We also report the tentative detection of Ly{\alpha} emission in the G140M spectrum, shifted by ~450 km/s redward of the systemic redshift. Combined with a modelling of the Ly{\alpha} spectral break, we rule out the presence of very high column densities of neutral gas pertaining to local absorbers, as well as any extended surrounding ionised bubble, suggesting that JADES-GS-z9-0 has not yet significantly contributed to cosmic Reionization.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Chemical Study of the Extreme Velocity Stars in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two decades on, the study of hypervelocity stars is still in its infancy. These stars can provide novel constraints on the total mass of the Galaxy and its Dark Matter distribution. However how these stars are accelerated to such high velocities is unclear. Various proposed production mechanisms for these stars can be distinguished using chemo-dynamic tagging. The advent of Gaia and other large surveys have provided hundreds of candidate hyper velocity objects to target for ground based high resolution follow-up observations. We conduct high resolution spectroscopic follow-up observations of 16 candidate late-type hyper velocity stars using the Apache Point Observatory and the McDonald Observatory. We derive atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances for these stars. We measure up to 22 elements, including the following nucleosynthetic families: {\alpha} (Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), light/Odd-Z (Na, Al, V, Cu, Sc), Fe-peak (Fe, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Zn), and Neutron Capture (Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu). Our kinematic analysis shows one candidate is unbound, two are marginally bound, and the remainder are bound to the Galaxy. Finally, for the three unbound or marginally bound stars, we perform orbit integration to locate possible globular cluster or dwarf galaxy progenitors. We do not find any likely candidate systems for these stars and conclude that the unbound stars are likely from the the stellar halo, in agreement with the chemical results. The remaining bound stars are all chemically consistent with the stellar halo as well.</description>

      <title>Spatially Coherent 3D Distributions of HI and CO in the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial distribution of the gaseous components of the Milky Way is of great importance for a number of different fields, e.g. Galactic structure, star formation and cosmic rays. However, obtaining distance information to gaseous clouds in the interstellar medium from Doppler-shifted line emission is notoriously difficult given our unique vantage point in the Galaxy. It requires precise knowledge of gas velocities and generally suffers from distance ambiguities.
  Previous works often assumed the optically thin limit (no absorption), a fixed velocity field, and lack resolution overall. We aim to overcome these issues and improve previous reconstructions of the gaseous constituents of the interstellar medium of the Galaxy.
  We use 3D Gaussian processes to model correlations in the interstellar medium, including correlations between different lines of sight, and enforce a spatially coherent structure in the prior. For modelling the transport of radiation from the emitting gas to us as observers, we take absorption effects into account. A special numerical grid ensures high resolution nearby. We infer the spatial distributions of HI, CO, their emission line-widths, and the Galactic velocity field in a joint Bayesian inference. We further constrain these fields with complementary data from Galactic masers and young stellar object clusters.
  Our main result consists of a set of samples that implicitly contain statistical uncertainties. The resulting maps are spatially coherent and reproduce the data with high fidelity. We confirm previous findings regarding the warping and flaring of the Galactic disc. A comparison with 3D dust maps reveals a good agreement on scales larger than approximately 400 pc. While our results are not free of artefacts, they present a big step forward in obtaining high quality 3D maps of the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>How does a low surface brightness galaxy form spiral arms?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of spiral arms in low surface brightness galaxies (LSBs) are not well-understood. We study the dynamics of spiral arms in two prototypical LSBs, F568-VI and F568-01, using both analytical models and N-body + hydrodynamical simulations. We first consider the disk as a 2-component system of gravitationally-coupled stars and gas in the force field of a \emph{spherical} dark matter halo, subjected to local, non-axisymmetric perturbations. However, no local spirals are formed. We next assume the disk to be a 1-component system of stars in the net gravitational potential of a galaxy with a \emph{spherical} dark matter halo perturbed by a global $m=2$ instability. In this case, the growth time for spiral formation was low, equal to 0.78 and 0.96 Gyrs, respectively, corresponding to a few dynamical times of the galaxies. Finally, we simulate the LSBs using the N-body + hydrodynamical simulation code RAMSES. \emph{Our results show that a quadrupolar field associated with an oblate halo with an axial ratio of 0.7} is necessary to drive a long-lived global spiral in the LSB disks. Further, feedback corresponding to a supernova mass fraction of $\sim$ 0.05 is essential to comply with the observed stellar surface density. The simulated spirals survives for about ten dynamical times and the average pattern speed lies between 10 - 15 $\rm{kms^{-1}{kpc}^{-1}}$. The spiral arm thus formed is therefore a transient global pattern driven by the tidal field of the oblate dark matter halo.</description>

      <title>NOEMA formIng Cluster survEy (NICE): Characterizing eight massive galaxy groups at $1.5 &lt; z &lt; 4$ in the COSMOS field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NOEMA formIng Cluster survEy (NICE) is a large program targeting 69 massive galaxy group candidates at $z&gt;2$ in six deep fields. We report spectroscopic confirmation of eight groups at $1.65\leq z\leq3.61$ in COSMOS. Homogeneously selected as significant overdensities of red IRAC sources with red Herschel colors, four groups are confirmed by CO and [CI] with NOEMA 3mm observations, three are confirmed with ALMA, and one is confirmed by H$\alpha$ from Subaru/FMOS. We constructed the integrated FIR SEDs for the eight groups, obtaining total IR SFR $=260-1300~{\rm M_\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. We adopted six methods to estimate the dark matter masses, including stellar mass to halo mass relations, overdensity with galaxy bias, and NFW profile fitting to radial stellar mass density. We found the radial stellar mass density are consistent with a NFW profile, supporting that they are collapsed structures hosted by a single dark matter halo. The best halo mass estimates are $\log(M_{\rm h}/{\rm M_\odot})=12.8-13.7$ with uncertainty of 0.3 dex. From halo mass estimates, we derive baryonic accretion rate ${\rm BAR}=(1-8)\times10^{3}\,{\rm M_{\odot}/yr}$ for this sample. We find a quasi-linear correlation between the integrated SFR/BAR and the theoretical halo mass limit for cold streams, $M_{\rm stream}/M_{\rm h}$, with ${\rm SFR/BAR}=10^{-0.46\pm0.22}\left({M_{\rm stream}/M_{\rm h}}\right)^{0.71\pm0.16}$ with a scatter of $0.40\,{\rm dex}$. Further, we compare halo masses and stellar masses with simulations, and find all structures are consistent with being progenitors of $M_{\rm h}(z=0)&gt;10^{14}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ galaxy clusters, and the most massive central galaxies have stellar masses consistent with brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) progenitors in the TNG300 simulation. The results strongly suggest these structures are forming massive galaxy clusters via baryonic and dark matter accretion.</description>

      <title>Neutral Atomic Hydrogen Surveys: past, present and future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) observations are fundamental to understand the dynamics of galaxies, their assembly, the fuelling of their star formation and environmental interactions. HI studies have so far been limited by the capabilities of single-dish radio telescopes or synthesis arrays to either small samples or low resolution and sensitivities. Now, the Square Kilometer Array precursors and pathfinders are providing a novel view of the HI in and around galaxies allowing wide-field high resolution deep surveys in nearby galaxies. We give an overview of past, current and future HI surveys consistently comparing their HI column density and spatial resolutions highlighting their main scientific key goals and results.</description>

      <title>The large-scale structure around the Fornax-Eridanus Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our objectives are to map the filamentary network around the Fornax-Eridanus Complex and probe the influence of the local environment on galaxy morphology. We employ the novel machine-learning tool, 1-DREAM (1-Dimensional, Recovery, Extraction, and Analysis of Manifolds) to detect and model filaments around the Fornax cluster. We then use the morphology-density relation of galaxies to examine the variation in the galaxies' morphology with respect to their distance from the central axis of the detected filaments. We detect 27 filaments that vary in length and galaxy-number density around the Fornax-Eridanus Complex. These filaments showcase a variety of environments; some filaments encompass groups/clusters, while others are only inhabited by galaxies in pristine filamentary environments. We also reveal a well-known structure -- the Fornax Wall, that passes through the Dorado group, Fornax cluster, and Eridanus supergroup. Regarding the morphology of galaxies, we find that early-type galaxies (ETGs) populate high-density filaments and high-density regions of the Fornax Wall. Furthermore, the fraction of ETGs decreases as the distance to the filament spine increases. Of the total galaxy population in filaments, ~7% are ETGs and ~24% are late-type galaxies (LTGs) located in pristine environments of filaments, while ~27% are ETGs and ~42% are LTGs in groups/clusters within filaments. This study reveals the Cosmic Web around the Fornax Cluster and asserts that filamentary environments are heterogeneous in nature. When investigating the role of the environment on galaxy morphology, it is essential to consider both, the local number-density and a galaxy's proximity to the filament spine. Within this framework, we ascribe the observed morphological segregation in the Fornax Wall to pre-processing of galaxies within groups embedded in it.</description>

      <title>Weak-Lensing Characterization of the Dark Matter in 29 Merging Clusters that Exhibit Radio Relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multiwavelength analysis of 29 merging galaxy clusters that exhibit radio relics. For each merging system, we perform a weak-lensing analysis on Subaru optical imaging. We generate high-resolution mass maps of the dark matter distributions, which are critical for discerning the merging constituents. Combining the weak-lensing detections with X-ray emission, radio emission, and galaxy redshifts, we discuss the formation of radio relics from the past collision. For each subcluster, we obtain mass estimates by fitting a multi-component NFW model with and without a concentration-mass relation. Comparing the two mass estimate techniques, we find that the concentration-mass relation underestimates (overestimates) the mass relative to fitting both parameters for high- (low-) mass subclusters. We compare the mass estimates of each subcluster to their velocity dispersion measurements and find that they preferentially lie below the expected velocity dispersion scaling relation, especially at the low-mass end (~$10^{14}\ M_\odot$). We show that the majority of the clusters that exhibit radio relics are in major mergers with a mass ratio below 1:4. We investigate the position of the mass peak relative to the galaxy luminosity peak, number density peak, and BCG locations and find that the BCG tends to better trace the mass peak position. Finally, we update a golden sample of 8 galaxy clusters that have the simplest geometries and can provide the cleanest picture of the past merger, which we recommend for further investigation to constrain the nature of dark matter and the acceleration process that leads to radio relics.</description>

      <title>Elevated UV luminosity density at Cosmic Dawn explained by non-evolving, weakly-mass dependent star formation efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have uncovered unexpectedly high cosmic star formation activity in the early Universe, mere hundreds of millions of years after the Big Bang. These observations are often understood to reflect an evolutionary shift in star formation efficiency (SFE) caused by changing galactic conditions during these early epochs. We present FIREbox-HR, a high-resolution, cosmological hydrodynamical simulation from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project, which offers insights into the SFE of galaxies during the first billion years of cosmic time. FIREbox-HR re-simulates the cosmic volume (L = 22.1 cMpc) of the original FIREbox run with eight times higher mass resolution (m_b ~ 7800 M_sun), but with identical physics, down to z ~ 6. FIREbox-HR predicts ultraviolet (UV) luminosity functions in good agreement with available observational data. The simulation also successfully reproduces the observed cosmic UV luminosity density at z ~ 6 - 14, demonstrating that relatively high star formation activity in the early Universe is a natural outcome of the baryonic processes encoded in the FIRE-2 model. According to FIREbox-HR, the SFE - halo mass relation for intermediate mass halos (M_halo ~ 10^9 - 10^11 M_sun) does not significantly evolve with redshift and is only weakly mass-dependent. These properties of the SFE - halo mass relation lead to a larger contribution from lower mass halos at higher z, driving the gradual evolution of the observed cosmic UV luminosity density. A theoretical model based on the SFE - halo mass relation inferred from FIREbox-HR allows us to explore implications for galaxy evolution. Future observations of UV faint galaxies at z &gt; 12 will provide an opportunity to further test these predictions and deepen our understanding of star formation during Cosmic Dawn.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at low metallicity -- IV. Spectral analysis methods and exemplary results for O stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CONTEXT: The spectral analysis of hot, massive stars is a fundamental astrophysical method to obtain their intrinsic properties and their feedback. Quantitative spectroscopy for hot, massive stars requires detailed numerical modeling of the atmosphere and an iterative treatment to obtain the best solution within a given framework. AIMS: We present an overview of different techniques for the quantitative spectroscopy of hot stars employed within the X-Shooting ULLYSES collaboration, from grid-based approaches to tailored fits. By performing a blind test, we gain an overview about the similarities and differences of the resulting parameters. Our study aims to provide an overview of the parameter spread caused by different approaches. METHODS: For three different stars from the sample (SMC O5 star AzV 377, LMC O7 star Sk -69 50, and LMC O9 star Sk -66 171), we employ different atmosphere codes (CMFGEN, Fastwind, PoWR) and strategies to determine their best-fitting model. For our analyses, UV and optical spectra are used to derive the properties with some methods relying purely on optical data for comparison. To determine the overall spectral energy distribution, we further employ additional photometry from the literature. RESULTS: Effective temperatures for each of three sample stars agree within 3 kK while the differences in log g can be up to 0.2 dex. Luminosity differences of up to 0.1 dex result from different reddening assumptions, which seem to be larger for the methods employing a genetic algorithm. All sample stars are nitrogen-enriched. CONCLUSIONS: We find a reasonable agreement between the different methods. Tailored fitting tends to be able to minimize discrepancies obtained with more course or automatized treatments. UV spectral data is essential for the determination of realistic wind parameters. For one target (Sk -69 50), we find clear indications of an evolved status.</description>

      <title>JWST NIRSpec spectroscopy of the triply-lensed $z = 10.17$ galaxy MACS0647$-$JD</title>

Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec prism spectroscopy of MACS0647-JD, the triply-lensed $z \sim 11$ candidate discovered in HST imaging and spatially resolved by JWST imaging into two components A and B. Spectroscopy of component A yields a spectroscopic redshift $z=10.17$ based on 7 detected emission lines: CIII] $\lambda\lambda$1907,1909, [OII] $\lambda$3727, [NeIII] $\lambda$3869, [NeIII] $\lambda$3968, H$\delta$ $\lambda$4101, H$\gamma$ $\lambda$4340, and [OIII] $\lambda$4363. These are the second-most distant detections of these emission lines to date, in a galaxy observed just 460 million years after the Big Bang. Based on observed and extrapolated line flux ratios we derive a gas-phase metallicity $Z =$ log(O/H) = $7.5 - 8.0$, or $(0.06 - 0.2)$ $Z_\odot$, ionization parameter log($U$) $\sim -1.9\pm0.2$, and an ionizing photon production efficiency ${\rm log}(\xi_{\rm ion})=25.2\pm0.2\,$erg$^{-1}$ Hz. The spectrum has a softened Lyman-$\alpha$ break, evidence for a strong Ly$\alpha$ damping wing, suggesting that MACS0647-JD was unable to ionize its surroundings beyond its immediate vicinity ($R_{\text{HII}} \ll 1$ pMpc). The Ly$\alpha$ damping wing also suppresses the F150W photometry, explaining the slightly overestimated photometric redshift $z = 10.6 \pm 0.3$. MACS0647-JD has a stellar mass log($M/M_\odot$) = $8.1 \pm 0.3$, including $\sim$ 6$\times 10^7 M_\odot$ in component A, most of which formed recently (within $\sim$ 20 Myr) with a star formation rate $2\pm1 M_\odot$ / yr, all within an effective radius $70\pm24\,$pc. The smaller component B ($r \sim 20$) pc is likely older ($\sim$100 Myr) with more dust ($A_V \sim 0.1$ mag), as found previously. Spectroscopy of a fainter companion galaxy C separated by a distance of \about\ 3$\,$kpc reveals a Lyman break consistent with $z = 10.17$. MACS0647-JD is likely the most distant galaxy merger known.</description>

      <title>Eccentricity dynamics of wide binaries -- II. The effect of stellar encounters and constraints on formation channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GAIA wide stellar binaries (separations $\sim 10^3-10^{4.5}$ AU) are observed to have a superthermal eccentricity distribution function (DF), well-fit by $P(e) \propto e^\alpha$ with $\alpha \sim 1.2$. In Modak \&amp; Hamilton (2023), we proved that this DF cannot have been produced by Galactic tidal torques starting from any realistic DF that was not already superthermal. Here, we consider the other major dynamical effect on wide binaries: encounters with passing stars. We derive and solve the Fokker-Planck equation governing the evolution of binaries in semimajor axis and eccentricity under many weak, impulsive, penetrative stellar encounters. We show analytically that these encounters drive the eccentricity DF towards thermal on the same timescale as they drive the semimajor axes $a$ towards disruption, $t_\mathrm{ion} \sim 4\,\mathrm{Gyr}\,(a/10^4\,\mathrm{AU})^{-1}$. We conclude that the observed superthermal DF must derive from an even more superthermal (i.e. higher $\alpha$) birth distribution. This requirement places strong constraints on the dominant binary formation channels. A testable prediction of our theory is that $\alpha$ should be a monotonically decreasing function of binary age.</description>

      <title>A two-phase model of galaxy formation: II. The size-mass relation of dynamically hot galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Paper-I we developed a two-phase model to connect dynamically hot galaxies (such as ellipticals and bulges) with the formation of self-gravitating gas clouds (SGCs) associated with the fast assembly of dark matter halos. Here we explore the implications of the model for the size-stellar mass relation of dynamically hot galaxies. Star-forming sub-clouds resulting from the fragmentation of the turbulent SGC inherit its spatial structure and dynamical hotness, producing a `homologous' relation, $r_{\rm f}\approx\, 100 r_{\rm bulge}$, between the size of a dynamically hot galaxy ($r_{\rm bulge}$) and that of its host halo assembled in the fast regime ($r_{\rm f}$), independent of redshift and halo mass. This relation is preserved by the `dry' expansion driven by dynamical heating when a galaxy becomes gas-poor due to inefficient cooling, and is frozen due to the stop of bulge growth during the slow assembly regime of the halo. The size-stellar mass relation is thus a simple combination of the galaxy-halo homology and the non-linear stellar mass-halo mass relation. Using a set of halo assembly histories we reproduce all properties in the observed size-mass relation of dynamically hot galaxies, including the flattening in the low-mass end and the upturn in the massive end. The prediction matches observational data currently available to $z \approx 4$, and can be tested in the future at higher $z$. Our results indicate that the sizes of dynamically hot galaxies are produced by the dissipation and collapse of gas in halos to establish SGCs in which stars form.</description>

      <title>A unified accretion disc model for supermassive black holes in galaxy formation simulations: method and implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well established that supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback is crucial for regulating the evolution of massive, if not all, galaxies. However, modelling the interplay between SMBHs and their host galaxies is challenging due to the vast dynamic range. Previous simulations have utilized simple subgrid models for SMBH accretion, while recent advancements track the properties of the unresolved accretion disc, usually based on the thin $\alpha$-disc model. However, this neglects accretion in the radiatively inefficient regime, expected to occur through a thick disc for a significant portion of an SMBH's lifetime. To address this, we present a novel 'unified' accretion disc model for SMBHs, harnessing results from the analytical advection-dominated inflow-outflow solution (ADIOS) model and state-of-the-art GR(R)MHD simulations. Going from low to high Eddington ratios, our model transitions from an ADIOS flow to a thin $\alpha$-disc via a truncated disc, incorporating self-consistently SMBH spin evolution due to Lense-Thirring precession. Utilizing the moving mesh code AREPO, we perform simulations of single and binary SMBHs within gaseous discs to validate our model and assess its impact. The disc state significantly affects observable luminosities, and we predict markedly different electromagnetic counterparts in SMBH binaries. Crucially, the assumed disc model shapes SMBH spin magnitudes and orientations, parameters that gravitational wave observatories like LISA and IPTA are poised to constrain. Our simulations emphasize the importance of accurately modelling SMBH accretion discs and spin evolution, as they modulate the available accretion power, profoundly shaping the interaction between SMBHs and their host galaxies.</description>

      <title>Overview and public data release of the augmented Auriga Project: cosmological simulations of dwarf and Milky Way-mass galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extended suite of the Auriga cosmological gravo-magnetohydrodynamical "zoom-in" simulations of 40 Milky Way-mass halos and 26 dwarf galaxy-mass halos run with the moving-mesh code Arepo. Auriga adopts the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmogony and includes a comprehensive galaxy formation physics model following the coupled cosmic evolution of dark matter, gas, stars, and supermassive black holes which has been shown to produce numerically well-converged galaxy properties for Milky Way-mass systems. We describe the first public data release of this augmented suite of Auriga simulations, which includes raw snapshots, group catalogues, merger trees, initial conditions, and supplementary data, as well as public analysis tools with worked examples of how to use the data. To demonstrate the value and robustness of the simulation predictions, we analyse a series of low-redshift global properties that compare well with many observed scaling relations, such as the Tully-Fisher relation, the star-forming main sequence, and HI gas fraction/disc thickness. Finally, we show that star-forming gas discs appear to build rotation and velocity dispersion rapidly for $z\gtrsim 3$ before they "settle" into ever-increasing rotation-dispersion ratios ($V/\sigma$). This evolution appears to be in rough agreement with some kinematic measurements from H$\alpha$ observations, and demonstrates an application of how to utilise the released data.</description>

      <title>JWST NIRSpec Spectroscopy of the Remarkable Bright Galaxy GHZ2/GLASS-z12 at Redshift 12.34</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We spectroscopically confirm the $M_{\rm UV} = -20.5$ mag galaxy GHZ2/GLASS-z12 to be at redshift $z=12.34$. The source was selected via NIRCam photometry in GLASS-JWST ERS data, providing the first evidence of a surprising abundance of bright galaxies at $z \gtrsim 10$. The NIRSpec PRISM spectrum shows detections of N IV, C IV, He II, O III, C III, O II, and Ne III lines, and the first detection at high-redshift of the O III Bowen fluorescence line at 3133 {\AA} rest-frame. The prominent C IV line with rest-frame equivalent width (EW) $\approx 46$ {\AA} puts GHZ2 in the category of extreme C IV emitters. GHZ2 displays UV lines with EWs that are only found in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) or composite objects at low/intermediate redshifts. The UV line-intensity ratios are compatible both with AGNs and star formation in a low-metallicity environment, with the low limit on the [Ne IV]/[N IV] ratio favoring a stellar origin of the ionizing photons. We discuss a possible scenario in which the high ionizing output is due to low metallicity stars forming in a dense environment. We estimate a metallicity $\lesssim 0.1 Z/{\rm Z}_{\odot}$, a high ionization parameter logU $&gt; -2$, a N/O abundance 4--5 times the solar value, and a subsolar C/O ratio similar to the recently discovered class of nitrogen-enhanced objects. Considering its abundance patterns and the high stellar mass density ($10^4$~M$_{\odot}$~pc$^{-2}$), GHZ2 is an ideal formation site for the progenitors of today's globular clusters. The remarkable brightness of GHZ2 makes it a ``Rosetta stone'' for understanding the physics of galaxy formation within just 360 Myr after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>The evolutionary pathways of disk galaxies with different sizes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From the IllustrisTNG-50 simulation, a sample of 836 central disk galaxies with tiny stellar halos is chosen to study the inherent evolution of galaxies driven by nature. These galaxies are classified as compact, normal, or extended by referencing their locations on the mass-size ($M_\star-R_{\rm 1/2}$) diagram. This research demonstrates the distinctive evolutionary pathways of galaxies with different sizes in IllustrisTNG simulations, primarily driven by nature. It is confirmed that disk galaxies inherit the angular momentum of their parent dark matter halos. More compact galaxies form earlier within halos possessing lower specific angular momentum through heightened star formation during the early phase at redshifts above 2. During the later phase, the size of extended galaxies experiences more pronounced growth by accreting gas with high angular momentum. Additionally, we reveal that many key characteristics of galaxies are linked to their mass and size: (1) compact galaxies tend to exhibit higher metal content, proportional to the potential well $\frac{M_\star}{R_{\rm 1/2}}$, (2) compact galaxies host more massive bulges and black holes, and higher central concentration. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that galaxies of all types continue to actively engage in star formation, with no evident signs of quenching attributed to their varying sizes and angular momenta.</description>

      <title>Kinematic morphology of low-mass galaxies in IllustrisTNG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of diverse kinematic morphologies observed in low-mass galaxies is unclear. In this study, we investigate the kinematic morphologies of central galaxies with stellar mass $10^{8.5-9.0} M_\odot$ at $z=0$ in the TNG50-1 cosmological simulation. The majority of the low-mass galaxies in TNG50-1 are dispersion-dominated, consistent with observations. By tracing the evolutionary histories of simulated low-mass galaxies, we find that while most stars form in rotating cold gas discs, the orientation of the star-forming discs relative to the galaxies may evolve with cosmic time. If the cold gas disc remains aligning with the galaxy during its evolution, stars formed at different times share the same rotational direction, leading to a rotation-dominated system. On the contrary, frequent misalignment of cold gas disc would result in a dispersion-dominated system. In addition, we also find that the two-body scattering can have a non-negligible numerical heating effect on the simulated galaxy morphology, especially at central regions of galaxies and for relatively low-mass galaxies. By comparing results of simulations with different resolutions, our results suggest that the simulated morphology of galaxies is roughly reliable when their number of stellar particles exceeds about $10^{4}$, and bulge morphology of galaxies can not be resolved robustly at the resolution level of TNG50-1.</description>

Abstract: Context. Atomic and molecular line emissions from shocks may provide valuable information on the injection of mechanical energy in the interstellar medium (ISM), the generation of turbulence, and the processes of phase transition between the Warm Neutral Medium (WNM) and the Cold Neutral Medium (CNM).Aims. In this series of papers, we investigate the properties of shocks propagating in the WNM. Our objective is to identify the tracers of these shocks, use them to interpret ancillary observations of the local diffuse matter, and provide predictions for future observations.Methods. Shocks propagating in the WNM are studied using the Paris-Durham shock code, a multi-fluid model built to follow the thermodynamical and chemical structures of shock waves, at steady-state, in a plane-parallel geometry. The code, already designed to take into account the impact of an external radiation field, is updated to treat self-irradiated shocks at intermediate (30</description>

      <title>Constraining the Low-Mass End of the Black Hole Mass Function and the Active Fraction of the Intermediate-mass Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09441v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the black hole mass function (BHMF) and the Eddington ratio distribution function (ERDF), focusing on the intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) with masses down to $M_{\bullet}\sim10^4 M_\odot$. Based on the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with a detected broad H$\alpha$ emission line, we construct a sample of 14,242 AGNs at redshift $z&lt;0.35$, including 243 IMBHs with $M_{\bullet}&lt;10^6 M_\odot$. By jointly modeling the BHMF and ERDF via the maximum posterior estimation, we find that the BHMF peaks at $\sim$$10^{6} M_\odot$ and exhibits a relatively constant value of $10^{-4}\,\mathrm{Mpc^{-3}\,dex^{-1}}$ at the low-mass end. By comparing the derived BHMF of type 1 AGNs with the galaxy mass function based on the updated black hole mass--host galaxy stellar mass relation, we derive the active fraction. We also determine the active fraction for all AGNs using the upper and lower limit of the type 1 fraction. The active fraction decreases from 15%--40% for massive galaxies ($M_\star&gt;10^{10} M_\odot$) to lower than $\sim$2% for dwarf galaxies with $M_\star\sim10^8 M_\odot$. These results suggest that the black hole occupation fraction is expected to be $\sim$50% for low-mass galaxies ($M_\star\sim10^{8.5}$--$10^9 M_\odot$) if the duty cycle is similar IMBHs and supermassive black holes.</description>

Abstract: Galaxy angular momenta (spins) contain valuable cosmological information, complementing their positions and velocities. The baryonic spin direction of galaxies has been probed as a reliable tracer of their host halos and the primordial spin modes. Here we use the TNG100 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project to study the spin magnitude correlations between dark matter, gas, and stellar components of galaxy-halo systems and their evolutions across cosmic history. We find that these components generate similar initial spin magnitudes from the same tidal torque in Lagrangian space. At low redshifts, the gas component still traces the spin magnitude of the dark matter halo and the primordial spin magnitude. However, the traceability of the stellar component depends on the $ex$ $situ$ stellar mass fraction, $f_{\rm acc}$. Our results suggest that the galaxy baryonic spin magnitude can also serve as a tracer of their host halo and the initial perturbations, and the galaxy-halo correlations are affected by the similarity of their evolution histories.</description>

      <title>Weighing Milky Way and Andromeda in an Expanding $\Lambda$CDM Universe: Resolving the Local Group mass tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of the Local Group (LG), especially the contribution of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) galaxies, is sensitive to the presence of dark energy. This work compares the evolution of the LG by considering it as a two-body problem in a homogeneous and isotropic expanding spacetime in a full $\Lambda$CDM background. Using the Timing Argument (which links LG dynamics to LG mass) we find that the full $\Lambda$CDM background predicts a $\sim 10 \%$ lower mass for the LG while $\Lambda$ alone predicts a $\sim 10 \%$ higher mass. By the calibration of the IllustrisTNG simulations, the TA mass is shown to be biased high, and modified to be $\left(3.89 \pm 0.62\right) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the MW Center Of Mass (COM) reduce the LG mass to be $\left(2.33 \pm 0.72\right) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. The overall estimated mass is compatible with the total sum of masses of MW and M31 (including their halos) estimated independently. The mass also is compatible with other estimations such as the Hubble flow, the Virial Theorem with the other dwarf galaxies and different Machine Learning methods based on LG-like pairs from simulations. These results resolve the controversy between the TA based estimations and the other probes in the literature.</description>

      <title>Search for gravitationally lensed interstellar transmissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01201v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore interstellar light transmission facilitated by gravitational lensing, focusing on axially-symmetric lensing configurations where the transmitter, lens, and receiver are nearly aligned. Positioning an optical transmitter in the lens's focal region, we investigate the caustic formed by a diffraction-limited annular beam of light emitted by the transmitter. We analyze the impact of the lens's point spread function (PSF) on the projected beam's structure, estimate the power delivered to a receiver at interstellar distances, and assess the major noise sources. We determine detection sensitivity in both noise- and signal-dominated regimes. Considering realistic assumptions about the transmitter's performance, we explore signal detection strategies enhanced by the spatial broadening of the received beam, a result of the transmitting lens's PSF. Our findings indicate that detecting lensed optical signals from nearby stars is achievable using established optical engineering technologies. A network of spatially distributed astronomical facilities capable of observations in multiple narrow spectral bands will enhance the search. Our results support the feasibility of interstellar power transmission via gravitational lensing, directly contributing to ongoing optical SETI efforts.</description>

      <title>JWST Imaging of the Closest Globular Clusters -- III. Multiple Populations along the low-mass Main Sequence stars of NGC 6397</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thanks to its exceptional near-infrared photometry, JWST can effectively contribute to the discovery, characterization, and understanding of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters, especially at low masses where the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) faces limitations. This paper continues the efforts of the JWST GO-1979 program in exploring the faintest members of the globular cluster NGC 6397. Here we show that the combination of HST and JWST data allows us to identify two groups of MS stars (MSa, the first-generation, and MSb, the second-generation group). We measured the ratio between the two groups and combined it with measurements from the literature focused on more central fields and more massive stars compared to our study. We find that the MSa and MSb stars are present in a $\approx$30-70 ratio regardless of the distance from the centre of the cluster and the mass of the stars used so far.</description>

      <title>A search for Galactic post-asymptotic giant branch stars in Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. When low and intermediate-mass stars leave the Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) phase, and before they reach the Planetary Nebulae stage, they enter a very brief and rather puzzling stellar evolutionary stage named post-AGB.
  Aims. To provide a reliable catalogue of galactic post-AGB stars together with their physical and evolutionary properties obtained through Gaia DR3 astrometry and photometry.
  Methods. We started by identifying post-AGB stars or possible candidates from the bibliography with their Gaia DR3 counterpart sources. Using the available photometry, interstellar extinction, literature spectroscopically derived temperatures or spectral types and parallax-derived distances from Gaia DR3, we fitted their Spectral Energy Distributions and we estimated their luminosities and circumstellar extinctions. When compared to models, luminosity values allowed us to disclose objects that are likely post-AGB stars from other target types. Their position on the HR diagram allows direct comparison with updated post-AGB evolutionary tracks and an estimation of their masses and evolutionary ages.
  Results. We obtained a sample of 69 reliable post-AGB candidates that meet our classification criteria, providing their coordinates, distances, effective temperature, total extinction, luminosity, mass, and evolutionary age. In addition, similar data for other stellar objects in our initial compilation, such as supergiant stars or young stellar objects, is provided.
  Conclusions. We have filtered out the data that have the best precision in parallaxes and distances to obtain more accurate luminosities, which allows us to classify with confidence the objects of the sample among different stellar phases. This allows us to provide a small but reliable sample of post-AGB objects. Derived mean evolutionary time and average mass values are in agreement with theoretical expectations.</description>

      <title>Strong gravitational lenses from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Like many areas of astrophysics and cosmology, the Vera C. Rubin Observatory will be transformational for almost all the applications of strong lensing, thanks to the dramatic increase in the number of known strong lenses by two orders of magnitude or more and the readily available time-domain data for the lenses with transient sources. In this article, we provide an overview of the forecasted number of discovered lenses of different types and describe the primary science cases these large lens samples will enable. We provide an updated forecast on the joint constraint for the dark energy equation-of-state parameters, $w_0$ and $w_a$, from combining all strong lensing probes of dark energy. We update the previous forecast from the Rubin Observatory Dark Energy Science Collaboration's Science Review Document by adding two new crucial strong lensing samples: lensed Type Ia supernovae and single-deflector lenses with measured stellar kinematics. Finally, we describe the current and near-future activities and collaborative efforts within the strong lensing community in preparation for the arrival of the first real dataset from Rubin in early 2026.</description>

      <title>Radiation MHD Simulations of Soft X-ray Emitting Regions in Changing Look AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong soft X-ray emission called soft X-ray excess is often observed in luminous active galactic nuclei (AGN). It has been suggested that the soft X-rays are emitted from a warm ($T=10^6\sim10^7\ \rm{K}$) region that is optically thick for the Thomson scattering (warm Comptonization region). Motivated by the recent observations that soft X-ray excess appears in changing look AGN (CLAGN) during the state transition from a dim state without broad emission lines to a bright state with broad emission lines, we performed global three-dimensional radiation magnetohydrodynamic simulations assuming that the mass accretion rate increases and becomes around $10$\% of the Eddington accretion rate. The simulation successfully reproduces a warm, Thomson-thick region outside the hot radiatively inefficient accretion flow near the black hole. The warm region is formed by efficient radiative cooling due to inverse Compton scattering. The calculated luminosity $0.01L_{{\rm Edd}}-0.08L_{{\rm Edd}}$ is consistent with the luminosity of CLAGN. We also found that the warm Comptonization region is well described by the steady model of magnetized disks supported by azimuthal magnetic fields. When the anti-parallel azimuthal magnetic fields supporting the radiatively cooled region reconnect around the equatorial plane of the disk, the temperature of the region becomes higher by releasing the magnetic energy transported to the region.</description>
