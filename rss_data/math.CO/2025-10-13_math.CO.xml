      <title>Divergent Infinite Series -- Ramanujan's Initial Intuition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates Srinivasa Ramanujan's initial intuitive methodology for assigning the finite value -1/12 to the sum of the divergent infinite series of all positive integers. We systematically examine Ramanujan's initial method, originally sketched in his notebooks, and set the methodology into an algebraic framework. The methodology has limited applicability to other classes of divergent series. The methodology is extended to assign a Ramanujan smoothed sum to the infinite sequences of integers raised to a positive integer power and to figurate binomial number sequences, including triangular numbers, tetrahedral numbers, and higher-dimensional analogues, avoiding analytical continuation. A key finding establishes that the Ramanujan smoothed sums of figurate binomial sequences are intrinsically connected to logarithmic numbers (Gregory coefficients), providing a novel perspective on Ramanujan summation through the lens of classical combinatorial functions. The paper applies asymptotic expansions of associated rational generating functions to demonstrate consistency with established results from analytic continuation methods. The results illuminate the deeper mathematical structures underlying Ramanujan's intuitive insights and suggest new avenues for research in divergent series summation.</description>

      <title>Remoteness, order, size and connectivity constraints in digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let \( D \) be a strongly connected digraph. The average distance of a vertex \( v \) in \( D \) is defined as the arithmetic mean of the distances from \( v \) to all other vertices in \( D \). The remoteness \( \rho(D) \) of \( D \) is the maximum of the average distances of the vertices in \( D \).
  In this paper, we provide a sharp upper bound on the remoteness of a strong digraph with given order, size, and vertex-connectivity. We then characterise the extremal digraphs that maximise remoteness among all strong digraphs of order \(n\), size at least \(m\), and vertex-connectivity \(\kappa\). Finally, we demonstrate that the upper bounds on the remoteness of a graph given its order, size, and connectivity constraints (see \cite{DanMafMal2025}) can be extended to a larger class of digraphs containing all graphs, the Eulerian digraphs.</description>

      <title>Iterated sumset expansion in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p^n$, what conditions does one need to guarantee that iterated sumsets of the form $A+\cdots+A$ expand quickly (say, within $O(p)$ terms) to the whole space? When only the size of $A$ is known, such expansion results are only possible when $|A|&gt;\frac{1}{p}|\mathbb{F}_p^n|$. However, heuristic considerations suggest that expansion should begin with much smaller sets under just mild ``nondegeneracy'' conditions. In this paper, we confirm this intuition by showing a sufficient algebraic condition for the asymmetric version of this problem: We have $A_1+\dots+A_m=\mathbb{F}_p^n$ as long as each $A_i$ is not contained in the zero set of any low degree polynomial ($\text{deg} = O(n)$ when $m=O(p)$). We close with a discussion of the behavior of random sets, as well as extensions of these results and connections with the Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv problem. Our proofs make use of the shift operator polynomial method developed by the second author.</description>

      <title>Graphs Excluding a Minor in Blowups of Treewidth 3 Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alon, Seymour, and Thomas [J. Amer. Math. Soc. 1990] famously showed that every $n$-vertex $K_h$-minor-free graph has treewidth $O_h(\sqrt{n})$. Recently, Distel, Dujmovi\'c, Eppstein, Hickingbotham, Joret, Micek, Morin, Seweryn, and Wood [SIAM J. Discrete Math. 2024] refined this by showing that these graphs are $O_h(\sqrt{n})$-blowups of treewidth $4$ graphs. We improve this by showing that these graphs are $O_h(\sqrt{n})$-blowups of treewidth $3$ graphs.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for the minimum degree of minimal multicolor Ramsey graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide two novel constructions of $r$ edge-disjoint $K_{k+1}$-free graphs on the same vertex set, each of which has the property that every small induced subgraph contains a complete graph on $k$ vertices. The main novelty of our argument is the combination of an algebraic and a probabilistic coloring scheme, which utilizes the beneficial algebraic and combinatorial properties of the Hermitian unital. These constructions improve on a number of upper bounds on the smallest possible minimum degree of minimal $r$-color Ramsey graphs for the clique $K_{k+1}$ when $r\geq c\frac{k}{\log^2 k}$ and $k$ is large enough.</description>

      <title>An algebraic approach to Latin squares of prime power order by local permutation polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Every Latin square of prime power order $q$ is uniquely described by a local permutation polynomial (LPP) in the polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_q[x,y]$. Despite this equivalence, one may find in the literature only some preliminary results on the relationship among Latin squares and LPPs. This paper delves into this topic by showing how the coefficients of any LPP are identified with the zeros of an algebraic set over $\mathbb{F}_q$. This allows for an algebraic description of all Latin squares of order $q$ by means of a unique polynomial in $\mathbb{F}_q[x,y]$, whose coefficients satisfy the constraints defined by the algebraic set under consideration. In order to make much easier the construction of this polynomial, we also deal with the natural translation to LPPs of both notions of reduced and isotopic Latin squares. Our algebraic approach is readily adapted to identify both types of Latin squares. All of the above is constructively illustrated for $q\in\{4,5\}$. We finish our study with the natural translation to LPPs of both notions of complete mappings and orthomorphisms of quasigroups, showing their relationship with transversals and isotopisms of Latin squares.</description>

      <title>A classification algorithm for reflexive simplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general classification algorithm for reflexive simplices, which allows us to determine all reflexive simplices in dimensions five and six. In terms of algebraic geometry this means that we classify the Gorenstein fake weighted projective spaces in dimensions five and six. As a byproduct of our methods, we obtain explicit formulae for the Picard group and the Gorenstein index of any fake weighted projective space.</description>

      <title>Multiparty equality in the local broadcast model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the multiparty equality problem in graphs, where every vertex of a graph $G$ is given an input, and the goal of the vertices is to decide whether all inputs are equal. We study this problem in the local broadcast model, where a message sent by a vertex is received by all its neighbors and the total cost of a protocol is the sum of the lengths of the messages sent by the vertices. This setting was studied by Khan and Vaidya, who gave in 2021 a protocol achieving a 4-approximation in the general case.
  We study this multiparty communication problem through the lens of network topology. We design a new protocol for 2-connected graphs, whose efficiency relies on the notion of total vertex cover in graph theory. This protocol outperforms the aforementioned 4-approximation in a number of cases. To demonstrate its applicability, we apply it to obtain optimal or asymptotically optimal protocols for several natural network topologies such as cycles, hypercubes, and grids. On the way we also provide new bounds of independent interest on the size of total vertex covers in regular graphs.</description>

      <title>On The Roots of Independence Polynomial: Quantifying The Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The independence polynomial of a graph $G$ is the generating polynomial corresponding to its independent sets of different sizes. More formally, if $a_k(G)$ denotes the number of independent sets of $G$ of size $k$ then
  \[I(G,z) \as \sum_{k}^{} (-1)^k a_k(G) z^k.\] The study of evaluating $I(G,z)$ has several deep connections to problems in combinatorics, complexity theory and statistical physics. Consequently, the roots of the independence polynomial have been studied in detail. In particular, many works have provided regions in the complex plane that are devoid of any roots of the polynomial. One of the first such results showed a lower bound on the absolute value of the smallest root $\beta(G)$ of the polynomial. Furthermore, when $G$ is connected, Goldwurm and Santini established that $\beta(G)$ is a simple real root of $I(G,z)$ smaller than one. An alternative proof was given by Csikv\'ari. Both proofs do not provide a gap from $\beta(G)$ to the smallest absolute value amongst all the other roots of $I(G,z)$. In this paper, we quantify this gap.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\lambda$-quiddities of size $n$ are $n$-tuples of elements from a fixed set that are solutions to a matrix equation which is fundamental in the study of the combinatorics of the modular group and Coxeter's friezes. To gain further insight into these objects, we use a notion of irreducibility, which allows restricting the study to a limited number of elements that must be determined for each set. Our goal here is to define several families of $\lambda$-quiddities over finite fields and to study their irreducibility properties, with the specific aim of establishing lower bounds on the maximal size of irreducible elements over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete computational classification of the combinatorial types of hyperplane sections, or slices, of the regular cube up to dimension six. For each dimension, we determine the exact number of distinct combinatorial types. When restricted to slices through the origin, our computations extend to dimension seven. The classification combines combinatorial, algebraic, and numerical techniques, with all results certified. Beyond enumeration, we analyze the distribution of types by number of vertices, establish new theoretical results about the combinatorics of slices of cubes, and propose conjectures motivated by our computational findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The poset of maximal tubings of a graph generalizes several well-known and remarkable partial orders. Notable examples include the weak Bruhat order and the Tamari lattice, posets of maximal tubings for the complete graph and the path graph, respectively. It is an open problem to characterize graphs for which the poset of maximal tubings is a lattice. In this paper, we prove that the poset of maximal tubings for the cycle graph is a lattice, and moreover that it is semidistributive and congruence uniform. As main tools, we characterize all order relations in the poset, and introduce a useful map from maximal tubings of the cycle graph to maximal tubings of the path graph.</description>

      <title>Multiplexons: Limits of Multiplex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a multiplex network, a set of nodes is connected by different types of interactions, each represented as a separate layer within the network. Multiplexes have emerged as a key instrument for modeling large-scale complex systems, due to the widespread coexistence of diverse interactions in social, industrial, and biological domains. This motivates the development of a rigorous and readily applicable framework for studying properties of large multiplex networks. In this article, we provide a self-contained introduction to the limit theory of dense multiplex networks, analogous to the theory of graphons (limit theory of dense graphs). As applications, we derive limiting analogues of commonly used multiplex features, such as degree distributions and clustering coefficients. We also present a range of illustrative examples, including correlated versions of Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi and inhomogeneous random graph models and dynamic networks. Finally, we discuss how multiplex networks fit within the broader framework of decorated graphs, and how the convergence results can be recovered from the limit theory of decorated graphs. Several future directions are outlined for further developing the multiplex limit theory.</description>

      <title>A CSP approach to Graph Sandwich Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The \emph{Sandwich Problem} (SP) for a graph class $\calC$ is the following computational problem. The input is a pair of graphs $(V,E_1)$ and $(V,E_2)$ where $E_1\subseteq E_2$, and the task is to decide whether there is an edge set $E$ where $E_1\subseteq E \subseteq E_2$ such that the graph $(V,E)$ belongs to $\calC$. In this paper we show that many SPs correspond to the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) of an infinite $2$-edge-coloured graph $H$. We then notice that several known complexity results for SPs also follow from general complexity classifications of infinite-domain CSPs, suggesting a fruitful application of the theory of CSPs to complexity classifications of SPs. We strengthen this evidence by using basic tools from constraint satisfaction theory to propose new complexity results of the SP for several graph classes including line graphs of multigraphs, line graphs of bipartite multigraphs, $K_k$-free perfect graphs, and classes described by forbidding finitely many induced subgraphs, such as $\{I_4,P_4\}$-free graphs, settling an open problem of Alvarado, Dantas, and Rautenbach (2019). We also construct a graph sandwich problem which is in coNP, but neither in P nor coNP-complete (unless P = coNP).</description>

      <title>An exactly solvable asymmetric simple inclusion process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of the asymmetric simple inclusion process (ASIP) on a periodic one-dimensional lattice, where the integers in the particles rates are deformed to their $t$-analogues. We call this the $(q, t, \theta)$~ASIP, where $q$ is the asymmetric hopping parameter and $\theta$ is the diffusion parameter. We show that this process is a misanthrope process, and consequently the steady state is independent of $q$. We compute the steady state, the one-point correlation and the current in the steady state. In particular, we show that the single-site occupation probabilities follow a \emph{beta-binomial} distribution at $t=1$. We compute the two-dimensional phase diagram in various regimes of the parameters $(t, \theta)$ and perform simulations to justify the results. We also show that a modified form of the steady state weights at $t \neq 1$ satisfy curious palindromic and antipalindromic symmetries. Lastly, we define an enriched process at $t=1$ and $\theta$ an integer which projects onto the $(q, 1, \theta)$~ASIP and whose steady state is uniform, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Geometry over finite local rings: Rigidity and Isospectrality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the simplicial order complexes obtained from free modules over finite local rings. These complexes arise naturally as geodesic spheres in Bruhat-Tits buildings over non-archimedean local fields. We establish two forms of rigidity, showing that their automorphism groups arise from the underlying algebraic group, and that they are determined by sparse induced subgraphs. We compute the spectra of these subgraphs and show that they form excellent expanders, which results in expansion for geodesic powers of Bruhat-Tits buildings. The computation also reveals that local rings with the same residue order give rise to isospectral induced subgraphs. Combining this with our rigidity results we show that the graphs arising from $n$-spaces over $\mathbb{Z}/p^{r}$ and $\mathbb{F}_{p}[t]/(t^{r})$ are isospectral and non-isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Games Through Communication Complexity and Quantum Cryptography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis explores foundational aspects of quantum information theory and quantum cryptography.
  First, we investigate quantum correlations in interactive settings, including the CHSH and graph isomorphism games. We aim to distinguish quantum correlations from non-signaling correlations by leveraging the principle of communication complexity. To this end, we employ techniques such as distributed computation, majority-function-based distillation protocols, the algebraic and geometric properties of nonlocal box wirings, and variations of some graph properties such as isomorphism, transitivity, and equitable partitions. This inquiry advances our understanding of non-physical correlations.
  Second, we address a key open problem in cryptography: the feasibility of unclonable encryption. We aim to construct an encryption scheme that prevents two distant parties from simultaneously obtaining information about a shared encrypted message. We introduce a candidate for unclonable encryption in the plain model, i.e. without assumptions, in working towards an unconditional proof. Our protocol is based on Clifford algebra, utilizing complex Hermitian unitary matrices that anti-commute. For small key sizes, we rigorously prove security using sum-of-squares methods, while for larger key sizes, we provide strong numerical evidence via the NPA hierarchy.</description>

Abstract: We survey three settings in which dimensions of intersection cohomology groups of algebraic varieties provide deep combinatorial and representation-theoretic information, and computations of the groups themselves have been made using combinatorial sheaves on finite posets. These settings are (1) intersection cohomology of Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials and their realizations via moment graph sheaves and Soergel bimodules; (2) intersection cohomology of toric varieties, the associated g-polynomials of convex polytopes, and their realization via the theory of intersection cohomology of fans; and (3) intersection cohomology of arrangement Schubert varieties, the associated Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of matroids, and their realization via intersection cohomology of matroids. In all three settings these constructions are valid in more general situations where the variety does not exist, leading to "intersection cohomology without spaces." We give parallel presentations of these three stories, highlighting applications to KLS-polynomials.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Algorithms for Diversity of Networks with Ecological Dependencies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a phylogenetic tree, the phylogenetic diversity of a set A of taxa is the total weight of edges on paths to A. Finding small sets of maximal diversity is crucial for conservation planning, as it indicates where limited resources can be invested most efficiently. In recent years, efficient algorithms have been developed to find sets of taxa that maximize phylogenetic diversity either in a phylogenetic network or in a phylogenetic tree subject to ecological constraints, such as a food web. However, these aspects have mostly been studied independently. Since both factors are biologically important, it seems natural to consider them together. In this paper, we introduce decision problems where, given a phylogenetic network, a food web, and integers k, and D, the task is to find a set of k taxa with phylogenetic diversity of at least D under the maximize all paths measure, while also satisfying viability conditions within the food web. Here, we consider different definitions of viability, which all demand that a "sufficient" number of prey species survive to support surviving predators. We investigate the parameterized complexity of these problems and present several fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms. Specifically, we provide a complete complexity dichotomy characterizing which combinations of parameters - out of the size constraint k, the acceptable diversity loss D, the scanwidth of the food web, the maximum in-degree in the network, and the network height h - lead to W[1]-hardness and which admit FPT algorithms. Our primary methodological contribution is a novel algorithmic framework for solving phylogenetic diversity problems in networks where dependencies (such as those from a food web) impose an order, using a color coding approach.</description>

Abstract: The $g$-vector of a simplicial complex contains a lot of information about the combinatorial and topological structure of that complex. Several classification results regarding the structure of normal pseudomanifolds and homology manifolds have been established concerning the value of $g_2$. It is known that when $g_2=0$, all normal pseudomanifolds of dimensions at least three are stacked spheres. In the cases of $g_2=1$ and $2$, all homology manifolds are polytopal spheres and can be obtained through retriangulation or join operations from the previous ones. In this article, we provide a combinatorial characterization of the homology $d$-manifolds, where $d\geq 3$ and $g_2=3$. These are spheres and can be obtained through operations such as joins, some retriangulations, and connected sums from spheres with $g_2\leq 2$. Furthermore, we have presented a structural result on prime normal $d$-pseudomanifolds with $g_2=3$.</description>

      <title>On open-separating dominating codes in graphs</title>

Abstract: Using dominating sets to separate vertices of graphs is a well-studied problem in the larger domain of identification problems. In such problems, the objective is to choose a suitable dominating set $C$ of a graph $G$ which is also separating in the sense that the neighbourhoods of any two distinct vertices of $G$ have distinct intersections with $C$. Such a dominating and separating set $C$ of a graph is often referred to as a code in the literature. Depending on the types of dominating and separating sets used, various problems arise under various names in the literature. In this paper, we introduce a new problem in the same realm of identification problems whereby the code, called open-separating dominating code, or OD-code for short, is a dominating set and uses open neighbourhoods for separating vertices. The paper studies the fundamental properties concerning the existence, hardness and minimality of OD-codes. Due to the emergence of a close and yet difficult to establish relation of the OD-code with another well-studied code in the literature called open (neighborhood)-locating dominating code (referred to as the open-separating total-dominating code and abbreviated as OTD-code in this paper), we compare the two codes on various graph families. Finally, we also provide an equivalent reformulation of the problem of finding OD-codes of a graph as a covering problem in a suitable hypergraph and discuss the polyhedra associated with OD-codes, again in relation to OTD-codes of some graph families already studied in this context.</description>

      <title>Identifying codes in graphs of given maximum degree: Characterizing trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An identifying code of a closed-twin-free graph $G$ is a dominating set $S$ of vertices of $G$ such that any two vertices in $G$ have a distinct intersection between their closed neighborhoods and $S$. It was conjectured that there exists an absolute constant $c$ such that for every connected graph $G$ of order $n$ and maximum degree $\Delta$, the graph $G$ admits an identifying code of size at most $( \frac{\Delta-1}{\Delta} )n +c$. We provide significant support for this conjecture by exactly characterizing every tree requiring a positive constant $c$ together with the exact value of the constant. Hence, proving the conjecture for trees. For $\Delta=2$ (the graph is a path or a cycle), it is long known that $c=3/2$ suffices. For trees, for each $\Delta\ge 3$, we show that $c=1/\Delta\le 1/3$ suffices and that $c$ is required to have a positive value only for a finite number of trees. In particular, for $\Delta = 3$, there are 12 trees with a positive constant $c$ and, for each $\Delta \ge 4$, the only tree with positive constant $c$ is the $\Delta$-star. Our proof is based on induction and utilizes recent results from [F. Foucaud, T. Lehtil\"a. Revisiting and improving upper bounds for identifying codes. SIAM Journal on Discrete Mathematics, 2022]. We remark that there are infinitely many trees for which the bound is tight when $\Delta=3$; for every $\Delta\ge 4$, we construct an infinite family of trees of order $n$ with identification number very close to the bound, namely $\left( \frac{\Delta-1+\frac{1}{\Delta-2}}{\Delta+\frac{2}{\Delta-2}} \right) n &gt; (\frac{\Delta-1}{\Delta} ) n -\frac{n}{\Delta^2}$. Furthermore, we also give a new tight upper bound for identification number on trees by showing that the sum of the domination and identification numbers of any tree $T$ is at most its number of vertices.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time treatment number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the discrete-time treatment number of a graph, in which each vertex is in exactly one of three states at any given time-step: compromised, vulnerable, or treated. Our treatment number is distinct from other graph searching parameters that use only two states, such as the firefighter problem or Bernshteyn and Lee's inspection number. Vertices represent individuals and edges exist between individuals with close connections. Each vertex starts out as compromised; it can become compromised again even after treatment. Our objective is to treat the entire population so that at the last time-step, no members are vulnerable or compromised, while minimizing the maximum number of treatments that occur at each time-step. This minimum is the treatment number, and it depends on the choice of a pre-determined length of time $r$ that a vertex can remain in a treated state and length of time $s$ that a vertex can remain in a vulnerable state without being treated again.
  We denote the pathwidth of graph $H$ by $pw(H)$ and prove that the treatment number of $H$ is bounded above by $\lceil \frac{1+pw(H)}{r+s}\rceil$. This equals the best possible lower bound for a cautious treatment plan, defined as one in which each vertex, after being treated for the first time, is treated again within every consecutive $r+s$ time-steps until its last treatment. However, many graphs admit a plan that is not cautious. When $r=s=1$, we find a useful tool for proving lower bounds, show that the treatment number of an $n\times n$ grid equals $\lceil\frac{1+n}{2}\rceil$, characterize graphs that require only one treatment per time-step, and prove that subdividing one edge can reduce the treatment number. It is known that there are trees with arbitrarily large pathwidth; surprisingly, we prove that for any tree $T$, there is a subdivision of $T$ that requires at most two treatments per time-step.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Satisfied Vertex Requests in List Coloring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $G$ is a graph and $L$ is a list assignment for $G$. A request of $L$ is a function $r$ with nonempty domain $D\subseteq V(G)$ such that $r(v) \in L(v)$ for each $v \in D$. The triple $(G,L,r)$ is $\epsilon$-satisfiable if there exists a proper $L$-coloring $f$ of $G$ such that $f(v) = r(v)$ for at least $\epsilon|D|$ vertices in $D$. We say $G$ is $(k, \epsilon)$-flexible if $(G,L',r')$ is $\epsilon$-satisfiable whenever $L'$ is a $k$-assignment for $G$ and $r'$ is a request of $L'$. It is known that a graph $G$ is not $(k, \epsilon)$-flexible for any $k$ if and only if $\epsilon &gt; 1/ \rho(G)$ where $\rho(G)$ is the Hall ratio of $G$. The list flexibility number of a graph $G$, denoted $\chi_{\ell flex}(G)$, is the smallest $k$ such that $G$ is $(k,1/ \rho(G))$-flexible. A fundamental open question on list flexibility numbers asks: Is there a graph with list flexibility number greater than its coloring number?
  In this paper, we show that the list flexibility number of any complete multipartite graph $G$ is at most the coloring number of $G$. We also initiate the study of list epsilon flexibility functions of complete bipartite graphs which was first suggested by Kaul, Mathew, Mudrock, and Pelsmajer in 2024. Specifically, we completely determine the list epsilon flexibility function of $K_{m,n}$ when $m \in \{1,2\}$ and establish some additional bounds for small $m$. Our proofs reveal a connection to list coloring complete bipartite graphs with asymmetric list sizes which is a topic that was explored by Alon, Cambie, and Kang in 2021.</description>

Abstract: In 1980, Gupta, Kahn and Robertson proved that every graph $G$ with minimum degree at least $k\geq 2$ contains a cycle $C$ containing at least $k+1$ vertices each having at least $k$ neighbors in $C$ (so $C$ has at least $\frac{(k+1)(k-2)}{2}$ chords). In this work, we go further by showing that some of its edges can be contracted to obtain a graph with high minimum degree (we call such a minor of $C$ a \emph{cyclic minor}). We then investigate further cycles having cliques as cyclic minors, and show that minimum degree at least $O(k^2)$ guarantees a cyclic $K_k$-minor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a family $\mathcal{F}$ of words of length $n$ drawn from an alphabet $A=[r]=\{1,\dots,r\}$, Danh and Daykin defined the deletion shadow $\Delta \mathcal{F}$ as the family containing all words that can be made by deleting one letter of a word of $\mathcal{F}$. They asked, given the size of such a family, how small its deletion shadow can be, and answered this with a Kruskal-Katona type result when the alphabet has size $2$. However, Leck showed that no ordering can give such a result for larger alphabets. The minimal shadow has been known for families of size $s^n$, where the optimal family has form $[s]^n$. We give the minimal shadow for many intermediate sizes between these levels, showing that families of the form 'all words in $[s]^n$ in which the symbol $s$ appears at most $k$ times' are optimal. Our proof uses some fractional techniques that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian polynomials and matroids over triangular hyperfields 1: Topological aspects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02907v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lorentzian polynomials serve as a bridge between continuous and discrete convexity, connecting analysis and combinatorics. In this article, we study the topology of the space $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ of Lorentzian polynomials on $J$ modulo $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$, which is nonempty if and only if $J$ is the set of bases of a polymatroid. We prove that $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ is a manifold with boundary of dimension equal to the Tutte rank of $J$, and more precisely, that it is homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball with the Dressian of $J$ removed from its boundary. Furthermore, we show that $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ is homeomorphic to the thin Schubert cell $\textrm{Gr}_J(\mathbb{T}_q)$ of $J$ over the triangular hyperfield $\mathbb{T}_q$, introduced by Viro in the context of tropical geometry and Maslov dequantization, for any $q&gt;0$. This identification enables us to apply the representation theory of polymatroids developed in a companion paper, as well as earlier work by the first and fourth authors on foundations of matroids, to give a simple explicit description of $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ up to homeomorphism in several key cases. Our results show that $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ always admits a compactification homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball. They can also be used to answer a question of Br\"and\'en in the negative by showing that the closure of $\mathbb{P}\textrm{L}_J$ within the space of all polynomials modulo $\mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ is not homeomorphic to a closed Euclidean ball in general. In addition, we introduce the Hausdorff compactification of the space of rescaling classes of Lorentzian polynomials and show that the Chow quotient of a complex Grassmannian maps naturally to this compactification. This provides a geometric framework that connects the asymptotic structure of the space of Lorentzian polynomials with classical constructions in algebraic geometry.</description>

      <title>On the foundations of signed graphs I: chain groups, frame matroid, and bivariate flow polynomial</title>

Abstract: This paper studies signed graphs with possible outer-edges. We introduce and investigate the chain group, the boundary operator, the co-boundary operator, the flow group, the tension group, the homology group, the cohomology group, with coefficients in an abelian group. We also introduce and investigate the bivariate flow polynomial for signed graphs. The guiding principle is the correspondence between representable matroids over $\mathbb{R}$ on a ground set $E$ of edges and the subspaces of the vector space of real-valued chains on the same ground set. The frame matroid of signed graph emerges naturally by defining circuits as minimal supports of nonzero flows, rather than listing circuit patterns abruptly. Likewise, bonds, or co-circuits, can be obtained as minimal supports of nonzero tensions. In addition to standardizing the concepts and their meanings of signed graphs, we update the following results: (1) Characterization of cuts and bonds of signed graph with outer-edges. (2) The structures of flow group, boundary group, and homology group, with coefficients in an arbitrary abelian group. (3) Introduction of bivariate flow polynomial of signed graph, revealing the mystery of inexistence of univariate flow polynomial of signed graph in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Positive geometries were introduced by Arkani-Hamed--Bai--Lam as a method of computing scattering amplitudes in theoretical physics. We show that a positive geometry from a polytope admits a log resolution of singularities to another positive geometry. Our result states that the regions in a wonderful compactification of a hyperplane arrangement complement, which we call wondertopes, are positive geometries. A familiar wondertope is the curvy associahedron, which tiles the moduli space of pointed stable rational curves. Thus our work generalizes the known positive geometry structure on this moduli space.</description>

      <title>Reality determining subgraphs and strongly real modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of pseudo q-factorization graphs was recently introduced by the last two authors as a combinatorial language which is suited for capturing certain properties of Drinfeld polynomials. Using certain known representation theoretic facts about tensor products of Kirillov Reshetikhin modules and qcharacters, combined with special topological/combinatorial properties of the underlying q-factorization graphs, the last two authors showed that, for algebras of type A, modules associated to totally ordered graphs are prime, while those associated to trees are real. In this paper, we extend the latter result. We introduce the notions of strongly real modules and that of trees of modules satisfying certain properties. In particular, we can consider snake trees, i.e., trees formed from snake modules. Among other results, we show that a certain class of such generalized trees, which properly contains the snake trees, give rise to strongly real modules.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Quantum State Transfer with a Generalized Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks generated by the adjacency matrix or the Laplacian are known to exhibit low transfer fidelity on general graphs. In this paper, we study continuous-time quantum walks governed by the generalized Laplacian operator L_k = A+kD, where A is the adjacency matrix, D is the degree matrix, and k is a real-valued parameter. Recent work of Duda, McLaughlin, and Wong showed that in the single-excitation Heisenberg (XYZ) spin model, one can realize walks generated by this family of operators on signed weighted graphs. Motivated by earlier studies on vertex-weighted graphs, we demonstrate that for certain graphs, tuning the parameter k can significantly enhance the fidelity of state transfer between endpoints.</description>

      <title>Progress in the study of the (non)existence of genuinely unextendible product bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the open problem of the existence of genuinely unextendible product bases (GUPBs), that is, multipartite unextendible product bases (UPBs) which remain unextendible even with respect to biproduct vectors across all bipartitions of the parties. To this end, we exploit the well-known connection between UPBs and graph theory through orthogonality graphs and orthogonal representations, together with recent progress in this framework, and employ forbidden induced subgraph characterizations to single out the admissible local orthogonality graphs for GUPBs. Using this approach, we establish that GUPBs of size thirteen in three-qutrit systems-the smallest candidate GUPBs-do not exist. We further provide a partial characterization of graphs relevant to larger bases and systems with ququart subsystems.</description>

      <title>Smooth functions which are Morse on preimages of values not being local extrema and constructing natural functions of the class on connected sums of manifolds admitting these functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss smooth functions which are Morse on preimages of values not being local extrema. We call such a function internally Morse or I-Morse.
  The Reeb graph of a smooth function is the space of all connected components of preimages of single points of it topologized with the natural quotient topology of the manifolds and a vertex of it is a point corresponding to a preimage with critical points. A smooth function is neat with respect to the Reeb graph or N-Reeb if the preimages of the vertices are the closed subsets in the manifolds of the domains with interiors being empty.
  We discuss I-Morse and N-Reeb functions, IN-Morse-Reeb functions. Our main result presents an IN-Morse-Reeb function respecting two such functions, on a connected sum of these given manifolds.</description>
