      <title>Mathematical Exploration of the Intersection Between Extended Schrodinger-Virasoro Lie Algebras and Symplectic Novikov Lie Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an in-depth mathematical investigation into the intersection of two advanced Lie algebraic structures: the extended Schr\"odinger-Virasoro Lie algebra (ESVLA) and the Symplectic Novikov Lie algebra (SNLA). By rigorously analyzing their derivations, central extensions, and automorphism groups, we seek to uncover potential synergies and applications linking these distinct algebraic frameworks. The exploration includes detailed proofs, derivations, and calculations, providing new insights into the representation theory of Lie algebras with potential applications in conformal field theory and symplectic geometry.</description>

      <title>Fredholm Determinants from Schr\"odinger Type Equations, and Deformation of Tracy-Widom Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We undertake an analysis of Fredholm determinants arising from kernels whose defining functions satisfy a Schr\"odinger type equation. When this defining function is the Airy one, the evaluation of the corresponding Fredholm determinant yields the notorious Tracy-Widom distribution [hep-th/9211141], which has found many applications in numerous domains. In this paper, we unveil a generalization of the Tracy-Widom distribution for a generic class of defining functions. Furthermore, we bring forth a direct application of our upshot and survey the relation between the framework which we employ and isomonodromic systems.</description>

      <title>Symmetry reduction and reconstruction in contact geometry and Lagrange-Poincar\'e-Herglotz equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the reduction process of a contact Lagrangian system whose Lagrangian is invariant under a group of symmetries. We give explicit coordinate expressions of the resulting reduced differential equations, the so-called Lagrange-Poincare-Herglotz equations. Our framework relied on the associated Herglotz vector field and its projected vector field, and the use of well-chosen quasi-velocities. Some examples are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Calculation of the Relaxation Modulus in the Andrade Model by Using the Laplace Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of the theory of linear viscoelasticity, we derive an analytical expression of the relaxation modulus in the Andrade model $G_{\alpha }\left( t\right) $ for the case of rational parameter \mbox{$\alpha =m/n\in (0,1)$} in terms of Mittag--Leffler functions from its Laplace transform $\tilde{G}_{\alpha }\left( s\right) $. It turns out that the expression obtained can be rewritten in terms of Rabotnov functions. Moreover, for the original parameter $\alpha =1/3$ in the Andrade model, we obtain an expression in terms of Miller-Ross functions. The asymptotic behaviours of $G_{\alpha }\left( t\right) $ for $t\rightarrow 0^{+}$ and $t\rightarrow +\infty $ are also derived applying the Tauberian theorem. The analytical results obtained have been numerically checked by solving the Volterra integral equation satisfied by $G_{\alpha }\left( t\right) $ by using a successive approximation approach, as well as computing the inverse Laplace transform of $\tilde{G}_{\alpha }\left( s\right) $ by using Talbot's method.</description>

      <title>A solution of the generalised quantum Stein's lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve the generalised quantum Stein's lemma, proving that the Stein exponent associated with entanglement testing, namely, the quantum hypothesis testing task of distinguishing between $n$ copies of an entangled state $\rho_{AB}$ and a generic separable state $\sigma_{A^n:B^n}$, equals the regularised relative entropy of entanglement. Not only does this determine the ultimate performance of entanglement testing, but it also establishes the reversibility of the theory of entanglement manipulation under asymptotically non-entangling operations, with the regularised relative entropy of entanglement governing the asymptotic transformation rate between any two quantum states. To solve the problem we introduce two techniques. The first is a procedure that we call "blurring", which, informally, transforms a permutationally symmetric state by making it more evenly spread across nearby type classes. In the fully classical case, blurring alone suffices to prove the generalised Stein's lemma. To solve the quantum problem, however, it does not seem to suffice. Our second technical innovation, therefore, is to perform a second quantisation step to lift the problem to an infinite-dimensional bosonic quantum system; we then solve it there by using techniques from continuous-variable quantum information. Rather remarkably, the second-quantised action of the blurring map corresponds to a pure loss channel. A careful examination of this second quantisation step is the core of our quantum solution.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Polynomials on the Unit Circle, Mutually Unbiased Bases, and Balanced States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two interesting phenomena for the construction of quantum states are that of mutually unbiased bases and that of balanced states. We explore a constructive approach to each phenomenon that involves orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle. In the case of mutually unbiased bases, we show that this approach does not produce such bases. In the case of balanced states, we provide examples of pairs of orthonormal bases and states that are balanced with respect to them. We also consider extensions of these ideas to the infinite dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Stationary Distribution of open Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Processes on an Interval as a marginal of a two-layer ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) on an interval with open boundaries. We provide a representation for its stationary distribution as a marginal of the top layer of a two-layer ensemble under Liggett's condition. The representation is valid in the fan region and in the shock region, extending the representation previously obtained in [Bryc-Zatitskii-2024 arXiv:2403.03275] to ASEP. We also give a recursion for the two-layer weight function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel methodology for constructing arbitrarily high-order structure-preserving methods tailored for damped Hamiltonian systems. This method combines the idea of exponential integrator and energy-preserving collocation methods, effectively preserving the energy dissipation ratio introduced by the damping terms. We demonstrate the conservative properties of these methods and confirm their order of accuracy through numerical experiments involving the damped Burger's equation and Korteweg-de-Vries equation.</description>

      <title>A bound on the quantum value of all compiled nonlocal games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compiler introduced by Kalai et al. (STOC'23) converts any nonlocal game into an interactive protocol with a single computationally-bounded prover. Although the compiler is known to be sound in the case of classical provers, as well as complete in the quantum case, quantum soundness has so far only been established for special classes of games. In this work, we establish a quantum soundness result for all compiled two-player nonlocal games. In particular, we prove that the quantum commuting operator value of the underlying nonlocal game is an upper bound on the quantum value of the compiled game. Our result employs techniques from operator algebras in a computational and cryptographic setting to establish information-theoretic objects in the asymptotic limit of the security parameter. It further relies on a sequential characterization of quantum commuting operator correlations which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Musings on SVD and pseudo entanglement entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pseudo-entropy and SVD entropy are generalizations of the entanglement entropy that involve post-selection. In this work we analyze their properties as measures on the spaces of quantum states and argue that their excess provides useful characterization of a difference between two (i.e. pre-selected and post-selected) states, which shares certain features and in certain cases can be identified as a metric. In particular, when applied to link complement states that are associated to topological links via Chern-Simons theory, these generalized entropies and their excess provide a novel quantification of a difference between corresponding links. We discuss the dependence of such entropy measures on the level of Chern-Simons theory and determine their asymptotic values for certain link states. We find that imaginary part of the pseudo-entropy is sensitive to, and can diagnose chirality of knots. We also consider properties of these entropy measures for simpler quantum mechanical systems, such as generalized SU(2) and SU(1,1) coherent states, and tripartite GHZ and W states.</description>

      <title>Time-asymptotic stability of composite waves of degenerate Oleinik shock and rarefaction for non-convex conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the large-time behavior of the solution to one-dimensional (1D) cubic non-convex scalar viscous conservation laws. Due to the inflection point of the cubic non-convex flux, the solution to the corresponding inviscid Riemann problem can be the composite wave of a degenerate Oleinik shock and a rarefaction wave and these two nonlinear waves are always attached together. We give a first proof of the time-asymptotic stability of this composite wave, up to a time-dependent shift to the viscous Oleinik shock, for the viscous equation. The Oleinik shock wave strength can be arbitrarily large. The main difficulty is due to the incompatibility of the time-asymptotic stability proof framework of individual viscous shock by the so-called anti-derivative method and the direct $L^2$-energy method to rarefaction wave. Here we develop a new type of $a$-contraction method with suitable weight function and the time-dependent shift to the viscous shock, which is motivated by [9,12]. Another difficulty comes from that the Oleinik shock and rarefaction wave are always attached together and their wave interactions are very subtle. Therefore, the same time-dependent shift needs to be equipped to both Oleinik shock and rarefaction wave such that the wave interactions can be treated in our stability proof. Time-asymptotically, this shift function grows strictly sub-linear with respect to the time and then the shifted rarefaction wave is equivalent to the original self-similar rarefaction wave.</description>

      <title>Linear stability analysis of a vertical liquid film over a moving substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stability of liquid film flows are important in many industrial applications. In the dip-coating process, a liquid film is formed over a substrate extracted at a constant speed from a liquid bath. We studied the linear stability of this film considering different thicknesses $\hat{h}$ for four liquids, spanning a large range of Kapitza numbers ($\rm Ka$). By solving the Orr-Sommerfeld eigenvalue problem with the Chebyshev-Tau spectral method, we calculated the neutral curves, investigated the instability mechanism and computed the absolute/convective threshold. The instability mechanism was studied through the analysis of vorticity distribution and the kinetic energy balance of the perturbations. It was found that liquids with low $\rm Ka$ (e.g. corn oil, $\text{Ka}$ = 4) have a smaller area of stability than a liquid at high $\rm Ka$ (e.g. Liquid Zinc, $\rm Ka$ = 11525). Surface tension has both a stabilizing and a destabilizing effect, especially for large $\rm Ka$. For long waves, it curves the vorticity lines near the substrate, reducing the flow under the crests. For short waves, it fosters vorticity production at the interface and creates a region of intense vorticity near the substrate. In addition, we discovered that the surface tension contributes to both the production and dissipation of perturbation's energy depending on the $\rm Ka$ number. In terms of absolute/convective threshold, we found a window of absolute instability in the $\text{Re}-\hat{h}$ space, showing that the Landau-Levich-Derjaguin solution ($\hat{h}=0.945 \text{Re}^{1/9}\text{Ka}^{-1/6}$) is always convectively unstable. Moreover, we show that for $\text{Ka}&lt;17$, the Derjaguin's solution ($\hat{h}=1$) is always convectively unstable.</description>

Abstract: For different cohomology theories (including the Hochschild homology, Hodge cohomology, and Chow groups), we identify the cohomology of moduli space of rank 1 perverse coherent sheaves on the blow-up of a surface by Nakajima-Yoshioka as the tensor product of cohomology of Hilbert schemes with a Fermionic Fock space. As the stable limit, we identify the cohomology of Hilbert schemes of blow-up of a surface as the tensor product of cohomology of Hilbert schemes on the surface with a Bosonic Fock space. The actions of the infinite-dimensional Clifford algebra and Heisenberg algebra are all given by geometric correspondences.</description>

      <title>Quantum obesity and steering ellipsoids for fermionic fields in Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger dilation spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06869v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates quantum obesity (QO), quantum discord (QD), and the quantum steering ellipsoid (QSE) for bipartite Gisin states subjected to Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilation of spacetime on the second qubit. These three quantifiers are introduced to characterize quantum correlations beyond entanglement and can also function as entanglement witnesses. Our results demonstrate a monotonic decrease in the physical accessibility of both QD and QO as the dilation parameter increases within the region-I of the second qubit. Conversely, in the anti-particle region, the accessibility of QD and QO stabilizes at finite values of the dilation parameter owing to the influence of the Pauli exclusion principle and Fermi-Dirac statistics, subsequently increasing gradually. Notably, the QSE in the region-I expands as the Dirac field frequency rises and the dilation parameter diminishes, while the opposite trend is observed in the anti-particle region.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the initial-boundary value problem to the three-dimensional primitive equations for the oceanic and atmospheric dynamics with only horizontal eddy viscosities in the horizontal momentum equations and only vertical diffusivity in the temperature equation in the domain $\Omega=M\times(-h,h)$, with $M=(0,1)\times(0,1)$. Global well-posedness of strong solutions is established, for any initial data $(v_0,T_0) \in H^1(\Omega)\cap L^\infty(\Omega)$ with $(\partial_z v_0, \nabla_H T_0) \in L^q(\Omega)$ and $v_0 \in L_z^1(B^1_{q,2}(M))$, for some $q \in (2,\infty)$, by using delicate energy estimates and maximal regularity estimate in the anisotropic setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a family of algebras, twisted Yangians (of simply-laced quasi-split type) in Drinfeld type current generators and defining relations. These new algebras admit PBW type bases and are shown to be a deformation of twisted current algebras. For all quasi-split type excluding the even rank case in type AIII, we show that the twisted Yangians can be realized via a degeneration on the Drinfeld type presentation of affine $\imath$quantum groups. For both even and odd rank cases in type AIII, we use the Gauss decomposition method to show that these new algebras are isomorphic to Molev-Ragoucy's reflection algebras defined in the R-matrix presentation.</description>

Abstract: Despite the central importance of quantum entanglement in fueling many quantum technologies, the understanding of the optimal ways to exploit it is still beyond our reach, and even measuring entanglement in an operationally meaningful way is prohibitively difficult. This is due to the need to precisely characterise many-copy, asymptotic protocols for entanglement processing. Here we overcome these issues by introducing a new way of benchmarking the fundamental protocol of entanglement distillation (purification), where instead of measuring its asymptotic yield, we focus on the best achievable error. We connect this formulation of the task with an information-theoretic problem in composite quantum hypothesis testing known as generalised Sanov's theorem. By solving the latter problem -- which had no previously known solution even in classical information theory -- we thus compute the optimal asymptotic error exponent of entanglement distillation. We show this asymptotic solution to be given by the reverse relative entropy of entanglement, a single-letter quantity that can be evaluated using only a single copy of a quantum state, which is a unique feature among operational measures of entanglement. Altogether, we thus demonstrate a measure of entanglement that admits a direct operational interpretation as the optimal asymptotic rate of an important entanglement manipulation protocol while enjoying an exact, single-letter formula.</description>

      <title>Circle Foliations Revisited: Periods of Flows whose Orbits are all Closed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our purpose here is to adapt the results of Geodesic circle foliations for Reeb flows or Hamiltonian flows on contact manifolds. Consequently, all periods are exactly the same if the contact manifold is connected and all orbits on the contact manifold are closed. We also present concrete examples of periodic flows, all of whose orbits are closed, such as Harmonic oscillators, Lotka-Volterra systems, and others. Lotka-Volterra systems, Reeb flows, and some geodesic flows have non-trivial periods, whereas the periods of Harmonic oscillators and similar systems can be easily obtained through direct calculations. As an application to quantum mechanics, we examine the spectrum of semiclassical Shr\"odinger operators. Then we have one of the semiclassical analogies of the Helton-Guillemin theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2008.04458v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a simple recursion formula for the Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces with boundaries. This formula demonstrates the polynomiality of the volume functions. By constructing the Laplace transform for both the original and our alternative formulas, we show that they are directly equivalent. By considering the top and lowest degree terms of these formulas, we recover the DVV identity and cohomology class identities for $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$. Similar conclusions are drawn for the super-analog of these results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03600v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to the algebras $A\subset B(H)$ that the linear operators $T:H\to H$ can form, once a complex Hilbert space $H$ is given. Motivated by quantum mechanics, we are mainly interested in the von Neumann algebras, which are stable under taking adjoints, $T\to T^*$, and are weakly closed. When the algebra has a trace $tr:A\to\mathbb C$, we can think of it as being of the form $A=L^\infty(X)$, with $X$ being a quantum measured space. Of particular interest is the free case, where the center of the algebra reduces to the scalars, $Z(A)=\mathbb C$. Following von Neumann, Connes, Jones, Voiculescu and others, we discuss the basic properties of such algebras $A$, and how to do algebra, geometry, analysis and probability on the underlying quantum spaces $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Hardy inequalities for antisymmetric functions in three different settings: euclidean space, torus and the integer lattice. In particular, we show that under the antisymmetric condition the sharp constant in Hardy inequality increases substantially and grows as d^4 as d \rightarrow \infty in all cases. As a side product, we prove Hardy inequality on a domain whose boundary forms a corner at the point of singularity x=0.</description>

      <title>Operator formalism for discretely holomorphic parafermions of the two-color Ashkin-Teller, loop $\mathrm{O} ( 1 )$, staggered eight-vertex, odd eight-vertex, and abelian sandpile models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend an operator formalism, developed by Hongler, Kyt\"ol\"a, and Zahabi in 2012 for the Ising model, to the Ashkin-Teller and loop $\mathrm{O} ( n ) $ models. The formalism is primarily dependent upon notions of massive, and massless, s-holomorphicity of the Ising model, which are respectively satisfied at, and below, the critical temperature, hence allowing for rigorous analyses of the transfer matrix, correlation functions, and lattice fermion operators. From results of another paper, by Tanhayi-Ahari and Rouhani in 2012, which demonstrates that parafermionic observables for the staggered eight-vertex model coincide with those of the Ashkin-Teller model, as well as a 2003 paper, by Wu and Kunz, which establishes a correspondence between the staggered eight-vertex and odd eight-vertex models, we establish further associations.</description>

      <title>One-sweep moment-based semi-implicit-explicit integration for gray thermal radiation transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal radiation transport (TRT) is a time dependent, high dimensional partial integro-differential equation. In practical applications such as inertial confinement fusion, TRT is coupled to other physics such as hydrodynamics, plasmas, etc., and the timescales one is interested in capturing are often much slower than the radiation timescale. As a result, TRT is treated implicitly, and due to its stiffness and high dimensionality, is often a dominant computational cost in multiphysics simulations. Here we develop a new approach for implicit-explicit (IMEX) integration of gray TRT in the deterministic S$_N$ setting, which requires only one sweep per stage, with the simplest first-order method requiring only one sweep per time step. The partitioning of equations is done via a moment-based high-order low-order formulation of TRT, where the streaming operator and first two moments are used to capture the asymptotic stiff regimes of the streaming limit and diffusion limit. Absorption-reemission is treated explicitly, and although stiff, is sufficiently damped by the implicit solve that we achieve stable accurate time integration without incorporating the coupling of the high order and low order equations implicitly. Due to nonlinear coupling of the high-order and low-order equations through temperature-dependent opacities, to facilitate IMEX partitioning and higher-order methods, we use a semi-implicit integration approach amenable to nonlinear partitions. Results are demonstrated on thick Marshak and crooked pipe benchmark problems, demonstrating orders of magnitude improvement in accuracy and wallclock compared with the standard first-order implicit integration typically used.</description>

      <title>Fate of $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time in non-relativistic (Galilean) and ultra-relativistic (Carrollian) regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we present an algebraic and kinematical analysis of non-commutative $\kappa$-Minkowski spaces within Galilean (non-relativistic) and Carrollian (ultra-relativistic) regimes. Utilizing the theory of Wigner-In\"{o}nu contractions, we begin with a brief review of how one can apply these contractions to the well-known Poincar\'{e} algebra, yielding the corresponding Galilean (both massive and mass-less) and Carrollian algebras as $c \to \infty$ and $c\to 0$, respectively. Subsequently, we methodically apply these contractions to non-commutative $\kappa$-deformed spaces, revealing compelling insights into the interplay among the non-commutative parameters $a^\mu$ (with $|a^\nu|$ being of the order of Planck length scale) and the speed of light $c$ as it approaches both infinity and zero. Our exploration predicts a sort of ``branching" of the non-commutative parameters $a^\mu$, leading to the emergence of a novel length scale and time scale in either limit. Furthermore, our investigation extends to the examination of curved momentum spaces and their geodesic distances in appropriate subspaces of the $\kappa$-deformed Newtonian and Carrollian space-times. We finally delve into the study of their deformed dispersion relations, arising from these deformed geodesic distances, providing a comprehensive understanding of the nature of these space-times.</description>

Abstract: We consider the 2-spin spherical Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model without external magnetic field where the interactions between the spins are given as random variables with heavy-tailed distribution. We show that the free energy exhibits a sharp phase transition depending on the location of the largest eigenvalue of the interaction matrix. We also prove the order of the limiting free energy and the limiting distribution of the fluctuation of the free energy for both regimes.</description>

      <title>Non-supersymmetric heterotic strings and chiral CFTs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-supersymmetric heterotic strings share various properties with their supersymmetric counterparts. Torus compactifications of the latter live in a component of the moduli space of string vacua with 16 supercharges, and various asymmetric orbifolds thereof realize vacua in other components, exhibiting qualitative differences such as rank reduction. We set out to study the analogous problem for non-supersymmetric heterotic strings, framing it in relation to chiral fermionic CFTs with central charge 24, which were classified recently. We find that for the case analogous to the so-called CHL string, which has gauge group rank reduced by 8, there are in total four non-supersymmetric versions. These include the well known $E_8$ string and three other constructions a la CHL, which can be distinguished qualitatively by how tachyons appear in their classical moduli spaces. We also discuss the classification problem for lower rank theories and the relationship between MSDS models and Scherk-Schwarz reductions.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian integral that counts regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent article J. Phys. Compl. 4 (2023) 035005, Kawamoto evoked statistical physics methods for the problem of counting graphs with a prescribed degree sequence. This treatment involved truncating a particular Taylor expansion at the first two terms, which resulted in the Bender-Canfield estimate for the graph counts. This is surprisingly successful since the Bender-Canfield formula is asymptotically accurate for large graphs, while the series truncation does not a priori suggest a similar level of accuracy.
  We upgrade the above treatment in three directions. First, we derive an exact formula for counting d-regular graphs in terms of a d-dimensional Gaussian integral. Second, we show how to convert this formula into an integral representation for the generating function of d-regular graph counts. Third, we perform explicit saddle point analysis for large graph sizes and identify the saddle point configurations responsible for graph count estimates. In these saddle point configurations, only two of the integration variables condense to significant values, while the remaining ones approach zero for large graphs. This provides an underlying picture that justifies Kawamoto's earlier findings.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, Lie symmetry analysis method is applied to the (2+1)-dimensional time fractional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation with the mixed derivative of Riemann-Liouville time-fractional derivative and integer-order $x$-derivative. We obtained all the Lie symmetries admitted by the KP equation and used them to reduce the (2+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equation with Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative to some (1+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equations with Erd\'{e}lyi-Kober fractional derivative or Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, thereby getting some exact solutions of the reduced equations. In addition, the new conservation theorem and the generalization of Noether operators are developed to construct the conservation laws for the equation studied.</description>

      <title>Polyadic Cantor potential of minimum lacunarity: Special case of super periodic generalized unified Cantor potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To bridge the fractal and non-fractal potentials we introduce the concept of generalized unified Cantor potential (GUCP) with the key parameter $N$ which represents the potential count at the stage $S=1$. This system is characterized by total span $L$, stages $S$, scaling parameter $\rho$ and two real numbers $\mu$ and $\nu$. Notably, the polyadic Cantor potential (PCP) system with minimal lacunarity is a specific instance within the GUCP paradigm. Employing the super periodic potential (SPP) formalism, we formulated a closed-form expression for transmission probability $T_{S}(k, N)$ using the $q$-Pochhammer symbol and investigated the features of non-relativistic quantum tunneling through this potential configuration. We show that GUCP system exhibits sharp transmission resonances, differing from traditional quantum systems. Our analysis reveals saturation in the transmission profile with evolving stages $S$ and establishes a significant scaling relationship between reflection probability and wave vector $k$ through analytical derivations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of the interplay between T-duality and classical stress tensor deformations in two-dimensional sigma models. We first show that a general Abelian T-duality commutes with the $T \overline{T}$ deformation, which can be engineered by a gravitational dressing. Then, by using an auxiliary field formulation of stress tensor deformations of the principal chiral model (PCM), we prove that non-Abelian T-duality and arbitrary $T \overline{T}$-like flows also commute for theories in this class. We argue that all such auxiliary field deformations of both the PCM and its T-dual are classically integrable.</description>

      <title>Weyl Calculus and Exactly Solvable Schr\"{o}dinger Bridges with Quadratic State Cost</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15245v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger bridge--a stochastic dynamical generalization of optimal mass transport--exhibits a learning-control duality. Viewed as a stochastic control problem, the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge finds an optimal control policy that steers a given joint state statistics to another while minimizing the total control effort subject to controlled diffusion and deadline constraints. Viewed as a stochastic learning problem, the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge finds the most-likely distribution-valued trajectory connecting endpoint distributional observations, i.e., solves the two point boundary-constrained maximum likelihood problem over the manifold of probability distributions. Recent works have shown that solving the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem with state cost requires finding the Markov kernel associated with a reaction-diffusion PDE where the state cost appears as a state-dependent reaction rate. We explain how ideas from Weyl calculus in quantum mechanics, specifically the Weyl operator and the Weyl symbol, can help determine such Markov kernels. We illustrate these ideas by explicitly finding the Markov kernel for the case of quadratic state cost via Weyl calculus, recovering our earlier results but avoiding tedious computation with Hermite polynomials.</description>

Abstract: We develop a systematic framework for understanding symmetries in topological phases in 2+1 dimensions using the string-net model, encompassing both gauge symmetries that preserve anyon species and global symmetries permuting anyon species, including both invertible symmetries describable by groups and noninvertible symmetries described by categories. As an archetypal example, we reveal the first noninvertible categorical gauge symmetry of topological orders in 2+1 dimensions: the Fibonacci gauge symmetry of the doubled Fibonacci topological order, described by the Fibonacci fusion 2-category. Our approach involves two steps: first, establishing duality between different string-net models with Morita equivalent input fusion categories that describe the same topological order; and second, constructing symmetry transformations within the same string-net model when the dual models have isomorphic input fusion categories, achieved by composing duality maps with isomorphisms of degrees of freedom between the dual models.</description>

Abstract: The analysis conducted by Rymarz and DiVincenzo (Phys. Rev. X 13, 021017 (2023)) regarding quantization of superconducting circuits is insufficient to justify their general conclusions, most importantly the need to discard Kirchhoff's laws to effect variable reductions. Amongst a variety of reasons, one source of several disagreements with experimental and theoretical results is the long-standing dispute between extended vs compact variables in the presence of Josephson junctions.</description>
