      <title>Innate behavioural mechanisms and defensive traits in ecological models of predator-prey types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are various examples of phenotypic plasticity in ecosystems that serve as the basis for a wide range of inducible defences against predation. These strategies include camouflage, burrowing, mimicry, evasive actions, and even counterattacks that enhance survival under fluctuating predatory threats. Additionally, the ability to exhibit plastic responses often influences ecological balances, shaping predator-prey coexistence over time. This study introduces a predator-prey model where prey species show inducible defences, providing new insights into the role of adaptive strategies in these complex interactions. The stabilizing impact of the defensive mechanism is one of several intriguing outcomes produced by the dynamics. Moreover, the predator population rises when the interference rate increases to a moderate value even in the presence of lower prey defence but decreases monotonically for stronger defence levels. Furthermore, we identify a bistable domain when the handling rate is used as a control parameter, emphasizing the critical role of initial population sizes in determining system outcomes. By considering the species diffusion in a bounded region, the study is expanded into a spatio-temporal model. The numerical simulation reveals that the Turing domain decreases as the level of protection increases. The study is subsequently extended to incorporate taxis, known as the directed movement of species toward or away from another species. Our investigation identifies the conditions under which pattern formation emerges, driven by the interplay of inducible defences, taxis as well as species diffusion. Numerical simulations demonstrate that including taxis within the spatio-temporal model exerts a stabilizing influence, thereby diminishing the potential for pattern formation in the system.</description>

      <title>Estimating invasive rodent abundance using removal data and hierarchical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Invasive rodents pose significant ecological, economic, and public health challenges. Robust methods are needed for estimating population abundance to guide effective management. Traditional methods such as capture-recapture are often impractical for invasive species due to ethical and logistical constraints. Here, I showcase the application of hierarchical multinomial N-mixture models for estimating the abundance of invasive rodents using removal data. First, I perform a simulation study which demonstrates minimal bias in abundance estimates across a range of sampling scenarios. Second, I analyze removal data for two invasive rodent species, namely coypus (Myocastor coypus) in France and muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) in the Netherlands. Using hierarchical multinomial N-mixture models, I examine the effects of temperature on abundance while accounting for imperfect and time-varying capture probabilities. I also show how to accommodate spatial variability using random effects, and quantify uncertainty in parameter estimates. Overall, I hope to demonstrate the flexibility and utility of hierarchical models in invasive species management.</description>

      <title>Slow spatial migration can help eradicate cooperative antimicrobial resistance in time-varying environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat and combating its spread is of paramount importance. AMR often results from a cooperative behaviour with shared protection against drugs. Microbial communities generally evolve in volatile environments and spatial structures. Migration, fluctuations, and environmental variability thus have significant impacts on AMR, whose maintenance in static environments is generally promoted by migration. Here, we demonstrate that this picture changes dramatically in time-fluctuating spatially structured environments. To this end, we consider a two-dimensional metapopulation model consisting of demes in which drug-resistant and sensitive cells evolve in a time-changing environment in the presence of a toxin against which protection can be shared. Cells migrate between neighbouring demes and hence connect them. When the environment varies neither too quickly nor too slowly, the dynamics is characterised by bottlenecks causing fluctuation-driven local extinctions, a mechanism countered by migration that rescues AMR. Through simulations and mathematical analysis, we investigate how migration and environmental variability influence the probability of resistance eradication. We determine the near-optimal conditions for the fluctuation-driven AMR eradication, and show that slow but non-zero migration speeds up the clearance of resistance and can enhance its eradication probability. We discuss our study's impact on laboratory-controlled experiments.</description>

      <title>Adaptive ratchets and the evolution of molecular complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.09981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological systems have evolved to amazingly complex states, yet we do not understand in general how evolution operates to generate increasing genetic and functional complexity. Molecular recognition sites are short genome segments or peptides binding a cognate recognition target of sufficient sequence similarity. Such sites are simple, ubiquitous modules of sequence information, cellular function, and evolution. Here we show that recognition sites, if coupled to a time-dependent target, can rapidly evolve to complex states with larger code length and smaller coding density than sites recognising a static target. The underlying fitness model contains selection for recognition, which depends on the sequence similarity between site and target, and a uniform cost per unit of code length. Site sequences are shown to evolve in a specific adaptive ratchet, which produces selection of different strength for code extensions and compressions. Ratchet evolution increases the adaptive width of evolved sites, accelerating the adaptation to moving targets and facilitating refinement and innovation of recognition functions. We apply these results to the recognition of fast-evolving antigens by the human immune system. Our analysis shows how molecular complexity can evolve as a collateral to selection for function in a dynamic environment.</description>

      <title>Triple equivalence for the emergence of biological intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04928v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterising the intelligence of biological organisms is challenging. This work considers intelligent algorithms developed evolutionarily within neural systems. Mathematical analyses unveil a natural equivalence between canonical neural networks, variational Bayesian inference under a class of partially observable Markov decision processes, and differentiable Turing machines, by showing that they minimise the shared Helmholtz energy. Consequently, canonical neural networks can biologically plausibly equip Turing machines and conduct variational Bayesian inferences of external Turing machines in the environment. Applying Helmholtz energy minimisation at the species level facilitates deriving active Bayesian model selection inherent in natural selection, resulting in the emergence of adaptive algorithms. In particular, canonical neural networks with two mental actions can separately memorise transition mappings of multiple external Turing machines to form a universal machine. These propositions were corroborated by numerical simulations of algorithm implementation and neural network evolution. These notions offer a universal characterisation of biological intelligence emerging from evolution in terms of Bayesian model selection and belief updating.</description>
