      <title>Building a continuous benchmarking ecosystem in bioinformatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarking, which involves collecting reference datasets and demonstrating method performances, is a requirement for the development of new computational tools, but also becomes a domain of its own to achieve neutral comparisons of methods. Although a lot has been written about how to design and conduct benchmark studies, this Perspective sheds light on a wish list for a computational platform to orchestrate benchmark studies. We discuss various ideas for organizing reproducible software environments, formally defining benchmarks, orchestrating standardized workflows, and how they interface with computing infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Measures and Models of Brain-Heart Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of brain-heart interactions within various paradigms, including affective computing, human-computer interfaces, and sensorimotor evaluation, stands as a significant milestone in biomarker development and neuroscientific research. A range of techniques, spanning from molecular to behavioral approaches, has been proposed to measure these interactions. Different frameworks use signal processing techniques, from the estimation of brain responses to individual heartbeats to higher-order dynamics linking cardiac inputs to changes in brain organization. This review provides an overview to the most notable signal processing strategies currently used for measuring and modeling brain-heart interactions. It discusses their usability and highlights the main challenges that need to be addressed for future methodological developments. Current methodologies have deepened our understanding of the impact of neural disruptions on brain-heart interactions, solidifying it as a biomarker for evaluation of the physiological state of the nervous system and holding immense potential for disease stratification. The vast outlook of these methods becomes apparent specially in neurological and psychiatric disorders. As we tackle new methodological challenges, gaining a more profound understanding of how these interactions operate, we anticipate further insights into the role of peripheral neurons and the environmental input from the rest of the body in shaping brain functioning.</description>

      <title>Data-centric challenges with the application and adoption of artificial intelligence for drug discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05150v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) is exhibiting tremendous potential to reduce the massive costs and long timescales of drug discovery. There are however important challenges currently limiting the impact and scope of AI models.
  Areas covered: In this perspective, the authors discuss a range of data issues (bias, inconsistency, skewness, irrelevance, small size, high dimensionality), how they challenge AI models, and which issue-specific mitigations have been effective. Next, they point out the challenges faced by uncertainty quantification techniques aimed at enhancing and trusting the predictions from these AI models. They also discuss how conceptual errors, unrealistic benchmarks and performance misestimation can confound the evaluation of models and thus their development. Lastly, the authors explain how human bias, whether from AI experts or drug discovery experts, constitutes another challenge that can be alleviated by gaining more prospective experience.
  Expert opinion: AI models are often developed to excel on retrospective benchmarks unlikely to anticipate their prospective performance. As a result, only a few of these models are ever reported to have prospective value (e.g. by discovering potent and innovative drug leads for a therapeutic target). The authors have discussed what can go wrong in practice with AI for drug discovery. We hope that this will help inform the decisions of editors, funders investors and researchers working in this area.</description>
