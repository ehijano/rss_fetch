      <title>Asymptotics of $L^r$ extremal polynomials for ${0&lt;r\leq\infty}$ on $C^{1+}$ Jordan regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study strong asymptotics of $L^r$-extremal polynomials for measures supported on Jordan regions with $C^{1+}$ boundary for $0&lt;r&lt;\infty$. Using the results for $r=2$, we derive asymptotics of weighted Chebyshev and residual polynomials for upper-semicontinuous weights supported on a $C^{1+}$ Jordan region corresponding to $r=\infty$. As an application, we show how strong asymptotics for extremal polynomials in the Ahlfors problem on a $C^{1+}$ Jordan region can be obtained from that for the weighted residual polynomials. Based on the results we pose a conjecture for asymptotics of weighted Chebyshev and residual polynomials for a $C^{1+}$ arc.</description>

      <title>Volume estimates for unions of convex sets, and the Kakeya set conjecture in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sets of $\delta$ tubes in $\mathbb{R}^3$, with the property that not too many tubes can be contained inside a common convex set $V$. We show that the union of tubes from such a set must have almost maximal volume. As a consequence, we prove that every Kakeya set in $\mathbb{R}^3$ has Minkowski and Hausdorff dimension 3.</description>

      <title>The fractional Riesz transform and their commutator in Dunkl setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the boundedness of the fractional Riesz transforms in the Dunkl setting. Moreover, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for the boundedness of their commutator with respect to the central BMO space associated with Euclidean metric and the BMO space associated with Dunkl metric, respectively. Based on this, we further characterize the compactness of the commutator in terms of the corresponding types of VMO spaces.</description>

      <title>The Fourier transform in Lebesgue spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each $f\in L^p({\mathbb R)}$ ($1\leq p&lt;\infty$) it is shown that the Fourier transform is the distributional derivative of a H\"older continuous function. For each $p$ a norm is defined so that the space Fourier transforms is isometrically isomorphic to $L^p({\mathbb R)}$. There is an exchange theorem and inversion in norm.</description>

      <title>On Bureau's classification of quadratic differential equations in two variables free of movable critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As part of the efforts aimed at extending Painlev\'e and Gambier's work on second-order equations in one variable to first-order ones in two, in 1981, Bureau classified the systems of ordinary quadratic differential equations in two variables which are free of movable critical points (which have the Painlev\'e Property). We revisit this classification, which we complete by adding some cases overlooked by Bureau, and by correcting some of his arguments. We also simplify the canonical forms of some systems, bring the natural symmetries of others into their study, and investigate the birational equivalence among some of the systems in the class. Lastly, we study the birational geometry of Okamoto's space of initial conditions for Bureau's system VIII, in order to establish the sufficiency of some necessary conditions for the absence of movable critical points.</description>

      <title>The adaptation property in non-equilibrium chemical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to understand if the property of adaptation, which is a typical property of many biochemical systems, can be achieved only by biological systems that actively consume energy or if it can be achieved also by passive systems.
  We prove that, unless the conserved quantities of a signalling system satisfy a very specific factorization assumption, adaptation cannot be achieved in a robust manner (i.e. in a stable manner under perturbations of the chemical reaction rates) by systems that satisfy the detailed balance property, hence that are passive, and that do not exchange substances or energy with the environment.
  We also prove that robust adaptation can be achieved by systems that satisfy the detailed balance property, but exchange substances with the environment.</description>
