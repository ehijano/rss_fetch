      <title>Limit Groups and Automorphisms of $\kappa$-Existentially Closed Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of automorphism groups of $\kappa$-existentially closed groups are studied
  by Kaya-Kuzucuo\u{g}lu in 2022.
  It was proved that Aut(G) is the union of subgroups of level preserving automorphisms and $|Aut(G)|=2^\kappa$
  whenever $\kappa$ is an inaccessible cardinal and $G$ is the unique
  $\kappa$-existentially closed group of
  cardinality $\kappa$. The cardinality of the automorphism group of a $\kappa$-existentially
  closed group of cardinality $\lambda&gt;\kappa$ is asked in Kourovka Notebook Question 20.40.
  Here we answer positively the promised case $\kappa=\lambda$ namely:
  If $G$ is a $\kappa$-existentially closed group of cardinality $\kappa$,
  then $|Aut(G)|=2^{\kappa}$. We also answer Kegel's question
  on universal groups, namely: For any uncountable cardinal $\kappa$,
  there exist universal groups of cardinality $\kappa$.</description>

      <title>There is a deep 1-generic set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An infinite binary sequence is Bennett deep if, for any computable time bound, the difference between the time-bounded prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity and the prefix-free Kolmogorov complexity of its initial segments is eventually unbounded. It is known that weakly 2-generic sets are shallow, i.e. not deep. In this paper, we show that there is a deep 1-generic set.</description>

      <title>Arithmetical completeness for some extensions of the pure logic of necessitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the arithmetical completeness theorems of some extensions of Fitting, Marek, and Truszczy\'{n}ski's pure logic of necessitation $\mathbf{N}$. For $m,n \in \omega$, let $\mathbf{N}^+ \mathbf{A}_{m,n}$, which was introduced by Kurahashi and Sato, be the logic obtained from $\mathbf{N}$ by adding the axiom scheme $\Box^n A \to \Box^m A$ and the rule $\dfrac{\neg \Box A}{\neg \Box \Box A}$. In this paper, among other things, we prove that for each $m,n \geq 1$, the logic $\mathbf{N}^+ \mathbf{A}_{m,n}$ becomes a provability logic.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of infinite algebraic extensions of $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on work of J. Robinson and A. Shlapentokh, we develop a general framework to obtain definability and decidability results of large classes of infinite algebraic extensions of $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$. As an application, we show that for every odd rational prime $p$ there exist infinitely many primes $r$ such that the fields $\mathbb{F}_{p^a}\left(t^{r^{-\infty}}\right)$ have undecidable first-order theory in the language of rings without parameters. Our method uses character theory to construct families of non-isotrivial elliptic curves whose Mordell-Weil group is finitely generated and of positive rank in $\mathbb{Z}_r$-towers.</description>

      <title>Internality of autonomous algebraic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is interested in internality to the constants of systems of autonomous algebraic ordinary differential equations. Roughly, this means determining when can all solutions of such a system be written as a rational function of finitely many fixed solutions (and their derivatives) and finitely many constants. If the system is a single order one equation, the answer was given in an old article of Rosenlicht. In the present work, we completely answer this question for a large class of systems. As a corollary, we obtain a necessary condition for the generic solution to be Liouvillian. We then apply these results to determine exactly when solutions to Poizat equations (a special case of Li\'enard equations) are internal, answering a question of Freitag, Jaoui, Marker and Nagloo, and to the classic Lotka-Volterra system, showing that its generic solutions are almost never Liouvillian.</description>

      <title>Relating homotopy equivalences to conservativity in dependendent type theories with propositional computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a conservativity result for extensional type theories over propositional ones, i.e. dependent type theories with propositional computation rules, using insights from homotopy type theory. The argument exploits a notion of canonical homotopy equivalence between contexts, and uses the notion of a category with attributes to phrase the semantics of theories of dependent types. Informally, our main result asserts that, for judgements essentially concerning h-sets, reasoning with extensional or propositional type theories is equivalent.</description>

      <title>$\widetilde{\mid}\hspace{1mm}$-divisibility of ultrafilters II: The big picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00101v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A divisibility relation on ultrafilters is defined as follows: ${\cal F}\hspace{1mm}\widetilde{\mid}\hspace{1mm}{\cal G}$ if and only if every set in $\cal F$ upward closed for divisibility also belongs to $\cal G$. After describing the first $\omega$ levels of this quasiorder, in this paper we generalize the process of determining the basic divisors of an ultrafilter. First we describe these basic divisors, obtained as (equivalence classes of) powers of prime ultrafilters. Using methods of nonstandard analysis we determine the pattern of an ultrafilter: the collection of its basic divisors as well as the multiplicity of each of them. All such patterns have a certain closure property in an appropriate topology. We isolate the family of sets belonging to every ultrafilter with a given pattern. We show that every pattern with the closure property is realized by an ultrafilter. Finally, we apply patterns to obtain an equivalent condition for an ultrafilter to be self-divisible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07893v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize Borel line graphs in terms of 10 forbidden induced subgraphs, namely the 9 finite graphs from the classical result of Beineke together with a 10th infinite graph associated to the equivalence relation $\mathbb{E}_0$ on the Cantor space. As a corollary, we prove a partial converse to the Feldman--Moore theorem, which allows us to characterize all locally countable Borel line graphs in terms of their Borel chromatic numbers.</description>

      <title>Universal Proof Theory: Semi-analytic Rules and Craig Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.06256</link>
      <description>arXiv:1808.06256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a general and syntactically-defined family of sequent calculi, called \emph{semi-analytic}, to formalize the informal notion of a "nice" sequent calculus. We show that any sufficiently strong (multimodal) substructural logic with a semi-analytic sequent calculus enjoys the Craig Interpolation Property, CIP. As a positive application, our theorem provides a uniform and modular method to prove the CIP for several multimodal substructural logics, including many fragments and variants of linear logic. More interestingly, on the negative side, it employs the lack of the CIP in almost all substructural, superintuitionistic and modal logics to provide a formal proof for the well-known intuition that almost all logics do not have a "nice" sequent calculus. More precisely, we show that many substructural logics including $\mathsf{UL^-}$, $\mathsf{MTL}$, $\mathsf{R}$, $\mathsf{L}_n$ (for $n \geq 3$), $\mathsf{G}_n$ (for $n \geq 4$), and almost all extensions of $\mathsf{IMTL}$, $\mathsf{L}$, $\mathsf{BL}$, $\mathsf{RM^e}$, $\mathsf{IPC}$, $\mathsf{S4}$, and $\mathsf{Grz}$, (except for at most 1, 1, 3, 8, 7, 37, and 6 of them, respectively) do not have a semi-analytic calculus.

      <title>First order complexity of finite random structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a sequence of random structures with $n$-element domains over a relational signature, we define its first order (FO) complexity as a certain subset in the Banach space $\ell^{\infty}/c_0$. The well-known FO zero-one law and FO convergence law correspond to FO complexities equal to $\{0,1\}$ and a subset of $\mathbb{R}$, respectively. We present a hierarchy of FO complexity classes, introduce a stochastic FO reduction that allows to transfer complexity results between different random structures, and deduce using this tool several new logical limit laws for binomial random structures. Finally, we introduce a conditional distribution on graphs, subject to a FO sentence $\varphi$, that generalises certain well-known random graph models, show instances of this distribution for every complexity class, and prove that the set of all $\varphi$ validating 0--1 law is not recursively enumerable.</description>

      <title>Analogs of Brooks' Theorem for coloring parameters of infinite graphs and Konig's Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past, analogies to Brooks' theorem have been found for various parameters of graph coloring for infinite locally finite connected graphs in ZFC. We prove these theorems are not provable in ZF (i.e. the Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory without the Axiom of Choice (AC)). Moreover, such theorems follow from Konig's Lemma (every infinite locally finite connected graph has a ray-a weak form of AC) in ZF. In ZF, we formulate new conditions for the existence of the distinguishing chromatic number, the distinguishing chromatic index, the total chromatic number, the total distinguishing chromatic number, the odd chromatic number, and the neighbor-distinguishing index in infinite locally finite connected graphs, which are equivalent to Konig's Lemma. In this direction, we strengthen a recent result of Stawiski from 2023.</description>
