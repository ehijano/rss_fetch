      <title>Lattice operations for the stable set in substitutable matching markets via re-equilibration dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the lattice operations for the (pairwise) stable set in two-sided matching markets where only substitutability on agents' choice functions is imposed. To do this, we use Tarski operators defined on the lattices of worker-quasi-stable and firm-quasi-stable matchings. These operators resemble lay-off and vacancy chain dynamics, respectively. First, we compute the lattice operations in the many-to-one model. Then, we extend these operations to a many-to-many model with substitutable choice functions on one side and responsive preferences on the other, via a morphism that relates many-to-one with many-to-many matchings in a natural way. Finally, we present the lattice operations in the many-to-many model with substitutable choice functions on both sides.</description>

      <title>Housing Bubbles with Phase Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11365v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze equilibrium housing prices in an overlapping generations model with perfect housing and rental markets. The economy exhibits a two-stage phase transition: as the income of home buyers rises, the equilibrium regime changes from fundamental to bubble possibility, where fundamental and bubbly equilibria can coexist. With even higher incomes, fundamental equilibria disappear and housing bubbles become a necessity. Even with low current incomes, housing bubbles may emerge if home buyers have access to credit or have high future income expectations. Contrary to widely-held beliefs, fundamental equilibria in the possibility regime are inefficient despite housing being a productive non-reproducible asset.</description>

      <title>Comparative Statics for Optimal Stopping Problems in Nonstationary Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do decisions change with the economic environment and with time? This paper studies general nonstationary stopping problems and provides the methodological tools to answer these questions. First, we identify conditions that ensure a monotone relation between decisions' timing and outcomes. These conditions apply to a prevalent class of economic environments. Second, we develop a theory of monotone comparative statics for stopping problems, offering general and unifying qualitative insights into the decision-maker's value and stopping behavior. We apply our results to models of information acquisition, bankruptcy, irreversible investment, and option pricing to explain documented patterns at odds with current theories.</description>

      <title>Two-Person Adversarial Games are Zero-Sum: An Elaboration of a Folk Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04029v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation that every two-person adversarial game is an affine transformation of a zero-sum game is traceable to Luce &amp; Raiffa (1957) and made explicit in Aumann (1987). Recent work of (ADP) Adler et al. (2009), and of Raimondo (2023) in increasing generality, proves what has so far remained a conjecture. We present two proofs of an even more general formulation: the first draws on multilinear utility theory developed by Fishburn &amp; Roberts (1978); the second is a consequence of the ADP proof itself for a special case of a two-player game with a set of three actions.</description>
