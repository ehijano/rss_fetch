      <title>A Quantum Approach for Optimal Transient Control in Network-Based Epidemic Models</title>

Abstract: Effective epidemic control is crucial for mitigating the spread of infectious diseases, particularly when pharmaceutical interventions such as vaccines or treatments are limited. Non-pharmaceutical strategies, including mobility restrictions, are key in reducing transmission rates but require careful optimization to balance public health benefits and socioeconomic costs. Quantum computing is emerging as a powerful tool for solving complex optimization problems that are intractable for classical methods and can thus be leveraged to handle mobility restrictions. This article presents a new approach to optimizing epidemic control strategies using quantum computing techniques. We focus on non-pharmaceutical interventions, particularly mobility restriction, modeled as a discrete-time network epidemic process based on the susceptible-infected-susceptible and susceptible-infected-removed frameworks. The control problem is formulated as a combinatorial optimization task, inherently NP-hard due to the binary nature of intervention decisions. To tackle this computational complexity, we derive a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization representation of the control problem, enabling its efficient solution via quantum computing resources. Our methodology is validated through numerical simulations on realistic case studies, showcasing the potential of quantum algorithms for enhancing epidemic control strategies. These findings pave the way for leveraging quantum optimization in broader applications of networked dynamical systems, demonstrating its viability for complex decision-making processes in public health management.</description>

      <title>Closing the complexity gap of the double distance problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01691</link>

Abstract: Genome rearrangement has been an active area of research in computational comparative genomics for the last three decades. While initially mostly an interesting algorithmic endeavor, now the practical application by applying rearrangement distance methods and more advanced phylogenetic tasks is becoming common practice, given the availability of many completely sequenced genomes. Several genome rearrangement models have been developed over time, sometimes with surprising computational properties. A prominent example is the fact that computing the reversal distance of two signed permutations is possible in linear time, while for two unsigned permutations it is NP-hard. Therefore one has always to be careful about the precise problem formulation and complexity analysis of rearrangement problems in order not to be fooled. The double distance is the minimum number of genomic rearrangements between a singular and a duplicated genome that, in addition to rearrangements, are separated by a whole genome duplication. At the same time it allows to assign the genes of the duplicated genome to the two paralogous chromosome copies that existed right after the duplication event. Computing the double distance is another example of a tricky hardness landscape: If the distance measure underlying the double distance is the simple breakpoint distance, the problem can be solved in linear time, while with the more elaborate DCJ distance it is NP-hard. Indeed, there is a family of distance measures, parameterized by an even number k, between the breakpoint distance (k=2) and the DCJ distance (k=\infty). Little was known about the hardness border between these extremes; the problem complexity was known only for k=4 and k=6. In this paper, we close the gap, providing a full picture of the hardness landscape when computing the double distance.</description>
