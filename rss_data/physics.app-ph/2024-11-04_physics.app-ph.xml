      <title>Seven-octave ultrabroadband metamaterial absorbers via Q-weighted mode density modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absorption is a crucial parameter in shaping wave propagation dynamics, yet achieving ultra-broadband absorption remains highly challenging, particularly in balancing low-frequency and broad bandwidth. Here, we present a metamaterial absorber (MMA) capable of achieving simultaneous spectral coverage across a seven-octave range of near-perfect absorption from 100 Hz to 12,800 Hz by engineering the quality-factor-weighted (Q-weighted) mode density. The Q-weighted mode density considers mode density, resonant frequencies, radiative loss, and intrinsic loss of multiple resonant modes, providing a comprehensive approach to govern broadband absorption properties. By optimizing the number of resonant modes and managing intrinsic losses, our approach achieves an intensive Q-weighted mode density across an ultra-wide bandwidth, enabling ultra-broadband absorption with high efficiency. These findings significantly advance the bandwidth capabilities of state-of-the-art MMAs and pave the way for the development of ultra-broadband metamaterial devices across various wave systems.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Coupled PT-symmetric Electronic Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the non-Hermitian characteristics of three-dimensional PT-symmetric coupled electronic resonators are theoretically analyzed. First, the concept of non-Hermitian PT symmetry is illustrated in the context of electronics using a pair of coupled electronic resonators. Two typical configurations of parallel-coupled PT-symmetric electronic trimers are then analyzed. The results indicate that, for the planar configuration, the system can exhibit two phase transitions as the coupling coefficient or gain-loss parameter changes, different from the linear configuration. By comparing system equations based on coupled-mode theory and circuit theory, it is shown that high dimensionality alone is not a sufficient condition for the existence of a higher-order exceptional point; an approximation condition is also required. A modified exceptional point is proposed, and the approximation conditions for the mean deviation $D$ for the real part of the three eigenfrequencies, satisfying $D \leq 1\%$ and $D \leq 0.1\%$, are discussed, respectively. The theoretical results presented in this paper not only reveal the unique non-Hermitian characteristics of high-dimensional PT-symmetric electronic systems but also offer theoretical support for wireless power transmission and wireless sensing technologies.</description>

      <title>Tuning electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ by stacking two layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benefiting from improved stability due to stronger interlayer van der Waals interactions, few-layer fullerene networks are experimentally more accessible compared to monolayer polymeric C$_{60}$. However, there is a lack of systematic theoretical studies on the material properties of few-layer C$_{60}$ networks. Here, we compare the structural, electronic and optical properties of bilayer and monolayer fullerene networks. The band gap and band-edge positions remain mostly unchanged after stacking two layers into a bilayer, enabling the bilayer to be almost as efficient a photocatalyst as the monolayer. The effective mass ratio along different directions is varied for conduction band states due to interlayer interactions,leading to enhanced anisotropy in carrier transport. Additionally, stronger exciton absorption is found in the bilayer than that in the monolayer over the entire visible light range, rendering the bilayer a more promising candidate for photovoltaics. Moreoever, the polarisation dependence of optical absorption in the bilayer is increased in the red-yellow light range, offering unique opportunities in photonics and display technologies with tailored optical properties over specific directions. Our study provides strategies to tune electronic and optical properties of 2D polymeric C$_{60}$ via the introduction of stacking degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>A Toffoli Gadget for Magnetic Tunnel Junctions Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs) are of great interest for non-conventional computing applications. The Toffoli gate is a universal reversible logic gate, enabling the construction of arbitrary boolean circuits. Here, we present a proof-of-concept construction of a gadget which encodes the Toffoli gate's truth table into the ground state of coupled uniaxial nanomagnets that could form the free layers of perpendicularly magnetized MTJs. This construction has three input bits, three output bits, and one ancilla bit. We numerically simulate the seven macrospins evolving under the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (s-LLG) equation. We investigate the effect of the anisotropy-to-exchange-coupling strength ratio $H_A/H_\text{ex}$ on the working of the gadget. We find that for $H_A/H_\text{ex} \lesssim 0.93$, the spins evolve to the Toffoli gate truth table configurations under LLG dynamics alone, while higher $H_A/H_\text{ex}$ ratios require thermal annealing due to suboptimal metastable states. Under our chosen annealing procedure, the s-LLG simulation with thermal annealing achieves a 100% success rate up to $H_A/H_\text{ex}\simeq3.0$. The feasibility of constructing MTJ-free-layer-based Toffoli gates highlights their potential in designing new types of MTJ-based circuits.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Phase-Matching Enabled by van der Waals Stacking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi-phase matching (QPM) is a technique extensively utilized in nonlinear optics for enhancing the efficiency and stability of frequency conversion processes. However, the conventional QPM relies on periodically poled ferroelectric crystals, which are limited in availability. The 3R phase of molybdenum disulfide (3R-MoS2), a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDc) with the broken inversion symmetry, stands out as a promising candidate for QPM, enabling efficient nonlinear process. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the QPM at nanoscale, utilizing van der Waals stacking of 3R-MoS2 layers with specific orientation to realize second harmonic generation (SHG) enhancement beyond the non QPM limit. We have also demonstrated enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) via QPM of 3R-MoS2 homo-structure, enabling more efficient generation of entangled photon pairs. The tunable capacity of 3R-MoS2 van der Waals stacking provides a platform for tuning phase-matching condition. This technique opens interesting possibilities for potential applications in nonlinear process and quantum technology.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Excitable Spiking Laser Neuron in InP Generic Integration Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-inspired, neuromorphic devices implemented in integrated photonic hardware have attracted significant interest recently as part of efforts towards novel non-von Neumann computing paradigms that make use of the low loss, high-speed and parallel operations in optics. An all-optical spiking laser neuron fabricated on the indium-phosphide generic integration technology platform may be a practical alternative to other semi-integrated photonic and electronic-based spiking neuron implementations. Owing to the large number of predefined building blocks, a plethora of applications have benefitted already from the generic integration process. This technology platform has now been utilised for the first time to demonstrate an all-optical spiking laser neuron. This paper present and discusses the design and measurement of the ultra-fast and rich spiking dynamics in these devices. We show that under external pulse injection and operated slightly below the lasing threshold, the laser neuron exhibits an excitable mode, in addition to a self-spiking mode far above the threshold when no pulse is injected. In the excitable mode, the required injected pulse energy is much lower than that of the generated excited response, meeting an important requirement for neuron cascadability. In addition, we investigate excitability at different injection wavelengths below the lasing wavelength, as well as the ultra-fast temporal properties of the spiking response. All of the discussed characteristics point to the laser neuron being an important candidate for scaling up to future fully-connected, multi-wavelength all-optical photonic spiking neural networks in indium-phosphide generic integration technology.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic suppression of anomalous Hall effect in Fe-rich kagome magnet Fe3Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Fe-based kagome magnets, Fe3Sn has been predicted to have the largest intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) and the highest Curie temperature TC = 743 K. However, the current experimental results show that the total AHC is much lower than the predicted value due to the strong extrinsic contribution. To suppress the extrinsic contribution and thus enhance the intrinsic contribution, we increased the Fe content in the stoichiometric Fe3Sn. We found that the extrinsic contribution is greatly suppressed, and the intrinsic contribution is dominant and is close to the theoretically predicted value of 555 S/cm over the whole temperature range. Based on the formula of the skew scattering, we analyzed the reason why the skew scattering is suppressed and found that the spin-orbit coupling strength provided by the impurity center is the key. The spin-orbit coupling strength provided by Fe as an impurity center in this study is much smaller than that of Sn as an impurity center in previous studies. Therefore, the AHC in Fe-rich Fe3Sn obeys the unified theory, while the AHC in Sn-rich Fe3Sn deviates from the unified theory. Our study provides a promising solution for the regulation of the extrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall effect in kagome magnets.</description>

      <title>Rapid cargo verification with cosmic ray muon scattering and absorption tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01020v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic ray muon tomography is considered a promising method for the non-invasive inspection of shipping containers and trucks. It utilizes highly penetrating cosmic-ray muons and their interactions with various materials to generate three-dimensional images of large and dense, like inter-modal shipping containers, typically not transparent with conventional X-ray radiography technique. The commonly used methods for imaging with muons are based on muon scattering or absorption-transmission data analysis. Due to large thickness of cargo material in shipping container substantial scattering and absorption occur when muons passing through cargo.
  One of the key tasks of customs and border security is to verify shipping container declarations to prevent illegal trafficking, and muon tomography could be a viable choice for this task. In this paper, we demonstrate through Monte Carlo simulations using the GEANT4 toolkit that a combined analysis of muon scattering and absorption data can improve the identification of cargo materials compared to using scattering or absorption data alone. The statistical differences in scattering and absorption data for several cargo materials are quantified. For a particular smuggling scenario where tobacco declared as paper towel rolls, it is demonstrated that the combined analysis can accurately distinguish between tobacco and paper towel rolls with 5.5$\sigma$ accuracy for detector spatial resolution (FWHM) of 0.235 mm, 4.5$\sigma$ for 1.175 mm resolution (FWHM), and 3.9$\sigma$ accuracy for 2.35 mm spatial resolution (FWHM), in a short scanning time of 10 seconds. This rapid detection capability has significant implications for anti-smuggling efforts and cargo inspection.</description>

      <title>Effective Magnetic Switching of THz Signal in Planar Structured Spintronic Emitters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21623v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate an efficient swithcable spintronic THz emission from a Co(2nm)/Pt(2nm) bilayer split into a grating of micro- or nanostripes in applied external magnetic field of the order of 10mT. The THz signal is effectively emitted if the samples are magnetized perpendicular to the stripes direction and decreases upon a 90-degree rotation of a sample. The maximal 27-fold ratio of amplitude change is achieved for the sample with a $2 \mu m$ width of stripes. For the samples with easy magnetization axis directed perpendicular to stripes the THz signal is linearly polarized in the direction of the stripes and abruptly switches during the sample re-magnetization process. If the easy axis is along the stripes the THz source is almost switched off in a zero magnetic field.</description>

      <title>A Study of Four-Switch Cross-Shaped RIS and A Novel Design Example</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the working principle of four-switch cross-shaped reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) in detail and reveals the different types of RIS that can be designed based on this structure. Combined with the design examples using this structure in the currently published articles, this paper summarizes and organizes them, and also points out several RIS solutions that have not been designed using this structure. Finally, based on this four-switch cross-shaped structure, this paper proposes a novel RIS design example that can realize the function switching of 1-bit ultra-wideband (UWB) and 2-bit narrowband, and conducts simulation verification. The simulation results show that by optimizing the element structure and controlling the states of the four switches, the 1-bit ultra-wideband function can achieve a frequency band coverage of 10.5GHz-19.8GHz and a 2-bit phase quantization function around 18.12GHz. At the same time, it can realize 60{\deg} two-dimensional beam scanning function. We call this novel design "bit reconfigurable metasurface".</description>

      <title>Acoustic Lateral Recoil Force and Stable Lift of Anisotropic Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06524v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acoustic forces and torques are of immense importance for manipulation of particles, in particular in biomedical applications. While such forces and torques are well understood for small spherical particles with lowest-order monopole and dipole responses, the higher-order effects for larger anisotropic particles have not been properly investigated. Here we examine the acoustic force and torque on an anisotropic (spheroid) particle and reveal two novel phenomena. First, we describe the lateral recoil force, orthogonal to the direction of the incident wave and determined by the tilted orientation of the particle. Second, we find conditions for the stable acoustic lift, where the balanced torque and force produce a stable lateral drift of the tilted particle. We argue that these phenomena can bring about new functionalities in acoustic manipulation and sorting of anisotropic particles including biological objects such as blood cells.</description>

      <title>Perfectly vertical silicon metamaterial grating couplers with large segmentation periods up to 650 nm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perfectly vertical grating couplers leveraging metamaterials can achieve both high coupling efficiency and minimal back reflection. The fabricability of these designs, with segmentations in both the longitudinal and transverse dimensions, hinges on the minimum feature size offered by cutting-edge fabrication technologies. In this work we present both numerical and experimental evidence that high performance devices can be obtained while using large transverse segmentation periods of up to 650 nm, thereby increasing the critical feature sizes. For single-step etched couplers produced on the 220 nm silicon-on-insulator platform, we demonstrate coupling efficiencies of nearly 50% in the C-band and remarkably low back reflections of -22 dB at zero-degree incidence angle. Notably, the duty cycles used in our optimized designs deviate significantly from those predicted by traditional effective medium models, even for small periods. Our findings promise to expand the range of optical properties achievable in metamaterials and offer fresh insights into the fine-tuning of nanophotonic devices.</description>

      <title>Giant Seebeck Effect in PEDOT Materials with Molecular Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Poly 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT) has been attracting attention as a thermoelectric material for room-temperature use due to its flexibility and non-toxicity. However, PEDOT reportedly generates insufficient thermoelectric power for practical use. This work tried to improve the Seebeck coefficient by introducing molecular strain to PEDOT molecules by loading a Polystyrene sulfonate (PSS)-free PEDOT on a Polyethyleneterephthalate (PET) fiber. Raman spectroscopy revealed the PEDOT materials with significant compression in the C{\alpha}-C{\alpha} bond and extension in the C{\alpha}=C\b{eta} bond exhibit Seebeck coefficients two orders of magnitude larger than usual. Furthermore, strain in the C\b{eta}-C\b{eta} bond strongly correlated with the Seebeck coefficient that varied in a broad range from -2100 to 3100 {\mu}V K-1. This variation indicated that the molecular strain formed a sharp peak or valley around the Fermi level in the density of state (DOS) function, which gradually shifts along with the C\b{eta}-C\b{eta} strain. This molecular strain-induced giant Seebeck effect is expected to be an applicable technique for other polythiophene molecules.</description>
