      <title>Hierarchical quantum embedding by machine learning for large molecular assemblies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum-in-quantum embedding strategy coupled to machine learning potentials to improve on the accuracy of quantum-classical hybrid models for the description of large molecules. In such hybrid models, relevant structural regions (such as those around reaction centers or pockets for binding of host molecules) can be described by a quantum model that is then embedded into a classical molecular-mechanics environment. However, this quantum region may become so large that only approximate electronic structure models are applicable. To then restore accuracy in the quantum description, we here introduce the concept of quantum cores within the quantum region that are amenable to accurate electronic structure models due to their limited size. Huzinaga-type projection-based embedding, for example, can deliver accurate electronic energies obtained with advanced electronic structure methods. The resulting total electronic energies are then fed into a transfer learning approach that efficiently exploits the higher-accuracy data to improve on a machine learning potential obtained for the original quantum-classical hybrid approach. We explore the potential of this approach in the context of a well-studied protein-ligand complex for which we calculate the free energy of binding using alchemical free energy and non-equilibrium switching simulations.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Enhanced Calculation of Quantum-Classical Binding Free Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binding free energies are a key element in understanding and predicting the strength of protein--drug interactions. While classical free energy simulations yield good results for many purely organic ligands, drugs including transition metal atoms often require quantum chemical methods for an accurate description. We propose a general and automated workflow that samples the potential energy surface with hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) calculations and trains a machine learning (ML) potential on the QM energies and forces to enable efficient alchemical free energy simulations. To represent systems including many different chemical elements efficiently and to account for the different description of QM and MM atoms, we propose an extension of element-embracing atom-centered symmetry functions for QM/MM data as an ML descriptor. The ML potential approach takes electrostatic embedding and long-range electrostatics into account. We demonstrate the applicability of the workflow on the well-studied protein--ligand complex of myeloid cell leukemia 1 and the inhibitor 19G and on the anti-cancer drug NKP1339 acting on the glucose-regulated protein 78.</description>

      <title>Nuclear-electronic calculations need uncontracted basis sets on the quantum protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An attractive way to calculate nuclear quantum effects is to describe select nuclei quantum mechanically at the same level as the electrons, requiring the solution of coupled Schr\"odinger equations for the electrons and the quantum nuclei. This is commonly known as the nuclear-electronic orbital (NEO) method, but it also has many other names. Two types of basis sets are required: a nuclear basis set is required in addition to the usual electronic basis set. In this work, we demonstrate that while existing nuclear basis sets are sufficient for NEO density-functional calculations, many sets producing proton affinities converged within 0.1 kcal/mol of the complete basis set limit, NEO calculations should always use uncontracted electronic basis sets on the quantum protons, since the contraction coefficients in typical electronic basis sets have been derived for point nuclear charge distributions. Uncontracting the basis sets on the quantized protons leads to significantly faster convergence to the basis set limit, leading to improvements of 18 kcal/mol and 10 kcal/mol in proton affinities employing double-$\zeta$ aug-pc-1 and triple-$\zeta$ aug-pc-2 electronic basis sets, respectively, with little effect on the computational effort. The partially uncontracted aug-pc-3 electronic basis set already affords proton affinities converged beyond 0.1 kcal/mol from the complete basis set limit. Similar results are also obtained with Dunning's correlation-consistent cc-pVXZ basis sets, as well as the Karlsruhe def2-XZP basis sets, albeit at a somewhat slower rate of convergence. As the protonic basis sets yield fully converged values, we find the protonic basis sets to be unnecessarily large for ground state density functional calculations, as the error in the protonic basis set is not balanced with that for typical electronic basis sets.</description>

      <title>Observation of Multiplet Lines in Seeded Stimulated Mn K{\alpha}1 X-ray Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the successful resolution of the multiplet structure of the K{\alpha}1 x-ray emission in manganese (Mn) complexes through seeded stimulated X-ray emission spectroscopy (seeded S-XES). By employing a femtosecond pump pulse above the Mn K edge to generate simultaneous 1s core-holes, and a second-color tunable seed pulse to initiate the stimulated emission process, we were able to enhance individual lines within the K{\alpha}1 emission. This approach allows to resolve the fine multiplet features that are obscured by the life-time broadening in conventional Mn K{\alpha} XES. The work builds on our previous observation that S-XES from Mn(II) and Mn(VII) complexes pumped at high intensities can exhibit stimulated emission without sacrificing the chemical sensitivity to oxidation states. This technique opens the door to controlled high-resolution electronic structure spectroscopy in transition metal complexes beyond core hole life time broadening with potential applications in catalysis, inorganic chemistry, and materials science.</description>

      <title>Materials Graph Library (MatGL), an open-source graph deep learning library for materials science and chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph deep learning models, which incorporate a natural inductive bias for a collection of atoms, are of immense interest in materials science and chemistry. Here, we introduce the Materials Graph Library (MatGL), an open-source graph deep learning library for materials science and chemistry. Built on top of the popular Deep Graph Library (DGL) and Python Materials Genomics (Pymatgen) packages, our intention is for MatGL to be an extensible ``batteries-included'' library for the development of advanced graph deep learning models for materials property predictions and interatomic potentials. At present, MatGL has efficient implementations for both invariant and equivariant graph deep learning models, including the Materials 3-body Graph Network (M3GNet), MatErials Graph Network (MEGNet), Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Network (CHGNet), TensorNet and SO3Net architectures. MatGL also includes a variety of pre-trained universal interatomic potentials (aka ``foundational materials models (FMM)'') and property prediction models are also included for out-of-box usage, benchmarking and fine-tuning. Finally, MatGL includes support for Pytorch Lightning for rapid training of models.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Antagonistic Collision-Controlled Reactivity in Energetic Molecular Perovskites with Deep Potential Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise regulation of chemical decompositions in energetic materials, whether towards rapid ignition or stable endurance, requires atomic-scale principles governing reactivity, which remain elusive yet. Herein, we resolve this challenge through deep potential molecular dynamics (DPMD) simulations, uncovering a universal collision-control principle in energetic molecular perovskites, $\text{(H}_{2}\text{dabco)B(ClO}_{4}\text{)}_{3}$, where $\text{H}_{2}\text{dabco}^{2+}$ = 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane-1,4-diium, B = $\text{Na}^{+}$, $\text{K}^{+}$, $\text{Rb}^{+}$, $\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$ for DAP-1, DAP-2, DAP-3 and DAP-4, respectively. Atomic-scale simulation with Arrhenius fitting for over 100-ps trajectories reveals that increasing B-site ionic radius ($\text{Na}^{+} &lt; \text{K}^{+} &lt; \text{Rb}^{+}$) simultaneously reduces both activation energy $E_{a}$, which enhances reactivity, and pre-exponential factor $A$ which suppresses collision probabilities for hydrogen transfer between site $X$ and site $A$, with sharply opposing kinetic consequences. This duality well explains the peak stability and insensitivity in $\text{K}^{+}$-based DAP-2, which optimally balance thermal endurance and collision dissipation. For ammonium-based DAP-4, though the radius of $\text{NH}_{4}^{+}$ is close to $\text{K}^{+}$, the reactive B-site cation triggers proton transfer that promotes $\text{C-H}$ bond rupture. By linking static cation radii to dynamic $E_{a}$-ln$(A)$ coupling, we rationalize non-monotonic decomposition temperatures ($\text{K}^{+} &gt; \text{NH}_{4}^{+} &gt; \text{Rb}^{+} &gt; \text{Na}^{+}$) macroscopic stability and establishes cornerstones for universal energetic material design.</description>

      <title>Annihilation-limited Long-range Exciton Transport in High-mobility Conjugated Copolymer Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A combination of ultrafast, long-range and low-loss excitation energy transfer from the photo-receptor location to a functionally active site is essential for cost-effective polymeric semiconductors. Delocalized electronic wavefunctions along {\pi}-conjugated polymer backbone can enable efficient intrachain transport, while interchain transport is generally thought slow and lossy due to weak chain-chain interactions. In contrast to the conventional strategy of mitigating structural disorder, amorphous layers of rigid conjugated polymers, exemplified by highly planar poly(indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole) (IDT-BT) donor-accepter copolymer, exhibit trap-free transistor performance and charge-carrier mobilities similar to amorphous silicon. Here we report long-range exciton transport in HJ-aggregated IDTBT thin-film, in which the competing exciton transport and exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) dynamics are spectroscopically separated using a phase-cycling-based scheme and shown to depart from the classical iffusion-limited and strong-coupling regime. In the thin film, we find an annihilation-limited mechanism with a per-encounter annihilation probability of much less than 100%, facilitating the minimization of EEA-induced excitation losses. In contrast, excitons on isolated IDTBT chains diffuse over 350 nm with 0.56 cm2 s-1 diffusivity, before eventually annihilating with unit probability on first contact. We complement the pump-probe studies with temperature dependent photocurrent and EEA measurements from 295 K to 77 K and find a remarkable correspondence of annihilation rate and photocurrent activation energies in the 140 K to 295 K temperature range.</description>

      <title>QE-CONVERSE: An open-source package for the Quantum ESPRESSO distribution to compute non-perturbatively orbital magnetization from first principles, including NMR chemical shifts and EPR parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital magnetization, a key property arising from the orbital motion of electrons, plays a crucial role in determining the magnetic behavior of molecules and solids. Despite its straightforward calculation in finite systems, the computation in periodic systems poses challenges due to the ill-defined position operator and surface current contributions. The modern theory of orbital magnetization, implemented in the Density Functional Theory (DFT) framework, offers an accurate solution via the "converse approach." Here, we introduce QE-CONVERSE, a refactored, modular implementation of this method, replacing outdated routines from Quantum ESPRESSO (version 3.2). QE-CONVERSE integrates modern computational libraries like scaLAPACK and ELPA, enhancing scalability, especially for large supercell calculations. This work focuses on providing the community with a reliable, accurate orbital magnetization package for properties such as Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) g-tensors and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) chemical shifts, particularly where perturbative methods fail. We demonstrate QE-CONVERSE's effectiveness with benchmark cases, including the NMR shifts of ${}^{27}$Al in alumina and ${}^{17}$O and ${}^{29}$Si in $\alpha$-quartz, as well as the EPR g-tensor for $_{ }^{n}\Sigma(n\geq 2)$ radicals and nitrogen defects in silicon. Results show excellent agreement with theoretical and experimental data, with improved accuracy in EPR calculations over linear response methods. QE-CONVERSE is fully compatible with recent Quantum ESPRESSO versions, enabling new possibilities for studying complex materials</description>

      <title>All-optical coherent control of chiral electronic transitions for highly enantioselective photochemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enantioselective photochemistry provides access to unique molecular structures and functions, with deep implications for fundamental science and industrial applications. Current methods for highly enantioselective photochemistry critically rely on chiral sensitisers, as circularly polarised light on its own yields vanishingly weak enantioselectivity. Here, we introduce a quantum control strategy to drive highly enantioselective electronic excitations in randomly oriented samples using a pulsed ($\sim$22 fs) IR laser and two of its harmonics, in the absence of intermediate resonances. Our approach addresses electronic transitions, does not require chiral sensitisers, or cold molecules, or long electronic coherence times, is relevant for liquid-phase samples, and remains effective over interaction regions extending across many laser wavelengths, even in the presence of dispersion. We show how, by 3D shaping the field's polarisation over the interaction region, we can achieve enantioselective coherent control over electronic population transfer. Our ab-initio simulations in the chiral molecule carvone yield a selectivity of $\sim$30 % in the populations of the first excited electronic state, three orders-of-magnitude higher than what is possible with circularly polarised light ($\sim$0.01 %). These results bring all-optical enantioselective photochemistry into the realm of practical applications.</description>

      <title>Tensor Decomposed Distinguishable Cluster. I. Triples Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a cost-reduced approach for the distinguishable cluster approximation to coupled cluster with singles, doubles and iterative triples (DC-CCSDT) based on a tensor decomposition of the triples amplitudes. The triples amplitudes and residuals are processed in the singular-value-decomposition (SVD) basis. Truncation of the SVD basis according to the values of the singular values together with the density fitting (or Cholesky) factorization of the electron repulsion integrals reduces the scaling of the method to $N^6$, and the DC approximation removes the most expensive terms of the SVD triples residuals and at the same time improves the accuracy of the method. The SVD basis vectors for the triples are obtained from the approximate CC3 triples density matrices constructed in an intermediate SVD basis of doubles amplitudes. This allows us to avoid steps that scale higher than $N^6$ altogether. Tests against DC-CCSDT and CCSDT(Q) on a benchmark set of chemical reactions with closed-shell molecules demonstrate that the SVD-error is very small already with moderate truncation thresholds, especially so when using a CCSD(T) energy correction. Tests on alkane chains demonstrated that the SVD-error grows linearly with system size confirming the size extensivity of SVD-DC-CCSDT within a chosen truncation threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbative approaches are methods to efficiently tackle many-body problems, offering both intuitive insights and analysis of correlation effects. However, their application to systems where light and matter are strongly coupled is non-trivial. Specifically, the definition of suitable orbitals for the zeroth-order Hamiltonian represents a significant theoretical challenge. While reviewing previously investigated orbital choices, this work presents an alternative polaritonic orbital basis suitable for the strong coupling regime. We develop a quantum electrodynamical (QED) M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory using orbitals obtained from the strong coupling QED Hartree-Fock. We assess the strengths and limitations of the different approaches and emphasize the essential role of using a consistent molecular orbital framework to achieve an accurate description of cavity-induced electron-photon correlation effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate yet efficient modeling of chemical systems with pronounced static correlation in their excited states remains a significant challenge in quantum chemistry, as most electronic structure methods that can adequately capture static correlation scale factorially with system size. Researchers are often left with no option but to use more affordable methods that may lack the accuracy required to model critical processes in photochemistry such as photolysis, photocatalysis, and non-adiabatic relaxation. A great deal of work has been dedicated to refining single-reference descriptions of static correlation in the ground state via ``addition-by-subtraction'' coupled cluster methods such as pair coupled cluster with double substitutions (pCCD), singlet-paired CCD (CCD0), triplet-paired CCD (CCD1), and CCD with frozen singlet- or triplet-paired amplitudes (CCDf0/CCDf1). By combining wave functions derived from these methods with the intermediate state representation (ISR), we gain insights into the extensibility of single-reference coupled cluster theory's coverage of static correlation to the excited state problem. Our CCDf1-ISR(2) approach is robust in the face of static correlation and provides enough dynamical correlation to accurately predict excitation energies to within about 0.2~eV in small organic molecules. We also highlight distinct advantages of the Hermitian ISR construction, such as the avoidance of pathological failures of equation-of-motion methods for excited state potential energy surface topology. Our results prompt us to continue exploring optimal single-reference theories (excited state approaches that leverage dependence on the initial reference wave function) as a potentially economical approach to the excited state static correlation problem.</description>

Abstract: Training machine learning models to predict properties of molecular conformer ensembles is an increasingly popular strategy to accelerate the conformational analysis of drug-like small molecules, reactive organic substrates, and homogeneous catalysts. For high-throughput analyses especially, trained surrogate models can help circumvent traditional approaches to conformational analysis that rely on expensive conformer searches and geometry optimizations. Here, we question how the performance of surrogate models for predicting 3D conformer-dependent properties (of a single, active conformer) is affected by the quality of the 3D conformers used as their input. How well do lower-quality conformers inform the prediction of properties of higher-quality conformers? Does the fidelity of geometry optimization matter when encoding random conformers? For models that encode sets of conformers, how does the presence of the active conformer that induces the target property affect model accuracy? How do predictions from a surrogate model compare to estimating the properties from cheap ensembles themselves? We explore these questions in the context of predicting Sterimol parameters of conformer ensembles optimized with density functional theory. Although answers will be case-specific, our analyses provide a valuable perspective on 3D representation learning models and raise practical considerations regarding when conformer quality matters.</description>
