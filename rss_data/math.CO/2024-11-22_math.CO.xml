      <title>On vertex sets inducing tangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diestel, Hundertmark and Lemanczyk asked whether every $k$-tangle in a graph is induced by a set of vertices by majority vote. We reduce their question to graphs whose size is bounded by a function in $k$. Additionally, we show that if for any fixed $k$ this problem has a positive answer, then every $k$-tangle is induced by a vertex set whose size is bounded in $k$. More generally, we prove for all $k$ that every $k$-tangle in a graph $G$ is induced by a weight function $V(G) \to \mathbb{N}$ whose total weight is bounded in $k$. As the key step of our proofs, we show that any given $k$-tangle in a graph $G$ is the lift of a $k$-tangle in some topological minor of $G$ whose size is bounded in $k$.</description>

      <title>Veronese polytopes: Extending the framework of cyclic polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces the theory of Veronese polytopes, a broad generalisation of cyclic polytopes. These arise as convex hulls of points on curves with one or more connected components, obtained as the image of the rational normal curve in affine charts. We describe their facial structure by extending Gale's evenness condition, and provide a further combinatorial characterisation of facets via $\sigma$-parity alternating sequences. Notably, we establish a bijective correspondence between combinatorial types of Veronese polytopes and partitions of finite sets equipped with a cyclic order, called circular compositions. We show that, although the only Veronese $3$-polytopes are the cyclic $3$-polytopes and the octahedron, in general dimension they form a rich and diverse class including all combinatorial types of simplicial $d$-polytopes with at most $d+3$ vertices, the cross-polytope and particular stacked polytopes. In addition, we characterise which curves defining Veronese polytopes are $d$-order curves, and provide a closed formula for the number of facets of any Veronese polytope.</description>

      <title>When are off-diagonal hypergraph Ramsey numbers polynomial?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A natural open problem in Ramsey theory is to determine those $3$-graphs $H$ for which the off-diagonal Ramsey number $r(H, K_n^{(3)})$ grows polynomially with $n$. We make substantial progress on this question by showing that if $H$ is tightly connected or has at most two tight components, then $r(H, K_n^{(3)})$ grows polynomially if and only if $H$ is not contained in an iterated blowup of an edge.</description>

      <title>Simplicial vs. cubical spheres, polyhedral products and the Nevo-Petersen conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that a Murai sphere is flag if and only if it is a nerve complex of a flag nestohedron and classify all the polytopes arising in this way. Our classification implies that flag Murai spheres satisfy the Nevo-Petersen conjecture on $\gamma$-vectors of flag homology spheres. We continue by showing that a Bier sphere is minimally non-Golod if and only if it is a nerve complex of a truncation polytope different from a simplex and classify all the polytopes arising in this way. Finally, the notion of a cubical Bier sphere is introduced based on the polyhedral product construction, and we study combinatorial and geometrical properties of these cubical complexes.</description>

      <title>Characterizing and Transforming DAGs within the I-LCA Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the connections between clusters and least common ancestors (LCAs) in directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), focusing on DAGs with unique LCAs for specific subsets of their leaves. These DAGs are important in modeling phylogenetic networks that account for reticulate processes or horizontal gene transfer. Phylogenetic DAGs inferred from genomic data are often complex, obscuring evolutionary insights, especially when vertices lack support as LCAs for any subset of taxa. To address this, we focus on $I$-lca-relevant DAGs, where each vertex serves as the unique LCA for a subset $A$ of leaves of specific size $|A|\in I$. We characterize DAGs with the so-called $I$-lca-property and establish their close relationship to pre-$I$-ary and $I$-ary set systems. Moreover, we build upon recently established results that use a simple operator $\ominus$, enabling the transformation of arbitrary DAGs into $I$-lca-relevant DAGs. This process reduces unnecessary complexity while preserving the key structural properties of the original DAG. The set $C_G$ consists of all clusters in a DAG $G$, where clusters correspond to the descendant leaves of vertices. While in some cases $C_H = C_G$ when transforming $G$ into an $I$-lca-relevant DAG $H$, it often happens that certain clusters in $C_G$ do not appear as clusters in $H$. To understand this phenomenon in detail, we characterize the subset of clusters in $C_G$ that remain in $H$ for DAGs $G$ with the $I$-lca-property. Furthermore, we show that the set $W$ of vertices required to transform $G$ into $H = G \ominus W$ is uniquely determined for such DAGs. This, in turn, allows us to show that the transformed DAG $H$ is always a tree or a galled-tree whenever $C_G$ represents the clustering system of a tree or galled-tree and $G$ has the $I$-lca-property. In the latter case $C_H = C_G$ always holds.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic configurations induced from the set of sums of two squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The set of sums of two squares plays an important role in the elementary number theory. Di Nasso investigated several infinite monochromatic patterns in integers considering operations induced from affine maps and asked whether one can find different sets of infinite monochromatic configurations in natural numbers with the structure induced from the set of sums of two squares. This article investigates Nasso's question and along the way proves several classical Ramsey-type theorems in this new setting.</description>

      <title>Vertices of the monotone path polytopes of hypersimplicies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The monotone path polytope of a polytope $P$ encapsulates the combinatorial behavior of the shadow vertex rule (a pivot rule used in linear programming) on $P$. On the other hand, computing monotone path polytopes is the entry door to the larger subject of fiber polytopes, for which explicitly computing examples remains a challenge.
  Monotone path polytopes of cubes and simplices have been known since the seminal article of Billera and Strumfels 1992. We (partially) extend these results to hypersimplices by linking this problem to the combinatorics of lattice paths. Indeed, we give a combinatorial model to describe the vertices of the monotone path polytope of the hypersimplex $\Delta(n, 2)$ (for any generic direction). With this model, we give a precise count of these vertices, and furthermore count the number of coherent monotone paths on $\Delta(n, 2)$ according to their lengths.
  We prove that some of the results obtained also hold for hypersimplices $\Delta(n, k)$ for $k\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Sharp Thresholds for Factors in Random Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a graph on $r$ vertices and let $G$ be a graph on $n$ vertices. Then an $F$-factor in $G$ is a subgraph of $G$ composed of $n/r$ vertex-disjoint copies of $F$, if $r$ divides $n$. In other words, an $F$-factor yields a partition of the $n$ vertices of $G$. The study of such $F$-factors in the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph dates back to Erd\H{o}s himself. Decades later, in 2008, Johansson, Kahn and Vu established the thresholds for the existence of an $F$-factor for strictly 1-balanced $F$ -- up to the leading constant. The sharp thresholds, meaning the leading constants, were obtained only recently by Riordan and Heckel, but only for complete graphs $F=K_r$ and for so-called nice graphs. Their results rely on sophisticated couplings that utilize the recent, celebrated solution of Shamir's problem by Kahn.
  We extend the couplings by Riordan and Heckel to any strictly 1-balanced $F$ and thereby obtain the sharp threshold for the existence of an $F$-factor. In particular, we confirm the thirty year old conjecture by Ruc\'inski that this sharp threshold indeed coincides with the sharp threshold for the disappearance of the last vertices which are not contained in a copy of $F$.</description>

      <title>The structure of sets with cube-avoiding sumsets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if $d \ge 2$ is an integer, $G$ is a finite abelian group, $Z_0$ is a subset of $G$ not contained in any strict coset in $G$, and $E_1,\dots,E_d$ are dense subsets of $G^n$ such that the sumset $E_1+\dots+E_d$ avoids $Z_0^n$ then $E_1, \dots, E_d$ essentially have bounded dimension. More precisely, they are almost entirely contained in sets $E_1' \times G^{I^c}, \dots, E_d' \times G^{I^c}$, where the size of $I \subset [n]$ is non-zero and independent of $n$, and $E_1',\dots,E_d'$ are subsets of $G^{I}$ such that the sumset $E_1'+\dots+E_d'$ avoids $Z_0^I$.</description>

      <title>Computing the permanental polynomial of $4k$-intercyclic bipartite graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a bipartite graph with adjacency matrix $A(G)$. The characteristic polynomial $\phi(G,x)=\det(xI-A(G))$ and the permanental polynomial $\pi(G,x) = \text{per}(xI-A(G))$ are both graph invariants used to distinguish graphs. For bipartite graphs, we define the modified characteristic polynomial, which is obtained by changing the signs of some of the coefficients of $\phi(G,x)$. For $4k$-intercyclic bipartite graphs, i.e., those for which the removal of any $4k$-cycle results in a $C_{4k}$-free graph, we provide an expression for $\pi(G,x)$ in terms of the modified characteristic polynomial of the graph and its subgraphs. Our approach is purely combinatorial in contrast to the Pfaffian orientation method found in the literature to compute the permanental polynomial.</description>

      <title>A new lower bound for the multicolor Ramsey number $r_k(K_{2, t + 1})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we provide a new infinite family of $K_{2, t+1}$-free graphs for each prime power $t$. Using these graphs, we show that it is possible to partition the edges of $K_n$ into parts, such that each part is isomorphic to our $K_{2, t+1}$-free graph. This yields an improved lower bound to the multicolor Ramsey number $r_k(K_{2, t+1})$ when $k$ and $t$ are powers of the same prime. For these values of $k$ and $t$, our coloring implies that $$ tk^2 + 1 \leq r_k(K_{2, t+1}) \leq tk^2 + k + 2. $$ where the upper bound is due to Chung and Graham.</description>

      <title>Comments on "$\mathcal{O}(m\cdot n)$ algorithms for the recognition and isomorphism problems on circular-arc graphs"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the work [$\mathcal{O}(m\cdot n)$ algorithms for the recognition and isomorphism problems on circular-arc graphs, SIAM J. Comput. 24(3), 411--439, (1995)], Wen-Lian Hsu claims three results concerning the class of circular-arc graphs: - the design of so-called \emph{decomposition trees} that represent the structure of all normalized intersection models of circular-arc graphs, - an $\mathcal{O}(m\cdot n)$ recognition algorithm for circular-arc graphs, - an $\mathcal{O}(m\cdot n)$ isomorphism algorithm for circular-arc graphs. In [Discrete Math. Theor. Comput. Sci., 15(1), 157--182, 2013] Curtis, Lin, McConnell, Nussbaum, Soulignac, Spinrad, and Szwarcfiter showed that Hsu's isomorphism algorithm is incorrect. In this note, we show that the other two results -- namely, the construction of decomposition trees and the recognition algorithm -- are also flawed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: De Loera, O'Neill and Wilburne introduced a general model for random numerical semigroups in which each positive integer is chosen independently with some probability p to be a generator, and proved upper and lower bounds on the expected Frobenius number and expected embedding dimensions. We use a range of probabilistic methods to improve the upper bounds to within a polylogarithmic factor of the lower bounds in each case. As one of the tools to do this, we prove that for any prime q, if A is a random subset of the cyclic group Z_q whose size is of order log(q) and k is also of order log(q), then with high probability the k-fold sumset kA is all of Z_q.</description>

      <title>Proof of Merca's stronger conjecture on truncated Jacobi triple product series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The truncated series start off with Andrews and Merca's truncated version of Euler's pentagonal number theorem in 2012. Moreover, Andrews--Merca and Guo--Zeng independently conjectured that the truncated Jacobi triple product series has nonnegative coefficients, which has been proved analytically by Mao and combinatorially by Yee. In 2021, Merca gave a stronger version for the truncated Jacobi triple product series(JTPS). Some very spcial cases of the conjecture have been proved by Ballantine--Feigon, Ding-Sun and Zhou. On the one hand, we consider the partial finite denomintor of the stronger truncated JTPS series with Residue theorem and prove that the coefficients of $ q^{n} $ in the series are positive when $ n $ greater than a finite constant. On the other hand, for the infinte denomintor, we deduce an asymptotic of nonmodular infinite products and therefore prove Merca's conjecture when $ n $ greater than a constant. We also show than when $ k $ is large enough, the infinte denomintor can be ignored and the Conjecture holds as a corollary.</description>

      <title>Improved Lower Bounds for all Odd-Query Locally Decodable Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for every odd $q\geq 3$, any $q$-query binary, possibly non-linear locally decodable code ($q$-LDC) $E:\{\pm1\}^k \rightarrow \{\pm1\}^n$ must satisfy $k \leq \tilde{O}(n^{1-2/q})$. For even $q$, this bound was established in a sequence of prior works. For $q=3$, the above bound was achieved in a recent work of Alrabiah, Guruswami, Kothari and Manohar using an argument that crucially exploits known exponential lower bounds for $2$-LDCs. Their strategy hits an inherent bottleneck for $q \geq 5$.
  Our key insight is identifying a general sufficient condition on the hypergraph of local decoding sets called $t$-approximate strong regularity. This condition demands that 1) the number of hyperedges containing any given subset of vertices of size $t$ (i.e., its co-degree) be equal to the same but arbitrary value $d_t$ up to a multiplicative constant slack, and 2) all other co-degrees be upper-bounded relative to $d_t$. This condition significantly generalizes related proposals in prior works that demand absolute upper bounds on all co-degrees.
  We give an argument based on spectral bounds on Kikuchi Matrices that lower bounds the blocklength of any LDC whose local decoding sets satisfy $t$-approximate strong regularity for any $t \leq q$. Crucially, unlike prior works, our argument works despite having no non-trivial absolute upper bound on the co-degrees of any set of vertices. To apply our argument to arbitrary $q$-LDCs, we give a new, greedy, approximate strong regularity decomposition that shows that arbitrary, dense enough hypergraphs can be partitioned (up to a small error) into approximately strongly regular pieces satisfying the required relative bounds on the co-degrees.</description>

      <title>Immersions of directed graphs in tournaments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Dragani\'c, Munh\'a Correia, Sudakov and Yuster showed that every tournament on $(2+o(1))k^2$ vertices contains a $1$-subdivision of a transitive tournament on $k$ vertices, which is tight up to a constant factor. We prove a counterpart of their result for immersions. Let $f(k)$ be the smallest integer such that any tournament on at least $f(k)$ vertices must contain a $1$-immersion of a transitive tournament on $k$ vertices. We show that $f(k)=O(k)$, which is clearly tight up to a multiplicative factor. If one insists in finding an immersion of a complete directed graph on $k$ vertices then an extra condition on the tournament is necessary. Indeed, we show that every tournament with minimum out-degree at least $Ck$ must contain a $2$-immersion of a complete digraph on $k$ vertices. This is again tight up to the value of $C$ and tight on the order of the paths in the immersion.</description>

      <title>The list-Ramsey threshold for families of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$ and an integer $r$, we say that a graph is $r$-Ramsey for $\mathcal{F}$ if any $r$-colouring of its edges admits a monochromatic copy of a graph from $\mathcal{F}$. The threshold for the classic Ramsey property in the binomial random graph, where $\mathcal{F}$ consists of one graph, was located in the celebrated work of R\"odl and Ruci\'nski.
  In this paper, we offer a twofold generalisation to the R\"odl--Ruci\'nski theorem. First, we show that the list-colouring version of the property has the same threshold. Second, we extend this result to finite families $\mathcal{F}$, where the threshold statements might also diverge. This also confirms further special cases of the Kohayakawa--Kreuter conjecture. Along the way, we supply a short(-ish), self-contained proof of the $0$-statement of the R\"odl--Ruci\'nski theorem.</description>

      <title>Spectral Tur\'an problems for hypergraphs with bipartite or multipartite pattern</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General criteria on spectral extremal problems for hypergraphs were developed by Keevash, Lenz, and Mubayi in their seminal work (SIAM J. Discrete Math., 2014), in which extremal results on \alpha-spectral radius of hypergraphs for \alpha&gt;1 may be deduced from the corresponding hypergraph Tur\'an problem which has the stability property and whose extremal construction satisfies some continuity assumptions. Using this criterion, we give two general spectral Tur\'an results for hypergraphs with bipartite or mulitpartite pattern, transform corresponding the spectral Tur\'an problems into pure combinatorial problems with respect to degree-stability of a nondegenerate k-graph family. As an application, we determine the maximum \alpha-spectral radius for some classes of hypergraphs and characterize the corresponding extremal hypergraphs, such as the expansion of complete graphs, the generalized Fans, the cancellative hypergraphs, the generalized triangles, and a special book hypergraph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the minimum number of distinct eigenvalues over a collection of matrices associated with a graph. Lower bounds are derived based on the existence or non-existence of certain cycle(s) in a graph. A key result proves that every Johnson graph has a signed variant with exactly two distinct eigenvalues. We also explore applications to weighing matrices, linear ternary codes, tight frames, and compute the minimum rank of Johnson graphs. Further results involve the minimum number of distinct eigenvalues for graphs in association schemes, distance-regular graphs, and Hamming graphs. We also draw some connections with simplicial complexes and higher-order Laplacians.</description>

      <title>The Tur\'an Density of 4-Uniform Tight Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any uniformity $r$ and residue $k$ modulo $r$, we give an exact characterization of the $r$-uniform hypergraphs that homomorphically avoid tight cycles of length $k$ modulo $r$, in terms of colorings of $(r-1)$-tuples of vertices. This generalizes the result that a graph avoids all odd closed walks if and only if it is bipartite, as well as a result of Kam\v cev, Letzter, and Pokrovskiy in uniformity 3. In fact, our characterization applies to a much larger class of families than those of the form $\mathscr C_k^{(r)}=\{\text{$r$-uniform tight cycles of length $k$ modulo $r$}\}$.
  We also outline a general strategy to prove that, if $\mathscr C$ is a family of tight-cycle-like hypergraphs (including but not limited to the families $\mathscr C_k^{(r)}$) for which the above characterization applies, then all sufficiently long $C\in \mathscr C$ will have the same Tur\'an density. We demonstrate an application of this framework, proving that there exists an integer $L_0$ such that for every $L&gt;L_0$ not divisible by 4, the tight cycle $C^{(4)}_L$ has Tur\'an density $1/2$.</description>

      <title>Corrigendum to the equivalent statement of the Laplacian Spread Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02440v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph $G,$ let $\alpha(G)$ denote its second smallest Laplacian eigenvalue. The Laplacian Spread Conjecture states that $\alpha(G)+\alpha(\overline{G}) \geq 1,$ where $\overline{G}$ is the complement of $G.$ In this paper, we have corrected two conclusions: First, the necessary and sufficient condition for $\alpha(G) + \alpha(\overline{G}) \geq 1$ is $\parallel \bigtriangledown_{x} - \bigtriangledown_{y} \parallel^{2} \geq 1$ rather than $\parallel \bigtriangledown_{x} - \bigtriangledown_{y} \parallel^{2} \geq 2$ which has been proved in \cite{BS} as demonstrated in our study. Second, we show that the Laplacian spread of balanced digraph $\Gamma$ satisfies $LS(\Gamma) \leq n - \frac{1}{2}$ but not $LS(\Gamma) \leq n - 1$ in \cite{BCEHK}, since inequality $\parallel \bigtriangledown_{x} - \bigtriangledown_{y} \parallel^{2} \geq 2$ does not hold.</description>

      <title>Chow functions for partially ordered sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Three decades ago, Stanley and Brenti initiated the study of the Kazhdan--Lusztig--Stanley (KLS) functions, putting on common ground several polynomials appearing in algebraic combinatorics, discrete geometry, and representation theory. In the present paper we develop a theory that parallels the KLS theory. To each kernel in a given poset, we associate a polynomial function that we call the \emph{Chow function}. The Chow function often exhibits remarkable properties, and sometimes encodes the graded dimensions of a cohomology or Chow ring. The framework of Chow functions provides natural polynomial analogs of graded module decompositions that appear in algebraic geometry, but that work for arbitrary posets, even when no graded module decomposition is known to exist. In this general framework, we prove a number of unimodality and positivity results without relying on versions of the Hard Lefschetz theorem. Our framework shows that there is an unexpected relation between positivity and real-rootedness conjectures about chains on face lattices of polytopes by Brenti and Welker, Hilbert--Poincar\'e series of matroid Chow rings by Ferroni and Schr\"oter, and flag enumerations on Bruhat intervals of Coxeter groups by Billera and Brenti.</description>

      <title>A sharp upper bound on the spectral radius of $\theta(1,3,3)$-free graphs with given size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $F$-free if $G$ does not contain $F$ as a subgraph. Let $\rho(G)$ be the spectral radius of a graph $G$. Let $\theta(1,p,q)$ denote the theta graph, which is obtained by connecting two distinct vertices with three internally disjoint paths with lengths $1, p, q$, where $p\leq q$. Let $S_{n,k}$ denote the graph obtained by joining every vertex of $K_{k}$ to $n-k$ isolated vertices and $S_{n,k}^{-}$ denote the graph obtained from $S_{n,k}$ by deleting an edge incident to a vertex of degree $k$, respectively. In this paper, we show that if $\rho(G)\geq\rho(S_{\frac{m+4}{2},2}^{-})$ for a graph $G$ with even size $m\geq 92$, then $G$ contains a $\theta(1,3,3)$ unless $G\cong S_{\frac{m+4}{2},2}^{-}$.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration Using Generalized Token Jumping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In reconfiguration, we are given two solutions to a graph problem, such as Vertex Cover or Dominating Set, with each solu tion represented by a placement of tokens on vertices of the graph. Our task is to reconfigure one into the other using small steps while ensuring the intermediate configurations of tokens are also valid solutions. The two commonly studied settings are Token Jumping and Token Sliding, which allows moving a single token to an arbitrary or an adjacent vertex, respectively.
  We introduce new rules that generalize Token Jumping, parameterized by the number of tokens allowed to move at once and by the maximum distance of each move. Our main contribution is identifying minimal rules that allow reconfiguring any possible given solution into any other for Independent Set, Vertex Cover, and Dominating Set. For each minimal rule, we also provide an efficient algorithm that finds a corresponding reconfiguration sequence.
  We further focus on the rule that allows each token to move to an adjacent vertex in a single step. This natural variant turns out to be the minimal rule that guarantees reconfigurability for Vertex Cover. We determine the computational complexity of deciding whether a (shortest) reconfiguration sequence exists under this rule for the three studied problems. While reachability for Vertex Cover is shown to be in P, finding a shortest sequence is shown to be NP-complete. For Independent Set and Dominating Set, even reachability is shown to be PSPACE-complete.</description>

  Moreover, we show that for all $2\le k \le n$ a set $A$ avoiding $k$ pairwise orthogonal vectors has measure at most $\exp(-c \min\{\sqrt{n}, n/k\})$ for some $c&gt;0$. Proofs rely on the harmonic analysis on the sphere and the hypercontractive inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first part of this paper concerns type C. We present new explicitly defined families of algebro-combinatorial structures of three kinds: combinatorial bases in representations, Newton--Okounkov bodies of flag varieties and toric degenerations of flag varieties. All three families are parametrized by the same family of polytopes: the marked chain-order polytopes of Fang and Fourier which interpolate between the type C Gelfand--Tsetlin and FFLV polytopes. Thus, in each case the obtained structures interpolate between the well-known bases, Newton--Okounkov bodies or degenerations associated with the latter two polytopes. We then obtain similar results for type B after introducing a new family of poset polytopes to be considered in place of marked chain-order polytopes. In both types our constructions and proofs rely crucially on a combinatorial connection between poset polytopes and pipe dreams.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores Iwasawa theory from a graph theoretic perspective, focusing on the algebraic and combinatorial properties of Cayley graphs. Using representation theory, we analyze Iwasawa-theoretic invariants within $\mathbb{Z}_\ell$-towers of Cayley graphs, revealing connections between graph theory, number theory, and group theory. Key results include the factorization of associated Iwasawa polynomials and the decomposition of $\mu$- and $\lambda$-invariants. Additionally, we apply these insights to complete graphs, establishing conditions under which these invariants vanish.</description>

Abstract: We show factorization formulas for a class of partition functions of rational six vertex model. First we show factorization formulas for partition functions under triangular boundary. Further, by combining the factorization formulas with the explicit forms of the generalized domain wall boundary partition functions by Belliard-Pimenta-Slavnov, we derive factorization formulas for partition functions under trapezoid boundary which can be viewed as a generalization of triangular boundary. We also discuss an application to emptiness formation probabilities under trapezoid boundary which admit determinant representations.</description>

Abstract: The Erd\"{o}s-Moser equation $ \sum_{i=1}^{m - 1} i^k = m^k $ is a longstanding problem in number theory, with the only known solution in positive integers being $ (k, m) = (1, 3) $. This paper investigates the possibility of other solutions by employing approximation methods based on the Euler-MacLaurin formula to extend the discrete sum $ S(m - 1, k) $ to a continuous function $ S_{\mathbb{R}}(m - 1, k) $. Analyzing the approximate polynomial $ P_{\mathbb{R}}(m) = S_{\mathbb{R}}(m - 1, k) - m^k $, we apply the rational root theorem to search for potential integer solutions. Our investigation confirms that for $ k = 1 $, the only solution is $ m = 3 $. For $ k \geq 2 $, the approximation suggests that no additional positive integer solutions exist. However, we acknowledge the limitations of using approximation methods in the context of Diophantine equations, where exactness is crucial. The omission of correction terms in the approximation may overlook valid solutions. Despite these limitations, our work provides insights into the behavior of the Erd\"{o}s-Moser equation and highlights the challenges in finding solutions using analytical methods. We discuss the implications of our findings and suggest directions for future research, emphasizing the need for exact analytical techniques to conclusively address the conjecture.</description>
