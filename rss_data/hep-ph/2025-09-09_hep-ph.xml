      <title>Unbinning global LHC analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference has been shown to outperform traditional, histogram-based inference in numerous phenomenological and experimental studies. So far, these analyses have focused on individual high-profile processes. We study the combination of four different di-boson processes in terms of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory. Our results demonstrate how simulation-based inference also wins over traditional methods for global LHC analyses.</description>

      <title>Chasing the two-Higgs-doublet model via electroweak corrections at $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of Higgs boson production associated with a neutrino pair at $e^+e^-$ colliders ($e^+ e^- \to h \, \nu \bar{\nu}$) at the next-to-leading-order accuracy in both the Standard Model and the two-Higgs-doublet model. We show that new physics effects from the extended Higgs sector can be probed through electroweak corrections, which lead to several percent deviations from the Standard Model predictions in total cross sections and differential distributions, even in the alignment limit. This highlights the potential of precision studies at future $e^+e^-$ colliders for searching new physics.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Initial-State and Evolution Effects in Heavy-Ion Collisions Using EPOS and PHSD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study we examine the impact of the initial stage and dynamical evolution on final-state observables in heavy-ion collisions. For this goal we develop a novel approach, EPOSir+PHSDe, which employs EPOS initial conditions as the starting point for parton and hadron evolution within the PHSD microscopic transport approach. By examining the space-time evolution of matter in this model and comparing to EPOS (which starts with an S-matrix approach for parallel scatterings for the initial conditions and uses a hydrodynamic evolution for the quark-gluon plasma stage with the UrQMD as afterburner) and PHSD (which starts with primary high energy $NN$ scattering realized via the LUND string model and continues with fully microscopic transport dynamics for strongly interacting partonic and hadronic matter), we identify the key differences in the final particle distributions among the three approaches. Our analysis focuses on rapidity, transverse momentum spectra, and flow harmonics $v_2$ for Au+Au collisions at the invariant energy of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV. We find a dominant influence of dynamical evolution over the initial conditions on the final observables.</description>

      <title>Knudsen number and universal behavior of collective flows in conformal and non-conformal systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of the Knudsen number (Kn) as a scaling parameter governing the emergence of collective behavior in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Using the Relativistic Boltzmann Transport approach, we explore different initial conditions for both conformal (massless) and non-conformal (massive) systems with a constant specific shear viscosity $\eta/s$. Observables such as the time evolution of anisotropic flow coefficients collapse onto universal curves for fixed classes of Knudsen number, when using a scaled time variable accounting for the system size and the speed of sound $c_s$. More differential quantities, such as $v_n(p_T/\langle E_T\rangle)$, show a larger sensitivity to $c_s$. We also study events with fluctuating initial profiles from the \trento\ model, simulating collision systems from O-O to Pb-Pb at RHIC and LHC energies. Universal scaling at a given Kn value also holds in these event-by-event simulations, suggesting that the Knudsen number provides a unified criterion for classifying collectivity across different systems, including small systems where thermalisation may not be fully realised.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Structure of an Extended Standard Model with $U(1)_D$ Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, we investigate the vacuum structure of an extended standard model with a $U(1)_D$ global symmetry. The scalar sector consists of three $SU(2)$ doublets as well as one complex singlet and one real singlet, resulting in a more complicated vacuum structure compared to that of the Standard Model. We analyze various theoretical constraints, including the conditions for being bounded from below, the existence of a global minimum, and perturbativity up to the Planck scale. Additionally, we consider experimental constraints from the Higgs invisible decay. Through a detailed statistical analysis using numerical methods, we show that the extended scalar potential can accommodate a stable vacuum while satisfying both theoretical and experimental constraints for a small region of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Flavor Enhanced Chromomagnetic Dipole Moment in the Bestest Little Higgs Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the anomalous Chromomagnetic Dipole Moment (CMDM), $\hat{\mu}_t^{\mathrm{BLHM}}$, of the top quark within the Bestest Little Higgs Model (BLHM). Our study incorporates novel interactions arising from the extended CKM matrix in the BLHM and explores a broad region of the experimentally allowed parameter space, yielding CMDM values on the order of $10^{-3}$. This result represents an improvement over previous CMDM calculations within the BLHM and makes it competitive with other beyond the Standard Model scenarios. Experimental and model parameter uncertainties are considered and propagated through our calculations, using a Monte Carlo method.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Structure Strikes Back: The Elimination of Vector-Mediated Nonstandard Interaction Models as a Mechanism for Sterile Neutrino Dark Matter Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit sterile-neutrino production enabled by nonstandard interactions (NSI) among active neutrinos mediated by new bosons. We focus on vector mediators, including neutrinophilic, gauged $L_\mu\!-\!L_\tau$, and $B\!-\!L$ realizations that modify in-medium dispersion and scattering, thereby altering the active--sterile conversion history. Building on a novel production framework with NSI thermal potentials and collision integrals, we compute nonthermal phase-space distributions across sterile neutrino mixing and NSI parameters and map each point to an equivalent thermal warm dark matter particle mass $m_{\mathrm{th}}$ via linear-theory transfer function fitting with cosmological structure-formation Boltzmann solver. This enables a direct reinterpretation of state-of-the-art structure-formation limits from Milky Way satellites, strong lensing, and the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest. These limits, in conjunction with X-ray decay searches, as well as results from a wide variety of particle physics experiments allow for a more complete examination of these models. We find that these vector-mediated models are ruled out when the full combination of current constraints, listed above, are taken into account. NSI scalar-mediated models and models with low-reheating temperatures remain viable.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the hidden-charm pentaquark candidates in the $J/\psi p$ mass spectrum with QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we distinguish the isospin unambiguously to construct the diquark-diquark-antiquark type five-quark currents with the isospin $I=\frac{1}{2}$, and study the $uudc\bar{c}$ pentaquark states with the QCD sum rules systematically for the first time. Then we obtain the mass spectrum of the diquark-diquark-antiquark type $uudc\bar{c}$ pentaquark states with the isospin-spin-parity $IJ^P=\frac{1}{2}{\frac{1}{2}}^-$, $\frac{1}{2}{\frac{3}{2}}^-$ and $\frac{1}{2}{\frac{5}{2}}^-$, and make possible assignments of the $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4337)$, $P_c(4380)$, $P_c(4440)$ and $P_c(4457)$. As a byproduct, we obtain the lowest hidden-charm pentaquark state which lies just above the $\bar{D}\Lambda_c$ threshold.</description>

      <title>Jet momentum broadening beyond the jet quenching parameter from QCD kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using QCD kinetic theory, we study momentum broadening of jets using the full broadening probability (elastic collision kernel) $C(\mathbf{q_\perp})$ extracted during simulations of the nonequilibrium initial stages in heavy-ion collisions. We find that small momentum transfer is more likely than in thermal equilibrium, particularly along the beam axis. Our extraction represents a significant step towards a more realistic modeling of jet quenching during the initial stages.</description>

      <title>Classification of Higgs sectors from group theoretical properties of UV gauge theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended Higgs sectors are often introduced to explain phenomena beyond the standard model (BSM). The existence of multiple scalar fields may cause the Landau pole below the Planck scale. In this case, the low-energy theory may be replaced by an asymptotic-free gauge theory. In this paper, we consider an $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge theory with confinement as such an ultra-violate theory of the extended Higgs sectors. We investigate the relation between scalar particle contents at the low energy and group theoretical properties of fundamental fermions of the gauge theory. We find that particle contents of various extended Higgs sectors previously proposed to explain the BSM problems are deduced by each charge assignment of flavor symmetry of the fundamental fermions of the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gauge symmetry. Our findings may provide a new picture for the ultra-violate completion of the extended Higgs sectors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare two recently developed frameworks of perfect spin hydrodynamics for spin-$1/2$ particles, based respectively on classical kinetic theory and the Wigner function. We show that the conserved currents in both approaches have the same form at each order of the expansion in the components of the spin polarization tensor $\omega$. The only difference is a relative multiplicative factor, which is equal to 1 at the lowest nontrivial order and increases monotonically with the expansion order.</description>

      <title>Explaining 650 GeV and 95 GeV Anomalies in the 2-Higgs Doublet Model Type-I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an interpretation of a rather significant 650 GeV excess emerged at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) from CMS Collaboration data in the $\gamma\gamma b\bar b$ final state, accompanied by further clusters at 125(90-100) GeV in the $\gamma\gamma(b\bar b)$ system, within the 2-Higgs Doublet Model Type-I (2HDM-I) in presence of a softly broken $\mathcal{Z}_{2}$ symmetry. The underlying process that we probe is $gg$-initiated production of a CP-odd (or pseudoscalar) Higgs boson $A$, with mass around 650 GeV, decaying into the Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs state $H$ (decaying into $\gamma\gamma$) and a $Z$ boson (decaying into $b\bar b$). We configure this theoretical framework so as to also have in the spectrum a light CP-even (or scalar) Higgs state $h$ with mass around 95 GeV, which is included for the purpose of simultaneously explaining additional data anomalies seen in the $b\bar b$, $\gamma\gamma$ and $\tau^+\tau^-$ final states while searching for light Higgs states at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider (the first one) and LHC (the last two). By accounting for both experimental and theoretical constraints, our results show that the 2HDM-I can explain all aforementioned anomalies at a significance level of $2.5 \sigma$.</description>

      <title>Multiplicity distributions in QCD jets and jet topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate the Koba--Nielsen--Olesen (KNO) scaling functions for quark- and gluon-initiated jets by incorporating energy conservation into the Double Logarithmic Approximation (DLA). The resulting modified DLA (MDLA) expressions differ substantially from the DLA predictions and qualitatively align with the recently proposed QCD-inspired expressions, albeit with some quantitative differences. By fixing the two parameters in the MDLA expressions, we show that the inclusive charged-particle multiplicity distributions of the two leading jets in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV, measured by ATLAS over a wide jet $p_T$ range of $0.1$--$2.5$ TeV, are well described within experimental uncertainties and consistent with {\tt PYTHIA} simulations. This conclusion is further supported by direct comparisons with quark- and gluon-initiated jet distributions extracted via jet topics, though the propagated uncertainties from experimental data remain sizable.</description>

      <title>To Break or Not to Break: A Review of a No-Go Theorem on Chiral Symmetry Breaking in QCD-like Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a pedagogical review of some recent progress in rigorously proving chiral symmetry breaking in a class of QCD-like theories that closely resemble the real-world QCD, namely the $SU(N_c)$ Yang-Mills theory coupled to $N_f$ flavors of massless quarks in the fundamental representation. Based on 't Hooft anomaly matching and persistent mass conditions, a general no-go theorem is formulated: assuming that the theory flows in the infrared to a fully color-screened, infrared-free phase described by color-singlet hadrons, symmetry and anomaly constraints necessarily imply spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking; conversely, any phase with unbroken chiral symmetry must retain unscreened color charges, thereby ruling out a fully color-singlet hadron description in the infrared. While these results have been widely assumed, the recent developments reviewed here establish them with a new level of rigor. The persistent mass condition, carefully formulated here, plays a central role, just as it does in the Vafa-Witten theorem on unbroken vectorlike symmetries.</description>

      <title>Could the 650 GeV Excess be a Pseudoscalar of a 3-Higgs Doublet Model?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose the interpretation of a 650 GeV excess observed at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the CMS Collaboration in terms of the production of a CP-odd (or pseudoscalar) Higgs boson A, with mass around 650 GeV, decaying into the Standard Model (SM)-like Higgs state $h_{125}$ (in turn decaying into $\gamma\gamma$) and a Z boson (in turn decaying into $b\bar b$), within a 3-Higgs Doublet Model (3HDM) featuring two active and one inert doublet, known as the I(1+2)HDM. This theoretical structure features a spectrum with both the SM-like Higgs boson (with a 125 GeV mass) and a lighter CP-even (or scalar) Higgs state with mass around 95 GeV, $h_{95}$, which is present in this scenario for the purpose of simultaneously explaining anomalies seen in the $b\bar b$, $\gamma\gamma$ and $\tau^+\tau^-$ final states in searches for additional light Higgs states at the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) collider and LHC itself. It should be noted that, in the I(1+2)HDM, the inert sector presents loop-induced enhancements to the $h_{95} \to \gamma\gamma$ width via inert charged Higgs states, providing a viable mechanism to explain, in particular, the observed (and most significant) di-photon excess at 95 GeV. Taking into account both experimental and theoretical constraints, our results can not only explain the aforementioned anomalies (possibly, aside from the $\tau^+\tau^-$, which is the most marginal one) but also predict, as collateral signals, resonant production of the same CP-odd scalar A followed by the decays: (i) $A \to h_{95} \, Z$, leading to the same $\gamma\gamma b \bar{b}$ final state displaying the original 650 GeV anomaly and (ii) $A\to t\bar t$, leading to a well-known and studied signature.</description>

      <title>Doubly heavy hadron production in ultraperipheral collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inclusive production of pseudoscalar heavy quarkoniua ($\eta_c,\, \eta_b,\, B_c$), double heavy baryon $\Xi_{QQ^\prime}$ ($Q^{(\prime)}=c,\,b$ quarks) and tetraquark $T_{QQ}$ in heavy ion ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) are studied. Numerical results indicate that the experimental investigation for $\eta_c,\, \Xi_{cc}$, and $T_{cc}$ are feasible at the coming HL-LHC and future FCC. The heavy ion UPCs open another door of the study on the production of these doubly heavy hadrons.</description>

      <title>Criterion for the Existence of the $G(3900)$ Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: About 18 years ago, the BABAR and the Belle Collaborations reported evidence for a new $c\bar{c}$ structure near $3900~\mathrm{MeV}$ in $e^{+}e^{-} \to D\bar{D}$, triggering debate over whether it represents a genuine hadronic state or arises from interference effects and the opening of the $D^{*}\bar{D}$ threshold. The issue remained unsettled until 2024, when BESIII, with an enlarged $e^{+}e^{-} \to D\bar{D}$ sample, confirmed the presence of the $G(3900)$ structure, reviving discussion of its nature. Although it has been proposed as a $P$-wave $D\bar{D}^{*}$ molecular state, no consensus has emerged, and interference effects remain a plausible explanation. In this Letter, we show that analyzing the $e^{+}e^{-}\to D\bar{D}$ cross section as a function of the transverse momentum of the final-state $D$ meson reveals a prominent Jacobian peak. This feature cannot be generated by interference effects alone and thus provides direct evidence for the existence of $G(3900)$. Moreover, the peak position is highly sensitive to the actual mass of $G(3900)$, offering a precise determination method. Our results further indicate that interpreting $G(3900)$ as a $D\bar{D}^{*}$ molecular state is disfavored, suggesting alternative internal structures. This work introduces a reliable method that provides a new perspective for disentangling genuine resonances from threshold or interference effects.</description>

      <title>Neural Posterior Unfolding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differential cross section measurements are the currency of scientific exchange in particle and nuclear physics. A key challenge for these analyses is the correction for detector distortions, known as deconvolution or unfolding. Binned unfolding of cross section measurements traditionally rely on the regularized inversion of the response matrix that represents the detector response, mapping pre-detector (`particle level') observables to post-detector (`detector level') observables. In this paper we introduce Neural Posterior Unfolding, a modern, Bayesian approach that leverages normalizing flows for unfolding. By using normalizing flows for neural posterior estimation, NPU offers several key advantages including implicit regularization through the neural network architecture, fast amortized inference that eliminates the need for repeated retraining, and direct access to the full uncertainty in the unfolded result. In addition to introducing NPU, we implement a classical Bayesian unfolding method called Fully Bayesian Unfolding (FBU) in modern Python so it can also be studied. These tools are validated on simple Gaussian examples and then tested on simulated jet substructure examples from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We find that the Bayesian methods are effective and worth additional development to be analysis ready for cross section measurements at the LHC and beyond.</description>

      <title>Double logarithmic contribution to Higgs pair production in the high-energy limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the leading logarithmic QCD corrections to Higgs pair production in the high-energy limit, which originate from soft quark exchange in the Feynman diagram and are thus suppressed by the quark mass. It is found that triangle Feynman diagrams can be analyzed in the same way as single Higgs production mediated by bottom quarks [45-47], while for diagrams of box type we cannot get an all-order result due to the many more double logarithmic structures they own. In this paper we calculate the abelian corrections at three loops for the first time after obtaining the corresponding one- and two-loop leading logarithms, which are in total agreement with the analytical results in the literature.</description>

      <title>Study of transition form factors of the lightest pseudoscalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the transition form factors of the lightest pseudoscalar mesons, $\pi^0$, $\eta$, and $\eta'$, within the framework of resonance chiral theory. Our analysis is performed based on the data of time-like and space-like singly-virtual and space-like doubly-virtual form factors, as well as the relevant cross sections and latest invariant mass spectra of $e^+e^-$ pair for the process of $P\to\gamma e^+ e^-$. The transition form factors of these pseudoscalars are obtained. Also, we evaluate their contributions to the light-by-light part of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Our two Fits give similar results, where Fit-A gives $a_\mu^{\pi^0 }=(61.6\pm 1.8)\times10^{-11}$, $a_\mu^{\eta }=(15.2\pm1.2)\times10^{-11}$, $a_\mu^{\eta'}=(16.0\pm 1.1)\times10^{-11}$, and the total contribution of neutral pseudo-scalar meson poles is $a_\mu^{\pi^0+\eta+\eta'}=(92.8\pm2.3)\times10^{-11}$.</description>

      <title>The 690 GeV scalar resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking through the Higgs field has been experimentally confirmed as a basic ingredient of the Standard Model. However, the origin of the phenomenon may not be entirely clear, because, in perturbation theory, the vacuum turns out to be a metastable state. An alternative scenario was proposed that implies a second resonance of the Higgs field ${\cal H}$ with a well delimited mass $(M_H)^{\rm Theor} = 690\,(30)$ GeV. This stabilises the potential, but, owing to an $H$ coupling to longitudinal $W$s with the same typical strength as that of the low-mass state with $m_h= 125$ GeV, it would still remain a relatively narrow resonance. Our scope here is twofold. First, leaving out many details, we outline a simple logical path where the, apparently surprising, idea of such a second resonance follows from basic properties of $\Phi^4$ theories. Secondly, we spell out a definite experimental signature of this resonance that is clearly visible in various LHC data. As a by-product, the ${\cal H} ^3$ term gives $\kappa_\lambda = (M_H/m_h) \sim $ 5.5 consistently with the ATLAS and CMS data.</description>

      <title>Dissecting Exclusive Multijet Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies multijet cross sections in the kinematic limit where one or more of the jets are unresolved. We study the asymptotic expansion of the cross section by using the method of regions. We explain in large generality how to identify the relevant phase space regions and derive the leading-power approximation of the phase space. The leading-power phase space factorizes into a hard phase space and a radiation phase space for each collinear sector and the soft sector. Using the infrared factorization properties of squared matrix elements at leading power, we derive a factorization formula for generic resolution variables describing the exclusive n-jet limit in terms of fully differential beam, jet, and soft functions. We show how the factorization formula can be simplified for specific resolution variables. We regularize rapidity divergences in the beam and jet functions using a time-like reference vector, a method we call the ``$z_N$-prescription'', and demonstrate how the associated zero-bin contributions combine with the soft function to define a soft subtracted function free of rapidity divergences and suitable for numerical evaluation. The $z_N$-prescription can be used both for $\mathrm{SCET}_{\mathrm{II}}$- and $\mathrm{SCET}_{\mathrm{I}}$-type resolution variables. As an application of our framework, we derive factorization formulas for several transverse-momentum-like variables, and we present a variable that factorizes into simple cumulant functions to all orders in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>The complementary of CTAO, direct detection and collider searches for dark matter in Effective Field Theories and Simplified models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory to dark matter annihilation in the Galactic Center, within the frameworks of Effective Field Theory and Simplified Models. We present sensitivity forecasts, utilizing an up-to-date instrument configuration and incorporating the latest models for Galactic Diffuse Emission. A key aspect of our work is the inclusion of updated dark matter density profiles, J-factors, and velocity dispersion distributions derived from the FIRE-2 cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which significantly impact the expected indirect detection signals. Furthermore, we update the constraints from direct detection experiments (Xenon1T and LZ) taking into account the astrophysical uncertainties informed by the FIRE-2 simulations, and also investigate limits coming from collider searches (ATLAS and CMS). Our analysis reveals improved constraints on the effective suppression scale ($M_*$) in the Effective Field Theory framework and on the mediator mass ($M_{med}$) in Simplified Models compared to previous studies, highlighting the complementarity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory with direct and collider searches in probing a wide range of dark matter scenarios. We discuss the implications of these results for various dark matter interaction types, including scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, and axial-vector mediators, and emphasize the importance of considering realistic astrophysical inputs in interpreting dark matter search results across different experimental fronts.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Energy Momentum Tensor through DVCS Dispersion Relation beyond Leading Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we analyse and interpret the kinematic power corrections to deeply virtual Compton scattering dispersion relation. We show that the kinematic corrections at twist-4 can be connected to other form factors of the Energy-Momentum Tensor beyond the pressure distribution involved at leading-power, namely the ones related to Momentum and total Angular Momentum distributions. In the nucleon case, these corrections are not negligible at presently accessible virtualities. The DVCS subtraction constant becomes an experimental constraint on momentum distributions, pressure forces distributions, and total angular momentum distributions. Finally, we use continuum and lattice-QCD results to predict the expected size of the DVCS subtraction constant, and conclude that momentum distributions are responsible of roughly one-third of the experimental signal at $Q^2 = 2\textrm{GeV}^2$.</description>

      <title>Self-resonant dark matter with $Z_4$ gauged symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new model for two-component scalar dark matter (DM), consisting of two complex scalar fields. In this model, both the DM components are stable due to the remaining $Z_4$ gauge symmetry, which is the remnant of the $U(1)^\prime$ local symmetry. When the resonance condition for DM masses is fulfilled, we show that the elastic co-scattering processes between two components of dark matter ($u$-channel processes) are enhanced due to the Yukawa potential with a small effective mass for the lighter DM mediator, so we can use such co-scattering processes for dark matter to explain the small-scale problems at galaxies. Moreover, there are also semi-annihilation processes that two components of dark matter annihilate into one dark matter particle and a dark photon/Higgs, which are enhanced by the $u$-channel Sommerfeld factor. Focusing on some benchmark models for two-component dark matter satisfying the observed relic density, we obtain the bounds for the dark photon portal couplings from the direct detection for boosted dark matter, which is produced from the semi-annihilation processes at the galactic center.</description>

      <title>Heavy Field Effects on Inflationary Models in Light of ACT Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), when combined with Planck and DESI datasets, indicate a scalar spectral index $n_s$ larger than that reported in the Planck 2018 baseline, thereby challenging conventional Starobinsky-type ($\alpha$-attractor) inflationary scenarios at the $2\sigma$ level. In addition, the positive running of the spectral index $\alpha_s$ implied by the data provides strong constraints on these models. In this paper, we explore the possibility that the presence of an additional heavy field during inflation, with a mass of order the Hubble scale and a sizable mixing coupling to the inflaton, can reconcile such inflationary models with the ACT results by increasing both $n_s$ and $\alpha_s$, particularly in the strong-mixing regime. Furthermore, we extend this framework to traditional inflation models such as chaotic inflation and natural inflation, which have already been excluded by Planck alone, and show that they can be revived in certain regions of parameter space. Inflationary observables, including the spectral index $n_s$, the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, and the running $\alpha_s$, are computed within the single-field EFT approach, which is applicable even in the presence of a heavy field with large mixing. We also discuss the non-Gaussianity signatures arising from the heavy field, noting that parts of the parameter space are already excluded or can be tested in future observations. Finally, we present concrete model realizations that allow for such a large mixing.</description>

      <title>Transverse momentum Resummation and Analytic continuation into the Deep Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting information on the three-dimensional structure of hadrons from transverse-momentum data is a challenging task, requiring the separation of perturbative contributions under QCD control from genuinely non-perturbative effects, unavoidably affected by phenomenological bias. Standard approaches model transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) observables in impact-parameter space and compare them with data after Fourier inversion, generating an interplay between perturbative terms, non-perturbative models, and prescriptions used to extend perturbation theory beyond its natural domain. In this work, a consistent methodology to perform the Fourier inversion analytically is proposed, achieving a solid resummation of TMD parton distributions and cross sections directly in transverse-momentum space. The resummation is carried out to next-to-leading logarithmic (NLL) accuracy, validated against alternative prescriptions, and tested on experimental data. This framework provides a systematic procedure to analytically continue observables into the deep infrared, identifying two primary sources of non-perturbative effects: the low energy behavior of the strong coupling and of the parton distribution functions. This points to a paradigm shift in TMD phenomenology, where the structure of hadrons emerges from the dynamics of QCD itself rather than from flexible parametrizations with only indirect physical interpretation.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Cannibal Dark Matter: Constraints from Neutron Star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asymmetric dark matter can be efficiently captured by neutron stars via elastic scattering with nucleons and dark matter self scattering. The accumulated dark matter thermalizes and concentrates in the stellar interior, forming a dark matter core. In this work, we propose a novel framework in which a $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry allows for number-changing self-interactions of the form $3 \rightarrow 2$ within the dark sector. These cannibalistic reactions become increasingly efficient at high dark matter densities, leading to a significant depletion of the dark matter population in the stellar core. This number depletion heats up the neutron star above the standard cooling expectations, yielding observable thermal signatures in relatively old, isolated neutron stars, potentially detectable via James Webb Space Telescope. We show that even in the presence of other heating mechanisms, e.g. dark matter annihilation and kinetic heating, the cannibal heating dominates for certain parameter space. We demonstrate that the cannibal heating can predict detectable heating signatures in old neutron stars, thereby allowing a broader range of viable dark matter masses and couplings to the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Enhancements in velocity-dependent dark matter annihilation in Galactic subhalos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine velocity-dependent dark matter annihilation in subhalos using a sample of six Milky Way-like galaxies from the Aurgia simulation suite. We quantify the enhancement in the annihilation rate in subhalos when including the contribution from particles in the smooth component of the halo that overlap with the subhalos. The enhancement in the annihilation rate scales with the smooth component of the host halo dark matter density, and is evident for subhalos over the resolvable mass range. Maximal enhancement factors are ~ 48 for p-wave models, and ~ 37,000 for d-wave models. For p and d-wave annihilation models, ~ 13 and ~ 6 subhalos, respectively, across all six host halos have emission from dark matter annihilation in their direction that is above the foreground emission from the smooth dark matter component, and would therefore be resolvable as sources. Such subhalos with the most significant enhancement factors tend to be on the lower end of the mass range and located closer to the center of the host galaxy. We provide a prescription to calculate the enhancement for subhalos as a function of distance from the Galactic center, and use this to examine the impact on dark matter limits from a couple of example dwarf spheroidals. We show that, including the enhancement factors, limits from individual dwarf spheroidals are at a cross section scale that may approach those derived from the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Evaporating before Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) formed from the collapse of density fluctuations provide a unique window into the physics of the early Universe. Their evaporation through Hawking radiation around the epoch of Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) can leave measurable imprints on the primordial light-element abundances. In this work, we analyze in detail the effects of PBHs evaporating before BBN, with various intermediate steps understood analytically, and obtain the BBN constraint on PBHs within a transparent and reproducible framework. We find that, to produce observable effects on BBN, the PBH mass must exceed $10^{9}$ g, a threshold higher than that reported in some earlier studies. Slightly above $10^{9}$ g, the BBN sensitivity rapidly increases with the mass and then decreases, with the turning point occurring at $2\times10^{9}$ g. For PBHs in the mass range $[10^{9},\ 10^{10}]$ g, current measurements of BBN observables set an upper bound on the initial mass fraction parameter $\beta$ ranging from $10^{-17}$ to $10^{-19}$. To facilitate future improvements, we make our code publicly available, enabling straightforward incorporation of updated nuclear reaction rates, particle-physics inputs, and cosmological data.</description>

      <title>The 21 cm forest one-dimensional power spectrum as a probe of dark matter particles and primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of dark matter (DM) particles remains a pivotal challenge in modern cosmology. Current cosmological research on these phenomena primarily utilizes cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations and other late-time probes, which predominantly focus on large scales. We introduce a novel probe, the 21 cm forest signal, which can be used to investigate DM properties on small scales during the epoch of reionization, thereby addressing the gap left by other cosmological probes. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation from PBHs, can heat the intergalactic medium (IGM). This heating suppresses the amplitude of the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. Therefore, the 1D power spectrum provides an effective method for constraining DM properties. However, astrophysical heating processes in the early universe can also affect the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum. In this work, we assess the potential of using the SKA to observe the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum for constraining DM properties, under the assumption that astrophysical heating can be constrained reliably by other independent probes. Under low astrophysical heating conditions, the 1D power spectrum could constrain the DM annihilation cross section and decay lifetime to $\langle\sigma v\rangle \sim {10^{-31}}\,{\rm cm^{3}\,s^{-1}}$ and $\tau \sim {10^{30}}\,{\rm s}$ for ${10}\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles, and probe PBHs with masses $\sim {10^{15}}\,{\rm\,g}$ at abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \simeq 10^{-13}$. These constraints represent improvements of 5-6 orders of magnitude over current limits. Furthermore, the 21 cm forest 1D power spectrum has the potential to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe PBHs with masses above $10^{18}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes.</description>

      <title>Long-term neutrino emission from a core-collapse supernova with axion-photon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform long-term general-relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamic simulations for core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) which include the cooling effect induced by the coupling between axion-like particles (ALPs) and photons. We take into account the \kanji{photon} coalescence and the Primakoff effect, and investigate ALPs with the mass of 10\,MeV and the coupling constant $g_{a\gamma}$ of $1.0\times10^{-9}{\rm \,GeV^{-1}}$ to $7.0\times10^{-9}{\rm \,GeV^{-1}}$. It is found that the effects of the ALP cooling emerge in the late phase rather than the early phase and the ALP luminosities are always lower than the neutrino luminosity in our simulations. We estimate the number of neutrino events for Super-Kamiokande assuming a 10\,kpc CCSN. We conclude that signatures of ALPs could be found in the long-term neutrino signals from a nearby CCSN event in the future, even if $g_{a\gamma}$ is below an upper limit based on the conventional energy-loss argument.</description>

      <title>Search for Signatures of Dark Matter Annihilation in the Galactic Center with HAWC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct an indirect dark matter (DM) search in the Galactic Center, focusing on a square region within $\pm 9^{\circ}$ in Galactic longitude and latutide, using 2,865 days of data ($\sim$8 years) from the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory. We explore DM particles within the Weakly Interacting Massive Particles framework with masses from 1 TeV to 10 PeV. Analyzing three annihilation channels ($b\bar{b}$, $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$, $W^{+}W^{-}$) and three density profiles (Navarro-Frenk-White, Einasto, Burkert), we find no significant excess and set 95\% confidence-level upper limits on the velocity-weighted annihilation cross section. Our results provide the first constraints on DM particles well above 100 TeV using gamma-ray data from the Galactic Center, with the strongest limits $\mathcal{O}(10^{-24})$~cm$^{3}$/s, from the $\tau^{+}\tau^{-}$ channel and the Einasto profile.</description>

      <title>Quarkonia collectivity in large collision systems with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quarkonium production is one of the golden probes to study the quark--gluon plasma (QGP). Among many observables, the measurement of azimuthal anisotropies in quarkonium production sheds light on the collective behavior of heavy-flavor particles in a strongly interacting medium. In particular, the measurements of the elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) of quarkonia in Pb--Pb collisions at the LHC provide us direct evidence of heavy quark thermalization in the QGP. In these proceedings, new results of inclusive $\mathrm{J/\psi}$ elliptic flow measurement in Pb--Pb collisions carried out by the ALICE collaboration in Run 3 using three methods including event-plane, scalar-product and multi-particle correlation (cumulant) will be presented. The method of cumulant will give access to the $\mathrm{J/\psi}$ flow fluctuations at forward rapidity. Alongside the new flow measurements of $\mathrm{J/\psi}$, new results of $\mathrm{\Upsilon}(1S)$ flow measurement at forward rapidity in ALICE Run 3 will be presented as well with comparison to model calculations.</description>

      <title>Core or Halo? Two-Fluid Analysis of Dark Matter-Admixed Quarkyonic Stars in the Multi-Messenger Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we explore dark matter (DM) admixed quarkyonic stars (DAQSs) within a two-fluid formalism, where the normal/visible sector is modeled by a quarkyonic equation of state (EOS) in the Effective Relativistic Mean Field (E-RMF) framework and the DM component is treated as a degenerate fermionic gas with scalar and vector self-interactions. Our analysis begins with the mass-radius (M-R) relation, showing that the inclusion of DM enables stellar configurations to reach the mass range compatible with the GW190814 event. We identify both DM core and DM halo morphologies among the viable EOSs, with core dominated and halo dominated cases exhibiting distinct signatures. By fixing the stellar mass within the GW190814 range, we constrain the possible dark matter fractions and explore the role of different interaction channels. Using the EOSs consistent with these constraints, we further investigate the tidal deformability ($\Lambda$), moment of inertia (MOI), and stellar radius, finding broad agreement with constraints from GW170817, GW190814, and NICER. Finally, we compile the characteristic properties of DAQSs, including EOS type, DM fractions, morphology (core vs halo), and macroscopic observables in a comparative summary. This study provides a unified two-fluid framework to explore dense QCD matter and dark matter in the multi-messenger era, suggesting that the GW190814 secondary object could plausibly be interpreted as either a DM core or a DM halo quarkyonic star.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strong magnetic fields of neutron stars are closely linked to their observed thermal, spectral, and timing properties, such as the distribution of spin periods and their derivatives. To understand the evolution of astrophysical observables over time, it is essential to develop robust theoretical frameworks and numerical models that solve the coupled thermal and magnetic field evolution equations, incorporating detailed microphysical inputs like thermal and electrical conductivities and neutrino emission rates. These efforts are key to uncovering how the strength and geometry of magnetic fields change with age, ultimately shedding light on the diverse phenomenology of neutron stars. In this review, we outline the fundamental theory underlying magneto-thermal evolution models, with an emphasis on numerical methods and a comprehensive set of benchmark tests intended to guide current and future code development. We revisit established results from axisymmetric simulations, highlight recent progress in fully three-dimensional models, and offer a perspective on the anticipated developments in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>NSVZ-Compatible Three-Loop Gauge $\beta$-Functions and Regulator-Driven Scheme Structure in Supersymmetric Theories with Exponential Higher Covariant Derivative Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the three-loop gauge $\beta$-functions in general $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric gauge theories regularized by higher covariant derivatives (HCD) supplemented with Pauli--Villars subtraction. The all-structure three-loop form is known in the HCD framework (e.g.~\cite{Kazantsev2020,Haneychuk2022,Haneychuk2025}) and involves regulator-dependent parameters. Here we evaluate these parameters explicitly for the exponential regulators $R(x)=e^{x^n}$ and $F(x)=e^{x^m}$. We obtain the constants $A(n)$ and $B(m)$ in closed form, together with their large-$n,m$ asymptotics, and substitute them into the general three-loop expressions. This yields fully explicit, regulator-parameterized $\beta$-functions and a systematic expansion in $1/n$ and $1/m$ that cleanly organizes finite, scheme-dependent terms. We then exhibit finite coupling redefinitions that map the renormalized $\overline{\mathrm{DR}}$ result to an NSVZ-compatible scheme. Our analysis clarifies how exponential higher-derivative regulators preserve the NSVZ relation at the bare level and illustrates the regulator-driven structure of supersymmetric RG flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A semi-analytical model for the evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm has been shown to yield stellar mass-BH mass relations that reproduce both the JWST and pre-JWST observations. Either fuzzy or warm dark matter (FDM or WDM) would suppress the formation of the smaller galactic halos that play important roles in the CDM fit to the high-redshift SMBH data. Our analysis of the stellar mass-BH mass relation disfavours FDM fields with masses $&lt; 2.0\times 10^{-20}$ eV and WDM particles with masses $&lt; 7.2$ keV, both at the 95 % confidence level.</description>

      <title>Analytic structure of the MNS matrix with diagonal reflection symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.13024v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we survey the analytic structure of the MNS matrix with diagonal reflection symmetries. If the mass matrix of charged leptons $m_{e}$ is hierarchical (i.e., $|(m_{e})_{33}| \simeq m_{\tau} \gg |(m_{e})_{1i , j1}|$), by neglecting the 1-3 mixing of $m_{e}$, the MNS matrix is represented by four parameters and several sign degrees of freedom. By substituting the three observed mixing angles $\theta_{ij}$ as input parameters, the Dirac phase $\delta$ and the Majorana phases $\alpha_{2,3}$ are represented by functions of the 1-2 mixing of charged leptons $s_{e}$. The effective mass of double beta decay $m_{ee}$ is also displayed as a function of $s_{e}$ and the lightest neutrino mass $m_{1 \, \rm or \, 3}$. Because the generalized CP symmetries restrict the effective mass to near the maximum or minimum value in the whole parameter region, several scenarios are suggested to be excluded by the latest limit of the KAMLAND-Zen collaboration.</description>

      <title>Several conjectures from the hadron physics: The transient worlds beside(s) ours</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The past decades witnessed the golden era of hadron physics, which gives us a good opportunity to study the physics happening in a transient period of time. The development on the singly heavy baryons indicates that there exists the fine structure of hadron spectrum caused by the direct strong interaction, and the development on the exotic hadrons indicates that the residue strong interaction is capable of forming the hadronic molecules. Similar to the electromagnetic interaction, the strong interaction may be capable of forming some imaginable hadronic worlds. Moreover, there can be various worlds formed by various fundamental physical laws. Some hadrons have so transient lifetimes that they may not even be formed. We discuss whether these non-existent particles are capable of affecting our realistic world. We discuss what kinds of particles exist, and so can be observed, in our realistic world. We conjecture that the ratios $R \equiv M/\Gamma \gg 1/2$ ($M \tau \gg \hbar/2$) and $R \equiv M/\Gamma &lt; 1/2$ ($M \tau &lt; \hbar/2$) can be used to describe the particles existing and not-existing in our realistic world, respectively. Here $M$, $\Gamma$, and $\tau$ are the mass, width, and lifetime, respectively. We propose to use the ratio $R \equiv M/\Gamma \sim 1/2$ ($M \tau \sim \hbar/2$) to describe the particles quasi-existing in our realistic world, whose studies may allow us to go beyond the quantum physics and arrive at another type of boundary of our realistic world, that is from the existent to the non-existent. We propose to investigate the quasi-existent particles by studying the singly heavy baryons through various imperfect symmetries among them. We obtain an incidental conjecture that the lifetime and width may be quantized for the particles existing in our realistic world as \begin{equation*}M\tau=n\hbar/2~~~{\rm{and}}~~~M/\Gamma=n/2\,,~~~n=1,2,3\cdots\,.\end{equation*}</description>

      <title>Probing an ultralight QCD axion with electromagnetic quadratic interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14962v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The axion-gluon coupling is the defining feature of the QCD axion. This feature induces additional and qualitatively different interactions of the axion with standard model particles -- quadratic couplings. Previously, hadronic quadratic couplings have been studied and experimental implications have been explored especially in the context of atomic spectroscopy and interferometry. We investigate additional quadratic couplings to the electromagnetic field and electron mass. These electromagnetic quadratic couplings are generated at the loop level from threshold corrections and are expected to be present in the absence of fine-tuning. While they are generally loop-suppressed compared to the hadronic ones, they open up new ways to search for the QCD axion, for instance via optical atomic clocks. Moreover, due to the velocity spread of the dark matter field, the quadratic nature of the coupling leads to low-frequency fluctuations in any detector setup. These distinctive low-frequency fluctuations offer a way to search for heavier axions. We provide an analytic expression for the power spectral density of this low-frequency background and briefly discuss experimental strategies for a low-frequency background search.</description>

      <title>Role of unphysical neutrino phases in the phenomenology of consistently defined textures. Case study: traceless neutrino mass matrix</title>

Abstract: We highlight the role played by the unphysical phases in the definition of neutrino mass matrix, showing it does not relate to mere semantics, rather it has an effect on the phenomenology. As a case study, we take the neutrino mass matrix texture characterized by a vanishing trace, and study the effect of the phases, physical and unphysical, in its definition. We undergo a thorough phenomenological analysis, first (second) when the unphysical (CP) phases are vanishing, then move on to the general case where all phases exist. We stress that the effect of the unphysical phases on the phenomenology originates from changing the texture definition upon introducing them, while they are not observable. Finally we present a theoretical realization of the texture based on $A_5$ non-abelian flavor symmetry, which is also related to a consistently defined texture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to study the ultra-light bosons, where compact rotating objects undergo the phenomenon of quenched superradiance to create gravitational waves and neutrino flux signals. The neutrino flux results from appropriate coupling between the ultra-light bosons and the neutrinos. We consider a heavy sterile neutrino generation from ultralight scalar, which later results in active neutrino flux through neutrino oscillations, whereas we consider active neutrino generation directly from the vector bosons. We study the intertwining of gravitational waves and neutrino flux signals produced from a single source and elaborate if and when the signals can be detected in existing and upcoming experiments in a direct manner.</description>

      <title>Dark Dwarfs: Dark Matter-Powered Sub-Stellar Objects Awaiting Discovery at the Galactic Center</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of dark matter annihilation on objects with masses close to the sub-stellar limit, finding that the minimum mass for stable hydrogen burning is larger than the $\sim0.075 M_\odot $ value predicted in the Standard Model. Below this limit, cooling brown dwarfs evolve into stable dark matter-powered objects that we name dark dwarfs. The timescale of this transition depends on the ambient dark matter density $\rho_{\rm DM}$ and circular velocity $v_{\rm DM}$ but is independent of the dark matter mass. We predict a population of dark dwarfs close to the galactic center, where the dark matter density is expected to be $\rho_{\rm DM}\gtrsim 10^{3}$ GeV/cm$^3$. At larger galactic radii the dark matter density is too low for these objects to have yet formed within the age of the universe. Dark dwarfs retain their initial lithium-7 in mass ranges where brown/red dwarfs would destroy it, providing a method for detecting them.</description>

      <title>Probing the cosmic sterile-neutrino background with IceCube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we take a close look at the interaction between the TeV--PeV energy astrophysical neutrinos and a hypothetical cosmic sterile-neutrino background. These interactions yield absorption features, also called ``dips", in the astrophysical neutrino spectrum, which are studied using the deposited energy distribution of high-energy starting events (HESE) in the IceCube detector. We improve upon the previous analysis by including the effects of regeneration and a realistic source distribution on the propagation of astrophysical neutrinos. We use the latest 7.5-year HESE dataset and include the observation of Glashow resonance in our analysis. We evaluate the impact of these dips on the inferred spectral index and overall normalization of the astrophysical neutrinos. We find a mild preference for dips in the 300--800 TeV range, and the best-fit parameters for the mass of sterile-neutrino and the mediator are 0.5 eV and 23 MeV, respectively. We find that the inclusion of these absorption features lowers the spectral index of astrophysical neutrinos to $2.60^{+0.19}_{-0.16}$. We show qualitatively that the lower spectral index from HESE sample can reduce the disagreement with the Northern Tracks sample. We also forecast the event spectrum for IceCube-Gen2 for the two different fits.</description>

Abstract: We study the benefit of modern simulation-based inference to constrain particle interactions at the LHC. We explore ways to incorporate known physics structures into likelihood estimation, specifically morphing-aware estimation and derivative learning. Technically, we introduce a new and more efficient smearing algorithm, illustrate how uncertainties can be approximated through repulsive ensembles, and show how equivariant networks can improve likelihood estimation. After illustrating these aspects for a toy model, we target di-boson production at the LHC and find that our improvements significantly increase numerical control and stability.</description>

      <title>Maximal value for trilinear Higgs coupling in a 3-3-1 EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent efforts, both theoretical and experimental, have increasingly focused on the scalar potential of the Standard Model, with a highlight on the trilinear Higgs coupling. This parameter has long been recognized for its potential to test Beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) theories and its significance in understanding early cosmological dynamics. In order to broadly map BSM scenarios, a powerful tool is to devise its effective field theory (EFT) version for low-energies. In this work, we obtain a consistent EFT for a class of models based on the gauge group $SU(3)_c\times SU(3)_L\times U(1)_Y$. After properly matching the UV-complete theory at one-loop, we show that the EFT is a Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM), where some of the quartic couplings are naturally small. By imposing bounds from electroweak precision observables, collider, flavor, as well as theoretical considerations, we obtain that the maximum value of the trilinear Higgs coupling is more than four times larger than the SM prediction, potentially testable at the LHC Hi-Lumi upgrade and other future colliders. Moreover, we find that such large values are only attainable if one considers an out-of-alignment scenario, even if the deviation is very small.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we perform a complete calculation of the differential cross section for elastic neutrino-electron scattering at the one-loop level in the Standard Model (SM), by using up-to-date values of relevant input parameters in the on-shell renormalization scheme. A careful comparison with the calculation done by Sarantakos, Sirlin and Marciano more than forty years ago in the same scheme is carried out, and an excellent agreement is found if the same values of input parameters are taken. Then we apply our results to compute the event rates for the detection of reactor antineutrinos in both JUNO and TAO experiments, which are now under construction and will soon be in operation. It should be emphasized that one-loop radiative corrections in the SM must be taken into account in the first place when searching for possible new-physics effects in the coming era of precision neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group invariant mean-field model for QCD at finite isospin density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: QCD at nonzero isospin chemical potentials has phenomenological relevance for a series of physical systems and provides an ideal testground for the modeling of dense strongly interacting matter. The two-flavor quark-meson model is known to effectively describe the condensation of charged pions in QCD that occurs in this setting. In this paper, we derive a renormalization-group invariant mean-field formulation of the model and demonstrate that the resulting phase diagram and equation of state are in quantitative agreement with data from lattice QCD simulations at small and intermediate isospin chemical potentials. In particular, the speed of sound from the model shows an excess over the conformal bound as previously seen in lattice computations in agreement with chiral perturbation theory. We then consider the speed of sound in the limit of large isospin chemical potentials and see that it approaches the conformal limit from above, in qualitative agreement with recent lattice results and in quantitative agreement with perturbation theory in the presence of a BCS gap. Finally, we consider the phase diagram in the approach to the chiral limit. We find that within the model the chiral phase transition connects to the pion condensation phase boundary in the chiral limit and we discuss the implications for the properties of the chiral transition point.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we study neutrino spin oscillations in the case when they are gravitationally scattered off a rotating Kerr black hole surrounded by a thick magnetized accretion disk. We consider only toroidal magnetic field inside the disk. Neutrino spin precession is caused by the interaction of the neutrino magnetic moment with the magnetic field in the disk. Our treatment of the spin oscillations of the observed neutrino fluxes is based on numerical simulations of the propagation of a large number of incoming test neutrinos using High Performance Parallel Computing. We briefly discuss our results and their applications in the observations of astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Strong decays of $P_{\psi}^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$ within the Bethe-Salpeter framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By combining the effective Lagrangian and Bethe-Salpeter framework, we studied the mass spectra, wave functions, and strong decay widths of the two pentaquark states $P_\psi^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$ reported by LHCb in 2019. Taking into account both the mass ordering and the decay widths, our results favor the interpretation of $P_\psi^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$ as the isospin-$\frac12$ $[\bar D^*\Sigma_c]$ molecular states with $J^P$ configuration $(\frac{3}{2})^-$ and $(\frac12)^-$, respectively. We first calculate the one-boson-exchange interaction kernel of $[\bar D^*\Sigma_c]$ in the isospin-$\frac12$ configuration. Then we present the Bethe-Salpeter equation\,(BSE) and wave functions for the bound states of a vector meson and a $\frac12$ baryon with $J^P={\frac12}^-$ and ${\frac32}^-$. The obtained mass results for the $(\frac32)^-$ and $(\frac12)^-$ are $4.442$ and $4.457$ GeV, respectively. Combining the effective Lagrangians and the BS wave functions, we further calculate the strong decay channels $\bar D^{(*)0}\Lambda_c^+$, $J/\psi(\eta_c) p$, and $\bar D\Sigma_c^{(*)}$ for the two $P_\psi^N$ states. In the favored $\frac32^-$ and $\frac12^-$ configuration, the obtained total widths are $21.8$ MeV and $13.0$ MeV, respectively, which are substantially consistent with the LHCb data. Our results suggest that $\bar D^{0}\Lambda_c^+$ and $\bar D^{(*)0}\Lambda_c^+$ are the dominant decay channels to detect $P_\psi^N(4440)^+$ and $P_\psi^N(4457)^+$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum properties of the Higgs-boson decays into four fermions via two vector bosons $(H\to VV^*\to 4f)$. In particular, we focus on the case of two different-flavour lepton pairs $(H\to ZZ^*\to \mu^+\mu^- e^+ e^-)$. We compute the quantum-information observables for the corresponding two-qutrit system $(ZZ)$ at next-to-leading order electroweak (NLO EW) accuracy in the SM. We find that NLO EW corrections lead to giant (order 1) effects in some specific cases, significantly altering the extraction of observables quantifying the quantum correlations. We identify observables that are robust and can be used to extract reliable information. Finally, we discuss possible new physics (NP) effects, parametrised via an effective-field-theory approach. We show how quantum observables can increase the sensitivity to NP also for the process considered in this study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the femtoscopic correlation functions of charmonium-nucleon pairs, utilizing the lattice QCD phase shifts provided by the HAL QCD Collaboration. A ``model-independent'' formalism is employed to transform scattering phase shifts directly into momentum correlation functions, thereby circumventing the approximations inherent in traditional methods, such as the Lednick\'y-Lyuboshits model. The $J/\psi$-$p$ correlation functions, including spin-averaged and partial-wave results, are predicted using near-physical pion mass lattice results. The $\eta_c$-$p$ correlation function is calculated for the first time. The derived correlation functions provide critical references for future experiments, such as those at the LHC, where high-precision measurements of charmonium-nucleon correlations could unveil valuable insights into non-perturbative QCD dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Concentrating on the mass differences relative to $P_{\psi}^{N}(4312)^+$, we systematically investigate the spectra of doubly-charmed pentaquark states in the compact $ccqq\bar{q}$ ($q=u, d, s$) configuration. The assumption that the observed $P_{\psi}^{N}(4312)^+$ is a compact hidden-charm pentaquark with $I(J^P)=\frac12(\frac32^-)$ is adopted. We also study the properties of strong decays within a simple rearrangement scheme. The results indicate that the $I(J^P)=\frac12(\frac12^-)$ $ccnn\bar{n}$ with $I_{nn}=0$ where $n$ denotes $u$ or $d$ quark, $I(J^P)=0(\frac12^-)$ $ccnn\bar{s}$, and $I(J^P)=0(\frac12^-)$ $ccns\bar{n}$ ground states should be stable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analyticity and unitarity constrain certain classe of new physics models by linking flavor-conserving and flavor-violating four-fermion interactions. In this work, we explore how these theoretical relations impact flavor-violating rare top quark decays. Building on our previous results, we present an updated analysis of the decays $t \to q \ell^+ \ell^-$ and identify interesting target branching ratios in the range of $10^{-7}$ to $10^{-6}$ once current experimental constraints from flavor-conserving processes are taken into account. We extend the analysis to top decays with lepton flavor violation, deriving correlations among the relevant Wilson coefficients and confronting them with existing limits from LEP and the LHC. Notably, we find that current searches for $t \to q e \mu$ are already probing theoretically motivated regions of parameter space. These results strongly support continued efforts to explore flavor-violating top decays as a powerful probe of new physics.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that QCD-like gauge dynamics can be consistently embedded within the Dark Technicolor (DTC) paradigm by invoking the extended Most Attractive Channel hypothesis, thereby revitalizing conventional technicolor scenarios. In this framework, the Higgs mass is generated dynamically while remaining consistent with electroweak precision tests, including constraints from the $S$ parameter. The flavor problem is resolved by incorporating the Standard Hierarchical VEVs Model, whereas a simple Froggatt--Nielsen construction is shown to be incompatible. Couplings of techni-hadrons such as $\rho_{\rm TC}$ and $\eta_{\rm TC}$ to Standard Model fermions are highly suppressed, leading to negligible direct fermionic signatures. Nevertheless, DTC mesons remain testable at the HL-LHC, HE-LHC, and future 100~TeV collider, with promising discovery channels including $\bar{b}b$, $\tau^+\tau^-$, $t\bar{t}$, and $\gamma\gamma$.</description>

      <title>Distribution Functions of $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^0$ Baryons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Treating baryons as quark + interacting-diquark bound states, a symmetry-preserving formulation of a vector$\,\times\,$vector contact interaction (SCI) is used to deliver an extensive, coherent set of predictions for $\Lambda, \Sigma^0$ baryon unpolarised and polarised distribution functions (DFs) -- valence, glue, and four-flavour separated sea -- and compare them with those of a like-structured nucleon. $\Lambda, \Sigma^0$ baryons are strangeness negative-one isospin partners within the SU$(3)$-flavour baryon octet. This makes such structural comparisons significant. The study reveals impacts of diquark correlations and SU$(3)$-flavour symmetry breaking on $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^0$ structure functions, some of which are significant. For instance, were it not for the presence of axialvector diquarks in the $\Sigma^0$ at the hadron scale, the $s$ quark could carry none of the $\Sigma^0$ spin. The discussion canvasses issues that include helicity retention in hard scattering processes; the sign and size of polarised gluon DFs; and the origin and decomposition of baryon spins. Interpreted judiciously, the SCI analysis delivers an insightful explanation of baryon structure as expressed in DFs.</description>

      <title>{\tt ggxy}: a flexible library to compute gluon-induced cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the library {\tt ggxy}, written in {\tt C++}, which can be
  used to compute partonic and hadronic cross sections for gluon-induced
  processes with at least one closed heavy quark loop.
  It is based on analytic ingredients which avoids, to a large extent,
  expensive numerical integration. This results in significantly shorter
  run-times than other similar tools.
  Modifying input parameters, changing the renormalization scheme
  and varying renormalization and factorization scales is straightforward.
  In Version~1 of {\tt ggxy} we implement all routines which are needed to
  compute partonic and hadronic cross sections for Higgs boson pair production
  up to next-to-leading order in QCD. We provide flexible interfaces
  and allow the user to interact with the built-in amplitudes at
  various levels.</description>

      <title>An extension of the SM with vector-like quarks and hypothetical heavy bosons: model independent parametrisation at NLO order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A model independent parametrization of an extension of the Standard Model including vector-like quarks, new heavy gauge bosons and an extra scalar, is introduced. Theoretical constraints on the model couplings and hypothetical particle masses are established by making use of perturbative unitarity. The consistency of the model renormalization and implementation, within the complex mass scheme for narrow widths, is verified. The production of heavy charged and neutral gauge bosons which subsequently decay to vector-like quarks at the LHC are investigated at both leading-order and next-to-leading order. The predictions of the model are obtained by using three approaches: the narrow-width-approximation, the complex mass scheme and a mix of both, where the advantages and weaknesses of each method are emphasized. This study demonstrates that, for certain configurations, off-shell effects remain significant even when the width-to-mass ratios of the unstable particles are sufficiently small, rendering the narrow-width approximation unreliable and necessitating the use of the complex mass scheme. The predictions are compared with CMS {\tt run II} data, where lower bounds on the charged heavy gauge boson mass are set as function of the free parameter normalizing their coupling to quarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by more precise recent measurements of the $B \to \eta \ell \nu$ and $D_{(s)} \to \eta^{(\prime)}\ell \nu$ decays, we employ state-of-the-art parametrizations to describe the $B_{(s)}, D_{(s)} \to \eta^{(\prime)}$ form factors across the full $q^2$ range, fitting them to the latest light-cone sum rule results. Using these results, we compute the branching ratios for all relevant decays and compare them with experimental data, finding good agreement. Additionally, we examine the validity and precision of the extracted $\eta$-$\eta'$ mixing angle in the context of heavy meson decays. By combining our predictions for the $B, D, D_s \to \eta^{(\prime)}$ form factors with recent semileptonic decay measurements, we extract the CKM elements $|V_{ub}|$, $V_{cs}$, and $V_{cd}$. We also provide tests of the lepton flavour universality in the $B, D, D_s \to \eta^{(\prime)} \ell \nu$ decays and present results for the forward-backwards asymmetries in these decays. Our findings indicate that the extracted values are becoming comparable in precision to those obtained from more conventional semileptonic decay analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A physically viable ansatz for quark mass matrices must satisfy certain constraints, like the constraint imposed by CP-violation. In this article we study a concrete example, by looking at some generic matrices with a nearly democratic texture, and the implications of the constraints imposed by CP-violation, specifically the Jarlskog invariant. This constraint reduces the number of parameters from six to five, implying that the six mass eigenvalues of the up-quarks and the down-quarks are interdependent, which in our approach is explicitly demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Prediction of $QQqq\bar{s}$ molecular pentaquarks within the extended local hidden gauge approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate hadronic molecular states with the quark contents $ccqq\bar{s}$, $bbqq\bar{s}$, and $bcqq\bar{s}$ $(q=u,d)$ by employing the extended local hidden gauge approach. Considering that the $S$-wave meson-baryon interactions are dominated by vector meson exchange, the coupled channels scattering amplitudes are obtained by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation in its on-shell form. We find that the poles appearing on the complex Riemann sheet are potential candidates for dynamically generated molecular pentaquark states. The results suggest the existence of a total of fourteen molecular states with quantum numbers $I(J^{P})=0(1/2^{-})$, $0(3/2^{-})$, and $0(5/2^{-})$, which arise from the interactions of the $K^{(*)}\Xi_{cc}^{(*)}$, $K^{(*)}\Xi_{bb}^{(*)}$, $K^{(*)}\Xi_{bc}^{(*)}$, and $K^{(*)}\Xi_{bc}^{'}$ channels, respectively. Their binding energies are calculated to be about $0.1-33$ MeV, and this range depends on the free parameter of the theory. Our research contributes to the spectroscopic studies of hadronic molecular pentaquark states.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a two real scalar singlet extension of the two Higgs doublet model. We study the vacuum structure, the bounded from below conditions, the restrictions from the oblique parameters S,T and U, as well as the unitarity constraints. We submit the model to collider and Dark Matter experimental constraints and explore its allowed parameter space. We compare randomly populated simulations, simulations starting near the alignment limit, and a Machine Learning based exploration. Using Evolutionary Strategies, we efficiently search for regions with two Dark Matter candidates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, interest in quantum computing has significantly increased, driven by its potential advantages over classical techniques. Quantum machine learning (QML) exemplifies one of the important quantum computing applications that are expected to surpass classical machine learning in a wide range of instances. This paper addresses the performance of QML in the context of high-energy physics (HEP). As an example, we focus on the top-quark tagging, for which classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been effective but fall short in accuracy when dealing with highly energetic jet images. In this paper, we use a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for this task and compare its performance with CNN using a classical noiseless simulator. We compare various setups for the QCNN, varying the convolutional circuit, type of encoding, loss function, and batch sizes. For every quantum setup, we design a similar setup to the corresponding classical model for a fair comparison. Our results indicate that QCNN with proper setups tend to perform better than their CNN counterparts, particularly when the convolution block has a lower number of parameters. For the higher parameter regime, the QCNN circuit was adjusted according to the dimensional expressivity analysis (DEA) to lower the parameter count while preserving its optimal structure. The DEA circuit demonstrated improved results over the comparable classical CNN model.</description>

      <title>Growth of Gravitational Wave Spectrum from Sound Waves in a Universe with Generic Expansion Rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23666v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a compact analytical expression for the growth factor $\Upsilon$, which characterizes how the gravitational wave spectrum sourced by sound waves evolves in a universe with a generic expansion history. Assuming the dominant energy density scales as $\rho \propto a^{-3(1+w)}$, we obtain $\Upsilon =\frac{2[1-y^{3(w-1)/2}]}{3(1-w)}$, where $y = a(t)/a(t_s)$ is the ratio of the scale factor at a later time $t$ to that at $t_s$ when gravitational wave production from sound waves starts. This general result reduces to known forms in radiation-and matter-dominated eras, thereby extending previous formulas to a broader class of cosmological backgrounds. The derivation assumes only that the source is stationary, making $\Upsilon$ a universal factor that captures gravitational wave growth in various scenarios-not limited to phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Cosmic superstrings in large volume compactifications: PTAs, LISA and time-varying tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background (SGWB) from cosmic superstrings offers one of the few known possibilities to test String Theory within current experimental reach. However, in order to be compatible with the existing constraints, the tension of a cosmic superstring network is required to lie several orders of magnitude below the Planck scale. This is naturally realized in string compactifications where the volume of the extra dimensions is parametrically large (in string units). We estimate the GW spectrum arising from cosmic superstrings in such scenarios, providing analytical formulae as well as numerical results. Crucially, we do so within a semi-realistic string cosmology scenario, taking into account various modified cosmological epochs (such as kination or early matter domination) induced by the presence of moduli and a time-dependent string tension. We show that part of the spectrum generically lies within reach of LISA and ET, with a large class of models predicting a characteristic drop in the amplitude which may be robustly probed by LISA. The corresponding signal would encode information on the dynamics of moduli and reheating. On the other hand, the ultra-high frequency part of the spectrum can be significantly enhanced by a long, early phase of kination with time-varying tension, yielding a spectral index unique to this set-up.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06125v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A few members of the recently discovered class of long-period transients have been identified as binaries with white-dwarf primaries. In most cases, however, electromagnetic data are inconclusive, and isolated magnetars or compact binaries remain viable. If the pulsation period matches that of the orbit -- as is the case for ILT J1101+5521 and GLEAM-X J0704--37 -- some of these elusive radio transients could be gravitational-wave bright in the mHz band. Space-based interferometers could thus be used to provide independent constraints on their nature. We quantify the signal-to-noise ratio for the known systems under various scenarios and show that a few could be detectable for sufficiently large chirp masses. Astrophysical implications for (non)detections are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Cosmological Principle, which states that the Universe is homogeneous and isotropic (when averaged on large scales), is the foundational assumption of Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) cosmologies such as the current standard Lambda-Cold-Dark-Matter ({\Lambda}CDM) model. This simplification yields an exact solution to the Einstein field equations that relates space and time through a single time-dependent scale factor, which defines cosmological observables such as the Hubble parameter and the cosmological redshift. The validity of the Cosmological Principle, which underpins modern cosmology, can now be rigorously tested with the advent of large, nearly all-sky catalogs of radio galaxies and quasars. Surprisingly, the dipole anisotropy in the large-scale distribution of matter is found to be inconsistent with the expectation from kinematic aberration and Doppler boosting effects in a perturbed FLRW universe, which is the standard interpretation of the observed dipole in the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Although the matter dipole agrees in direction with that of the CMB dipole, it is anomalously larger, demonstrating that either the rest frames in which matter and radiation appear isotropic are not the same, or that there is an unexpected intrinsic anisotropy in at least one of them. This discrepancy now exceeds 5{\sigma} in significance. We review these recent findings, as well as the potential biases, systematic issues, and alternate interpretations that have been suggested to help alleviate the tension. We conclude that the cosmic dipole anomaly poses a serious challenge to FLRW cosmology, and the standard {\Lambda}CDM model in particular, as an adequate description of our Universe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this White Paper, we present the potential of the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry (eXTP) mission to constrain the equation of state of dense matter in neutron stars, exploring regimes not directly accessible to terrestrial experiments. By observing a diverse population of neutron stars - including isolated objects, X-ray bursters, and accreting systems - eXTP's unique combination of timing, spectroscopy, and polarimetry enables high-precision measurements of compactness, spin, surface temperature, polarimetric signals, and timing irregularity. These multifaceted observations, combined with advances in theoretical modeling, pave the way toward a comprehensive description of the properties and phases of dense matter from the crust to the core of neutron stars. Under development by an international Consortium led by the Institute of High Energy Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the eXTP mission is planned to be launched in early 2030.</description>

      <title>Cosmographic analysis of sign-switching dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the well-studied $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, we propose and investigate a class of dynamical dark energy models that evolve from a negative cosmological constant, transitioning to a positive value at low redshifts. Specifically, we introduce a dark energy framework based on a generalised ladder-step function for the cosmological constant. Furthermore, we present two additional models in which the cosmological constant undergoes a smooth sign change at a specified redshift. We provide a detailed discussion of the construction and theoretical properties of these models, analysing their background cosmological evolution using a cosmographic approach and the statefinder hierarchy parameters. Our results are compared with those obtained for the standard $\Lambda$CDM and $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM models. We also perform a careful analysis of the types of singularities that may arise in these models due to a sign change in the cosmological constant. Notably, we show that a continuous sign change removes the sudden singularity present in the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model, replacing it with a milder $w$-singularity.</description>

      <title>Inflationary attractors and radiative corrections in light of ACT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of the recent results from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which have provided a notable shift in the constraints on $(n_s, r)$ and placed several otherwise viable models of inflation in tension with the latest data, we investigate the possible effects that radiative corrections can have on $\xi$-attractor and $\alpha$-attractor models of inflation. These models, which share much in common with Starobinsky-Higgs inflation, have likewise been put under pressure by these results. We find that percent (and even sub-percent) level radiative corrections can easily shift both of these classes of inflation models comfortably into the regions of parameter space favoured by the most recent constraints. However, the flexibility under such corrections (which one can argue should be generally expected) calls into question to what extent it is possible to precisely pin down model-specific predictions for important cosmological observables.</description>

      <title>Dark matter signatures in cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study analyzes an 11-year cosmic ray dataset of positrons and antiprotons for planetary dependencies related to gravitationally focused dark matter streams. By projecting event timestamps onto planetary heliocentric longitudes, structured flux modulations are found. The results resemble previously reported planetary relationships in solar and terrestrial observables. This supports the possibility that streaming dark matter particles are focused toward Earth by solar system bodies, including the Moon. The findings suggest further searches using other cosmic ray channels, including existing very high-energy gamma-ray data.</description>

      <title>Updated constraints on the primordial power spectrum at sub-Mpc scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primordial power spectrum of matter density perturbations contains highly valuable information about new fundamental physics, in particular cosmological inflation, but is only very weakly constrained observationally for small cosmological scales $k\gtrsim 3\,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. We derive novel constraints, $\mathcal{P}_\mathcal{R}(k)\lesssim 5\cdot10^{-6}$ over a large range of such scales, from the formation of ultracompact minihalos in the early universe. Unlike most existing constraints of this type, our results do not rest on the assumption that dark matter can annihilate into ordinary matter.</description>

      <title>Confronting infrared divergences in de Sitter: loops, logarithms and the stochastic formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A well-established result in quantum field theory in four-dimensional de Sitter space is that the vacuum state of a massless scalar field breaks the de Sitter isometry group, leading to time-dependent (secular) growth in correlation functions computed in inflationary coordinates. This behavior is widely believed to extend to more general theories involving light scalar fields with weak non-derivative interactions. In such cases, secular growth is thought to be further amplified by loop corrections, and the stochastic formalism is often regarded as the appropriate framework to resum these infrared effects. In this article we challenge this prevailing view. A crucial distinction must be made between two cases: a massless scalar field protected by a shift symmetry, and a light scalar without such a symmetry. In the former, the shift symmetry enforces derivative interactions, yielding observables in which secular growth plays no physical role. In the latter, although correlation functions develop infrared divergences in the massless limit, they remain fully invariant under the de Sitter isometry group. We analyze the structure of these divergences arising from loop integrals and show that, in the soft-momentum limit, they do not alter the time dependence of tree-level correlators. In fact, using a de Sitter-invariant renormalization scheme based on Wilson's axioms for integration, these divergences can be systematically removed order by order. We therefore conclude that neither massless nor light scalar fields in de Sitter space exhibit genuine secular growth. We further discuss the implications of these findings for the validity and scope of the stochastic approach to inflation.</description>

      <title>New computational methods in lattice gauge theory -- quantum computation and tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice QCD calculations have been conducted using large-scale classical computers based on the Lagrangian formalism of field theory for the past 40 years. On the other hand, the advent of quantum computers has brought increasing attention to first-principles computational methods based on the Hamiltonian formalism compatible with these machines. In this talk, we discuss recent results on how to calculate hadronic properties using the Hamiltonian formalism.</description>

      <title>XTE J1814-338 as a strange star admixed with bosonic dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the compact star XTE J1814-338 can be explained as a strange star admixed with self-interacting bosonic dark matter (BDM), provided the dark matter fraction exceeds approximately 70\%. This interpretation leads to a robust constraint on the BDM particle mass: $m_\chi \lesssim 307(\lambda/\pi)^{1/4}$ MeV ($\lambda$ is the dimensionless coupling constant of the BDM). The result is independent of formation scenario and microphysical details and is falsifiable by future NICER and LIGO/Virgo observations.</description>
