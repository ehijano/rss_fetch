      <title>Stochastic Volatility Model with Sticky Drawdown and Drawup Processes: A Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new financial model, the stochastic volatility model with sticky drawdown and drawup processes (SVSDU model), which enables us to capture the features of winning and losing streaks that are common across financial markets but can not be captured simultaneously by the existing financial models. Moreover, the SVSDU model retains the advantages of the stochastic volatility models. Since there are not closed-form option pricing formulas under the SVSDU model and the existing simulation methods for the sticky diffusion processes are really time-consuming, we develop a deep neural network to solve the corresponding high-dimensional parametric partial differential equation (PDE), where the solution to the PDE is the pricing function of a European option according to the Feynman-Kac Theorem, and validate the accuracy and efficiency of our deep learning approach. We also propose a novel calibration framework for our model, and demonstrate the calibration performances of our models on both simulated data and historical data. The calibration results on SPX option data show that the SVSDU model is a good representation of the asset value dynamic, and both winning and losing streaks are accounted for in option values. Our model opens new horizons for modeling and predicting the dynamics of asset prices in financial markets.</description>

      <title>The fundamental representation of pricing adjustments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article consolidates and extends past work on derivative pricing adjustments, including XVA, by providing an encapsulating representation of the adjustment between any two derivative pricing functions, within an Ito SDE/parabolic PDE framework. We give examples of this representation encapsulating others from the past 20 years, ranging from a well known option pricing adjustment introduced by Gatheral, to the collection of semi-replication XVA originating from Burgard &amp; Kjaer. To highlight extensions, we discuss certain meta-adjustments beyond XVA, designed to help signal and mitigate XVA model risk.</description>
