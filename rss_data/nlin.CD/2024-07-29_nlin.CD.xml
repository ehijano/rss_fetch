      <title>Scars of Kramers-Henneberger atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron motion in an atom driven by an intense linearly polarized laser field can exhibit a laser-dressed stable state, referred to as the Kramers-Henneberger (KH) state or KH atom. Up to now, the existence conditions of this state rely on the presence of a double well in the KH potential, obtained by averaging the motion over one period of the laser. However, the approximation involved in the averaging is largely invalid in the region of the double well structure; therefore this raises the question of its relevance for identifying signatures of these exotic states. Here we present a method to establish conditions for the existence of the KH atom based on a nonperturbative approach. We show that the KH atom is structured by an asymmetric periodic orbit with the same period as the laser field in a wide range of laser parameters. Its imprint is clearly visible on the wavefunction in quantum simulations. We identify the range of parameters for which this KH state is effective, corresponding to an elliptic periodic orbit.</description>

      <title>Tipping detection using climate networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of robust Early Warning Signals (EWS) is necessary to quantify the risk of crossing tipping points in the present-day climate change. Classically, EWS are statistical measures based on time series of climate state variables, without exploiting their spatial distribution. However, spatial information is crucial to identify the starting location of a transition process, and can be directly inferred by satellite observations. By using complex networks constructed from several climate variables on the numerical grid of climate simulations, we seek for network properties that can serve as EWS when approaching a state transition. We show that network indicators such as the normalized degree, the average length distance and the betweenness centrality are capable of detecting tipping points at the global scale, as obtained by the MIT general circulation model in a coupled-aquaplanet configuration for CO$_2$ concentration-driven simulations. The applicability of such indicators as EWS is assessed and compared to traditional methods. We also analyse the ability of climate networks to identify nonlinear dynamical patterns.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Reservoir Computing for Multivariate Denoising of Severely Contaminated Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interdependence and high dimensionality of multivariate signals present significant challenges for denoising, as conventional univariate methods often struggle to capture the complex interactions between variables. A successful approach must consider not only the multivariate dependencies of the desired signal but also the multivariate dependencies of the interfering noise. In our previous research, we introduced a method using machine learning to extract the maximum portion of ``predictable information" from univariate signal. We extend this approach to multivariate signals, with the key idea being to properly incorporate the interdependencies of the noise back into the interdependent reconstruction of the signal. The method works successfully for various multivariate signals, including chaotic signals and highly oscillating sinusoidal signals which are corrupted by spatially correlated intensive noise. It consistently outperforms other existing multivariate denoising methods across a wide range of scenarios.</description>

      <title>Learning the Chaotic and Regular Nature of Trajectories in Hamiltonian Systems with Lagrangian descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the application of Machine Learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM), to unveil the chaotic and regular nature of trajectories in Hamiltonian systems using Lagrangian descriptors. Traditional chaos indicators, while effective, are computationally expensive and require an exhaustive study of the parameter space to establish the classification thresholds. By using SVMs trained on a dataset obtained from the analysis of the dynamics of the double pendulum Hamiltonian system, we aim at reducing the complexity of this process. Our trained SVM models demonstrate high accuracy when it comes to classifying trajectories in diverse Hamiltonian systems, such as for example in the four-well Hamiltonian, the H\'enon-Heiles system and the Chirikov Standard Map. The results indicate that SVMs, when combined with Lagrangian descriptors, offer a robust and efficient method for chaos classification across different dynamical systems. Our approach not only simplifies the classification process but also is highlighting the potential of Machine Learning algorithms in the study of nonlinear dynamics and chaos.</description>

      <title>Interplay between the Lyapunov exponents and phase transitions of charged AdS black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between the standard or extended thermodynamic phase structure of various AdS black holes and the Lyapunov exponents associated with the null and time-like geodesics. We consider dyonic, Bardeen, Gauss-Bonnet, and Lorentz-symmetry breaking massive gravity black holes and calculate the Lyapunov exponents of massless and massive particles in unstable circular geodesics close to the black hole. We find that the thermal profile of the Lyapunov exponents exhibits distinct behaviour in the small and large black hole phases and can encompass certain aspects of the van der Waals type small/large black hole phase transition. We further analyse the properties of Lyapunov exponents as an order parameter and find that its critical exponent is $1/2$, near the critical point for all black holes considered here.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space Diffusion in Systems with Approximate Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) universality is the defining property of quantum mechanical chaotic systems, and can be probed by observables like the spectral form factor (SFF). In this paper, we describe systematic deviations from RMT behaviour at intermediate time scales in systems with approximate symmetries. At early times, the symmetries allow us to organize the Hilbert space into approximately decoupled sectors, each of which contributes independently to the SFF. At late times, the SFF transitions into the final ramp of the fully mixed chaotic Hamiltonian. For approximate continuous symmetries, the transitional behaviour is governed by a universal process that we call Hilbert space diffusion. The diffusion constant corresponding to this process is related to the relaxation rate of the associated nearly conserved charge. By implementing a chaotic sigma model for Hilbert-space diffusion, we formulate an analytic theory of this process which agrees quantitatively with our numerical results for different examples.</description>

      <title>Physics-Guided Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning for Swimming in Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent diffusion causes particles placed in proximity to separate. We investigate the required swimming efforts to maintain a particle close to its passively advected counterpart. We explore optimally balancing these efforts with the intended goal by developing and comparing a novel Physics-Informed Reinforcement Learning (PIRL) strategy with prescribed control (PC) and standard physics-agnostic Reinforcement Learning strategies. Our PIRL scheme, coined the Actor-Physicist, is an adaptation of the Actor-Critic algorithm in which the Neural Network parameterized Critic is replaced with an analytically derived physical heuristic function (the physicist). This strategy is then compared with an analytically computed optimal PC policy derived from a stochastic optimal control formulation and standard physics-agnostic Actor-Critic type algorithms.</description>

      <title>Krylov complexity as an order parameter for quantum chaotic-integrable transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Krylov complexity has recently emerged as a new paradigm to characterize quantum chaos in many-body systems. However, which features of Krylov complexity are prerogative of quantum chaotic systems and how they relate to more standard probes, such as spectral statistics or out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs), remain open questions. Recent insights have revealed that in quantum chaotic systems Krylov state complexity exhibits a distinct peak during time evolution before settling into a well-understood late-time plateau. In this work, we propose that this Krylov complexity peak (KCP) is a hallmark of quantum chaotic systems and suggest that its height could serve as an `order parameter' for quantum chaos. We demonstrate that the KCP effectively identifies chaotic-integrable transitions in the mass-deformed Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model at both infinite and finite temperature, aligning with results from spectral statistics and OTOCs. Our findings offer a new diagnostic tool for quantum chaos that is operator-independent, potentially leading to more `universal' insights and a deeper understanding of general properties in quantum chaotic systems.</description>
