      <title>Visual Event Detection over AI-Edge LEO Satellites with AoI Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non terrestrial networks (NTNs), particularly low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems, play a vital role in supporting future mission critical applications such as disaster relief. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-native communications enable LEO satellites to act as intelligent edge nodes capable of on board learning and task oriented inference. However, the limited link budget, coupled with severe path loss and fading, significantly constrains reliable downlink transmission. This paper proposes a deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC)-based downlink scheme for AI-native LEO networks, optimized for goal-oriented visual inference. In the DJSCC approach, only semantically meaningful features are extracted and transmitted, whereas conventional separate source-channel coding (SSCC) transmits the original image data. To evaluate information freshness and visual event detection performance, this work introduces the age of misclassified information (AoMI) metric and a threshold based AoI analysis that measures the proportion of users meeting application specific timeliness requirements. Simulation results show that the proposed DJSCC scheme provides higher inference accuracy, lower average AoMI, and greater threshold compliance than the conventional SSCC baseline, enabling semantic communication in AI native LEO satellite networks for 6G and beyond.</description>

      <title>Learned Digital Codes for Over-the-Air Computation in Federated Edge Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables wireless devices to collaboratively train a centralised model without sharing raw data, but repeated uplink transmission of model updates makes communication the dominant bottleneck. Over-the-air (OTA) aggregation alleviates this by exploiting the superposition property of the wireless channel, enabling simultaneous transmission and merging communication with computation. Digital OTA schemes extend this principle by incorporating the robustness of conventional digital communication, but current designs remain limited in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. This work proposes a learned digital OTA framework that improves recovery accuracy, convergence behaviour, and robustness to challenging SNR conditions while maintaining the same uplink overhead as state-of-the-art methods. The design integrates an unsourced random access (URA) codebook with vector quantisation and AMP-DA-Net, an unrolled approximate message passing (AMP)-style decoder trained end-to-end with the digital codebook and parameter server local training statistics. The proposed design extends OTA aggregation beyond averaging to a broad class of symmetric functions, including trimmed means and majority-based rules. Experiments on highly heterogeneous device datasets and varying numbers of active devices show that the proposed design extends reliable digital OTA operation by more than 10 dB into low SNR regimes while matching or improving performance across the full SNR range. The learned decoder remains effective under message corruption and nonlinear aggregation, highlighting the broader potential of end-to-end learned design for digital OTA communication in FEEL.</description>

      <title>Generative Bayesian Spectrum Cartography: Unified Reconstruction and Active Sensing via Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity spectrum cartography is pivotal for spectrum management and wireless situational awareness, yet it remains a challenging ill-posed inverse problem due to the sparsity and irregularity of observations. Furthermore, existing approaches often decouple reconstruction from sensing, lacking a principled mechanism for informative sampling. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a unified diffusion-based Bayesian framework that jointly addresses spectrum reconstruction and active sensing. We formulate the reconstruction task as a conditional generation process driven by a learned diffusion prior. Specifically, we derive tractable, closed-form posterior transition kernels for the reverse diffusion process, which enforce consistency with both linear Gaussian and non-linear quantized measurements. Leveraging the intrinsic probabilistic nature of diffusion models, we further develop an uncertainty-aware active sampling strategy. This strategy quantifies reconstruction uncertainty to adaptively guide sensing agents toward the most informative locations, thereby maximizing spectral efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art interpolation, sparsity-based, and deep learning baselines in terms of reconstruction accuracy, sampling efficiency, and robustness to low-bit quantization.</description>

      <title>RIS-Empowered OTFS Modulation With Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling in High-Mobility Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-mobility wireless communication systems suffer from severe Doppler spread and multi-path delay, which degrade the reliability and spectral efficiency of conventional modulation schemes. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation offers strong robustness in such environments by representing symbols in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, while faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling can further enhance spectral efficiency through intentional symbol packing. Meanwhile, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) provide a promising means to improve link quality via passive beamforming. Motivated by these advantages, we propose a novel RIS-empowered OTFS modulation with FTN signaling (RIS-OTFS-FTN) scheme. First, we establish a unified DD-domain input-output relationship that jointly accounts for RIS passive beamforming, FTN-induced inter-symbol interference, and DD-domain channel characteristics. Based on this model, we provide comprehensive analytical performance for the frame error rate, spectral efficiency, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), etc. Furthermore, a practical RIS phase adjustment strategy with quantized phase selection is designed to maximize the effective channel gain. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations under a standardized extended vehicular A (EVA) channel model validate the theoretical results and provide key insights into the trade-offs among spectral efficiency, PAPR, input back-off (IBO), and error performance, with some interesting insights.The proposed RIS-OTFS-FTN scheme demonstrates notable performance gains in both reliability and spectral efficiency, offering a viable solution for future high-mobility and spectrum-constrained wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Viterbi State Selection for Discrete Pinching Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching antennas enable dynamic control of electromagnetic wave propagation through reconfigurable radiating structures, but selecting an optimal subset of antennas remains a combinatorial problem with exponential complexity. This letter considers antenna subset selection for a waveguide-fed pinching antenna array serving ground users under a time-division access scheme. The achievable rate depends on the coherent superposition of the effective complex channel gains and is therefore highly sensitive to the relative phase alignment of the activated antennas. To address the prohibitive complexity of exhaustive search, we propose a Viterbi state selection (VSS) algorithm that exploits the phase structure of the combined received signal. The trellis state is defined by a quantized representation of the phase of the accumulated complex gain, and a Viterbi-based survivor rule is used to prune dominated antenna subsets across stages. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the same antenna selection and rate as exhaustive search, while reducing the computational complexity from exponential to polynomial in the number of available antennas.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic signatures of causality in Bayesian networks and hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing causality in multivariate systems involves establishing how information is generated, distributed and combined, and thus requires tools that capture interactions beyond pairwise relations. Higher-order information theory provides such tools. In particular, Partial Information Decomposition (PID) allows the decomposition of the information that a set of sources provides about a target into redundant, unique, and synergistic components. Yet the mathematical connection between such higher-order information-theoretic measures and causal structure remains undeveloped. Here we establish the first theoretical correspondence between PID components and causal structure in both Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. We first show that in Bayesian networks unique information precisely characterizes direct causal neighbors, while synergy identifies collider relationships. This establishes a localist causal discovery paradigm in which the structure surrounding each variable can be recovered from its immediate informational footprint, eliminating the need for global search over graph space. Extending these results to higher-order systems, we prove that PID signatures in Bayesian hypergraphs differentiate parents, children, co-heads, and co-tails, revealing a higher-order collider effect unique to multi-tail hyperedges. We also present procedures by which our results can be used to characterize systematically the causal structure of Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. Our results position PID as a rigorous, model-agnostic foundation for inferring both pairwise and higher-order causal structure, and introduce a fundamentally local information-theoretic viewpoint on causal discovery.</description>

      <title>Holographic MIMO Empowered NOMA-ISAC for 6G: Rate-Splitting Enhanced Near-Field Modeling, Multi-Objective Optimization, and Statistical Performance Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with extremely large apertures enable transformational capabilities for sixth-generation (6G) integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). However, existing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) ISAC works inadequately address: (i) holographic near-field propagation with sub-wavelength antenna spacing; (ii) rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) integration for interference management; (iii) statistical validation under realistic impairments. This paper presents a comprehensive holographic MIMO NOMA-ISAC framework featuring: \textbf{(1)} Unified near-field modeling incorporating spatially-correlated Rayleigh fading, spherical wavefront propagation, and sub-wavelength antenna coupling effects; \textbf{(2)} Novel rate-splitting enhanced NOMA (RS-NOMA) architecture enabling flexible interference management between sensing and communication; \textbf{(3)} Multi-objective optimization suite comparing hybrid alternating optimization with successive convex approximation (HAO-SCA), weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE), semidefinite relaxation (SDR), fractional programming (FP), and deep reinforcement learning (DRL); \textbf{(4)} Rigorous statistical validation over 5000 Monte Carlo runs with significance testing across massive MIMO scenarios (up to 1024 antennas). Results demonstrate that RS-NOMA achieves \SI{11.7}{\percent} higher sum-rate than conventional NOMA and \SI{18.8}{\percent} over WMMSE at matched sensing utility. Sensing CRLB improvements of \SI{2.4}{\decibel} are confirmed with 99\% statistical confidence. The framework establishes rigorous foundations for practical 6G holographic MIMO ISAC deployment.</description>

      <title>Sign-Aware Multistate Jaccard Kernels and Geometry for Real and Complex-Valued Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a sign-aware, multistate Jaccard/Tanimoto framework that extends overlap-based distances from nonnegative vectors and measures to arbitrary real- and complex-valued signals while retaining bounded metric and positive-semidefinite kernel structure. Formally, the construction is a set- and measure-theoretic geometry: signals are represented as atomic measures on a signed state space, and similarity is given by a generalized Jaccard overlap of these measures. Each signal is embedded into a nonnegative multistate representation, using positive/negative splits for real signals, Cartesian and polar decompositions for complex signals, and user-defined state partitions for refined regime analysis. Applying the Tanimoto construction to these embeddings yields a family of $[0,1]$ distances that satisfy the triangle inequality and define positive-semidefinite kernels usable directly in kernel methods and graph-based learning. Beyond pairwise distances, we develop coalition analysis via M\"obius inversion, which decomposes signal magnitude into nonnegative, additive contributions with exact budget closure across coalitions of signals. Normalizing the same embeddings produces probability measures on coordinate -- state configurations, so that the distance becomes a monotone transform of total variation and admits a regime -- intensity decomposition. The resulting construction yields a single, mechanistically interpretable distance that simultaneously provides bounded metric structure, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting within one sign-aware framework, supporting correlograms, feature engineering, similarity graphs, and other analytical tools in scientific and financial applications.</description>

      <title>Composable, unconditional security without a Quantum secret key: public broadcast channels and their conceptualizations, adaptive bit transmission rates, fidelity pruning under wiretaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine public broadcast, forward conceptual, and backward conceptual, Quantum channels in the context of communication protocols that are independent of secret keys. Given research directions of interest previously identified in arXiv: 1804.01797, besides converse upper bounds on the bit transmission rate obtained by the author in recent work (arXiv: 2507.03035), additional possibilities remain, including: (1) determining whether aspects of QKD dependent protocols can be incorporated into steps of QKD independent protocols; (2) whether there would be any amplification to the Quantum-classical performance gap that Alice and Bob can exploit towards prospective Quantum advantage; (3) formulating the conditions under which secrecy and authentication can be simultaneously achieved. To characterize the conditions for which secrecy can be achieved with high probability, we argue that there not only exists suitable protocols which enable Alice and Bob to map into the authenticated space of bit codewords with high probability, but also that forward conceptual channels, through cascading, can significantly increase Eve's probability of false acceptance. Albeit the fact that secrecy, along with conceputalizations of the public broadcast channel, were initially discussed by Maurer for QKD dependent protocols, determining whether aspects of such protocols can be adapted for unconditional security without the use of a secret key is of great interest to explore. We demonstrate that Eve's error probability, through the cascading procedure, can be analyzed with the Holevo information under an optimal decoder. Furthermore, through post-processing of the outputs of a Completely Positive Trace Preserving (CPTP) map, we also demonstrate how to decrease Holevo sum quantities with data-processing and entropy-continuity bounds.</description>

      <title>Towards a point-to-point CV-QKD system: Implementation challenges and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an analysis of the practical challenges and implementation perspectives of point-to-point continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) systems over optical fiber. The study addresses the physical layer, including the design of transmitters, quantum channels, and receivers, with emphasis on impairments such as attenuation, chromatic dispersion, polarization fluctuations, and coexistence with classical channels. We further examine the role of digital signal processing (DSP) as the bridge between quantum state transmission and classical post-processing, highlighting its impact on excess noise mitigation, covariance matrix estimation, and reconciliation efficiency. The post-processing pipeline is detailed with a focus on parameter estimation in the finite-size regime, information reconciliation using LDPC-based codes optimized for low-SNR conditions, and privacy amplification employing large-block universal hashing. From a hardware perspective, we discuss modular digital architectures that integrate dedicated accelerators with programmable processors, supported by a reference software framework (CV-QKD-ModSim) for algorithm validation and hardware co-design. Finally, we outline perspectives for the deployment of CV-QKD in Brazil, starting from metropolitan testbeds and extending toward hybrid fiber/FSO and space-based infrastructures. The work establishes the foundations for the first point-to-point CV-QKD system in Brazil, while providing a roadmap for scalable and interoperable quantum communication networks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Anytime-Valid Tests for Composite Nulls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of designing optimal level-$\alpha$ power-one tests for composite nulls. Given a parameter $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and a stream of $\mathcal{X}$-valued observations $\{X_n: n \geq 1\} \overset{i.i.d.}{\sim} P$, the goal is to design a level-$\alpha$ power-one test $\tau_\alpha$ for the null $H_0: P \in \mathcal{P}_0 \subset \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{X})$. Prior works have shown that any such $\tau_\alpha$ must satisfy $\mathbb{E}_P[\tau_\alpha] \geq \tfrac{\log(1/\alpha)}{\gamma^*(P, \mathcal{P}_0)}$, where $\gamma^*(P, \mathcal{P}_0)$ is the so-called $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$ or minimum divergence of $P$ to the null class. In this paper, our objective is to develop and analyze constructive schemes that match this lower bound as $\alpha \downarrow 0$.
  We first consider the finite-alphabet case~($|\mathcal{X}| = m &lt; \infty$), and show that a test based on \emph{universal} $e$-process~(formed by the ratio of a universal predictor and the running null MLE) is optimal in the above sense. The proof relies on a Donsker-Varadhan~(DV) based saddle-point representation of $\mathrm{KL}_{\inf}$, and an application of Sion's minimax theorem. This characterization motivates a general method for arbitrary $\mathcal{X}$: construct an $e$-process based on the empirical solutions to the saddle-point representation over a sufficiently rich class of test functions. We give sufficient conditions for the optimality of this test for compact convex nulls, and verify them for H\"older smooth density models. We end the paper with a discussion on the computational aspects of implementing our proposed tests in some practical settings.</description>

      <title>Information-directed sampling for bandits: a primer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Multi-Armed Bandit problem provides a fundamental framework for analyzing the tension between exploration and exploitation in sequential learning. This paper explores Information Directed Sampling (IDS) policies, a class of heuristics that balance immediate regret against information gain. We focus on the tractable environment of two-state Bernoulli bandits as a minimal model to rigorously compare heuristic strategies against the optimal policy. We extend the IDS framework to the discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing a modified information measure and a tuning parameter to modulate the decision-making behavior. We examine two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and the scenario involving one fair coin. In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds. This work serves as a pedagogical synthesis, aiming to bridge concepts from reinforcement learning and information theory for an audience of statistical physicists.</description>

Abstract: Statistical inference in contextual bandits is complicated by the adaptive, non-i.i.d. nature of the data. A growing body of work has shown that classical least-squares inference may fail under adaptive sampling, and that constructing valid confidence intervals for linear functionals of the model parameter typically requires paying an unavoidable inflation of order $\sqrt{d \log T}$. This phenomenon -- often referred to as the price of adaptivity -- highlights the inherent difficulty of reliable inference under general contextual bandit policies.
  A key structural property that circumvents this limitation is the \emph{stability} condition of Lai and Wei, which requires the empirical feature covariance to concentrate around a deterministic limit. When stability holds, the ordinary least-squares estimator satisfies a central limit theorem, and classical Wald-type confidence intervals -- designed for i.i.d. data -- become asymptotically valid even under adaptation, \emph{without} incurring the $\sqrt{d \log T}$ price of adaptivity.
  In this paper, we propose and analyze a penalized EXP4 algorithm for linear contextual bandits. Our first main result shows that this procedure satisfies the Lai--Wei stability condition and therefore admits valid Wald-type confidence intervals for linear functionals. Our second result establishes that the same algorithm achieves regret guarantees that are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors, demonstrating that stability and statistical efficiency can coexist within a single contextual bandit method. Finally, we complement our theory with simulations illustrating the empirical normality of the resulting estimators and the sharpness of the corresponding confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>A Covariance-Surrogate Framework for Movable-Antenna Enabled Anti-Jamming with Unknown Jammers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20380v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a movable antenna (MA) enabled anti-jamming optimization problem, where a legitimate uplink system is exposed to multiple jammers with unknown jamming channels. To enhance the anti-jamming capability of the considered system, an MA array is deployed at the receiver, and the antenna positions and the minimum-variance distortionless-response (MVDR) receive beamformer are jointly optimized to maximize the output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). The main challenge arises from the fact that the interference covariance matrix is unknown and nonlinearly dependent on the antenna positions. To overcome these issues, we propose a surrogate objective by replacing the unknown covariance with the sample covariance evaluated at the current antenna position anchor. Under a two-timescale framework, the surrogate objective is updated once per block (contains multiple snapshots) at the current anchor position, while the MVDR beamformer is adapted on a per-snapshot basis. We establish a local bound on the discrepancy between the surrogate and the true objective by leveraging matrix concentration inequalities, and further prove that a natural historical-averaging surrogate suffers from a non-vanishing geometric bias. Building on these insights, we develop a low-complexity projected trust-region (TR) surrogate optimization (PTRSO) algorithm that maintains the locality of each iteration via TR constraints and enforces feasibility through projection, which is guaranteed to converge to a stationary point near the anchor. Numerical results verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PTRSO algorithm, which consistently achieves higher output SINR than existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Goal-Oriented Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Goal-oriented communications offer an attractive alternative to the Shannon-based communication paradigm, where the data is never reconstructed at the Receiver (RX) side. Rather, focusing on the case of edge inference, the Transmitter (TX) and the RX cooperate to exchange features of the input data that will be used to predict an unseen attribute of them, leveraging information from collected data sets. This chapter demonstrates that the wireless channel can be used to perform computations over the data, when equipped with programmable metasurfaces. The end-to-end system of the TX, RX, and MS-based channel is treated as a single deep neural network which is trained through backpropagation to perform inference on unseen data. Using Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM), it is shown that this Metasurfaces-Integrated Neural Network (MINN) can achieve performance comparable to fully digital neural networks under various system parameters and data sets. By offloading computations onto the channel itself, important benefits may be achieved in terms of energy consumption, arising from reduced computations at the transceivers and smaller transmission power required for successful inference.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Two-Dimensional Constacyclic Codes using Common Zero Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09915v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional $(\lambda_1, \lambda_2)$-constacyclic codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ of area $M N$, where $q$ is some power of prime $p$ with $\gcd(M,p)=1$ and $\gcd(N,p)=1$. With the help of common zero (CZ) set, we characterize 2-D constacyclic codes. Further, we provide an algorithm to construct an ideal basis of these codes by using their essential common zero (ECZ) sets. We also describe the dual of 2-D constacyclic codes. Finally, we provide an encoding scheme for generating 2-D constacyclic codes from the generator tensor, implementable in a parallel fashion. Through examples, we illustrate that 2-D constacyclic codes can have better minimum distance compared to their cyclic counterparts with the same code area and code rate, generalizing prior work over 2-D binary cyclic coded arrays.</description>

      <title>FedMeld: A Model-dispersal Federated Learning Framework for Space-ground Integrated Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To bridge the digital divide, space-ground integrated networks (SGINs) are expected to deliver artificial intelligence (AI) services to every corner of the world. One key mission of SGINs is to support federated learning (FL) at a global scale. However, existing space-ground integrated FL frameworks involve ground stations or costly inter-satellite links, entailing excessive training latency and communication costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose an infrastructure-free federated learning framework based on a model dispersal (FedMeld) strategy, which exploits periodic movement patterns and store-carry-forward capabilities of satellites to enable parameter mixing across large-scale geographical regions. We theoretically show that FedMeld leads to global model convergence and quantify the effects of round interval and mixing ratio between adjacent areas on its learning performance. Based on the theoretical results, we formulate a joint optimization problem to design the staleness control and mixing ratio (SC-MR) for minimizing the training loss. By decomposing the problem into sequential SC and MR subproblems without compromising the optimality, we derive the round interval solution in a closed form and the mixing ratio in a semi-closed form to achieve the optimal latency-accuracy tradeoff. Experiments using various datasets demonstrate that FedMeld achieves superior model accuracy while significantly reducing communication costs as compared with traditional FL schemes for SGINs.</description>

      <title>On the Optimality of Random Partial Sphere Coverings in High Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10607v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given \( N \) geodesic caps on the unit sphere in \( \mathbb{R}^d \), and whose total normalized surface area sums to one, what is the maximal surface area their union can cover? In this work, we provide an asymptotically sharp upper bound for an antipodal partial covering of the sphere by $N \in (\omega(1),e^{o(\sqrt{d})})$ congruent caps, showing that the maximum proportion covered approaches \( 1 - e^{-1} \) as $d\to\infty$. We discuss the relation of this result to the optimality of random polytopes in high dimensions, the limitations of our technique via the Gaussian surface area bounds of K. Ball and F. Nazarov, and its applications in computer science theory.</description>

      <title>A General Error-Theoretical Analysis Framework for Constructing Compression Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth in parameter size and computational complexity of deep models poses significant challenges for efficient deployment. The core problem of existing compression methods is that different layers of the model have significant differences in their tolerance to compression levels. For instance, the first layer of a model can typically sustain a higher compression level compared to the last layer without compromising performance. Thus, the key challenge lies in how to allocate compression levels across layers in a way that minimizes performance loss while maximizing parameter reduction. To address this challenge, we propose a Compression Error Theory (CET) framework, designed to determine the optimal compression level for each layer. Taking quantization as an example, CET leverages differential expansion and algebraic geometry to reconstruct the quadratic form of quantization error as ellipsoids and hyperbolic paraboloids, and utilizes their geometric structures to define an error subspace. To identify the error subspace with minimal performance loss, by performing orthogonal decomposition of the geometric space, CET transforms the optimization process of the error subspace into a complementary problem. The final theoretical analysis shows that constructing the quantization subspace along the major axis results in minimal performance degradation. Through experimental verification of the theory, CET can greatly retain performance while compressing. Specifically, on the ResNet-34 model, CET achieves nearly 11$\times$ parameter compression while even surpassing performance comparable to the original model.</description>

      <title>ISAC Network Planning: Sensing Coverage Analysis and 3-D BS Deployment Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks strive to deliver both high-precision target localization and high-throughput data services across the entire coverage area. In this work, we examine the fundamental trade-off between sensing and communication from the perspective of base station (BS) deployment. Furthermore, we conceive a design that simultaneously maximizes the target localization coverage, while guaranteeing the desired communication performance. In contrast to existing schemes optimized for a single target, an effective network-level approach has to ensure consistent localization accuracy throughout the entire service area. While employing time-of-flight (ToF) based localization, we first analyze the deployment problem from a localization-performance coverage perspective, aiming for minimizing the area Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (A-CRLB) to ensure uniformly high positioning accuracy across the service area. We prove that for a fixed number of BSs, uniformly scaling the service area by a factor \kappa increases the optimal A-CRLB in proportion to \kappa^{2\beta}, where \beta is the BS-to-target pathloss exponent. Based on this, we derive an approximate scaling law that links the achievable A-CRLB across the area of interest to the dimensionality of the sensing area. We also show that cooperative BSs extend the coverage but yield marginal A-CRLB improvement as the dimensionality of the sensing area grows.</description>
