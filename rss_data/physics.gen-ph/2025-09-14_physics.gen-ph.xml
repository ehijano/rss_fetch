      <title>Do we need an alternative to local gauge coupling to electromagnetic fields?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The local gauge coupling through the recipe $\partial_\mu \psi \to \partial_\mu \psi + iqA_\mu \psi$ works perfectly well with Dirac spinors in QED and in the gauge theories of the Standard Model, but for scalar fields it has a peculiarity: it generates in the Lagrangian a coupling term $J_\mu A^\mu$ in which $J_\mu$ does not coincide with the conserved N\"other current associated to the global gauge symmetry. If we want to preserve a coupling through a conserved current, which is true for spinors and has definite physical grounds, one possibility is to renounce to the principle of local gauge symmetry and couple the fields to the extended electrodynamics by Aharonov-Bohm. No differences with the usual theory appear for fermion systems when strict local charge conservation applies. In particular, if we consider the non-relativistic quantum theory as the low-energy limit of the relativistic theory, we would expect no modifications of Schr\"odinger equation when applied to fermion systems. However, when scalar boson systems are considered, like Cooper pairs quasi-particles in superconductors, in the new formulation the electromagnetic (e.m.) fields include a source, additional to the usual conserved four-current, and, besides, the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation acquires a new term, proportional to $\mathbf{A}^2$, which leads to observable consequences, like a sizable change in the estimate of the magnetic penetration depth in superconductors, compatible with the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Grassmann algebraic field theory, entanglement and fermionic hidden clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With Grassmann algebra as fermions in a Feynman path-integral approach to field theory, the quantum correlation can be recovered. This means that a quantum field of Grassmann variables can explain the entanglement. In turn, this agrees with Einstein's ideas of field theory and local principles. Moreover, Grassmann variables can refer to an empirical reality like e.g. in QCD. Hence, a possible but still fictitious fermionic field in conjunction with the previously introduced hidden clocks as Einstein variables, likely describes this empirical reality.</description>
