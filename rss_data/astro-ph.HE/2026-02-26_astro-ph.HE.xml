      <title>Global Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Monster Shocks in Neutron Star Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waves launched from the neutron star surface or inner magnetosphere propagate through the magnetosphere as small perturbations, but can grow relative to the background magnetic field and steepen into ``monster shocks'' -- ultra-relativistic magnetized shocks which can power high-energy emission from magnetars, neutron star mergers and collapse. They occur in magnetically dominated plasma and are described by relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). We present global relativistic MHD simulations of monster shocks in unperturbed and perturbed (``wrinkled'') backgrounds with a global dipolar geometry. Our simulations confirm analytical predictions for equatorial shocks and provide new insight into the behavior of oblique shocks off the equator. Simulations where the shock is formed through Alfv\'{e}n mode to fast mode conversion are also presented, demonstrating the generic nature of the monster shock mechanism. We explore how the presence of additional modes in the magnetosphere modifies the shock behavior. Modes of comparable amplitude can fragment the shock front, substantially reduce the magnetization, produce localized enhancements in the Lorentz factor relative to an unperturbed dipole background, and intermittently generate additional shocks along a line of sight.</description>

      <title>Collapse of Magnetized White Dwarfs as site of Heavy Element Formation and Kilonova Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first end-to-end calculation connecting the accretion-induced collapse (AIC) of a magnetized, rapidly rotating white dwarf to observable kilonova signatures, combining 2D general-relativistic neutrino-magnetohydrodynamic simulations, followed by radiation hydrodynamics with in-situ nuclear network and 2D Monte Carlo radiative transfer with spatially resolved heating rates. Unlike all previous unmagnetized AIC models - which predicted proton-rich, $^{56}$Ni-dominated ejecta - strong magnetic fields eject ${\sim 0.2 M_\odot}$ of neutron-rich material $(\langle Y_e \rangle \sim 0.24)$ on dynamical timescales, before neutrino irradiation can raise the electron fraction, enabling strong $r$-process nucleosynthesis up to and beyond the third peak. The resulting kilonova is lanthanide-rich $(X_{\rm lan} \approx 6\%)$ and dominated by near-infrared emission. We compute synthetic light curves in the LSST and JWST bands and find striking agreement, without parameter tuning, between the observations of AT 2023vfi/GRB 230307A and our broadband light curves for polar viewing angles. These results establish magnetized AIC as a viable channel for heavy $r$-process element production and a compelling progenitor candidate for long-duration gamma-ray bursts with kilonova signatures.</description>

      <title>Shock-induced chiral magnetic effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak-interaction-mediated chiral imbalance generation in idealized massless electrons during core-collapse supernovae was once proposed to be the source of strong magnetic fields found in neutron stars. The effect goes by the name of chiral plasma instability (CPI). However, it was found that a finite electron mass damps out this process, inactivating the instability and preventing magnetic field growth. In this work we show that the instability can survive in the presence of abrupt density and temperature perturbation that drives the system sufficiently far out of weak equilibrium. As an example, we work with such perturbations generated by shockwaves which are common during both core collapse as well as neutron star mergers. We find that the chiral imbalance resulting from shock waves, under the right conditions of density and temperature, can sustain the chiral plasma instability despite the damping from the electron mass. Additionally, in an already magnetized medium, the chiral magnetic effect resulting from shock wave density and temperature perturbation can generate substantial ohmic heating. Our results imply that shockwaves during core-collapse supernovae and merging neutron stars can act as a source of strong heating in a magnetized medium as well as CPI.</description>

      <title>Complex Analysis of Askaryan Radiation: UHE-$\nu$ Identification and Reconstruction using the Hilbert Envelope of Observed Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of ultra-high energy neutrinos (UHE-$\nu$), with enegies above 10 PeV, has been a long-time goal in astroparticle physics. Autonomous, radio-frequency (RF) UHE-$\nu$ detetectors have been deployed in polar regions that rely on the Askaryan effect in ice for the neutrino signal. The Askaryan effect occurs when the excess negative charge within a UHE-$\nu$ cascade radiates in a dense medium. UHE-$\nu$ can induce cascades that radiate in the RF bandwidth above thermal backgrounds. To identify UHE-$\nu$ signals in data from Askaryan-class detectors, analytic models of the Askaryan electromagnetic field have been created and matched to simulations and laboratory measurements. These models describe the Askaryan electromagnetic field, but leave the effects of signal propagation through polar ice and RF channel response to simulations. In this work, a fully analytic Askaryan model that accounts for these effects is presented. First, formulas for the observed voltage trace and its Hilbert envelope are calculated. Second, the analytic model is compared to UHE-$\nu$ signals at 100 PeV from NuRadioMC, a key Monte Carlo toolset in the field. Correlation coefficients between the analytic signal envelope and MC data in excess of $0.94$ are found, and 99.99% of UHE-$\nu$ signals pass a correlation threshold of $\rho\geq 0.4$. Analysis of RF thermal noise reveals that just 0.2 background events have $\rho\geq 0.4$ in 5 years at a 1 Hz thermal trigger rate. Finally, we describe future work related to the measurement of the logarithm of the UHE-$\nu$ cascade energy.</description>

      <title>Short-duration GRB 250221A Afterglow Driven by Two-Component Jets from merger of compact star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB 250221A is a short gamma-ray burst (GRB) at redshift $z=0.768$, with a duration of 1.8 s and no extended emission in either Swift/BAT or Konus-Wind bands. A remarkable re-brightening feature in both optical and X-ray bands was observed at $\sim 0.6$ days after the burst trigger, but no supernova or kilonova signature was detected. The burst properties and empirical correlations or distributions (e.g., duration, spectral hardness, location in the Amati correlation, $\varepsilon-$value, $f_{\rm eff}$ parameter, and physical offset) favor a compact binary merger origin. However, a dense circumburst medium with $n\sim 80\rm~cm^{-3}$, obtained by adopting the energy injection into a jet to interpret the late-time re-brightening is inconsistent with the compact binary merger origin. In this paper, we propose a two-component jet model to explain the multiwavelength afterglow observations of GRB 250221A, in which the relativistic narrow jet ($\rm \theta_{c} \sim 3.8^\circ$) produces the prompt and the early decay afterglow emission, while the mildly relativistic wide jet ($\rm \theta_{w} \sim 4.4^\circ$) dominates at later times, resulting in the observed re-brightening feature. If this is the case, one can obtain a lower medium density with $n\sim 0.72\rm~cm^{-3}$ which is a little bit higher than that of short GRBs in merger environments, but falls into the reasonable and acceptable range. Finally, a possible kilonova emission is also discussed within the scenario of compact star merger origin of GRB 250221A.</description>

      <title>Constraints on neutrino emission and hadronic flux from 1LHAASO catalog $\gamma$-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IceCube has detected neutrino emission from the Galactic Plane (GP) at a significance of $4.5\sigma$, though its origin remains uncertain. Utilizing ten years of IceCube muon-track data, we investigate potential correlations between the GP neutrinos and $\gamma$-ray sources in the first LHAASO catalog (1LHAASO). To avoid issues caused by spectral extrapolation, this analysis focuses on sources detected by the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA). We employ an unbinned likelihood analysis to search for neutrino emission and constrain the hadronic $\gamma$-ray component of these sources. Neither single-source searches nor stacking analyses reveal significant neutrino signals. The stacking analysis indicates that the 1LHAASO WCDA population contributes at most $\sim$20\% to the diffuse GP neutrino flux measured by IceCube. The total hadronic contribution to the cumulative $\gamma$-ray emission from all WCDA sources is constrained to be at most $\sim$$60\%$, suggesting a predominantly leptonic origin for the $\gamma$-ray emission from the LHAASO source population. Even accounting for unresolved sources below the detection threshold, we estimate the total neutrino flux from all discrete sources (resolved plus unresolved) reaches at most about 40\% of the observed GP neutrino flux. These results support that the bulk of the GP neutrino emission is mainly from truly diffuse processes, i.e., cosmic-ray interactions with the interstellar medium, rather than from unresolved point sources.</description>

      <title>AT2024lhc and AT2024kmq in the landscape of featureless tidal disruption events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study AT2024kmq and AT2024lhc, two tidal disruption events (TDEs) with blue featureless spectra associated with high-mass black holes ($M_{\rm BH}\sim 10^8\,M_\odot$). Both events show optical precursors consistent with shock dissipation from stream self-intersection. Their X-ray emission is luminous ($L_{\rm X}\sim 10^{44}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}}$), highly variable (with minimum observed variability timescales of 1.3\,hr and 4.8\,hr for factor of $\sim3$ flux changes), long-lasting ($&gt;1\,\rm yr$), emerging no later than the optical peak, and well characterized by power-laws with $1.7&lt;\Gamma&lt;3$ (where $f_\nu \propto \nu^{1-\Gamma}$). The X-ray properties and radio non-detections support a compact corona ($\lesssim 10 r_{\rm g}$) producing Comptonized X-ray emission. Using all published featureless TDEs, we find statistically significant bimodality in the distribution of their peak UV/optical blackbody luminosities and radii. We assemble a comparison TDE sample with early-time X-ray observations with eROSITA, in which we find different $M_{\rm BH}$ distributions in TDEs with different X-ray spectral evolution properties: low-mass black holes ($M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^6 M_\odot$) remain soft ($\Gamma&gt;4$) within $t\lesssim 2$\,yr, intermediate masses ($\sim 10^7 M_\odot$) transition from soft to hard at $\sim$1 yr, while high masses ($\sim 10^8 M_\odot$) are hard ($1.5&lt;\Gamma\lesssim 3$) from the outset. We interpret this result as evidence that the soft-to-hard state transition in TDEs occurs at the critical threshold of $\dot{M}_{\rm acc} \sim 0.03 \dot M_{\rm Edd}$ (similar to X-ray binaries), using the fact that the transition timescale predicted by simple disk theory scales with black hole mass as $t_{\rm tr}\propto M_{\rm BH}^{-3/4}$.</description>

      <title>$r$-mode stabilization in rotating hyperon-rich neutron stars and its implications for GW190814</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The GW190814 event, involving a black hole of mass $22.2$--$24.3 M_{\odot}$ and a compact object of mass $2.50$--$2.67 M_{\odot}$, challenges our understanding of the mass gap between the heaviest neutron stars and the lightest black holes. If the secondary is a neutron star exceeding $2.5 M_{\odot}$, hyperons are likely to appear in its core, softening the equation of state. Rapid rotation can offset some of this softening, enabling higher maximum masses, but it may simultaneously excite the Chandrasekhar--Friedman--Schutz $r$-mode instability. Bulk viscosity arising from nonleptonic weak interactions in hyperonic matter provides an efficient damping mechanism that can stabilize such configurations. In this work, we investigate the combined effects of rotation, thermal evolution, and hyperon-induced bulk viscosity on the stability of massive neutron stars. We demonstrate a direct connection between the suppression of $r$-mode instabilities and the long-term dynamical stability of hyperon-rich stars, offering a plausible interpretation of the GW190814 secondary as a rapidly rotating, hyperon-rich neutron star rather than a low-mass black hole. Our unified framework extends beyond previous studies restricted to static equations of state or extreme viscous damping assumptions, providing new insights into the stability of massive, exotic neutron star configurations.</description>

      <title>Spectral and photometric variability of SS 433 observed with XRISM and simultaneous optical and near-infrared telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from coordinated multiwavelength observations of the SS 433, obtained with XRISM, optical telescopes, and near-infrared camera during 2024 April and 2025 March. The XRISM exposures amounted to ~200 ks in 2024 and ~100 ks in 2025. With XRISM/Resolve's high spectral resolution and large effective area, we clearly resolved numerous emission lines even in short time segments, achieving improved accuracy in Doppler-shift measurements relative to earlier observations. The simultaneously obtained X-ray and optical Doppler shifts suggest a possible tendency for the optical emission to lag slightly behind the X-rays. In the Resolve data, the Doppler shifts of the two jet components exhibited apparent asymmetries, with jet speeds fluctuating around ~0.26$\pm$0.01$c$ in 2024 and ~0.30$\pm$0.01$c$ in 2025. The velocity variations indicated modulations on a timescale of ~6.3 d, with a phase offset of about -90$^{\circ}$ relative to the nutation cycle. The observed line widths and flux of the approaching and receding jets appear consistent with the expected geometrical effects, indicating systematically larger line widths in the inner regions of the jets, as proposed by Shidatsu et al. (2025). Optical light curves show flares of ~400 s in 2024 and ~1600 s in 2025, with amplitudes up to ~15% during out-of-eclipse intervals, while the XRISM/Xtend light curves show no significant variability within the overlapping intervals and given the statistical uncertainties. Near-infrared photometry in 2024, obtained during an out-of-eclipse interval at a different epoch from the optical observations, showed no flare-like variability, and the X-ray band also remained constant within uncertainties. These coordinated observations provide a foundation for future XRISM studies aimed at probing the dynamical properties of the relativistic jets in SS 433.</description>

      <title>Classical, large scale 3D MHD simulations of interacting pulsar wind nebulae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetized rotating neutron stars, or pulsars, are a possible end product of massive star evolution. Their relativistic wind successively interacts with the supernova ejecta of their defunct progenitor, then with the circumstellar medium of the progenitor, and eventually with the interstellar medium. If a massive star is static with respect to its ambient medium, then its resulting circumstellar medium is elongated along the direction of the local magnetic field, and its supernova remnant transiently appears as a rectangle. The pulsar wind nebula forming in it is, in its turn, elongated, as long as the pulsar axis of rotation matches the direction of the local magnetization. In this work, we explore how the angle between the direction of the local magnetic field of the interstellar medium and the pulsar axis of rotation influences the shaping of its pulsar wind nebula with 3D MHD simulations are carried out with the PLUTO. We use those models to perform radiative transfer calculations to derive non-thermal radio emission maps of the pulsar wind nebulae. When the polar elongation of the pulsar develop, they bend in opposite directions under the effects of the cavity carved by the stellar wind and already filled by supernova ejecta. This induces a complex distribution of magnetized supernova ejecta and pulsar wind, resulting in various observable structures, appearing as rectangles, circles, or irregular oblong shapes, in the radio waveband. The angle between the direction of the pulsar rotation axis and that of the local ambient magnetization is a governing parameter for the shaping and non-thermal radio properties of the pulsar wind nebulae of static massive stars; however, the mixing of material, once the pulsar wind nebula is old (50 to 80 kyr), is not strongly affected by that factor.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Photon Dark Matter with CTAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark photon is a new hypothetical gauge boson arising in extensions of the Standard Model, and constitutes a compelling dark matter candidate. As dark photon dark matter (DPDM), it can interact with electromagnetic fields via kinetic mixing, and the inelastic scattering process $\gamma \gamma' \to e^+ e^-$ becomes kinematically allowed for gamma rays above a characteristic energy threshold. This interaction imprints unique spectral attenuation features at very-high-energies (VHE), offering an observational probe of DPDM models. Using the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) Instrument Response Functions (IRFs), we simulate observations of VHE sources and forecast novel sensitivities to the kinetic mixing parameter for the photon-dark photon scattering process. Our study focuses on three key astrophysical targets: the Crab Nebula and the blazars Markarian 421 and Markarian 501. Additionally, we investigate the impact of dark matter spikes around black holes on the upper limits. Our results demonstrate that CTAO can probe the DPDM parameter space down to a mixing parameter of $\varepsilon \sim 10^{-8}$ for masses around $m_{A^{\prime}} \sim 10^{-1}~\textrm{eV}$ through high-energy spectral attenuation, at a $95\%$ confidence level.</description>

Abstract: Repeating partial tidal disruption events (pTDEs) provide a direct probe of stellar orbits and episodic mass loss around supermassive black holes, but robust identification requires multi-band and multi-epoch evidence. We investigate whether the late-time radio rebrightening of the nuclear transient IGR J12580+0134 in NGC 4845 can be explained as a repeating pTDE, using multi-epoch Karl G. Jansky VLA observations together with X-ray constraints from Swift/XRT and NICER. The radio light curves show two distinct episodes, with the L-band peaks separated by $\approx1513$ days. Modeling the second episode with a synchrotron afterglow framework using Markov Chain Monte Carlo fitting favors a non-relativistic outflow $v\simeq0.03c$, with an isotropic-equivalent kinetic energy of order $10^{50}$ erg propagating in an approximately constant-density circumnuclear medium. No significant contemporaneous brightening is detected by Swift/XRT during the 2016 radio flare, while faint NICER flares in 2023 suggest intermittent low-level accretion. The recurrence timescale and radio energetics therefore make IGR J12580+0134 a possible candidate for a repeating pTDE system, motivating continued sensitive radio and X-ray monitoring to test future reactivations.</description>

      <title>Forward hadron production in proton-air collisions above LHC energies through the fluctuations of extensive air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primary proton-air interactions at ultra-high energies leave a physically interpretable imprint on the correlated fluctuations of the depth of shower maximum and the muon content in extensive air showers. This imprint reflects the stochasticity in the partition of the primary energy among secondary particles in the first interaction. We show that these fluctuations can be accessed through a probabilistic description that isolates sensitivity to hadronic physics in the initial collision, while treating the subsequent shower development as effectively universal. The uncertainties resulting from this universality are smaller than the spread among current hadronic interaction models and comparable to current experimental uncertainties. Consequently, the joint observable space defined by these two quantities provides a new probe of hadron production in kinematic regimes far beyond the reach of human-made accelerators.</description>

      <title>Fermi-LAT 16-year Source List</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current Fermi-LAT source catalog (4FGL-DR4: 7194 sources over 14 years) was built incrementally from the 8-year catalog. In a survey mission like Fermi, data accumulate on each source over time, so after 16 years (reached in August 2024) and twice the data for the original 4FGL sources we have more precise localization (by 24% on average). It is thus time to generate a new original catalog, which implies, beyond adding the sources newly detectable after two more years, changing the existing source names (derived from their coordinates) and reviewing the associations. We present an early 16-year list (FL16Y) of 7220 sources, which relocalizes all sources and improves a few aspects of the catalog analysis, but still uses the same model of interstellar diffuse emission as 4FGL-DR4.</description>

      <title>Whistler-Alfv\'en turbulence in a non-neutral ultrarelativistic pair plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale dynamics of most conventional space and astrophysical plasmas are predominantly governed by Alfv\'en modes, which are low-frequency magnetohydrodynamic modes existing in magnetized media. At scales smaller than the ion gyroscale or frequencies exceeding the ion cyclotron frequency, the Alfv\'en modes transform into kinetic-Alfv\'en or whistler modes that significantly contribute to plasma dynamics. However, this scenario reverses in non-neutral pair plasmas, such as those found in the magnetospheres of pulsars and magnetars, around rotating black holes and in their relativistic jets, as well as in certain laboratory plasmas. In these systems, the large-scale dynamics is governed by hybrid whistler-Alfv\'en modes, which transform into pure Alfv\'en modes at smaller scales. We derive the nonlinear equations that describe the dynamics of whistler-Alfv\'en modes in ultrarelativistic non-neutral magnetically dominated pair plasma and discuss the spectrum of turbulence governed by these equations.</description>

      <title>Collisionless Accretion of Finite-Angular-Momentum Plasma onto a Spinning Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In low-luminosity active galactic nuclei like M87* and Sgr A*, the accretion disk around the central supermassive black hole is tenuous and collisionless. As a result, the usual ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) approximation may not be applicable. In this Letter, we report on the first fully kinetic simulations of the accretion process where the plasma initially has finite angular momentum. The simulated accretion flow behaves remarkably similarly to the magnetically arrested disk (MAD) regime of ideal MHD, reproducing episodes of magnetic flux saturation and eruption typical of MADs. The resemblance to fluid models owes largely to kinetic instabilities, which regulate pressure anisotropy in the disk, allowing fluid terms to dominate the angular momentum transfer. In addition, by handling vacuum regions effectively, our kinetic approach probes the matter supply to the jet funnel. We observe no efficient penetration of the accreting material into this region, which suggests that a pair discharge may be required to sustain the Blandford-Znajek process.</description>

      <title>Tests of general relativity in pseudo-Newtonian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the extent to which pseudo-Newtonian gravitational potentials can reproduce classic tests of general relativity without resorting to full general relativistic formalisms. This is useful for the researchers seeking intuitive insight into relativistic gravity. Focusing on the perihelion precession of Mercury, gravitational redshift, and gravitational light bending, we derive analytical expressions for orbital precession and demonstrate that, with suitable physically acceptable parameters, pseudo-Newtonian approaches can accurately reproduce the observed perihelion advance and gravitational redshift. However, we confirm that no single potential consistently captures all relativistic effects. In particular, while certain parameters yield agreement with general relativity for planetary motion and redshift, they fail to reproduce gravitational lensing over a broad range of impact parameters. Our results highlight both the usefulness and limitations of pseudo-Newtonian methods in modeling gravitational phenomena. Although the pseudo-Newtonian approach cannot serve as universal substitutes for general relativity, especially in strong-field regimes, it provides valuable semi-analytical insight and pedagogical simplicity. Our results indicate the usefulness of the pseudo-Newtonian approach to uncover more complicated phenomena involved with strong field gravity in possibly modification to general relativity.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Newtonian potential for accretion disks in a modified gravity spacetime around the black hole and underlying properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a pseudo-Newtonian potential (PNP) corresponding to a rotating black hole solution in a modified gravity (MGR) framework using a metric-based prescription. The motivation is to enable realistic accretion disk studies in MGR, where full relativistic MHD simulations remain computationally prohibitive. Effective potentials and the underlying Newtonian-like forces are derived for both massive and massless particles in the equatorial plane, relevant for disk dynamics. The reliability of the PNP is tested by comparing key orbital properties -- marginally stable, marginally bound, photon orbits and energies at marginally stable orbit radii -- with exact MGR predictions. The PNP reproduces the marginally stable and photon orbits exactly, while marginally bound orbits and specific energies deviate by less than about 7-10%. The influence of the MGR parameter on particle dynamics and effective potentials is analyzed, revealing non-trivial departures from simple Newtonian intuition. The study demonstrates that the proposed PNP accurately captures essential spatial properties of MGR spacetime and provides an efficient, physically consistent tool for investigating accretion phenomena and strong-gravity astrophysics beyond general relativity.</description>

      <title>Using thermodynamics to learn gravitational wave physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes are some of the most interesting objects in the universe. While they first arise in the complicated behavior of general relativity, the physical laws ruling their behavior are surprisingly simple. For example, one of the core facts about black holes is that their area never decreases, much alike the entropy in thermodynamics. In this note directed at introductory physics students and their instructors, we use this similarity to understand properties of black hole physics using standard techniques from an undergraduate course in thermal physics. We explore the never-decreasing nature of black hole area to obtain bounds on the energy emitted in a black hole merger (a calculation originally done by Hawking). We show how this allows us to think of black holes in manners very similar to heat engines, and how these ideas have been used in modern gravitational wave observatories to test general relativity. This allows a research-level topic to be discussed in introductory physics lectures.</description>

      <title>A Path to an All-Sky Survey with Roman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A deep, space-based, all-sky near-infrared survey carried out with the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope would constitute a foundational astronomical infrastructure for decades to come. In this white paper, we present a concrete and feasible path to imaging the entire sky at $\sim0.1''$ resolution, beginning with high-impact fields in Cycle 1 and scaling to ultra-wide coverage within the nominal mission. This first-epoch survey will reach $\mathrm{H}\sim25.5$ AB mag (5$\sigma$) and maximize synergies with contemporaneous observatories, while preserving substantial time for other ambitious Roman programs. We outline representative scheduling scenarios and an example Cycle 1 program that triples early Roman-LSST overlap and delivers high-value community data products such as LSST forced photometry, joint \textit{Gaia}-Roman astrometry, and catalogs of Galactic substructure, stong lenses, and other rare systems. The Cycle 1 program will lay the foundation for an eventual all-sky survey, while also delivering high-impact early science. We invite broad community participation in shaping and carrying out both the initial program and the long-term vision of an all-sky Roman survey.</description>

      <title>Implications for PBH Dark Matter from a single Sub-Solar$\unicode{x2013}$GW Detection in LVK O1$\unicode{x2013}$O4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of sub-solar mass black holes is a milestone of modern astrophysics as it would open a window either onto new stellar physics or could potentially unveil the nature of Dark Matter as Primordial Black Holes. On November 12, 2025, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration reported the compact binary merger candidate S251112cm, a system with no obvious EM counterpart, consistent with binary black hole merger with a chirp mass in the range $0.1-0.87 \, M_\odot$. The probability that at least one component has mass $&lt;$1 $M_{\odot}$ is $&gt;99\%$. Inspired by this trigger, we tested if a population of PBHs formed at Quantum Chromodynamics epoch with a broad mass function could account for a signal of this type. Our results, corresponding to a predicted event rate of $0.8 \,\text{yr}^{-1}$ as seen by LVK O3b, suggest that the observed merger rate of $0.23^{+0.86}_{-0.218}\,\text{yr}^{-1}\;(95\%\;\text{C.L.})$ if the trigger is confirmed as an astrophysical event would be compatible with such a model. Our predicted detection rate is also in agreement with current LVK expectations for stellar-mass binaries, remaining consistent with a scenario in which a non-negligible fraction of the $3-200 \;M_\odot$ mergers observed by LVK originate from Primordial Black Holes. If confirmed, this detection would place a lower limit to the PBH abundance $f_{PBH}&gt;0.04$ for our adopted model.</description>

      <title>On the Importance of the Convective Urca Process in 3D Simulations of a Simmering White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae are bright thermonuclear explosions that are important to numerous areas of astronomy. However, the origins of these events are poorly understood. One proposed setting is that of a near Chandrasekhar mass white dwarf that undergoes runaway carbon burning in the core. During the thousand years leading up to the explosion, the white dwarf undergoes a simmering phase where slow carbon burning heats the core and drives convection. A poorly understood aspect of this phase is the convective Urca process, which links convection with weak nuclear reactions. We use the low Mach number code MAESTROeX to perform full 3D simulations as is required to accurately capture the turbulent convection. We present simulations with and without the A=23 convective Urca process, which have relaxed to a steady state. We characterize the effects of the convective Urca process on the neutrino losses, the nuclear energy generation, and the convective boundary. We find that the size of the convection zone is substantially reduced by the convective Urca process, though convection still extends past the Urca shell. Our findings on the structure of the convective zone and the compositional changes can be used to inform 1D stellar models that track the longer-timescale evolution.</description>

      <title>Intracluster Medium Fluctuations on Scales up to 1 Mpc: A Combined eROSITA and SPT/Planck Analysis of Abell 3266</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters form through hierarchical assembly, where smaller substructures merge to build the largest gravitationally bound objects in the universe. These mergers, combined with feedback from AGN, filamentary accretion, and other energy injection processes, generate turbulence and perturbations within the intra-cluster medium (ICM). X-ray and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) observations can be utilized to measure these ICM density and pressure inhomogeneities, in turn providing constraints on the effective Equation of State (EOS) of the perturbations and ICM velocities. In this work, we analyze deep SRG-eROSITA and Planck/SPT observations of Abell 3266 (A3266), a dynamically complex merging cluster with elongated morphology and significant substructure. We measure pressure and density fluctuations, and compute the power spectra and deprojected 3D amplitudes of these perturbations. We estimate the ratio of pressure-to-density fluctuation amplitudes as $1.00 \pm 0.55$ and non-thermal pressure support $0.068 \pm 0.050$. Density fluctuations are found to be stronger in the northern sector of the cluster compared to the south, consistent with ongoing accretion along a filamentary structure revealed by eROSITA. Further, we find the amplitude of density fluctuations increases with radius, qualitatively consistent with the trend found in cosmological simulations. Uncertainties in our results are dominated by the relatively low sensitivity of current Planck/SPT data, suggesting that improvements in SZ data quality could substantially improve our understanding of ICM energy injection, transport, and dissipation from this technique.</description>

      <title>A Decade-Long Increasing Mid-Infrared Luminosity in Galaxy NGC6447: a Turning-On Candidate of Active Galactic Nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely expected that the obscured accretion stage can be the initial turning-on stage of active galactic nuclei from quiescent galaxies. We present mid-infrared light curves of NGC 6447 in 3.5$\mu$m and 4.6 $\mu$m bands observed by WISE/NEOWISE, which show an almost monotonic increasing trend of 1.2 mag over 14 years. The optical light curve from ASAS-SN during the same period is consistent with a constant showing no variability. The mid-infrared color evolution shows that the galaxy transitioned into an active galactic nucleus (AGN) in 2018. The SPHEREx spectrum reveals an increasing continuum resembling warm to hot dust emission from an AGN. NuSTAR detected an X-ray source with a 2-30 keV luminosity of $8.4\times10^{41}$ ergs/s at the lower boundary of AGN X-ray emission range, and a factor of &gt;7 variability in one year compared to the Swift upper limit. NGC 6447 was classified as a quiescent galaxy in the literature. The multi-wavelength timing and spectral properties of NGC 6447 are consistent with the expected AGN turning on event, where the obscuring material around the AGN central engine is gradually dispersed, revealing the central engine. This example shows that long-term infrared variability can be a powerful tool to find similar sources. Based on the sample selection statistics, we estimate the duration of the episodes of AGN accretion (duty cycle) signified by the turning-on event as $10^4$-$10^6$ yr.</description>

      <title>Conditional Image Diffusion with Interferometric Closure Invariants: Independent EHT Imaging of Centaurus~A and 3C~279</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present independent imaging analyses of Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of the active galactic nuclei in radio galaxy Centaurus~A and quasar 3C~279 using Generative Deep learning Image Reconstruction with Closure Terms (GenDIReCT), a recently developed machine-learning framework built on conditional diffusion models that uses interferometric closure invariants as primary observables. For Centaurus~A, our reconstruction reveals two prominent emission ridges ($\simeq 80\,\mu$as each) along the jet sheath with a brightness ratio of $1.4\pm 0.1$ and an opening angle of $12.3\pm 0.3$~deg. For 3C~279, we identify three distinct components in the image, with the southern jet ejecta on sub-parsec scale exhibiting a proper motion of $4.6\pm 1.0\,\mu$as over $\approx 5.39$ days away from the northern components, corresponding to an apparent superluminal velocity of $\simeq 10\pm 2$ times light speed. These measurements are consistent with those reported by the EHT Collaboration. The results are significant because we demonstrate that: (1) imaging from interferometric aperture synthesis data, especially in VLBI and most acutely in extremely sparse arrays like the EHT, remains a severely ill-posed and challenging inverse problem, yet closure invariants preserve robust morphological information that can strongly constrain structural features, and (2) more importantly, closure-invariant imaging largely avoids calibration systematics, thus providing a fundamentally independent view of spatial structure with very high angular resolution. The generative nature of GenDIReCT further allows us to sample and characterise clusters of plausible image solutions for each dataset. As a calibration-independent, generative imaging approach, GenDIReCT offers a robust and truly independent blind-imaging tool for current and future VLBI experiments.</description>

      <title>Direction-of-arrival estimation of a gravitational wave by correlations between quadrupole moments of pulsar timings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can we estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of a gravitational wave (GW) signal from pulsar timing array observations? The present paper addresses the inverse problem, for which we consider quadrupole moments of pulsar timings due to GWs from a dominant isolated source such as a binary of supermassive black holes over an isotropic stochastic background. Correlations between the quadrupole moments are discussed, where the correlations between pulsar pairs over the full sky are taken into account. The correlations turn out to be in the form of a three-dimensional traceless matrix with rank 2 that can be closely related with a projection tensor for the GW. Thereby, we demonstrate that the rank-2 matrix allows to estimate the DOA of the GW. In expectation of the forthcoming Square Kilometer Array, angular resolutions as well as DOA estimation errors are also examined.</description>

      <title>pythonradex: a fast Python re-implementation of RADEX with extended functionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common task in astronomical research is to estimate the physical parameters (temperature, mass, density etc.) of a gas by using observed line emission. This often requires a calculation of how the radiation propagates via emission and absorption (so-called radiative transfer). In radio and infrared astronomy, the Fortran code RADEX (van der Tak et al., 2007) is a popular tool to solve the non-LTE radiative transfer of a uniform medium in a simplified geometry. I present pythonradex, a Python re-implementation of RADEX. Written in Python, it provides an easy and intuitive user interface, improved performance as well as additional functionality not included in RADEX, such as continuum effects and overlapping lines. In addition, pythonradex provides a self-consistent computation of the total flux for all geometries, including spherical geometries.</description>

      <title>Analytic force-free jet from disk-fed rotating black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new analytic model of force-free electromagnetic jet launched from a disk-fed rotating black hole. The jet solution is obtained through a systematic construction from previously developed methods. The resulting physical jet solution exhibits an asymptotically parabolic structure and is parametrized by the location of localized current concentration and sign reversal in the disk. We find, however, that the jet properties show negligible dependence on the disk parameter. The black hole jet captures the basic feature of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism for energy extraction and jet formation.</description>

      <title>A deep X-ray and UV look into the reflaring stage of the accreting millisecond pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an X-ray and UV high-time-resolution monitoring of the final flaring phase of the 2022 outburst of the AMSP SAX J1808.4-3658, based on simultaneous XMM-Newton and HST observations. The uninterrupted coverage provided by XMM-Newton enabled a detailed characterization of the spectral and temporal evolution of the source X-ray emission, as the flux varied by approximately 1 order of magnitude. We detected coherent X-ray pulsations during the whole X-ray observation, down to a 0.5-10 keV luminosity of $L_{X(low)0.5-10} \simeq 6.21^{+0.20}_{-0.15}\times 10^{34} d^2_{3.5}erg/s$, among the lowest ever observed in this source. At the lowest flux levels, we observed significant variations in pulse amplitude and phase. These variations were anticorrelated with the X-ray source flux. We found a sharp phase jump of $\sim 0.4$ cycles, accompanied by a doubling of the pulse amplitude and a softening of the X-ray emission. We interpreted changes in the X-ray pulse profiles as drifts of emission regions on the neutron-star surface, driven by an increase in the inner-disk radius when the mass-accretion rate decreased. The dependence of the pulse phase on the X-ray flux was consistent with a magnetospheric radius scaling as $R_{m} \propto \dot{M}^{\Lambda}$, with $\Lambda = -0.17(9)$, in broad agreement with theoretical predictions. Simultaneous HST observations confirmed the presence of significant UV pulsations at an X-ray luminosity approximately a factor of two lower than during the 2019 outburst, extending the range of mass accretion rates at which UV pulsations have been detected. The measured pulsed UV luminosity, $L_{pulsed}^{UV}=1.1(3) \times 10^{32}erg/s$, was consistent with that observed during the 2019 outburst. Such a UV luminosity exceeds the predictions of standard emission models, as further confirmed by the shape of the pulsed spectral energy distribution.</description>

      <title>Prolonged fallback and late-time rebrightening episodes in stellar tidal disruptions as imprints of a galactic environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07026v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classic models of tidal disruption events (TDEs), employing a purely Keplerian description of stellar debris dynamics, have proven remarkably successful in describing the observed emission of these transients. We extend these simple models by including the gravitational influence of a spherically symmetric mass distribution representing either a dark matter halo or the broader galactic environment, rather than treating the disruption as an isolated star-black hole encounter. We retain a minimal, fully Newtonian setup so that the role of the host galaxy remains transparent and straightforward to interpret. Within this extended model, we find that the host potential can imprint clear signatures on the light curve that lie outside the predictive scope of traditional models, such as phases of shallow decay and episodes of late-time rebrightening. These environment-driven signatures, however, emerge only on very long timescales unless the host is unrealistically ultra-compact. For most real systems, the environmental influence turns on far too late to be captured by current observations, which explains why the early evolution of TDEs occurring in typical galaxies is essentially unaffected by the host potential and why the classic models have been so successful. Only at much longer times does the broader galactic structure begin to reshape the fallback dynamics, gradually steering the system away from the canonical $t^{-5/3}$ decay. This provides an exciting opportunity for next-generation time domain surveys to extend monitoring and track late-time TDE evolution in search of delayed signals that quietly encode information about the surrounding galactic mass.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous JWST, NuSTAR, and VLA Monitoring of Sgr A*: A Unified Picture of the Variable IR, X-ray and Radio Emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flux variability is a fundamental channel of information from Sgr A* because of its direct probe of processes occurring within an accretion disk under strong gravity. We present simultaneous IR, X-ray and radio observations of Sgr A* on 2024 Apr 05 using JWST, NuSTAR, and VLA. We report the detection of a strong X-ray flare with a luminosity of $\sim5.2x10^{35}$ erg/s coincident with a bright near-IR flare, and a brightening in radio about an hour later. We investigate the candidate physical mechanisms for the X-ray flare emission and conclude that this can best be explained by inverse Compton scattering of near-IR flare radiation. We propose a dynamic scenario analogous to a coronal mass ejection in which a magnetic flux rope is ejected from Sgr A*'s inner accretion flow with a current sheet extending down from the rope to the bulk of the accretion flow. Reconnection within the sheet produces oppositely directed flows of accelerated particles moving upwards towards the rope and downwards towards the accretion flow. Infrared radiation from the approaching energetic electrons is enhanced by beaming and up-scattered by thermal electrons in the accretion flow to produce the strong X-ray flare. Meanwhile, the relativistic electrons moving in the opposite direction away from the disk experience weaker magnetic fields so radiate at longer wavelengths by feeding into the magnetic flux tube and adiabatically cooled during its subsequent expansion. This physical picture attempts to unify the origin of the variable emission from Sgr A* at IR, X-ray and radio/submm wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Tidal capture and repeating partial tidal disruption events of giant stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When an object is scattered near a supermassive black hole (SMBH), tidal oscillations excited within it reduce its orbital energy, leading to capture by the SMBH. This process, called tidal capture, can also occur when the object approaches even closer to the SMBH, resulting in a partial tidal disruption event (pTDE). Previous studies on pTDEs of main-sequence stars have shown that as the disruption intensifies, dynamical effects dominate over tidal oscillations, causing the remnant material to acquire a kick velocity instead of being captured by the SMBH. In this work, we performed hydrodynamic numerical simulations of pTDEs involving giant stars. We found that for weaker disruptions, the dynamical behavior of the remnant material resembles that of main-sequence stars. However, as the disruptions deepen, the remnant material transitions from gaining energy to losing energy, leading to capture by the SMBH. This behavior markedly differs from that of main-sequence stars, demonstrating that the presence of a compact core significantly influences the dynamical processes in pTDEs. Our simulations reveal that the energy change of the remnant material strongly correlates with asymmetric mass -- lossspecifically, the difference in mass outflow between the Lagrange points L1 and L2. This suggests that the energy change stems from asymmetric mass loss, consistent with conclusions from previous studies on main-sequence stars. However, quantitative analysis contradicts earlier models, indicating that the dynamical model of pTDEs requires further refinement. Finally, we discuss the characteristics of repeating pTDEs produced by this process and their potential observability, as well as the implications for the long-term orbital evolution of high eccentricity extreme mass ratio inspiral systems.</description>

Abstract: Fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) represent one of the most exotic astrophysical transients, exhibiting unusually strong emission across X-ray, optical, and radio wavelengths. Their physical origins remain highly debated, with proposed explanations ranging from stellar explosion to tidal disruption event (TDE). Here we report observations of the most luminous FBOT, AT 2024wpp whose post-peak luminosity rebrightens in X ray and becomes flattening in optical in a manner follows the decay rate characteristic of TDEs ($L_{\rm bol} \propto t^{-5/3}$). This invokes energy contribution of accretion by a central compact object, getting further corroborations from hardening of X-ray spectral index and detection of outflow inferred from the emission lines at similar phase. Detailed modeling of luminsoity evolution favors a coalesce explosion of a 34 M$_{\odot}$ Wolf-Rayet star with a 15 M$_{\odot}$ black hole (BH), demonstrating that some FBOTs may be associated with TDE of a stellar blackhole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03857v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) simulations, we investigate the bright ring features and polarization structures in images of the Kerr-Sen black hole associated with Sgr A*, as illuminated by 230 GHz thermal synchrotron emission from radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAF). Our findings reveal that an increase in the dilaton parameter leads to a shrinking of the bright ring, accompanied by enhancements in both its width and brightness. As the disk thickness grows, the bright ring's diameter and width both decrease. The brightness enhancement induced by the disk thickness is less prominent than that driven by the dilaton parameter. Comparing with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational data of SgrA*, we present the allowed ranges of black hole parameters, and find that effects of the disk thickness on the allowed parameter space are stronger than those of the observer's inclination. Furthermore, we analyze the coefficient $\beta_2$, associated with the two-fold rotational symmetry of the electric vector position angles (EVPA), to probe the polarization structure of the black hole images, and reveal that effects of the disk thickness on $\beta_2$ are much weaker than those from the dilaton parameter.</description>

      <title>The possible accretion discs of GN-z11 at redshift z = 10.6, MoM-z14 at z = 14.44 and other high redshift objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The JWST has enabled the discovery of Active Galactic Nuclei at high redshifts. The intrinsic UV spectrum of GN-z11 at redshift z=10.6 has a spectral slope compatible with a standard accretion disc. By fitting a disc model to its spectrum, we find that the mass of the black hole must be above 1.12 x 10^7 Msun in order that it lies below the Eddington limit. We define this mass as the Eddington mass of the black hole. We note that the spectral shape is consistent with that of accreting stellar mass black holes sources in their soft state, for which no variability is expected. Mom-z14 is a more distant object at $z=14.44$ and has a similar UV slope. Disc model-fitting gives a similar result but lower mass accretion rate. We also examine3 further high redshift objects: GS z14-1, GHZ2 and PAN-z14-1 at z=13.86, 12.34 and 13.53, again obtaining similar results. If sub-Eddington accretion discs are indeed the origin of much of the UV emission from these objects, then the existence of massive black holes less than 304 and 290 Myr after the Big Bang point either to exceptional black hole seeds or to primordial black holes. The observed spread of UV spectral slopes in high redshift objects suggests that our approach may be relevant to about half of that population.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption of a neutron star near naked singularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tidal disruption of a neutron star (NS) near a black hole (BH), and for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, near a naked singularity (NaS). For a BH with a mass greater than about $10 M_{\odot}$, the tidal disruption of NS should occur within the event horizon, and hence neither can the stellar material escape nor a distant observer observe the disruption. Since NaS does not have an event horizon, a significant portion of the NS's material can escape, and the tidal disruption can be observed by a distant observer. One could identify such an event from the observed emission from the disrupted NS's material and the decay of the light curve of the disruption event. The escape of a significant fraction of the NS's material may also have implications for the heavy elements in the universe. Moreover, observing such an event can be useful for confirming a NaS, probing its spacetime, and studying the motion of matter in such a geometry. This may help constrain the NS parameters and equation of state models. As a first step in this direction, we calculate here the tidal disruption radius and other parameters for a specific type (Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan type 1) of NaS and compare our results with observations.</description>

It rises to an absolute magnitude peak of about -17.58 mag in 10.6 days, and displays a rapid linear post-peak light-curve decline in all bands, similar to most SNe Ibn. The optical pseudobolometric light curve peaks at $(3.5\pm0.8) \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$, with a total radiated energy of $(5.0\pm0.4) \times 10^{48}$ erg. The spectra are dominated by a blue continuum at early stages, with narrow P Cygni He I lines and flash-ionisation emission lines of C III, N III, and He II. The P Cygni He I features gradually evolve and become emission-dominated in late-time spectra. Our multi-band light-curve modelling yields estimates of the ejecta mass of $M_{\rm ej} = 0.49^{+0.11}_{-0.09}$ M$_\odot$ with a kinetic energy of $E_{\rm k} = 0.06^{+0.01}_{-0.01} \times 10^{51}$ erg, and a $^{56}$Ni mass of $M_{\rm Ni} = 0.018$ M$_\odot$. The inferred CSM properties are characterised by a mass of $M_{\rm CSM} = 0.51^{+0.05}_{-0.04}$ M$_\odot$, an inner radius of $R_0 = 17.8^{+3.6}_{-3.0}$ AU, and a density of $\rho_{\rm CSM} =(8.3_{-1.2}^{+2.7})\times10^{-12}$ g cm$^{-3}$. The multi-epoch spectra are well reproduced by the CMFGEN/he4p0 model, corresponding to a He-ZAMS mass of 4 M$_\odot$ (H-ZAMS mass 18.11 M$_\odot$, pre-SN mass 3.16 M$_\odot$). These findings are consistent with a scenario of an SN powered by ejecta-CSM interaction, originating from a low-mass helium star that evolved within an interacting binary system where the CSM with some residual hydrogen may originate from the mass-transfer process. In addition, a channel of core-collapse explosion of a late-type Wolf-Rayet star with H, or an Ofpe/WN9 star with fallback accretion, cannot be entirely ruled out.</description>

Abstract: The existence of massive, compact galaxies (Little Red Dots, LRDs) at $z \sim 2$ challenges early structure formation models, suggesting rapid stellar and black hole (BH) assembly. While LRDs are efficient environments for BH growth, many show no X-ray evidence of strong AGN emission. We utilize a subsample of X-ray non-detected LRDs to test the compatibility of collision-based BH formation scenarios and constrain physical parameters like metallicity and column density. Our results indicate LRDs are ideal birthplaces for massive BHs, particularly given a mass-radius relation $R_{gal} \propto M_{gal}^{0.6}$. Collision-based models suggest seed masses larger than those in the local Universe, consistent with high-redshift BH mass-radius relations. We modeled BH seed formation and X-ray emission (0.3-7 keV) against observed upper limits. We find that mass-radius exponents $&gt; 0.55$ favor the collision-based scenario; however, consistency with stacked X-ray analysis requires specific accretion and obscuration parameters. Constant or increasing SFR scenarios with high Eddington ratios are feasible but necessitate larger column densities or higher metal enrichment. Alternatively, moderate sub-Eddington accretion reconciles massive seeds with observed masses and X-ray weakness. We conclude that even if LRDs began as starbursts, they should eventually evolve into AGNs.</description>
