      <title>Embeddings into de Branges-Rovnyak spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study conditions for containment of a given space $X$ of analytic functions on the unit disk $\mathbb{D}$ in the de Branges-Rovnyak space $\mathcal{H}(b)$. We deal with the non-extreme case in which $b$ admits a Pythagorean mate $a$, and derive a multiplier boundedness criterion on the function $\phi = b/a$ which implies the containment $X \subset \mathcal{H}(b)$. With our criterion, we are able to characterize the containment of the Hardy space $\mathcal{H}^p$ inside $\mathcal{H}(b)$, for $p \in [2, \infty]$. The end-point cases have previously been considered by Sarason, and we show that in his result, stating that $\phi \in \mathcal{H}^2$ is equivalent to $\mathcal{H}^\infty \subset \mathcal{H}(b)$, one can in fact replace $\mathcal{H}^\infty$ by BMOA. We establish various other containment results, and study in particular the case of the Dirichlet space $\mathcal{D}$, containment of which is characterized by a Carleson measure condition. In this context, we show that matters are not as simple as in the case of the Hardy spaces, and we carefully work out an example.</description>

      <title>Hermitian null loci</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a transcendental generalization of Nakamaye's theorem to compact complex manifolds when the form is not assumed to be closed. We apply the recent analytic technique developed by Collins--Tosatti to show that the non-Hermitian locus of a nef and big $(1,1)$-form, which is not necessarily closed, on a compact complex manifold equals the union of all positive-dimensional analytic subvarieties where the restriction of the form is not big (null locus). As an application, we can give an alternative proof of the Nakai--Moishezon criterion of Buchdahl and Lamari for complex surfaces and generalize this result in higher dimensions. This is also used for studying degenerate complex Monge--Amp\`ere equations on compact Hermitian manifolds. Finally, we investigate finite time non-collapsing singularities of the Chern--Ricci flow, partially answering a question raised by Tosatti and Weinkove.</description>

      <title>Applications of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem in the Calder\'on problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give examples on the use of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem in inverse problems. We show uniqueness in the linearized Calder\'on problem on holomorphically separable K\"ahler manifolds, and in the Calder\'on problem for nonlinear equations on conformally transversally anisotropic manifolds. We also study the holomorphic separability condition in terms of plurisubharmonic functions. The Stone-Weierstrass theorem allows us to generalize and simplify earlier results. It also makes it possible to circumvent the use of complex geometrical optics solutions and inversion of explicit transforms in certain cases.</description>

      <title>The extremal length systole of the cube punctured at its vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the extremal length systole of the cube punctured at its vertices is realized by the 12 curves surrounding its edges and give a characterization of the corresponding quadratic differentials, allowing us to estimate its value to high precision. The proof uses a mixture of exact calculations done using branched covers and elliptic integrals, together with estimates obtained using either the geometry of geodesic trajectories on the cube or explicit conformal maps.</description>

      <title>Boundary points, Minimal $L^{2}$ integrals and Concavity property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.01648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.01648v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the purpose of proving the strong openness conjecture of multiplier ideal sheaves, Jonsson-Musta\c{t}\u{a} posed an enhanced conjecture and proved the two-dimensional case, which says that: the Lebesgue measure of the set $\big\{c_o^F(\psi)\psi-\log|F|&lt;\log r\big\}$ divided by $r^2$ has a uniform positive lower bound independent of $r$, for a plurisubharmonic function $\psi$ and a holomorphic function $F$ near the origin $o$. Jonsson-Musta\c{t}\u{a}'s conjecture was proved by Guan-Zhou depending on the truth of the strong openness conjecture. However, it is still a question whether one can prove Jonsson-Musta\c{t}\u{a}'s conjecture without using the strong openness property, and obtain a sharp effectiveness result for this conjecture.
  In this article, we use an $L^2$ method with the weight functions $\psi-\log|F|$ and firstly consider a module at at a boundary point of the sublevel sets of a plurisubharmonic function. By studying the minimal $L^{2}$ integrals on the sublevel sets of a plurisubharmonic function with respect to the module at the boundary point, we establish a concavity property of the minimal $L^{2}$ integrals. As applications, we obtain a sharp effectiveness result related to Jonsson-Musta\c{t}\u{a}'s conjecture, which completes the approach from the conjecture to the strong openness property. We also obtain a strong openness property of the module and a lower semi-continuity property with respect to the module.</description>

      <title>Variation of the Hausdorff dimension and degenerations of Schottky groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set of a Schottky group varies continuously over the moduli space of Schottky groups defined over any complete valued field constructed by Poineau and Turchetti. To obtain this result, we first study the non-Archimedean case in a setting of Berkovich analytic spaces, where we make use of Poincar\'e series. We show that the latter can be extended meromorphically over the complex plane and admit a special value at zero which is a purely topological invariant.
  As an application, we prove results on the asymptotic behavior of the Hausdorff dimension of degenerating families of complex Schottky groups. For certain families, including Schottky reflection groups, we obtain an exact formula for the asymptotic logarithmic decay rate of the Hausdorff dimension. This generalizes a theorem of McMullen.</description>
