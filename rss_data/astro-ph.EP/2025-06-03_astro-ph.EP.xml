      <title>Sorcha: Optimized Solar System Ephemeris Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sorcha is a solar system survey simulator built for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) and future large-scale wide-field surveys. Over the ten-year survey, the LSST is expected to collect roughly a billion observations of minor planets. The task of a solar system survey simulator is to take a set of input objects (described by orbits and physical properties) and determine what a real or hypothetical survey would have discovered. Existing survey simulators have a computational bottleneck in determining which input objects lie in each survey field, making them infeasible for LSST data scales. Sorcha can swiftly, efficiently, and accurately calculate the on-sky positions for sets of millions of input orbits and surveys with millions of visits, identifying which exposures these objects cross, in order for later stages of the software to make detailed estimates of the apparent magnitude and detectability of those input small bodies. In this paper, we provide the full details of the algorithm and software behind Sorcha's ephemeris generator. Like many of Sorcha's components, its ephemeris generator can be easily used for other surveys.</description>

      <title>A Pan-STARRS Search for Distant Planets: Part 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a search for distant planets in Pan-STARRS1. We calibrated our search by injecting an isotropic control population of synthetic detections into Pan-STARRS1 source catalogs, providing a high-fidelity alternative to injecting synthetic sources at the image level. We found that our method is sensitive to a wide range of distances, as well as all rates and directions of motion. We identified 692 solar system objects (109 of which are not yet listed in the Minor Planet Center's database), including 642 TNOs, 23 of which are dwarf planets. By raw number of detections, this makes our search the third most productive Kuiper Belt survey to date, in spite of the fact that we did not explicitly search for objects closer than 80 au. Although we did not find Planet Nine or any other planetary objects, we were able to show that the remaining parameter space for Planet Nine is highly concentrated in the galactic plane.</description>

      <title>Interior redox state effects on the stability of secondary atmospheres and observational manifestations: LP 791-18 d as a case study for outgassing rocky exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in space and ground-based facilities now enable atmospheric characterization of a selected sample of rocky exoplanets. These atmospheres offer key insights into planetary formation and evolution, but their interpretation requires models that couple atmospheric processes with both the planetary interior and the surrounding space environment. This work focuses on the Earth-size planet LP791 18d, which is estimated to receive continuous tidal heating due to the orbital configuration of the system; thus, it is expected to exhibit volcanic activity. We estimate the mantle temperature of 1680-1880 K. Our results show that the atmospheric mean molecular weight gradient is controlled by oxygen fugacity rather than bulk metallicity. Furthermore, we use the atmospheric steady-state solutions produced from the interior redox state versus surface pressure parameter space and explore their atmospheric stability. We find that stability is achieved only in highly oxidized scenarios while reduced interior states fall into the hydrodynamic escape regime with mass loss rates on the order of 10^5-10^8 kg/s. We argue that scenarios with reduced interior states are likely to have exhausted their volatile budget during the planets lifetime. Furthermore, we predict the atmospheric footprint of the planets interior based on its oxidation state and assess its detectability using current or forthcoming tools to constrain the internal and atmospheric composition. We show that the degeneracy between bare rock surfaces and thick atmospheres can be resolved by using three photometric bands to construct a color-color diagram that accounts for potential effects from photochemical hazes and clouds. Our modeling approach connects interior and atmospheric processes, providing a basis to explore volatile evolution and potential habitability.</description>

      <title>WASP-121b's transmission spectrum observed with JWST/NIRSpec G395H reveals thermal dissociation and SiO in the atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: WASP-121b has been established as a benchmark ultrahot Jupiter, serving as a laboratory for the atmospheric chemistry and dynamics of strongly irradiated extrasolar gas giants. Here, we present and analyze WASP-121b's transmission spectrum observed with NIRSpec G395H on board the James Webb Space Telescope and find evidence for the thermal dissociation of H$_2$O and H$_2$ on the planet's permanent dayside. Additionally, we detect SiO at a statistical significance of $5.2\sigma$ which is compatible with chemical equilibrium in the atmosphere. Constraining the abundance of SiO and abundance ratios between silicon and volatile atoms in WASP-121b's atmosphere could help discriminate between possible migration histories of the planet. The three-dimensional nature of thermal dissociation on WASP-121b's dayside and of recombination on its nightside, however, poses a challenge to constraining molecular abundances and elemental abundance ratios from the transmission spectrum. To account for this, we implemented an atmospheric model in the NEMESIS framework that splits the planet's atmosphere into dayside and nightside. A retrieval applying our atmospheric model to WASP-121b's transmission spectrum favors a higher H$_2$O abundance on the nightside than on the dayside, demonstrating the impact of hemispheric heterogeneity when attempting to constrain WASP-121b's bulk H$_2$O inventory.</description>

      <title>Stability of a cluster-disrupted mean-motion resonance (chain) in HR 8799 and PDS 70</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HR~8799 is a planetary system with four planets potentially in a mean-motion resonance chain. It is unclear from the observations if they are in mean-motion resonance. Similarly, PDS~70 has two observed planets also potentially in mean-motion resonance. We simulate HR~8799 and PDS~70 under external perturbations to study their responds if in resonance or mean-motion resonance. We integrate the equations of motion for HR~8799 and PDS~70 starting with either in resonance or in mean-motion resonance and study their in isolation and in a star cluster. In the star cluster, we take the effects of passing stars into account. The dynamics of the star cluster is resolved using the Lonely Planets module in AMUSE. HR~8799 and PDS~70 in mean-motion resonance are stable, whereas in non-resonance they dissolve in $0.303\pm0.042$Myr and $1.26\pm0.25$Myr, respectively. In a cluster, the non-resonant HR~8799 is slightly more stable than in isolation, but still dissolves in $0.300\pm0.043$Myr, whereas the resonant planetary system remains stable for at least $0.71$Myr. In contrast, a non-resonant PDS~70 system is approximately equally stable in a cluster compared to isolation, and dissolves in $1.03\pm0.20$Myr, whereas the resonant PDS~70 system remains stable for at least $0.83$Myr. Considering the more stable solutions of mean-motion resonance for HR~8799, we argue that the planetary system was born in mean-motion resonance and that the mean-motion resonance was preserved. If HR~8799 was not born in resonance, the probability that it survived until the present day is negligible. Similarly, we argue that PDS~70 was probably born in mean-motion resonance and that its state was preserved. We also find that it is almost possible for planetary systems with a broken mean-motion resonance chain to survive longer in a perturbing cluster environment compared to isolation.</description>

      <title>Alkali phenoxides in comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potassium was first detected in spectra of the sungrazer comet Ikeya-Seki at the heliocentric distance rh = 0.15 au and, 48 years later, in comets PanSTARRS and ISON at rh = 0.46 au. The alkali tail photoionization model provides a Na/K ratio close to the solar value. No lithium was detected in any comet: the lower limit of the Na/Li ratio was almost one order of magnitude greater than the solar ratio. Here we searched for the emissions of the alkali NaI, KI, and LiI in Comets C/2020 F3 and C/2024 G3. High-resolution spectra of the comets were taken with the 0.84 m telescope at the Schiaparelli Observatory at rh = 0.36 and 0.15 au, the observations closest to the Sun since Ikeya-Seki. To model the data, we assumed that alkali phenoxides are present in the aromatic fraction of organic dust at the nucleus surface where they react with carbon dioxide ejecting alkali atoms. NaI and KI were detected in emission lines of exceptional intensity in both comets, with no evidence of LiI emission. The NaI/KI ratios were determined: 31 +/- 5 and 26 +/- 8, whereas solar Na/K = 15. This excess and its observed trend with the heliocentric distance are consistent with chemistry between CO2 and alkali phenoxides at the nucleus surface. The Li upper limit for comet C/2020 F3 is very stringent at Na/Li &gt; 3.4 10^4, a factor of 34 greater than the solar value. This Li depletion is consistent with the reaction rate of lithium phenoxides, which is a factor of 10^4 slower than sodium phenoxides. The widespread chemistry of carbon dioxide with organic dust may provide a significant energy and mass sink of carbon dioxide in all comets also at rh &gt; 1 au, reconciling recent models of cometary activity with Rosetta CO2 measurements. At rh &lt; 0.5 au potassium was observed in all comets, so that we predict the formation of a KI tail spatially resolved from the NaI tail.</description>

      <title>Predictions of the LSST Solar System Yield: Near-Earth Objects, Main Belt Asteroids, Jupiter Trojans, and Trans-Neptunian Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory is a new 8m-class survey facility presently being commissioned in Chile, expected to begin the 10yr-long Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) by the end of 2025. Using the purpose-built Sorcha survey simulator (Merritt et al. In Press), and near-final observing cadence, we perform the first high-fidelity simulation of LSST's solar system catalog for key small body populations. We show that the final LSST catalog will deliver over 1.1 billion observations of small bodies and raise the number of known objects to 1.27E5 near-Earth objects, 5.09E6 main belt asteroids, 1.09E5 Jupiter Trojans, and 3.70E4 trans-Neptunian objects. These represent 4-9x more objects than are presently known in each class, making LSST the largest source of data for small body science in this and the following decade. We characterize the measurements available for these populations, including orbits, griz colors, and lightcurves, and point out science opportunities they open. Importantly, we show that ~70% of the main asteroid belt and more distant populations will be discovered in the first two years of the survey, making high-impact solar system science possible from very early on. We make our simulated LSST catalog publicly available, allowing researchers to test their methods on an up-to-date, representative, full-scale simulation of LSST data.</description>

      <title>Clues for Solar System Formation from Meteorites and their Parent Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of comets requires knowledge of how the Solar System formed from a cloud of dust and gas 4.567 Gyr ago. Here, a review is presented of how the remnants of this formation process, meteorites and to a lesser extent comets, shed light on Solar System evolution. The planets formed by a process of collisional agglomeration during the first hundred million years of Solar System history. The vast majority of the original population of planetary building blocks (~100 km-scale planetesimals) was either incorporated into the planets or removed from the system, via dynamical ejection or through a collision with the Sun. Only a small fraction of the original rocky planetesimals survive to this day in the form of asteroids (which represent a total of ~0.05% of Earth's mass) and comets. Meteorites are fragments of asteroids that have fallen to Earth, thereby providing scientists with samples of Solar System-scale processes for laboratory-based analysis. Meteorite datasets complement cometary datasets, which are predominantly obtained via remote observation as there are few cometary samples currently available for laboratory-based measurements. This chapter discusses how analysis of the mineralogical, elemental, and isotopic characteristics of meteorites provides insight into (i) the origin of matter that formed planets, (ii) the pressure, temperature, and chemical conditions that prevailed during planet formation, and (iii) a precise chronological framework of planetary accretion. Also examined is the use of stable isotope variations and nucleosynthetic isotope anomalies as constraints on the dynamics of the disk and planet formation, and how these data are integrated into new models of Solar System formation. It concludes with a discussion of Earth's accretion and its source of volatile elements, including water and organic species.</description>

      <title>MINDS: The very low-mass star and brown dwarf sample. Detections and trends in the inner disk gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet-forming disks around brown dwarfs and very low-mass stars (VLMS) are on average less massive and are expected to undergo faster radial solid transport than their higher mass counterparts. Spitzer had detected C$_2$H$_2$, CO$_2$ and HCN around these objects. With better sensitivity and spectral resolving power, JWST recently revealed incredibly carbon-rich spectra from such disks. A study of a larger sample of objects is necessary to understand how common such carbon-rich inner disk regions are and to put constraints on their evolution. We present and analyze MIRI observations of 10 disks around VLMS from the MIRI GTO program. This sample is diverse, with the central object ranging in mass from 0.02 to 0.14 $M_{\odot}$. They are located in three star-forming regions and a moving group (1-10 Myr). We identify molecular emission in all sources and report detection rates. We compare the molecular flux ratios between different species and to dust emission strengths. We also compare the flux ratios with the stellar and disk properties. The spectra of these VLMS disks are extremely molecular rich, and we detect the 10 $\mu$m silicate dust emission feature in 70% of the sample. We detect C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN in all of the sources and find larger hydrocarbons such as C$_4$H$_2$ and C$_6$H$_6$ in nearly all sources. Among O-bearing molecules, we find firm detections of CO$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO in 90%, 50%, and 20% of the sample, respectively. We find that the detection rates of organic molecules correlate with other organic molecules and anti-correlate with inorganic molecules. Hydrocarbon-rich sources show a weaker 10$\mu$m dust strength as well as lower disk dust mass than the oxygen-rich sources. We find potential evidence for C/O enhancement with disk age. The observed trends are consistent with models that suggest rapid inward solid material transport and grain growth.</description>

      <title>Predictions of the LSST Solar System Yield: Discovery Rates and Characterizations of Centaurs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will start by the end of 2025 and operate for ten years, offering billions of observations of the southern night sky. One of its main science goals is to create an inventory of the Solar System, allowing for a more detailed understanding of small body populations including the Centaurs, which will benefit from the survey's high cadence and depth. In this paper, we establish the first discovery limits for Centaurs throughout the LSST's decade-long operation using the best available dynamical models. Using the survey simulator $\texttt{Sorcha}$, we predict a $\sim$7-12 fold increase in Centaurs in the Minor Planet Center (MPC) database, reaching $\sim$1200-2000 (dependent on definition) by the end of the survey - about 50$\%$ of which are expected within the first 2 years. Approximately 30-50 Centaurs will be observed twice as frequently as they fall within one of the LSST's Deep Drilling Fields (DDF) for on average only up to two months. Outside of the DDFs, Centaurs will receive $\sim$200 observations across the $\textit{ugrizy}$ filter range, facilitating searches for cometary-like activity through PSF extension analysis, as well as fitting light-curves and phase curves for color determination. Regardless of definition, over 200 Centaurs will achieve high-quality color measurements across at least three filters in the LSST's six filters. These observations will also provide over 300 well-defined phase curves in the $\textit{griz}$ bands, improving absolute magnitude measurements to a precision of 0.2 mags.</description>

      <title>Sorcha: A Solar System Survey Simulator for the Legacy Survey of Space and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory is expected to revolutionize solar system astronomy. Unprecedented in scale, this ten-year wide-field survey will collect billions of observations and discover a predicted $\sim$5 million new solar system objects. Like all astronomical surveys, its results will be affected by a complex system of intertwined detection biases. Survey simulators have long been used to forward-model the effects of these biases on a given population, allowing for a direct comparison to real discoveries. However, the scale and tremendous scope of the LSST requires the development of new tools. In this paper we present Sorcha, an open-source survey simulator written in Python. Designed with the scale of LSST in mind, Sorcha is a comprehensive survey simulator to cover all solar system small-body populations. Its flexible, modular design allows Sorcha to be easily adapted to other surveys by the user. The simulator is built to run both locally and on high-performance computing (HPC) clusters, allowing for repeated simulation of millions to billions of objects (both real and synthetic).</description>

      <title>Hot exozodiacal dust around Fomalhaut: The MATISSE perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Excess over the stellar photospheric emission of main-sequence stars has been found in interferometric near-infrared observations, and is attributed to the presence of hot exozodiacal dust (HEZD). As part of our effort to detect and characterize HEZD around the nearby A3 V star Fomalhaut, we carried out the first interferometric observations with the MATISSE instrument at the VLTI in the photometric bands L and M for the Fomalhaut system. Assuming a dust distribution either as a narrow ring or spherical shell for modeling the HEZD, we aim to constrain the HEZD parameters by generating visibilities and fitting them to the MATISSE data using different approaches. The L band data provide a marginal detection of circumstellar radiation, potentially caused by the presence of HEZD, which is only the second detection of HEZD emission in the L band. An analysis of the data with different fitting approaches showed that the best-fit values for the HEZD parameters are consistent with those of previous Fomalhaut observations, which underlines the functionality of MATISSE. Assuming a dust ring, it would have an inner ring radius of \(0.11\ \mathrm{au}\), an outer ring radius of \(0.12\ \mathrm{au}\), a narrow dust grain size distribution around a dust grain radius constrained by \(0.53\ \mu\mathrm{m}\), and a total dust mass of \(3.25\times 10^{-10}\ \rm{M}_{\oplus}\). Finally, the results indicate that the choice of the geometric model has a more significant impact on the derived dust-to-star flux ratio than the specific fitting approach applied. Since different dust-to-star flux ratios can result from the applied fitting approaches, this also has an impact on the parameter values of the HEZD around Fomalhaut and most likely for other HEZD systems. Moreover, further NIR and MIR data are required for a more comprehensive description of the emission originating in the vicinity of Fomalhaut.</description>

      <title>Stellar Magnetic Storm Induced Magnetospheric Polarity Reversals: Distinguishing between Unmagnetised and Magnetised Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exoplanetary and planetary environments are forced by stellar activity which manifest through variable radiation, particle and magnetic fluxes, stellar winds, flares and magnetic storms known as coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Recent studies have shown that (exo)planets with intrinsic magnetic fields and magnetospheres respond differently to this stellar forcing compared to planets which lack an intrinsic magnetism; this is borne out by observations in solar system planets. However, detailed investigations to uncover the subtle ways in which stellar magnetic storms impact exoplanets are still at a nascent stage. Here we utilize 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the impact of stellar CMEs on Earth-like planets with different magnetic fields. Our results show that planetary atmospheric mass loss rates are dependent on the relative orientation of stellar wind and planetary magnetic fields, with significantly higher losses when the CME and planetary magnetic fields are oppositely oriented -- favoring enhanced magnetic reconnections. In contrast, for unmagnetised planets, the mass loss rate do not strongly depend on stellar magnetic field orientation. More significantly, we find that stellar CME induced polarity reversals can distinguish between planets with and without intrinsic magnetism. In unmagnetised or weakly magnetised (exo)planets, the polarity of the externally imposed magnetosphere are prone to global polarity reversals forced by stellar magnetised storms. Our analysis of the magnetotail current density dynamics during polarity reversals aligns with observations of Venus. This distinction in magnetospheric response provides a new paradigm to differentiate between (exo)planets with or without significant (intrinsic) magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Preliminary analysis of a potential asteroid from the IASC campaign using Pan-STARRS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a detailed analysis of a potential asteroid candidate, ISP0010, using images provided by the Pan-STARRS 1 telescope as part of our participation in the International Astronomical Search Collaboration campaign. IASC is one of the leading contributors to the detection of various Near-Earth Objects and Main Belt asteroids. Using Astrometrica software we analysed those images and extracted their key parameters such as signal-to-noise ratio, right ascension, declination, flux, FWHM, RMS, and magnitude. Later, we analysed its trajectory, apparent angular speed, and error analyses using python and its libraries. In the end, we concluded that ISP0010 would be a potential candidate for an asteroid. However, on cross-verifying with the Minor Planet Centre database, we found that ISP0010 was already reported on February 27, 2021, and a total of 25 observations has been reported up to the date and currently the object has been designated as 2021 CP66. Our date of observation of 2021 CP66 was February 27, 2025. This study thus provides an independent confirmation and characterization of 2021 CP66, demonstrating the accuracy of our analysis and underscoring the importance of thorough database verification in asteroid detection.</description>

      <title>Reappraising the Elatina series: Solar dynamo clocking and inference of orbital periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We reconsider the 680 million year old Elatina series of sedimentary laminae from South Australia that show a remarkably stable periodicity with a main period of around 12 years, which is close to the Schwabe cycle, and a second period of 314 years that has been coined Elatina cycle. By analyzing the residuals of the series' minima from a linear trend, and deriving Dicke's ratio, we first show that the series exhibits a high degree of phase stability, except one single break point which may indicate a 90{\deg} phase jump. We discuss the data in terms of a recently developed synchronization model of the solar dynamo. This model is then employed to infer those orbital periods of Venus, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn that would be required to jointly explain the moderately changed Schwabe cycle, and the Elatina cycle when interpreted as a prolonged Suess-de Vries cycle. Assuming pairwise conservations of the sum of the angular momenta of Jupiter/Saturn and Venus/Earth, respectively, we find solutions of the underlying inverse problem which amount to approximately 1 percent angular momentum increase of Jupiter and a 0.005 per cent angular momentum increase of Earth. The plausibility of such changes over a period of seven hundred million years is discussed in light of solar system dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Growing Impact of Unintended Starlink Broadband Emission on Radio Astronomy in the SKA-Low Frequency Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the largest survey to date characterising intended and unintended emission from Starlink satellites across the SKA-Low frequency range. This survey analyses ~76 million full sky images captured over ~29 days of observing with an SKA-Low prototype station - the Engineering Development Array 2 - at the site of SKA-Low. We report 112,534 individual detections of 1,806 unique Starlink satellites, some emitting broadband emission and others narrowband emission. Our analysis compares observations across different models of Starlink satellite, with 76% of all v2-mini Ku and 71% of all v2-mini Direct to Cell satellites identified. It is shown that in the worst cases, some datasets have a detectable Starlink satellite in ~30% of all images acquired. Emission from Starlink satellites is detected in primary and secondary frequency ranges protected by the International Telecommunication Union, with 13 satellites identified between 73.00 - 74.60 MHz and 703 identified between 150.05 - 153.00 MHz. We also detect the reflections of terrestrial FM radio off different models of Starlink satellites at 99.70 MHz. The polarisation of the broadband emission shows the flux density of two orthogonal polarisations is anti-correlated with temporally shifting spectral structure observed. We compare our results to previous EDA2 and LOFAR results and provide open public access to our final data products to assist in quantifying future changes in this emission.</description>

      <title>Eighteen Exoplanet Host Stars from the NPOI Data Archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the course of publishing angular diameters from the Navy Precision Optical Interferometer data archive, we found we had data on 17 confirmed exoplanet host stars and one exoplanet candidate (HD 20902/alpha Per). Here, we update our previously published stellar radii with more precise Gaia parallaxes when available, and use our radius and effective temperature measurements to fit each star's mass and age using MIST models. The mass changed by more than 10% for 9 of the 18 stars. Combining our updated masses, radii, and temperatures, we present refined planetary masses as well as habitable zone calculations.</description>

      <title>High-contrast spectroscopy with the new VLT/ERIS instrument: Molecular maps and radial velocity of the gas giant AF Lep b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Enhanced Resolution Imager and Spectrograph (ERIS) is the new Adaptive-Optics (AO) assisted Infrared instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT). Its refurbished Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) SPIFFIER leverages a new AO module, enabling high-contrast imaging applications and giving access to the orbital and atmospheric characterisation of super-Jovian exoplanets. We test the detection limits of ERIS and demonstrate its scientific potential by exploring the atmospheric composition of the young super-Jovian AF Lep b and improving its orbital solution by measuring its radial velocity relative to its host star. We present new spectroscopic observations of AF Lep b in $K$-band at $R\sim 11000$ obtained with ERIS/SPIFFIER at the VLT. We reduce the data using the standard pipeline together with a custom wavelength calibration routine, and remove the stellar PSF using principal component analysis along the spectral axis. We compute molecular maps by cross-correlating the residuals with molecular spectral templates and measure the radial velocity of the planet relative to the star. Furthermore, we compute contrast grids for molecular mapping by injecting fake planets. We detect a strong signal from H$_{2}$O and CO but not from CH$_{4}$ or CO$_{2}$. This result corroborates the hypothesis of chemical disequilibrium in the atmosphere of AF Lep b. Our measurement of the RV of the planet yields $\Delta v_{\mathrm{R,P\star}} = 7.8 \pm 1.7$ km s$^{-1}$. This enables us to disentangle the degeneracy of the orbital solution, namely the correct longitude of the ascending node is $\Omega=248^{+0.4}_{-0.7}$ deg and the argument of periapsis is $\omega=109^{+13}_{-21}$ deg. Our results demonstrate the competitiveness of the new ERIS/SPIFFIER instrument for the orbital and atmospheric characterisation of exoplanets at high contrast and small angular separation.</description>

      <title>Dust enrichment and growth in the earliest stages of protoplanetary disk formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aims. We numerically investigated dust enrichment and growth during the initial stages of protoplanetary disk formation. A particular objective was to determine the effects of various growth barriers, mimicked by imposing a series of upper permissible limits on maximum dust sizes. Methods. We used the Formation and Evolution of Stars and Disks on nested meshes (ngFEOSAD) code to simulate the three-dimensional dynamics of gas and dust under the polytropic approximation, from the gravitational collapse of a slowly rotating Bonnor-Ebert sphere to \approx 12 kyr after the first hydrostatic core and disk formation. Results. We found that dust growth begins in the contracting cloud in the evolution stage that precedes disk formation, and that the disk begins to form in an environment already enriched with grown dust. The efficiency of dust growth in the disk is limited by dust growth barriers. For dust grains with maximum sizes &lt; 100 micron, electrostatic or bouncing barriers likely dominate, whereas fragmentation and drift barriers are more important for larger grains. The disk midplane quickly becomes enriched with dust, while the vertically integrated dust distribution shows notable local variations around the canonical 1:100 dust-to-gas mass ratio. These positive and negative deviations are likely caused by local hydrodynamic flows, as the globally integrated dust-to-gas ratio deviates negligibly from the initial 1:100 value. We note that care should be taken when using models with fixed dust sizes, as disks exhibit profound negative radial gradients in dust size even during the earliest stages of disk formation. Models with a constant Stokes number may be preferable in this context. Conclusions. Early dust enrichment and growth may facilitate planet formation, as suggested by observations of protoplanetary disk substructures.</description>

      <title>Orbital Decay of the Ultra-Hot Jupiter TOI-2109b: Tidal Constraints and Transit-Timing Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TOI-2109b is the ultra-hot Jupiter with the shortest orbital period ($\sim16\,$hr) yet discovered. At this close distance, strong tidal interactions can produce a significant exchange of angular momentum with the star. Since the orbital period of this planet is shorter than the stellar rotation period, TOI-2109b may be an optimal candidate for studying orbital decay. This process depends on how efficiently the star and the planet dissipate energy, due mainly to interior mechanisms that are poorly constrained in exoplanet systems. In this work, we study for the first time the tidal evolution of TOI-2109b under a formalism of inertial waves (IWs) in convective envelopes and internal gravity waves (IGWs) in stellar radiative regions. We find that uncertainties in the age of TOI-2109 ($t_\mathrm{\star, age}$) significantly affect the rate of orbital evolution, as IWs and IGWs interact differently depending on $t_\mathrm{\star, age}$. For an 'old' host star, we find that TOI-2109b would undergo fast orbital decay. Conversely, if TOI-2109b orbits a 'young' host star, a rather slow decay rate for $Q_\star'&gt;2.3\times10^7$ would suggest a constant-period orbit. Our calculated mid-transit times and transit-timing variations (TTVs) support a 'young' host star with $Q_\star'&gt;3.7\times10^7$, suggesting a decay rate $\dot{P}\sim4\,$ms yr$^{-1}$ that could lead to mid-transit-time shifts $\lesssim10\,$s over three years. Orbital decay and other TTV-inducing effects will be confirmed or ruled out with future higher-quality timing data. The results presented here aim at constraining the current modeling of tides and TTVs for TOI-2109b, helping us further understand light-curve changes associated to the long-term evolution of ultra-short-period planets.</description>
