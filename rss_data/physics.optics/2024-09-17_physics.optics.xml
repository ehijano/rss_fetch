      <title>Lithium Niobate Photonic Topological Insulator-based Multi-Wavelength Optical Demultiplexer with Piezoelectric Switch-Off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic topological insulators provide unidirectional, robust, wavelength-selective transport of light at an interface while keeping it insulated at the bulk of the material. The non-trivial topology results in an immunity to backscattering, sharp turns, and fabrication defects. This work leverages these unique properties to design a 2-channel optical demultiplexer based on a lithium niobate photonic topological insulator with piezoelectric switch-off capabilities. A photonic topological insulator design for the demultiplexer allows for good wavelength selectivity, crosstalk as low as $-$54 dB, and better isolation between output channels. The primary operating wavelengths presented are the telecommunication wavelengths of 1310 nm and 1550 nm, but the use of the lithium niobate material allows operation at multiple operating wavelengths. Furthermore, we propose a post-fabrication method to switch off the topological protection and, thus, optical transmittance via an applied voltage utilizing the inverse piezoelectric effect of lithium niobate. This work will contribute to advancing lithium niobate integrated photonics and developing efficient, multi-wavelength, electrically controlled optical communication systems and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Compact Inversely-Designed Vertical Coupler with Bottom Reflector for Sub-Decibel Fiber-to-Chip Coupling on Silicon-on-Insulator Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse design via topology optimization has led to innovations in integrated photonics and offers a promising way for designing high-efficiency on-chip couplers with a minimal footprint. In this work, we exploit topology optimization to design a compact vertical coupler incorporating a bottom reflector, which achieves sub-decibel coupling efficiency on the 220-nm silicon-on-insulator platform. The final design of the vertical coupler yields a predicted coupling efficiency of -0.35 dB at the wavelength of 1550 nm with a footprint of 14 {\mu}m x 14 {\mu}m, which is considerably smaller than conventional grating couplers. Its topology-optimized geometry can be realized by applying one full etch and one 70-nm shallow-etch process and the fabricability is also guaranteed by a minimum feature size around 150 nm. The proposed vertical coupler can further miniaturize photonic integrated circuits and enable highly-efficient networks between optical fibers and other photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Generation of tunable quantum entanglement via nonlinearity symmetry breaking in semiconductor metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunable biphoton quantum entanglement generated from nonlinear processes is highly desirable for cutting-edge quantum technologies, yet its tunability is substantially constrained by the symmetry of material nonlinear tensors. Here, we overcome this constraint by introducing symmetry-breaking in nonlinear polarization to generate optically tunable biphoton entanglement at picosecond speeds. Asymmetric optical responses have made breakthroughs in classical applications like non-reciprocal light transmission. We now experimentally demonstrate the nonlinear asymmetry response for biphoton entanglement using a semiconductor metasurface incorporating [110] InGaP nano-resonators with structural asymmetry. We realize continuous tuning of polarization entanglement from near-unentangled states to a Bell state. This tunability can also extend to produce tailored hyperentanglement. Furthermore, our nanoscale entanglement source features an ultra-high coincidence-to-accidental ratio of $\approx7\times10^4$, outperforming existing semiconductor flat optics by two orders of magnitude. Introducing asymmetric nonlinear response in quantum metasurfaces opens new directions for tailoring on-demand quantum states and beyond.</description>

      <title>Label-free correlative morpho-chemical tomography of 3D kidney mesangial cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Label-free characterization of biological specimens seeks to supplement existing imaging techniques and avoid the need for contrast agents that can disturb the native state of living samples. Conventional label-free optical imaging techniques are compatible with living samples but face challenges such as poor sectioning capability, fragmentary morphology, and lack chemical specific information. Here, we combined simultaneous label-free autofluorescence multi-harmonic (SLAM) microscopy and gradient light interference microscopy (GLIM) to extract both chemical specific and morphological tomography of 3D cultured kidney mesangial cells. Imaging 3D in vitro kidney models is essential to understand kidney function and pathology. Our correlative approach enables imaging and quantification of these cells to extract both morphology and chemical-specific signals that is crucial for understanding kidney function. In our approach, SLAM offers a nonlinear imaging platform with a single-excitation source to simultaneously acquire autofluorescence (FAD and NAD(P)H), second, and third harmonic signal from the 3D cultured cells. Complementarily, GLIM acquires high-contrast quantitative phase information to quantify structural changes in samples with thickness of up to 250 micron. Our correlative imaging results demonstrate a versatile and hassle-free platform for morpho-chemical cellular tomography to investigate functions such as metabolism and matrix deposition of kidney mesangial cells in 3D under controlled physiological conditions.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal phase-change metaoptics for reconfigurable nonvolatile image processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of smart imaging and vision systems will require compact and tunable optical computing hardware to perform high-speed and low-power image processing. These requirements are driving the development of computing metasurfaces to realize efficient front-end analog optical pre-processors, especially for edge-detection capability. Yet, there is still a lack of reconfigurable or programmable schemes, which may drastically enhance the impact of these devices at the system level. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a reconfigurable flat optical image processor using low-loss phase-change nonlocal metasurfaces. The metasurface is configured to realize different transfer functions in spatial frequency space, when transitioning the phase-change material between its amorphous and crystalline phases. This enables edge detection and bright-field imaging modes on the same device. The metasurface is compatible with a large numerical aperture of ~0.5, making it suitable for high resolution coherent optical imaging microscopy. The concept of phase-change reconfigurable nonlocal metasurfaces may enable emerging applications of artificial intelligence-assisted imaging and vision devices with switchable multitasking.</description>

      <title>HoloTile RGB: Ultra-fast, Speckle-Free RGB Computer Generated Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the first use of the HoloTile Computer Generated Holography (CGH) modality on multicolor targets. Taking advantage of the sub-hologram tiling and Point Spread Function (PSF) shaping of HoloTile allows for the reconstruction of high-fidelity, pseudo-digital RGB images, with well-defined output pixels, without the need for temporal averaging. For each wavelength, the target channels are scaled appropriately, using the same output pixel size. We employ a Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) hologram generation algorithm for each wavelength, and display them sequentially on a HoloEye GAEA 2.1 Spatial Light Modulator (SLM) in Color Field Sequential (CFS) phase modulation mode. As such, we get full 8-bit phase modulation at 60Hz for each wavelength. The reconstructions are projected onto a camera sensor where each RGB image is captured at once.</description>

      <title>Convergent-beam attosecond X-ray crystallography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-angstrom spatial resolution of electron density coupled with sub-femtosecond temporal resolution is required to directly observe the dynamics of the electronic structure of a molecule after photoinitiation or some other ultrafast perturbation. Meeting this challenge, pushing the field of quantum crystallography to attosecond timescales, would bring insights into how the electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom couple, enable the study of quantum coherences involved in molecular dynamics, and ultimately enable these dynamics to be controlled. Here we propose to reach this realm by employing convergent-beam X-ray crystallography with high-power attosecond pulses from a hard-X-ray free-electron laser. We show that with dispersive optics, such as multilayer Laue lenses of high numerical aperture, it becomes possible to encode time into the resulting diffraction pattern with deep sub-femtosecond precision. Each snapshot diffraction pattern consists of Bragg streaks that can be mapped back to arrival times and positions of X-rays on the face of a crystal. This can span tens of femtoseconds, and can be finely sampled as we demonstrate experimentally. The approach brings several other advantages, such as an increase of the number of observable reflections in a snapshot diffraction pattern, all fully integrated, to improve the speed and accuracy of serial crystallography -- especially for crystals of small molecules.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Talbot effect from a surface acoustic wave dynamic grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the dynamical Talbot effect caused by optical diffraction from standing surface acoustic waves (SAWs). The Talbot effect is a wave interference phenomenon in the Fresnel regime, and we observe it with a fiber-based scanning optical interferometer on a SAW Fabry-Perot cavity. By studying the interferometric signal at 1 GHz, we first discover the existence of an amplitude-modulated term, that can exceed in magnitude the usual phase-modulated term, enabling a new way of imaging surface acoustic waves. Secondly, by displacing the acoustic device from the beam focus we reveal the optical Talbot effect, where despite the curved wavefronts of the optical field, the conventional Talbot length appears. As a consequence, the amplitude modulation vanishes at periodic positions of the acoustic wave relative to the beam focus.</description>

      <title>Mitigating tilt-induced artifacts in reflection ptychography via optimization of the tilt angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ptychography in a reflection geometry shows great promise for non-destructive imaging of 3-dimensional nanostructures at the surface of a thick substrate. A major challenge to obtain high quality reflection-ptychographic images under near-grazing conditions has been to calibrate the incidence angle used to straighten the measured curved diffraction patterns in a process referred to as 'tilted plane correction' (TPC). In this work, we leverage the flexibility of automatic differentiation (AD)-based modeling to realise an alternative approach, where the tilted propagation is included into the forward model. Use of AD allows us to jointly optimize the tilt angles with the typical probe and object, eliminating the need for accurate calibration or random search optimization. The approach was validated using datasets generated with an extreme ultraviolet (EUV) beamline based on either a tabletop high harmonic generation (HHG) source or a visible laser. We demonstrate that the proposed approach can converge to a precision of $\pm 0.05\deg$ for probe beams at $70\deg$ angle of incidence, possibly precise enough for use as a calibration approach. Furthermore, we demonstrate that optimizing for the tilt angles reduces artifacts and increases reconstruction fidelity. Use of AD not only streamlines the current ptychographic reconstruction process, but should also enable optimization of more complex models in other domains, which will undoubtedly be essential for future advancements in computational imaging.</description>

      <title>High gain squeezing in lossy resonators: an asymptotic field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for describing nonlinear electromagnetic interactions in integrated photonic devices utilizing an asymptotic-in/out field formalism. Our method expands upon previous continuous wave asymptotic treatments by describing the evolution non-perturbatively for an arbitrary pulsed input. This is presented in the context of a squeezing interaction within an integrated microring resonator side coupled to an input/output waveguide, but is readily generalizable to other integrated structures, while including a variety of (non-squeezing) third-order interactions. An example of a single-pump, non-degenerate squeezing interaction is studied, which is shown to match well with standard coupled-mode treatments for high-finesse resonators, as well as previous perturbative treatments dealing with the generation of pairs with low probability.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical model of optothermal fluidics in a confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the semi-analytical solution of the temperature and flow fields of a fluid confined in a narrow space between two parallel plates. The temperature increase is triggered by photothermal effects of fluids and/or boundaries due to the absorption of a focused Gaussian beam irradiated perpendicular to the fluid film, and then the temperature variation induces the flow fields through a buoyancy force and/or thermo-osmotic slip. The semi-analytical solution to this optothermal fluidic system is validated by comparing with the results of numerical simulation, and is applied to typical optothermal fluidic problems. In particular, the optothermal trap of nanoparticles observed in our previous experiment [T. Tsuji, et al., Electrophoresis, 42, 2401 (2021)] is investigated in terms of thermophoretic force and flow drag that are obtained semi-analytically. The semi-analytical solution can be shared through open-source codes that are available to researchers without the background of fluid mechanics.</description>

      <title>A modified recursive transfer matrix algorithm for radiation and scattering computation of multilayer spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discusses the electromagnetic scattering and radiation problems of multilayered spheres, reviewing the historical expansion of the Lorentz-Mie theory and the numerical stability issues encountered in handling multilayered spheres. By combining recursive methods with the transfer matrix method, we propose a modified transfer matrix algorithm designed for the stable and efficient calculation of electromagnetic scattering coefficients of multilayered spheres. The new algorithm simplifies the recursive formulas by introducing Debye potentials and logarithmic derivatives, effectively avoiding numerical overflow issues associated with Bessel functions under large complex variables. Numerical test results demonstrate that this algorithm offers superior stability and applicability when dealing with complex cases such as thin shells and strongly absorbing media.</description>

      <title>A group-IV double heterostructure light emitting diode for room temperature gain in Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lack of straightforward epitaxial integration of useful telecom lasers on silicon remains the major bottleneck for bringing optical interconnect technology down to the on-chip level. Crystalline silicon itself, an indirect semiconductor, is a poor light emitter. Here, we identify conceptionally simple Si/Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$/Si double heterostructures (DHS) with large Ge content ($x \gtrsim 0.4$) as auspicious gain material suitable for Si-based integrated optics. In particular, using self-consistent Poisson-current transport calculations, we show that Si diodes containing a 16 nm thick Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$ layer of high crystalline quality, centered at the p-n junction, results in efficient carrier accumulation in the DHS and gain if the diode is driven in forward direction. Despite the high strain, we unambiguously demonstrate that such prior unattainable defect-free DHS can be fabricated using ultra-low temperature epitaxy at pristine growth pressures. Telecom light emission is persistent up to 360 K, and directly linked to a ~160 meV high conduction band barrier for minority electron injection. This epitaxy approach allows further increasing the Ge content in the DHS and creating dot-in-well heterostructures for which even higher gains are predicted. Thus, the surprisingly facile DHS presented here can be an essential step toward novel classes of group-IV optoelectronic devices for silicon photonics.</description>

      <title>In-situ measurements of light diffusion in an optically dense atomic ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel method to investigate in-situ light transport within optically thick ensembles of cold atoms, exploiting the internal structure of alkaline-earth metals. A method for creating an optical excitation at the center of a large atomic cloud is demonstrated, and we observe its propagation through multiple scattering events. In conditions where the cloud size is significantly larger than the transport mean free path, a diffusive regime is identified. We measure key parameters including the diffusion coefficient, transport velocity, and transport time, finding a good agreement with diffusion models. We also demonstrate that the frequency of the photons launched inside the system can be controlled. This approach enables direct time- and space-resolved observation of light diffusion in atomic ensembles, offering a promising avenue for exploring new diffusion regimes.</description>

Abstract: Emittance measurements using synchrotron radiation are usually performed using x-rays to avoid diffraction limits. Interferometric techniques using visible light are also used to measure either the horizontal or the vertical beam projection. Several measurements rotating the interferometry axis are needed to obtain a full beam reconstruction. In this report we present a new interferometric multi-aperture masking technique and data analysis, inspired by astronomical methods, that are able to provide a full 2-D transverse beam reconstruction in a single acquisition. Results of beam characterization obtained at ALBA synchrotron light source will also been shown.</description>

      <title>Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: tracking a coherent and invertible state localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</description>

      <title>Quantum-limited optical lever measurement of a torsion oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical lever is a precision displacement sensor with broad applications. In principle, it can track the motion of a mechanical oscillator with added noise at the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL); however, demonstrating this performance requires an oscillator with an exceptionally high torque sensitivity, or, equivalently, zero-point angular displacement spectral density. Here, we describe optical lever measurements on Si$_3$N$_4$ nanoribbons possessing $Q&gt;3\times 10^7$ torsion modes with torque sensitivities of $10^{-20}\,\text{N m}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ and zero-point displacement spectral densities of $10^{-10}\,\text{rad}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. Compensating aberrations and leveraging immunity to classical intensity noise, we realize angular displacement measurements with imprecisions 20 dB below the SQL and demonstrate feedback cooling, using a position modulated laser beam as a torque actuator, from room temperature to $\sim5000$ phonons. Our study signals the potential for a new class of torsional quantum optomechanics.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points in perturbed dielectric spheres: A resonant-state expansion study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12536v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) in open optical systems are rigorously studied using the resonant-state expansion (RSE). A spherical resonator, specifically a homogeneous dielectric sphere in a vacuum, perturbed by two point-like defects which break the spherical symmetry and bring the optical modes to EPs, is used as a worked example. The RSE is a non-perturbative approach encoding the information about an open optical system in matrix form in a rigorous way, and thus offering a suitable tool for studying its EPs. These are simultaneous degeneracies of the eigenvalues and corresponding eigenfunctions of the system, which are rigorously described by the RSE and illustrated for perturbed whispering-gallery modes (WGMs). An exceptional arc, which is a line of adjacent EPs, is obtained analytically for perturbed dipolar WGMs. Perturbation of high-quality WGMs with large angular momentum and their EPs are found by reducing the RSE equation to a two-state problem by means of an orthogonal transformation of a large RSE matrix. WGM pairs have opposite chirality in spherically symmetric systems and equal chirality at EPs. This chirality at EPs can be observed in circular dichroism measurements, as it manifested itself in a squared-Lorentzian part of the optical spectra, which we demonstrate here analytically and numerically in the Purcell enhancement factor for the perturbed dipolar WGMs.</description>

      <title>Correlating light fields through disordered media across multiple degrees of freedom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speckle patterns are inherent features of coherent light propagation through complex media. As a result of interference, they are sensitive to multiple experimental parameters such as the configuration of disorder or the propagating wavelength. Recent developments in wavefront shaping have made it possible to control speckle pattern statistics and correlations, for example using the concept of the transmission matrix. In this article, we address the problem of correlating scattered fields across multiple degrees of freedom. We highlight the common points between the specific techniques already demonstrated, and we propose a general framework based on the singular value decomposition of a linear combination of multiple transmission matrices. Following analytical predictions, we experimentally illustrate the technique on spectral and temporal correlations, and we show that both the amplitude and the phase of the field correlations can be tuned. Our work opens up new perspectives in speckle correlation manipulation, with potential applications in coherent control.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate second- and third-harmonic generation processes in Au nanorod systems using the real-time time-dependent density functional tight binding method. Our study focuses on the computation of nonlinear signals based on the time dependent dipole response induced by linearly polarized laser pulses interacting with nanoparticles. We systematically explore the influence of various laser parameters, including pump intensity, duration, frequency, and polarization directions, on harmonic generation. We demonstrate all the results using Au nanorod dimer systems arranged in end-to-end configurations, and disrupting the spatial symmetry of regular single nanorod systems is crucial for second-harmonic generation processes. Furthermore, we study the impact of nanorod lengths, which lead to variable plasmon energies, on harmonic generation, and estimates of polarizabilities and hyper-polarizabilities are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) play a crucial role in almost every aspect of modern life, such as data storage, telecommunications, medical diagnostics, green energy, autonomous driving, agriculture, and high-performance computing. To fully harness their benefits, an efficient coupling mechanism is required to successfully launch light into waveguides from fibers. This study introduces low-loss coupling strategies and their implementation for a silicon nitride integrated platform. Here we present an overview of coupling technologies, optimized designs, and a tutorial on manufacturing techniques for inverted tapers, which enable effective coupling for both transverse-magnetic and transverse-electric modes. The optimized coupling losses for the UHNA-7 fiber and the inverted taper Si3N4 coupler reached -0.15 dB at 1550 nm per connection for single-mode waveguides with 220x1200 nm cross section. The measured coupling losses in the inverted taper coupler with a standard single-mode fiber were -1.50 dB at 1550 nm per connection for the same platform.</description>

      <title>Dielectric microparticles for enhanced optical imaging: a FDTD analysis of contrast and resolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive numerical analysis of super-resolution imaging using dielectric microparticles, employing the Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) method to elucidate the mechanisms that enable resolution enhancements beyond the diffraction limit. Our study demonstrates that dielectric microparticles can achieve a resolution on the order of 50 nm in the visible spectrum, surpassing traditional optical microscopy limits. By simulating the propagation of radiation through a microparticle-object system and generating optical images via a backward propagation technique, we reveal critical insights into how microparticles enhance image contrast and resolution. The study also explores the influence of various parameters, such as source coherence and particle-substrate interactions, on the image formation process. Our results not only validate the super-resolution capability of microparticle-assisted imaging but also provide a robust framework for further advancements in optical imaging technologies, with potential applications in fields requiring ultra-high-resolution visualization.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Phase Estimation with Squeezed Vacuum Approaching the Quantum Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phase estimation plays a central role in communications, sensing, and information processing. Quantum correlated states, such as squeezed states, enable phase estimation beyond the shot-noise limit, and in principle approach the ultimate quantum limit in precision, when paired with optimal quantum measurements. However, physical realizations of optimal quantum measurements for optical phase estimation with quantum-correlated states are still unknown. Here we address this problem by introducing an adaptive Gaussian measurement strategy for optical phase estimation with squeezed vacuum states that, by construction, approaches the quantum limit in precision. This strategy builds from a comprehensive set of locally optimal POVMs through rotations and homodyne measurements and uses the Adaptive Quantum State Estimation framework for optimizing the adaptive measurement process, which, under certain regularity conditions, guarantees asymptotic optimality for this quantum parameter estimation problem. As a result, the adaptive phase estimation strategy based on locally-optimal homodyne measurements achieves the quantum limit within the phase interval of $[0, \pi/2)$. Furthermore, we generalize this strategy by including heterodyne measurements, enabling phase estimation across the full range of phases from $[0, \pi)$, where squeezed vacuum allows for unambiguous phase encoding. Remarkably, for this phase interval, which is the maximum range of phases that can be encoded in squeezed vacuum, this estimation strategy maintains an asymptotic quantum-optimal performance, representing a significant advancement in quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Super-dephasing in Collective Atom-Atom Interactions Mediated by Near-Field Electromagnetic Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pure dephasing and spontaneous emission are two non-unitary processes of atoms or spins interacting with fluctuating electromagnetic (EM) modes. The dissipative collective emission processes (e.g., superradiance) originate from interactions with EM modes in resonance with atoms and have received considerable attention. Meanwhile, the analogous non-dissipative collective dephasing phenomena mediated by EM environments remain poorly understood. Here, we introduce the nano-EM super-dephasing phenomenon arising in the photonic environments near materials. We show that collective dephasing in this nano-EM environment is enhanced by over 10 orders of magnitude compared to free space or cavities. This giant enhancement originates from long-range correlations in off-resonant, low-frequency evanescent EM fluctuations, which lead to collectively accelerated (super-) or suppressed (sub-) dephasing in many-body entangled states. We further unravel that nano-EM collective dephasing exhibits universal interaction ranges near materials with different anisotropy that can be reciprocal or non-reciprocal. This nano-EM interaction range, which is not present in free-space and cavities, leads to unique scaling laws of super-dephasing in GHZ states different from the conventional $N^2$ scaling of superradiance. Finally, we discuss how to experimentally isolate and control super-dephasing to open interesting frontiers for scalable quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Computational Electromagnetics Meets Spin Qubits: Controlling Noise Effects in Quantum Sensing and Computing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid-state spin qubits have emerged as promising platforms for quantum information. Despite extensive efforts in controlling noise in spin qubit quantum applications, one important but less controlled noise source is near-field electromagnetic fluctuations. Low-frequency (MHz and GHz) electromagnetic fluctuations are significantly enhanced near lossy material components in quantum applications, including metallic/superconducting gates necessary for controlling spin qubits in quantum computing devices and materials/nanostructures to be probed in quantum sensing. Although controlling this low-frequency electromagnetic fluctuation noise is crucial for improving the performance of quantum devices, current efforts are hindered by computational challenges. In this paper, we leverage advanced computational electromagnetics techniques, especially fast and accurate volume integral equation based solvers, to overcome the computational obstacle. We introduce a quantum computational electromagnetics framework to control low-frequency magnetic fluctuation noise and enhance spin qubit device performance. Our framework extends the application of computational electromagnetics to spin qubit quantum devices. Furthermore, we demonstrate the application of our framework in realistic quantum devices. Our work paves the way for device engineering to control magnetic fluctuations and improve the performance of spin qubit quantum sensing and computing.</description>

      <title>Room temperature operation of germanium-silicon single-photon avalanche diode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ability to detect single photons has led to the advancement of numerous research fields. Although various types of single-photon detector have been developed, because of two main factors - that is, (1) the need for operating at cryogenic temperature and (2) the incompatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) fabrication processes - so far, to our knowledge, only Si-based single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) has gained mainstream success and has been used in consumer electronics. With the growing demand to shift the operation wavelength from near-infrared to short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) for better safety and performance, an alternative solution is required because Si has negligible optical absorption for wavelengths beyond 1 {\mu}m. Here we report a CMOS-compatible, high-performing germanium-silicon SPAD operated at room temperature, featuring a noise-equivalent power improvement over the previous Ge-based SPADs by 2-3.5 orders of magnitude. Key parameters such as dark count rate, single-photon detection probability at 1,310 nm, timing jitter, after-pulsing characteristic time and after-pulsing probability are, respectively, measured as 19 kHz {\mu}m^2, 12%, 188 ps, ~90 ns and &lt;1%, with a low breakdown voltage of 10.26 V and a small excess bias of 0.75 V. Three-dimensional point-cloud images are captured with direct time-of-flight technique as proof of concept. This work paves the way towards using single-photon-sensitive SWIR sensors, imagers and photonic integrated circuits in everyday life.</description>
