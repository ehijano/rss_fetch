      <title>Empirical Discovery of Multi-Scale Transfer of Information in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we quantify the timescales and information flow associated by multiscale energy transfer in a weakly turbulent system through a novel new interpretation of transfer entropy. Our goal is to provide a detailed understanding of the nature of complex energy transfer in nonlinear dispersive systems driven by wave mixing. Further, we present a modal decomposition method based on the empirical wavelet transform that produces a relatively small number of nearly decorrelated, scale separated modes. Using our method, we are able to track multiscale energy transfer using only scalar time series measurements of a weakly turbulent system. This points to our approach being of broader applicability in real-world data coming from chaotic or turbulent dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Quasiclassical quantization of the Boussinesq breather emerging from the kink localized mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The breather solution found by M. Tajiri and Y. Murakami for the Boussinesq equation is studied analytically. The new parameterization of the solution is proposed, allowing us to find exactly the existence boundary of the Boussinesq breather and to show that such a nonlinear excitation emerges from the linear localized mode of the kink solution corresponding to a shock wave analog in a crystal. We explicitly find the first integrals, namely the energy and the field momentum, and faithfully construct the adiabatic invariant for the Boussinesq breather. As a result, we carry out the quasiclassical quantization of the nonlinear oscillating solution, obtaining its energy spectrum, i.e., the energy dependence on the momentum and the number of states, and reveal the Hamiltonian equations for this particle-like excitation.</description>

      <title>Controller for rejection of the first harmonic in periodic signal with uncertain delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11731v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The plant (system to be controlled) is disturbed by an external periodic signal containing a broad spectrum of Fourier harmonics. The first Fourier harmonic (sine-type signal) is assumed to be undesirable and should be removed by a control force, while other harmonics should be preserved without distortion. Because the measured plant data has an unknown amount of time delay (dead time) and the sensitivity of the plant to external force is unknown, thus the amplitude and the phase of an anti-sine control force are also unknown. Based on an internal model principle, we developed a feedback controller described as a linear time-invariant system that can remove the first harmonic from the plant's output by constantly adjusting its parameters of control force. That type of controller was requested to extend further the capabilities of a newly developed high-speed large-area rotational scanning atomic force microscopy technique where the sample is rotated, and a tilt angle between the normal of the sample surface and the axis of rotation produces the parasitic first Fourier harmonic which significantly limits the scanning area.</description>

      <title>Oscillons from $Q$-balls through renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a renormalization-inspired perturbation expansion we show that oscillons in a generic field theory in (1+1) dimensions arise as dressed $Q$-balls of a universal (up to the leading nonlinear order) complex field theory. This theory reveals a close similarity to the integrable complex sine-Gordon model which possesses exact multi-$Q$-balls. We show that excited oscillons, with characteristic modulations of their amplitude, are two-oscillons bound states generated from a two $Q$-ball solution.</description>

      <title>Oscillons from $Q$-balls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Renormalization Group Theory we show that oscillons in (1+1)-dimensions can be obtained, at the leading nonlinear order, from $Q$-balls of universal complex field theories. For potentials with a nonzero cubic or quartic term the universal $Q$-ball theory is well approximated by the integrable complex sine-Gordon model. This allows us to generalize the usual perturbative expansion by Fodor et. al. beyond the simplest unmodulated oscillon case. Concretely, we explain the characteristic amplitude modulations of excited oscillons as an effect of formation of a two-$Q$-ball (two-oscillon) bound state.</description>
