      <title>Fine structure in the Sigma Orionis cluster revealed by Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sigma Orionis is an open cluster in the nearest giant star formation site - Orion. Its youth (3-5 Myr), low reddening, and relative vicinity make it an important benchmark cluster to study stellar and substellar formation and evolution. Young star-forming sites are complex and hierarchical. Precision astrometry from Gaia DR3 enables the exploration of their fine structure. We used the modified convergent point technique to kinematically re-evaluate the members in the Sigma Orionis cluster and its vicinity. We present clear evidence for three kinematically distinct groups in the Sigma Orionis region. The second group, the RV Orionis association, is adjacent to the Sigma Orionis cluster and is composed only of low-mass stars. The third group, the Flame association, whose age is comparable to that of Sigma Orionis, overlaps with the younger NGC 2024 in the Flame Nebula. In total, we have discovered 105 members of this complex not previously found in the literature (82 in Sigma Orionis, 19 in the Flame association, and 4 in the RV Orionis association).</description>

      <title>Observational predictions for the survival of atomic hydrogen in simulated Fornax-like galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of dense, neutral hydrogen clouds in the hot, diffuse intra-group and intra-cluster medium is an important clue to the physical processes controlling the survival of cold gas and sheds light on cosmological baryon flows in massive halos. Advances in numerical modeling and observational surveys means that theory and observational comparisons are now possible. In this paper, we use the high-resolution TNG50 cosmological simulation to study the HI distribution in seven halos with masses similar to the Fornax galaxy cluster. Adopting observational sensitivities similar to the MeerKAT Fornax Survey (MFS), an ongoing HI survey that will probe to column densities of $10^{18}$ cm$^{-2}$, we find that Fornax-like TNG50 halos have an extended distribution of neutral hydrogen clouds. Within one virial radius, we predict the MFS will observe a total HI covering fraction around $\sim$ 12\% (mean value) for 10 kpc pixels and 6\% for 2 kpc pixels. If we restrict this to gas more than 10 half-mass radii from galaxies, the mean values only decrease mildly, to 10\% (4\%) for 10 (2) kpc pixels (albeit with significant halo-to-halo spread). Although there are large amounts of HI outside of galaxies, the gas seems to be associated with satellites, judging both by the visual inspection of projections and by comparison of the line of sight velocities of galaxies and intracluster HI.</description>

      <title>IRX-CIGALE: a tailored module for Low-Luminosity AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral energy distribution (SED) of low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGN) presents unique challenges due to their comparable radiation output to their host galaxies and complex accretion dynamics. We introduce a novel module within the CIGALE framework specifically designed for SED fitting of LLAGN, incorporating both empirical relationships like $L_\mathrm{X}$--$L_\mathrm{12\mu m}$ and physically-based accretion models such as advection-dominated accretion flows (ADAFs) and truncated accretion disks. This allows for more accurate depiction of LLAGN central emissions.
  Using this module, we analyzed a set of 52 X-ray-detected local galaxies, primarily LINERs and Seyferts, and compared its performance to higher-luminosity AGN from the COSMOS and SDSS datasets. Our results show that the module adeptly estimates bolometric luminosities with high precision, despite significant galaxy contamination. It also introduces a versatile X-ray bolometric correction formula covering a vast range of luminosities.
  Further, our study explored the $\alpha_\mathrm{ox}$ index, which measures the UV to X-ray emission slope, showing that unlike quasars, LLAGN display either stable or only slightly varying $\alpha_\mathrm{ox}$ values, indicating differing accretion and photon production processes in the low luminosity regime. Additionally, we observed a significant drop of 1.4 dex in specific star formation rates when moving from whole galaxies to a central 9-arcsecond aperture in LLAGN, suggesting potential feedback mechanisms at play.
  Overall, our findings underscore the importance of a multiwavelength approach in AGN studies, highlighting distinct behaviors of LLAGN compared to quasars, thus enhancing our understanding of LLAGN and providing a framework for future comprehensive AGN population studies.</description>

      <title>On the mass assembly history of the Milky Way: clues from its stellar halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar halos of galaxies retain crucial clues to their mass assembly history. It is in these galactic components that the remains of cannibalised galactic building blocks are deposited. For the case of the Milky Way, the opportunity to analyse the stellar halo's structure on a star-by-star basis in a multi-faceted approach provides a basis from which to infer its past and assembly history in unrivalled detail. Moreover, the insights that can be gained about the formation of the Galaxy not only help constrain the evolution of our Milky Way, but may also help place constraints on the formation of other disc galaxies in the Universe. This paper includes a summary of work undertaken during a PhD thesis aiming to make progress toward answering the most fundamental question in the field of Galactic archaeology: "How did the Milky Way form?" Through the effort to answer this question, we summarise new insights into aspects of the history of assembly and evolution of our Galaxy and measurements of the structure of various of its Galactic components.</description>

      <title>Action-Angle Variables for Axisymmetric Potentials via Birkhoff Normalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe a method for calculating action-angle variables in axisymmetric galactic potentials using Birkhoff normalization, a technique from Hamiltonian perturbation theory. An advantageous feature of this method is that it yields explicit series expressions for both the forward and inverse transformations between the action-angle variables and position-velocity data. It also provides explicit expressions for the Hamiltonian and dynamical frequencies as functions of the action variables. We test this method by examining orbits in a Miyamoto-Nagai model potential and compare it to the popular St\"ackel approximation method. When vertical actions are not too large, the Birkhoff normalization method achieves fractional errors smaller than a part in $10^{3}$ and outperforms the St\"ackel approximation. We also show that the range over which Birkhoff normalization provides accurate results can be extended by constructing Pad\'e approximants from the perturbative series expressions developed with the method. Numerical routines in Python for carrying out the Birkhoff normalization procedure are made available.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of GN-z11 Explored by JWST Integral Field Spectroscopy: Gaseous Rotating Disk at z=10.60 Suggestive of Weak Feedback?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of GN-z11, a luminous galaxy at $z=10.60$, carefully analyzing the public deep integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data taken with JWST NIRSpec IFU. While the observations of the IFS data originally targeted a He II clump near GN-z11, we find that C III]$\lambda\lambda1907,1909$ emission from ionized gas at GN-z11 is bright and spatially extended significantly beyond the point-spread function (PSF) in contrast with the GN-z11's compact UV-continuum morphology. The spatially extended C III] emission of GN-z11 shows a velocity gradient, red- and blue-shifted components in the NE and SW directions, respectively, which cannot be explained by the variation of [C III]$\lambda$1907/C III]$\lambda$1909 line ratios. We perform forward modeling with GalPak$^\mathrm{3D}$, including the effects of PSF smearing and line blending, and find that the best-fit model is a nearly edge-on disk with a rotation velocity of $v_\mathrm{rot}$=$376_{-151}^{+110}$ km s$^{-1}$, a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v=113_{-48}^{+24}$ km s$^{-1}$, and a ratio of $v_\mathrm{rot}/\sigma_v=3.3_{-1.5}^{+1.7}$, indicative of a rotation-dominated disk at $z=10.6$. Interestingly, the disk rotation velocity is faster than the circular velocity at the virial radius, $v_\mathrm{c}(r_{200})=205_{-34}^{+28}$ km s$^{-1}$, estimated from the stellar mass, suggesting a compact disk produced under weak feedback such predicted in numerical simulations. In fact, the half-light radius of the C III] emitting gas disk is only $294\pm45$ pc, while the one of the stellar UV component is even smaller, $196\pm12$ pc. While higher S/N data are necessary for a conclusion, these observational results would suggest that GN-z11 has a fast-rotating gaseous disk whose center possesses luminous stellar components or AGN providing weak feedback.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Subtleties in the Scaling of the 'Terminal Momentum' For Galaxy Formation Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In galaxy formation simulations, it is increasingly common to represent supernovae (SNe) at finite resolution (when the Sedov-Taylor phase is unresolved) via hybrid energy-momentum coupling with some 'terminal momentum' $p_{\rm term}$ (depending weakly on ambient density and metallicity) that represents unresolved work from an energy-conserving phase. Numerical implementations can ensure momentum and energy conservation of such methods, but these require that couplings depend on the surrounding gas velocity field (radial velocity $\langle v_{r} \rangle$). This raises the question of whether $p_{\rm term}$ should also be velocity-dependent, which we explore analytically and in simulations. We show that for simple spherical models, the dependence of $p_{\rm term}$ on $\langle v_{r} \rangle$ introduces negligible corrections beyond those already imposed by energy conservation if $\langle v_{r} \rangle \ge 0$. However, for SNe in some net converging flow ($\langle v_{r} \rangle&lt;0$), naively coupling the total momentum when a blastwave reaches the standard cooling/snowplow phase (or some effective cooling time/velocity/temperature criterion) leads to enormous $p_{\rm term}$ and potentially pathological behaviors. We propose an alternative $\Delta$-Momentum formulation which represents the differential SNe effect and show this leads to opposite behavior of $p_{\rm term}$ in this limit. We also consider a more conservative velocity-independent formulation. Testing in numerical simulations, these directly translate to large effects on predicted star formation histories and stellar masses of massive galaxies, explaining differences between some models and motivating further study in idealized simulations.</description>

      <title>Cepheid Metallicity in the Leavitt Law (C- MetaLL) survey: VI: Radial abundance gradients of 29 chemical species in the Milky Way Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) are crucial for calibrating the extragalactic distance ladder, ultimately enabling the determination of the Hubble constant through the PL and PW relations they exhibit. Hence it's vital to understand how the PL and PW relations depend on metallicity. This is the purpose of the C-MetaLL survey within which this work is situated. DCEPs are also very important tracers of the young populations placed along the Galactic disc. We aim to enlarge the sample of DCEPs with accurate abundances from high-resolution spectroscopy. Our goal is to extend the range of measured metallicities towards the metal-poor regime to better cover the parameter space. We observed objects in a wide range of Galactocentric radii, allowing us to study in detail the abundance gradients present in the Galactic disc. We present the results of the analysis of 331 spectra obtained for 180 individual DCEPs with a variety of high-resolution spectrographs. We derived accurate atmospheric parameters, radial velocities, and abundances for up to 29 different species. The iron abundances range between 0.5 and -1 dex with a rather homogeneous distribution in metallicity. The sample presented in this paper was complemented with that already published in the context of the C-MetaLL survey, resulting in a total of 292 pulsators whose spectra have been analysed in a homogeneous way. These data were used to study the abundance gradients of the Galactic disc in a range of Galactocentric radii spanning the range 5-20 kpc. For most of the elements we found a clear negative gradient, with a slope of -0.071\pm0.003 dex kpc^-1 for [Fe/H] case. Through a qualitative fit with the Galactic spiral arms we shown how our farthest targets (R_GC&gt;10 kpc) trace both the Outer and OSC arms. The homogeneity of the sample will be of pivotal importance for the study of the metallicity dependance of the DCEP PL relations.</description>

      <title>Inefficient star formation in high Mach number environments I. The turbulent support analytical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star formation rate (SFR), the number of stars formed per unit of time, is a fundamental quantity in the evolution of the Universe. While turbulence is believed to play a crucial role in setting the SFR, the exact mechanism remains unclear. Turbulence promotes star formation by compressing the gas, but also slows it down by stabilizing the gas against gravity. Most widely-used analytical models rely on questionable assumptions, including: $i)$ integrating over the density PDF, a one-point statistical description that ignores spatial correlation, $ii)$ selecting self-gravitating gas based on a density threshold that often ignores turbulent dispersion, $iii)$ assuming the freefall time as the timescale for estimating SFR without considering the need to rejuvenate the density PDF, $iv)$ assuming the density PDF to be lognormal. Improving upon the only existing model that incorporates the spatial correlation of the density field, we present a new analytical model. We calculate the time needed to rejuvenate density fluctuations of a given density and spatial scale, revealing that it is generally much longer than the freefall time, rendering the latter inappropriate for use. We make specific predictions regarding the role of the Mach number, $ M $, and the driving scale of turbulence divided by the mean Jeans length. At low to moderate Mach numbers, turbulence does not reduce and may even slightly promote star formation by broadening the PDF. However, at higher Mach numbers, most density fluctuations are stabilized by turbulent dispersion, leading to a steep drop in the SFR as the Mach number increases.</description>

      <title>Inefficient star formation in high Mach number environments. II. Numerical simulations and comparison with analytical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies is crucial to understand their evolution and morphology. To do so requires a fine understanding of how dense structures of gas are created and collapse. In that, turbulence and gravity play a major role. Within the gravo-turbulent framework, we assume that turbulence shapes the ISM, creating density fluctuations that, if gravitationally unstable, will collapse and form stars. The goal of this work is to quantify how different regimes of turbulence, characterized by the strength and compressibility of the driving, shape the density field. We are interested in the outcome in terms of SFR and how it compares with existing analytical models for the SFR. We run a series of hydrodynamical simulations of turbulent gas. The simulations are first conducted without gravity, so that the density and velocity are shaped by the turbulence driving. Gravity is then switched on, and the SFR is measured and compared with analytical models. The physics included in these simulations is very close to the one assumed in the classical gravo-turbulent SFR analytical models, which makes the comparison straightforward. We found that the existing analytical models convincingly agree with simulations at low Mach number, but we measure a much lower SFR in the simulation with a high Mach number. We develop, in a companion paper, an updated physically-motivated SFR model that reproduces well the inefficient high Mach regime of the simulations. Our work demonstrates that accurate estimations of the turbulent-driven replenishment time of dense structures and the dense gas spatial distribution are necessary to correctly predict the SFR in the high Mach regime. The inefficient high-Mach regime is a possible explanation for the low SFR found in dense and turbulent environments such as the centers of our Milky Way and other galaxies.</description>

      <title>Extreme Emission-Line Galaxies in the MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a methodology to build a sample of extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) using integral field spectroscopy data. In this work we follow the spectroscopic criteria corresponding for EELG selection and use the MUSE Hubble Ultra-Deep field survey, which includes the deepest spectroscopic survey ever performed. Objects in the primary (extended) sample were detected requiring a rest-frame equivalent width EWo $\geqslant$ 300A (200A $\leq$ EWo $\leq$ 300A) in any of the emission lines of [OII]$\lambda\lambda$3726,29, [OIII]$\lambda\lambda$5007,4959, or H$\alpha$. A detailed closer inspection of the spectra of the candidates selected has been performed on a one by one basis, in order to confirm their classification. For this sample, the line fluxes, physical properties and chemical abundances of the EELGs have been derived as well as their spatially resolved structure and kinematics. Four (five) of the galaxies in the primary (extended) sample, $\sim$57$\%$ ($\sim$83$\%$), were spatially resolved. Three (none) of them present a clear pattern compatible with rotation. We have shown how our entire EELGs sample share the same loci defined by high-redshift galaxies (z $\approx$ 6-8) for the mass-metallicity relation, illustrating their role as local analogs.</description>

      <title>Forming off-center massive black hole binaries in dwarf galaxies through Jacobi capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well established that black holes reside in the central regions of virtually all types of known galaxies. Recent observational and numerical studies however challenge this picture, suggesting that intermediate-mass black holes in dwarf galaxies may be found on orbits far from the center. In particular, constant-density cores minimize orbital energy losses due to dynamical friction, and allow black holes to settle on stable off-center orbits. Using controlled simulations, we study the dynamics of off-center black holes in dwarf galaxies with such cores. We propose a new scenario to describe off-center mergers of massive black holes, starting with a Jacobi capture. We focus on initially circular and co-planar black hole orbits and explore a large parameter space of black hole masses and orbital parameters. We find that Jacobi captures are a complex and chaotic phenomenon that occurs in about 13% of cases in this simplified setup, and we quantify how the likelihood of capture depends on the simulation parameters. We note that this percentage is likely an upper limit of the general case. Nevertheless, we show that Jacobi captures in cored dwarf galaxies can facilitate the formation of off-center black hole binaries, and that this process is sufficiently common to have a substantial effect on black hole growth. While our setup only allows for temporary captures, we expect dissipative forces from baryons and post-Newtonian corrections to maintain the captures over time and to lead to the formation of stable binary systems. This motivates future studies of the effectiveness of such dissipative forces, within stripped nuclei or globular clusters, in forming stable bound systems.</description>

      <title>[OI] fine structure line profiles in Mon R2 and M17 SW: the puzzling nature of cold foreground material identified by [12CII] self-absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Recent studies of the optical depth comparing [12CII] and [13CII] line profiles in Galactic star-forming regions revealed strong self-absorption in [12CII] by low excitation foreground material, implying a large column density of C+ corresponding to an equivalent AV of a few, up to about 10 mag.
  Aims. As the nature and origin of such a large column of cold C+ foreground gas are difficult to explain, it is essential to constrain the physical conditions of this material.
  Methods. We conducted high-resolution observations of [OI] 63 um and [OI] 145 um lines in M17 SW and Mon R2. The [OI] 145 um transition traces warm PDR-material, while the [OI] 63 um line traces foreground material as manifested by absorption dips.
  Results. Comparison of both [OI] line profiles with [CII] isotopic lines confirms warm PDR-origin background emission and a significant column of cold foreground material causing self-absorption visible in [12CII] and [OI] 63 um profiles. In M17 SW, the C+ and O column densities are comparable for both layers. Mon R2 exhibits larger O columns compared to C+, indicating additional material where the carbon is neutral or in molecular form. Small-scale spatial variation of the foreground absorption profiles and the large column density (around 1E18 cm-2 ) of the foreground material suggest emission from high-density regions associated with the cloud complex, not a uniform diffuse foreground cloud.
  Conclusions. The analysis confirms that the previously detected intense [CII] foreground absorption is attributable to a large column of low excitation dense atomic material, where carbon is ionized, and oxygen is in neutral atomic form.</description>

      <title>The boring history of Gaia BH3 from isolated binary evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaia BH3 is the first observed dormant black hole (BH) with a mass of $\approx{30}$ M$_\odot$ and represents the first confirmation that such massive BHs are associated with metal-poor stars. Here, we explore the isolated binary formation channel for Gaia BH3 focusing on the old and metal-poor stellar population of the Milky Way halo. We use our open-source population synthesis code SEVN to evolve $3.2 \times 10^8$ binaries exploring 16 sets of parameters. We find that systems like Gaia BH3 form preferentially from binaries initially composed of a massive star ($40-60$ M$_\odot$) and a low mass companion ($&lt;1$ M$_\odot$) in a wide ($P&gt;10^3$ days) and eccentric orbit ($e&gt;0.6$). Such progenitors do not undergo any Roche-lobe overflow episode during their entire evolution, so that the final orbital properties of the BH-star system are essentially determined at the core collapse of the primary star. Low natal kicks ($\approx$ 10~km/s) significantly favour the formation of Gaia BH3-like systems, but high velocity kicks up to $\approx 220$ km/s are also allowed. We estimate the formation efficiency for Gaia BH3-like systems in old ($t&gt;10$ Gyr) and metal-poor ($Z&lt;0.01$) populations to be $4 \times 10^{-8}$ M$_\odot^{-1}$, representing $\approx 3\%$ of the whole simulated BH-star population. We expect up to $\sim 3000$ BH-star systems in the Galactic halo formed through isolated evolution, of which $\sim 100$ are compatible with Gaia BH3 alike. Gaia BH3-like systems represent a common product of isolated binary evolution at low metallicity ($Z&lt;0.01$), but given the steep density profile of the Galactic halo we do not expect more than one in the halo at the observed distance of Gaia BH3. Considering the estimated formation efficiency for both the isolated and dynamical formation channel, we conclude that they are almost equally likely to explain the origin of Gaia BH3.</description>

      <title>The galaxy-galaxy strong lensing cross section and the internal distribution of matter in {\Lambda}CDM substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe of the detailed distribution of matter in lenses, while magnifying and bringing faint background sources into view. Observed strong lensing by massive galaxy clusters, which are often in complex dynamical states, has also been used to map their dark matter substructures on smaller scales. Deep high resolution imaging has revealed the presence of strong lensing events associated with these substructures, namely galaxy-scale sub-halos. However, an inventory of these observed galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) events is noted to be discrepant with state-of-the-art {\Lambda}CDM simulations. Cluster sub-halos appear to be over-concentrated compared to their simulated counterparts yielding an order of magnitude higher value of GGSL. In this paper, we explore the possibility of resolving this observed discrepancy by redistributing the mass within observed cluster sub-halos in ways that are consistent within the {\Lambda}CDM paradigm of structure formation. Lensing mass reconstructions from data provide constraints on the mass enclosed within apertures and are agnostic to the detailed mass profile within them. Therefore, as the detailed density profile within cluster sub-halos currently remains unconstrained by data, we are afforded the freedom to redistribute the enclosed mass. We investigate if rearranging the mass to a more centrally concentrated density profile helps alleviate the GGSL discrepancy. We report that refitting cluster sub-halos to the ubiquitous {\Lambda}CDM-motivated Navarro-Frenk-White profile, and further modifying them to include significant baryonic components, does not resolve this tension. A resolution to this persisting GGSL discrepancy may require more careful exploration of alternative dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Milky Way and Nearby Galaxies Science with the Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies (\textit{SALTUS}) Space Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an overview of the Milky Way and nearby galaxies science case for the \textit{Single Aperture Large Telescope for Universe Studies} (SALTUS) far-infrared NASA probe-class mission concept. SALTUS offers enormous gains in spatial resolution and spectral sensitivity over previous far-IR missions, thanks to its cold ($&lt;$40~K) 14-m primary mirror. Key Milky Way and nearby galaxies science goals for SALTUS focus on understanding the role of star formation in feedback in the Local Universe. In addition to this science case, SALTUS would open a new window to to of Galactic and extragalactic communities in the 2030s, enable fundamentally new questions to be answered, and be a far-IR analog to the near- and mid-IR capabilities of JWST. This paper summarizes the Milky Way and nearby galaxies science case and plans for notional observing programs in both guaranteed and guest (open) time.</description>

      <title>LAMOST J1010+2358 is not a Pair-Instability Supernova Relic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of a star formed out of pair-instability supernova ejecta would have massive implications for the Population III star initial mass function and the existence of stars over 100 Msun, but none have yet been found. Recently, the star LAMOST J1010+2358 was claimed to be a star that formed out of gas enriched by a pair-instability supernova. We present a non-LTE abundance analysis of a new high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectrum of J1010+2358. We determined the carbon and aluminum abundances needed to definitively distinguish between enrichment by a pair-instability and core-collapse supernova. Our new analysis demonstrates that J1010+2358 does not have the unique abundance pattern of a a pair-instability supernova, but was instead enriched by the ejecta of a low mass core-collapse supernova. Thus, there are still no known stars displaying unambiguous signatures of pair-instability supernovae.</description>

      <title>Bridging theory and observations in stellar pulsations: The impact of convection and metallicity on the instability strips of Classical and Type-II Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effect of metallicity on the theoretical and empirical period-luminosity (PL) relations of Cepheid variables is not well understood and remains a highly debated issue. Here, we examine empirical colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of Classical and Type-II Cepheids in the Magellanic Clouds and compare those with the theoretically predicted instability strip (IS) edges. We explore the effects of incorporating turbulent flux, turbulent pressure, and radiative cooling into the convection theory on the predicted IS at various metallicities using MESA-RSP. We find that the edges become redder with the increasing complexity of convection physics incorporated in the fiducial convection sets, and are similarly shifted to the red with increasing metallicity. The inclusion of turbulent flux and pressure improves the agreement of the red edge of the IS, while their exclusion leads to better agreement with observations of the blue edge. About 90% of observed stars are found to fall within the predicted bluest and reddest edges across the considered variations of turbulent convection parameters. Furthermore, we identify and discuss discrepancies between theoretical and observed CMDs in the low effective temperature and high luminosity regions for stars with periods greater than ~ 20 days. These findings highlight the potential for calibrating the turbulent convection parameters in stellar pulsation models or the prediction of a new class of rare, long-period, 'red Cepheids', thereby improving our understanding of Cepheids and their role in cosmological studies.</description>

      <title>The Inefficiency of Genetic Programming for Symbolic Regression -- Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the search behaviour of genetic programming for symbolic regression in practically relevant but limited settings, allowing exhaustive enumeration of all solutions. This enables us to quantify the success probability of finding the best possible expressions, and to compare the search efficiency of genetic programming to random search in the space of semantically unique expressions. This analysis is made possible by improved algorithms for equality saturation, which we use to improve the Exhaustive Symbolic Regression algorithm; this produces the set of semantically unique expression structures, orders of magnitude smaller than the full symbolic regression search space. We compare the efficiency of random search in the set of unique expressions and genetic programming. For our experiments we use two real-world datasets where symbolic regression has been used to produce well-fitting univariate expressions: the Nikuradse dataset of flow in rough pipes and the Radial Acceleration Relation of galaxy dynamics. The results show that genetic programming in such limited settings explores only a small fraction of all unique expressions, and evaluates expressions repeatedly that are congruent to already visited expressions.</description>

      <title>The SRG/eROSITA All-Sky Survey: Exploring halo assembly bias with X-ray selected superclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore halo assembly bias on cluster scales using large samples of superclusters. Leveraging the largest-ever X-ray galaxy cluster and supercluster samples obtained from the first SRG/eROSITA all-sky survey, we construct two subsamples of galaxy clusters which consist of supercluster members (SC) and isolated clusters (ISO) respectively. After correcting the selection effects on redshift, mass, and survey depth, we compute the excess in the concentration of the intracluster gas of isolated clusters with respect to supercluster members, defined as $\delta c_{\rm gas} \equiv c_{\rm gas,ISO}/c_{\rm gas,SC}-1$, to investigate the environmental effect on the concentration of clusters, an inference of halo assembly bias on cluster scales. We find that the average gas mass concentration of isolated clusters is a few percent higher than that of supercluster members, with a significance of $2\sigma$. The result on $\delta c_{\rm gas}$ varies with the overdensity ratio $f$ in supercluster identification, cluster mass proxies, and mass ranges, but remains positive in all the measurements. We measure slightly larger $\delta c_{\rm gas}$ when adopting a higher $f$ in supercluster identification. $\delta c_{\rm gas}$ is also larger for low-mass clusters, and almost negligible for high-mass clusters. We perform weak lensing analyses to compare the total mass concentration of the two classes and find a similar trend as obtained from gas mass concentration. Our results are consistent with the prediction of HAB on cluster scales, where halos located in denser environments are less concentrated, and this trend is stronger for low-mass halos than for massive halos. These phenomena can be interpreted by the fact that clusters in denser environments such as superclusters have experienced more mergers than isolated clusters in their assembling history.</description>

      <title>MIDIS: JWST/MIRI reveals the Stellar Structure of ALMA-selected Galaxies in the Hubble-UDF at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present deep James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/MIRI F560W observations of a flux-limited, ALMA-selected sample of 28 galaxies at z=0.5-3.6 in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). The data from the MIRI Deep Imaging Survey (MIDIS) reveal the stellar structure of the HUDF galaxies at rest-wavelengths of &gt;1 micron for the first time. We revise the stellar mass estimates using new JWST photometry and find good agreement with pre-JWST analysis; the few discrepancies can be explained by blending issues in the earlier lower-resolution Spitzer data. At z~2.5, the resolved rest-frame near-infrared (1.6 micron) structure of the galaxies is significantly more smooth and centrally concentrated than seen by HST at rest-frame 450 nm (F160W), with effective radii of Re(F560W)=1-5 kpc and S\'ersic indices mostly close to an exponential (disk-like) profile (n~1), up to n~5 (excluding AGN). We find an average size ratio of Re(F560W)/Re(F160W)~0.7 that decreases with stellar mass. The stellar structure of the ALMA-selected galaxies is indistinguishable from a HUDF reference sample of galaxies with comparable MIRI flux density. We supplement our analysis with custom-made, position-dependent, empirical PSF models for the F560W observations. The results imply that a smoother stellar structure is in place in massive gas-rich, star-forming galaxies at Cosmic Noon, despite a more clumpy rest-frame optical appearance, placing additional constraints on galaxy formation simulations. As a next step, matched-resolution, resolved ALMA observations will be crucial to further link the mass- and light-weighted galaxy structures to the dusty interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Supernova Ejecta with Crystalline Silicate Dust in the Supernova Remnant MSH 15-52</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: IRAS 15099-5856 in the young supernova remnant (SNR) MSH 15-52 is the first and only SNR-associated object with crystalline silicate dust detected so far, although its nature and the origin of the crystalline silicate are still unclear. In this paper, we present high-resolution mid-infrared (MIR) imaging observations of the bright central compact source IRS1 of IRAS 15099-5856 to study the spatial distributions of gas and dust and the analysis of its Spitzer MIR spectrum to explore the origin of IRS1. The MIR images obtained with the T-ReCS attached on the Gemini South telescope show a complicated, inhomogeneous morphology of IRS1 with bright clumps and diffuse emission in [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m and Qa 18.30 $\mu$m, which confirms that IRS1 is an extended source externally heated by the nearby O star Muzzio 10, a candidate for the binary companion of the progenitor star. The Spitzer MIR spectrum reveals several ionic emission lines including a strong [Ne II] 12.81 $\mu$m line, but no hydrogen line is detected. We model the spectrum using the photoionization code CLOUDY with varying elemental composition. The elemental abundance of IRS1 derived from the model is close to that of SN ejecta with depleted hydrogen and enhanced metals, particularly neon, argon, and iron. Our results imply that IRS1 originates from the SN ejecta and suggest the possibility of the formation of crystalline silicate in newly-formed SN dust.</description>

      <title>Stellar Populations With Optical Spectra: Deep Learning vs. Popular Spectrum Fitting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare the performance of several popular spectrum fitting codes (Firefly, starlight, pyPipe3D and pPXF), and a deep-learning convolutional neural network (StarNet), in recovering known stellar population properties (mean stellar age, stellar metallicity, stellar mass-to-light ratio M*/L_r and the internal E(B-V)) of simulated galaxy spectra in optical wavelengths. Our mock spectra are constructed from star-formation histories from the IllustrisTNG100-1 simulation. These spectra mimic the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) through a novel method of including the noise, sky residuals and emission lines taken directly from SDSS. We find that StarNet vastly outperforms all conventional codes in both speed and recovery of stellar population properties (error scatter &lt; 0.08 dex, average biases &lt; 0.02 dex for all tested quantities), but it requires an appropriate training set. Of the non-machine-learning codes, pPXF was a factor of 3-4 times faster than the other codes, and was the best in recovering stellar population properties (error scatter of &lt; 0.11 dex, average biases &lt; 0.08 dex). However, the errors and biases are strongly dependent on both true and predicted values of stellar age and metallicity, and signal-to-noise ratio. The biases of all codes can approach 0.15 dex in stellar ages, metallicities and log M*/L_r , but remain &lt; 0.05 for E(B-V). Using unrealistic Gaussian noise in the construction of mock spectra will underestimate the errors in the metallicities by a factor of two or more, and mocks without emission lines will underestimate the errors in stellar age and M*/L_r by a factor of two.</description>

      <title>The Interaction Between Stars and Past AGN Disk: Possible Explanation for the Kinematic Distributions of S-stars in the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of young stars, aged around several million years and situated within the range of $\sim 0.04-1$ pc from our Galactic center raises a question about their origins and dynamical evolutions. Their kinematics provide an opportunity to explore their formation or possible subsequent dynamical evolution. If Sagittarius A* was active in the past as suggested by several observations, the accretion disk may have a significant impact on the dynamics of stars in the Galactic center. The drag force exerted on stars during star-disk interaction could lead some of them to sink into the accretion disk, and these embedded stars will rapidly migrate inward and eventually be disrupted within $\sim10^5$ yr. This could roughly explain the absence of stars within $2.5 \times 10^4 R_{\rm g}$ ($\sim$ 1000 au). Additionally, Kozai-Lidov oscillations, induced by the gravitational perturbation of the disk, could contribute to the bimodal distribution of S-star inclinations and drive a majority of stars into high eccentricity orbits.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Driven Relativistic Jet in the High-Redshift Blazar OH~471</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context : Understanding the mechanisms that launch and shape powerful relativistic jets from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in high-redshift active galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial for probing the co-evolution of SMBHs and galaxies over cosmic time.
  Aims :We study the high-redshift ($z=3.396$) blazar OH~471 to explore the jet launching mechanism in the early Universe.
  Methods : Using multi-frequency radio monitoring observations and high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry imaging over three decades, we study the milliarcsecond structure and long-term variability of OH~471.
  Results : Spectral modelling of the radio flux densities reveals a synchrotron self-absorbed spectrum indicating strong magnetic fields within the compact core. By applying the flux freezing approximation, we estimate the magnetic flux carried by the jet and find that it reaches or exceeds theoretical predictions for jets powered by black hole spin energy via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. This implies that OH~471 was in a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state where the magnetic flux accumulated near the horizon regulates the accretion flow, allowing efficient extraction of black hole rotational energy.
  Conclusions : Our study demonstrates the dominance of MAD accretion in powering the prominent radio flares and relativistic jets observed in the radio-loud AGN OH~471 and statistical studies of large samples of high-redshift AGN will shed light on the role of MAD accretion in launching and accelerating the earliest relativistic jets.</description>

Abstract: The tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) allows for the measurement of precise and accurate distances to nearby galaxies, based on the brightest ascent of low-mass red giant branch stars before they undergo the helium flash. With the advent of JWST, there is great promise to utilize the technique to measure galaxy distances out to at least 50 Mpc, significantly further than HST's reach of 20 Mpc. However, with any standard candle, it is first necessary to provide an absolute reference. Here we use Cycle 1 data to provide an absolute calibration in the F090W filter. F090W is most similar to the F814W filter commonly used for TRGB measurements with HST, which had been adopted by the community due to minimal dependence from the underlying metallicities and ages of stars. The imaging we use was taken in the outskirts of NGC 4258, which has a direct geometrical distance measurement from the Keplerian motion of its water megamaser. Utilizing several measurement techniques, we find $M_{TRGB}^{F090W}$ = -4.362 $\pm$ 0.033 (stat) $\pm$ 0.045 (sys) mag (Vega) for the metal-poor TRGB. We also perform measurements of the TRGB in two Type Ia supernova hosts, NGC 1559, and NGC 5584. We find good agreement between our TRGB distances and previous distance determinations to these galaxies from Cepheids ($\Delta$ = 0.01 $\pm$ 0.06 mag), with these differences being too small to explain the Hubble tension ($\sim$0.17 mag). As a final bonus, we showcase the serendipitous discovery of a faint dwarf galaxy near NGC 5584.</description>

      <title>3D physical structure and angular expansion of the remnant of the recurrent nova T Pyx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the analysis of archival Very Large Telescope (VLT) MUSE and multi-epoch Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFPC2 and WFC3/UVIS narrow-band observations of the remnant associated with the ejecta of the mid-nineteenth century outburst of the recurrent nova T Pyx. These data sets are used to investigate its true 3D physical structure and the nebular expansion patterns along the line of sight and on the plane of the sky. The VLT MUSE emission line maps and 3D visualisations based on position-position-velocity diagrams reveal T Pyx as a bipolar nebula, with a knotty toroidal structure at its waist best seen in H$\beta$ and two open bowl-shaped bipolar lobes (a diabolo) best revealed by the [OIII] emission lines. The comparison of multi-epoch HST WFPC2 and WFC3/UVIS narrow-band images and VLT MUSE emission line maps of T Pyx reveals the angular expansion of the remnant through the proper motion of individual knots and nebular features. The angular expansion is confirmed to be homologous in the period from 1994.2 to 2007.4 before the recent 2011 outburst, but there is suggestive evidence that the inner knots have experienced a higher expansion rate since then.</description>

      <title>A Chandra Search for Periodic X-ray Sources in the Bulge of M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07432v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for periodic X-ray sources in the bulge of M31, using ~ 2 Ms of archival Chandra observations spanning a temporal baseline of 16 years. Utilizing the Gregory-Loredo algorithm that is designed for photon-counting, phase-folded light curves, we detect seven periodic X-ray sources, among which four are newly discovered. Three of these sources are novae, the identified periods of which range between 1.3-2.0 hour and is most likely the orbital period. The other four sources are low-mass X-ray binaries, the identified periods of which range between 0.13-19.3 hour and are also likely orbital due to a clear eclipsing/dipping behavior in the light curve. We address implications on the X-ray binary population of the M31 bulge. Our study demonstrates the potential of using archival X-ray observations to systematically identify periodic X-ray sources in external galaxies, which would provide valuable information about the underlying exotic stellar populations.</description>
