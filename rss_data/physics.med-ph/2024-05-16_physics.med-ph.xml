      <title>Polydisperse versus monodisperse microbubbles: A simulation study for contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging</title>

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) presents distinct advantages in diagnostic echography. Utilizing microbubbles (MBs) as conventional contrast agents enhances vascular visualization and organ perfusion, facilitating real-time, non-invasive procedures. There is a current tendency to replace the traditional polydisperse MBs by novel monodisperse formulations in an attempt to optimize contrast enhancement and guarantee consistent behavior and reliable imaging outcomes. This study investigates the contrast enhancement achieved by monodisperse MBs of different sizes, and their influence on nonlinear imaging artifacts observed in traditional CEUS. To explore the differences between monodisperse and polydisperse populations without excessive experimentation, numerical simulations are employed for delivering precise, objective and expeditious results. The Iterative Nonlinear Contrast Source (INCS) method has previously demonstrated its efficacy in simulating ultrasound propagation in large populations in which each bubble has individual properties and several orders of multiple scattering are significant. Our findings in CEUS imaging indicate that scattering from resonant monodisperse microbubbles is 11.8 dB stronger than scattering from the polydisperse population. Furthermore, the amplitude of nonlinear imaging artifacts downstream of the monodisperse population is 19.4 dB stronger compared to polydisperse suspension. Investigating the impact of multiple scattering on polydisperse populations compared to various monodisperse suspensions reveals that monodisperse MBs are more effective contrast agents, especially when on resonance. Despite the strong signal to noise ratio of monodisperse populations, the imaging artifacts due to nonlinear wave propagation are also enhanced, resulting in more missclassification of MBs as tissue.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear interaction of two cross-propagating plane waves</title>

Abstract: An ideal contrast-enhanced ultrasound image should display microbubble-induced nonlinearities while avoiding wave propagation nonlinearities. One of the most successful ultrasound pulse sequences to disentangle these nonlinear effects relies on the transmission of cross-propagating plane waves. However, theory describing the noncollinear nonlinear interaction of two finite plane waves has not been fully developed and a better understanding of these effects would improve contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging further. Here, local nonlinear interactions at the intersection of two plane-waves are investigated by extending the Westervelt equation with a term including the Lagrangian density. The Iterative Nonlinear Contrast Source (INCS) method is employed to numerically solve this full nonlinear wave equation for two 3D finite cross-propagating pulsed plane waves. In addition, analytical expressions for the cross-propagation of two infinite continuous plane waves are derived. Numerical results obtained with INCS show good agreement with the analytical expressions. Overall, the generated results show that the pressure associated with local nonlinear effects is two orders of magnitude lower than the pressure associated with global nonlinear effects. Local nonlinear effects are therefore expected to be negligible in the context of single-shot ultrasound imaging, but they may influence approaches that subtract pressure fields such as amplitude modulation or pulse inversion.</description>
