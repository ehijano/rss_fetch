      <title>Curvature effects on the regimes of the lateral van der Waals force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been shown that, under the action of the lateral van der Waals (vdW) force due to a perfectly conducting corrugated plane, a neutral anisotropic polarizable particle in vacuum can be attracted not only to the nearest corrugation peak but also to a valley or an intermediate point between a peak and a valley, with such behaviors called the peak, valley, and intermediate regimes, respectively. In the present paper, we calculate the vdW interaction between a polarizable particle and a grounded conducting corrugated cylinder, and investigate how the effects of the curvature of the cylinder affect the occurrence of the mentioned regimes.</description>

      <title>Non-Local Classical Field Theory with Fractional Operators on $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework on non-local classical field theory using fractional integrodifferential operators. Due to the lack of easily manageable symmetries in traditional fractional calculus and the difficulties that arise in the formalism of multi-fractional calculus over $\mathbb{R}^{\text{D}}$ space, we introduce a set of new fractional operators over the $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ space. The redefined fractional integral operator results in the non-trivial measure canonically. The redefined fractional differential operator can account for the spacetime symmetries for the underlying space $\mathbb{S}^3 \times \mathbb{R}^1$ with the Lorentzian signature $(+, -, -, - , -)$. We conclude that the field equation for the non-local classical field can be obtained as the consequence of the optimization of the action, considering the non-local variations in the field after defining the non-local Lagrangian density as $\mathcal{L}(\phi_{a}\left(x\right), \mathbb{\eth}^\alpha (\phi_{a}\left(x\right)))$, the function of the symmetric Fractional derivative of the field in the context of the kinetic term, and the field itself.</description>

      <title>Coupling theory of electromagnetic fields with mass transport in non-uniform fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navier-Stokes and Maxwell equations have been invented for fluid dynamics and electromagnetic systems, respectively, for centuries. The development of Navier-Stokes and Maxwell equations for homogeneous materials seems to be mature. However, when there is a phase interface, a coupling theory for the mass transport with the propagation of electromagnetic fields remains an open question. In the current work, we present a fundamental theory for the thermodynamics and the kinetics for mass transport and electromagnetic wave propagation in non-uniform system when an interface is present. We will demonstrate that Maxwell-Ampere equation, Lorenz force, and Gauss' law for magnetic field all have to be modified at the phase interface. We expect that the modified Lorenz force and Maxwell equations will shed light on high-temperature superconductivity, where the coupling of mass effect, such as thermal noise, with electromagnetic fields is necessary.</description>

      <title>A comparative view of Becker, Lomnitz, and Lambert linear viscoelastic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the classical viscoelastic models due to Becker and Lomnitz with respect to a recent viscoelastic model based on the Lambert W function. We take advantage of this comparison to derive new analytical expressions for the relaxation spectrum in the Becker and Lomnitz models, as well as novel integral representations for the retardation and relaxation spectra in the Lambert model.</description>

      <title>Rate-Dependent Tensile Response of Polyvinyl Chloride Geomembranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the challenge that face the effectiveness of Polyvinyl Chloride geomembranes (PVC GMs) as a hydraulic barrier is the capacity to withstand unexpected mechanical actions, particularly tensile forces, during installation and throughout their lifespan. These forces pose risks of premature failure and impermeability degradation. In this study, the characterization of the short and long-term mechanical response of PVC GMs to uniaxial tensile forces has been investigated. Uniaxial tensile test have been performed for tensile rates spanning several orders of magnitude. Analysis of the true stress-strain curves reveals a significant decrease in tensile modulus, strength, and strain at failure at low strain rates, which are relatively close to those applied in situ. Long-term investigations have been conducted as well, through relaxation tests. Our key results unveil two distinct characteristic times in stress relaxation, with the fast relaxation occurring over the first four hours. During this phase, the pre-relaxation loading rate affects the relaxation behavior. Beyond this phase, the relaxation behavior becomes independent from the pre-relaxation loading rate. Burger's rheological model is proposed to measure the stress relaxation at different rates. The model's results validate the existence of two characteristic times.</description>

      <title>A Mechanical Route for Cooperative Transport in Autonomous Robotic Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cooperative transport is a striking phenomenon where multiple agents join forces to transit a payload too heavy for the individual. While social animals such as ants are routinely observed to coordinate transport at scale, reproducing the effect in artificial swarms remains challenging, as it requires synchronization in a noisy many-body system. Here we show that cooperative transport spontaneously emerges in swarms of stochastic self-propelled robots. Robots deprived of sensing and communication, are isotropically initialized around a passive circular payload, where directional motion is not expected without an external cue. And yet it moves. We find that a minute modification to the mechanical design of the individual agent dramatically changes its alignment response to an external force. We then show experimentally that by controlling the individual's friction and mass distribution, a swarm of active particles autonomously cooperates in the directional transport of larger objects. Surprisingly, transport increases with increasing payload size, and its persistence surpasses the persistence of the active particles by over an order of magnitude. A mechanical, coarse-grained description reveals that force-alignment is intrinsic and captured by a signed, charge-like parameter with units of curvature. Numerical simulations of swarms of active particles with a negative active charge corroborate the experimental findings. We analytically derive a geometrical criterion for cooperative transport which results from a bifurcation in a non-linear dynamical system. Our findings generalize existing models of active particles, offer new design rules for distributed robotic systems, and shed light on cooperation in natural swarms.</description>
