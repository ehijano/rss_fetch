      <title>HST pre-imaging of a free-floating planet candidate microlensing event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-cadence microlensing observations uncovered a population of very short-timescale microlensing events, which are believed to be caused by the population of free-floating planets (FFP) roaming the Milky Way. Unfortunately, the light curves of such events are indistinguishable from those caused by wide-orbit planets. To properly differentiate both cases, one needs high-resolution observations that would allow resolving a putative luminous companion to the lens long before or after the event. Usually, the baseline between the event and high-resolution observations needs to be quite long ($\sim 10$ yr), hindering potential follow-up efforts. However, there is a chance to use archival data if they exist. Here, we present an analysis of the microlensing event OGLE-2023-BLG-0524, the site of which was captured in 1997 with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Hence, we achieve a record-breaking baseline length of 25 years. A very short duration of the event ($t_E = 0.346 \pm 0.008$ d) indicates an FFP as the explanation. We have not detected any potential companion to the lens with the HST data, which is consistent with the FFP origin of the event. Thanks to the available HST data, we are able to reject from 25% to 48% of potential stellar companions depending on the assumed population model. Based on the finite-source effects in the light curve we measure the angular Einstein radius value $\theta_E = 4.78 \pm 0.23 \mu as$, suggesting a super-Earth in the Galactic disk or a sub-Saturn-mass planet in the Galactic bulge. We show that the archival high-resolution images should be available for several microlensing events, providing us with the unprecedented possibility of seeing the lensing system as it was many years before the event.</description>

      <title>Giant planet formation via pebble accretion across different stellar masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The occurrence rate of cold Jupiters was found to depend on stellar mass. The formation environment in the protoplanetary disks regulates core formation and the subsequent gas accretion. In this study, we simulate giant planet formation via pebble accretion accounting for various stellar masses, core formation times, disk turbulent viscosities, and grain opacities. We use a self-consistent formation model that calculates the solid accretion rate and gas accretion rate of growing protoplanets. We investigate how the planetary formation, in particular, the contraction of the envelope, and the formation timescale change under different conditions. We find that to reproduce the observed occurrence rate of cold Jupiters, giant planets must undergo slow envelope contraction after they reach pebble isolation, which lasts for several Myrs. Such a slow contraction phase can be achieved when the grain opacity is assumed to be as high as that of the interstellar medium (ISM). If the grain opacity is smaller than the ISM opacity by a factor of ten or more, the growing protoplanets reach crossover mass within 3 Myrs and form too many cold Jupiters around stars of &gt;0.4Msun. Protoplanets around low-mass stars &lt;0.4Msun take &gt;10 Myrs to reach crossover mass also with low grain opacity. If the grain opacity in the planetary envelope is much lower than that of ISM, other mechanisms, such as atmospheric recycling or planetesimal accretion, is required for cold Jupiter formation. We next explore how the deposition of the accreted heavy elements to the planetary envelope changes the formation timescale. Our model suggests that the formation timescale could be longer due to heavy-element enrichment, resulting from the lower core mass at pebble isolation. We conclude that the details of the formation processes have a significant effect on the planetary growth and therefore, the formation of gaseous planets.</description>

      <title>Planet-induced Gas and Dust Substructure Feedbacks on Disk Thermal Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01336v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanets can interact with their natal disks and generate gas and dust substructures such as gaps and rings. However, how these planet-induced substructures affect the disk temperature, and how that in turn influences the substructures, remains unclear. We aim to study disk substructures and the thermal structure self-consistently and explore their impact on volatile distribution. To this end, we perform iterative multi-fluid hydrodynamical and radiative transfer simulations of planet-disk interactions. We find that the temperature in a structured disk deviates significantly from that of a smooth disk due to giant planet formation. In particular, midplane temperatures in gaps can increase by tens of Kelvin, leading to volatile sublimation as well as radial shifts and multiplication of icelines. Comparing our multi-dust models with previous gas-only models, we find that the former produces slightly shallower gaps and temperatures about 10 K ($\sim25\%$) higher. Furthermore, the temperature at dust rings formed by pressure bumps can drop by several Kelvin, creating volatile freeze-out regions. Nevertheless, the overall midplane ice distribution is not strongly sensitive to whether dust is included. We also investigate the effect of varying disk viscosity. Increasing $\alpha$ viscosity from $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-2}$ leads to a roughly 10 K ($\sim25\%$) warmer midplane due to enhanced vertical dust mixing. However, higher viscosity suppresses gap opening and reduces the temperature enhancement within gaps. As a result, iceline locations do not follow a simple trend with viscosity. Finally, we propose an observational strategy using ALMA to test our predicted temperature changes within disk gaps.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the ejecting-crust activity model on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reproducing the observed activity of comets with thermophysical models remains a primary challenge of cometary science. We use a pebble-based thermophysical model of gas-pressure build-up in the subsurface to reproduce the global emission rates of dust, water, CO$_{2}$, and CO observed by Rosetta at comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (hereafter 67P). For sufficiently low diffusivities, the low tensile strength is overcome, leading to the ejection of $\sim$ millimetre- to decimetre-sized dust-particles as well as roughly the correct outgassing rates. All the ejections, and thus the bulk of the outgassing, come from the southern hemisphere during the time that it is strongly illuminated at perihelion. This leads to a 'blow-off' of the dust-crust that otherwise forms: volatiles are much closer to the surface in the south (within the top centimetre) than in the north (10-or-more cm deep), naturally explaining the strong southern water-outgassing expected from 67P's non-gravitational accelerations and torques. We find that low gas-diffusivity, as well as large heat-capacity and steeply decreasing tensile strength with depth or ice-content, are in best agreement with the outgassing data. However, even in these cases, we struggle not to exceed the observed emission rates of dust, CO$_{2}$, and CO. In the south, it is difficult for models to achieve a balance between triggering activity and generating too much of it (with CO$_{2}$ the critical driving-species here); while in the north, it remains challenging to generate activity at all. Strong constraints are placed on the nature of the activity mechanism by the location of dust-ejection and erosion.</description>

      <title>Meteoroid stream identification with HDBSCAN unsupervised clustering algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate identification of meteoroid streams is central to understanding their origins and evolution. However, overlapping clusters and background noise hinder classification, an issue amplified for missions such as ESA's LUMIO that rely on meteor shower observations to infer lunar meteoroid impact parameters. This study evaluates the performance of the Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN) algorithm for unsupervised meteoroid stream identification, comparing its outcomes with the established Cameras for All-Sky Meteor Surveillance (CAMS) look-up table method. We analyze the CAMS Meteoroid Orbit Database v3.0 using three feature vectors: LUTAB (CAMS geocentric parameters), ORBIT (heliocentric orbital elements), and GEO (adapted geocentric parameters). HDBSCAN is applied with varying minimum cluster sizes and two cluster selection methods (eom and leaf). To align HDBSCAN clusters with CAMS classifications, the Hungarian algorithm determines the optimal mapping. Clustering performance is assessed via the Silhouette score, Normalized Mutual Information, and F1 score, with Principal Component Analysis further supporting the analysis. With the GEO vector, HDBSCAN confirms 39 meteoroid streams, 21 strongly aligning with CAMS. The ORBIT vector identifies 30 streams, 13 with high matching scores. Less active showers pose identification challenges. The eom method consistently yields superior performance and agreement with CAMS. Although HDBSCAN requires careful selection of the minimum cluster size, it delivers robust, internally consistent clusters and outperforms the look-up table method in statistical coherence. These results underscore HDBSCAN's potential as a mathematically consistent alternative for meteoroid stream identification, although further validation is needed to assess physical validity.</description>

      <title>Icarus's Orbit as the Ultimate Test for the Vulcan Hypothesis and General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: General Relativity (GR) quantitatively accounts for the anomalous perihelion precession observed in several planets' orbits, with Mercury exhibiting the most significant deviation from Newtonian predictions. In the present work, I carry out an in-depth study comparing methods for calculating perihelion advance of inner planets using two methods, one based on the rotation of the Laplace-Runge-Lentz vector and the other on the evolution of the perihelion longitude. I show that, although the two methods predict almost identical perihelion advances for inner planets according to classical gravitational theory and the general relativity model, they give divergent results for the asteroid Icarus. Comparing numerical calculations of Icarus'perihelion advance with those predicted by Einstein's formula leads to the conclusion that only the method based on the Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector offers a consistent explanation for the behavior of Icarus' perihelion advance. By incorporating the hypothetical planet Vulcan into the Newtonian gravitational model and analyzing its influence on the perihelion advances of the inner planets, I find that carefully selecting Vulcan's mass and orbital parameters yields a delicate balance between its semi-major axis and mass necessary to simultaneously match the observed perihelion advances of the inner planets. Vulcan, orbiting at a semi-major axis of 0.545 AU and possessing about one-third the mass of Mercury, could exert gravitational effects on Earth and Mars comparable to those predicted by GR. This Vulcan would cause an effect on Icarus' perihelion advance approximately nine times greater than the relativistic effect. Thus, precise observational data of Icarus's orbital dynamics offers a definitive means to either rule out this specific Vulcan hypothesis or, conversely, indicate the necessity of further refinement of GR's applications.</description>

      <title>The HR 8799 Debris Disc: Shaped by Planetary Migration and a Possible Fifth Outermost Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The HR 8799 system, hosting four giant planets between a warm and cold debris disc, and an extended dusty tail beyond, serves as an ideal laboratory for studying planetary formation and evolution. The debris discs have been observed across various wavelengths, and the planetary properties are well-constrained. Nonetheless, there are still open questions regarding the role of the planets in shaping the debris discs.
  Aims. We investigate the system's evolution with the aim of understanding how planetary migration shapes its architecture, both in terms of planets and the disc.
  Methods. We performed $N$-body simulations to model the HR 8799 system. We examined the orbital evolution of the known four super-Jupiter planets through the course of simple, imposed migration in a gaseous disc as they perturb an external, massless planetesimal disc. We also explore the impact of introducing a fifth planet on the dynamical and morphological aspects of the disc.
  Results. The planets migrate outward as a result of their imposed interactions with the gaseous disc while maintaining their resonant configuration. This outward migration excites the planetesimal disc, producing a transient scattered population. While a four-planet system partially reproduces the observed cavity between the star and the cold debris disc, the inclusion of a fifth low-mass planet appears to be crucial for better reproducing key morphological aspects of the cold debris disc.
  Conclusions. This model provides a novel explanation for the architecture of HR 8799. Outward planetary migration, combined with mean motion resonant interactions and a fifth, low-mass planet, can effectively replicate the observed planetary architecture and cold debris disc characteristics. Our findings underscore the potential important role of planetary migration in shaping debris discs.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Earth's Core-Mantle boundary from nutation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic variations in the Sun and Moon's gravitational pull cause small changes in Earth's rotational axis direction called nutation. Nutation components in the retrograde quasi-diurnal frequency band measured in the terrestrial reference frame are amplified by resonance with the Free Core Nutation (FCN), a rotational mode of Earth's fluid core. Dissipative processes at the core-mantle boundary (CMB) dampen this resonance, contributing to the observed phase lag between tidal forcing and Earth's rotational response. This phase lag is commonly attributed to electromagnetic (EM) coupling between the core and the electrically conducting lower mantle. However, estimates of mantle conductivity and radial magnetic field strength at the CMB suggest these effects are insufficient. We show that the missing dissipation arises naturally from the excitation of internal waves in the fluid core by topographic features at the CMB. Adapting a theoretical framework originally developed for tidal flow over oceanic topography, we compute the form drag and associated power flux induced by CMB topography. Our results are consistent with a CMB topography characterized by a root mean square amplitude of a few kilometers. The model favors weak stratification at the top of the core, though stronger stratification remains compatible with increased topographic amplitude. This mechanism provides independent constraints on CMB topography and stratification, complementing seismological and magnetic observations. Its generality offers a new framework for probing deep-interior dynamics across terrestrial planets.</description>

      <title>The star HIP 41378 potentially misaligned with its cohort of long-period planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The obliquity between the stellar spin axis and the planetary orbit, detected via the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect, is a tracer of the formation history of planetary systems. While obliquity measurements have been extensively applied to hot Jupiters and short-period planets, they remain rare for cold and long-period planets due to observational challenges, particularly their long transit durations. We report the detection of the RM effect for the 19-hour-long transit of HIP 41378 f, a temperate giant planet on a 542-day orbit, observed through a worldwide spectroscopic campaign. We measure a slight projected obliquity of 21 $\pm$ 8 degrees and a significant 3D spin-orbit angle of 52 $\pm$ 6 degrees, based on the measurement of the stellar rotation period. HIP 41378 f is part of a 5-transiting planetary system with planets close to mean motion resonances. The observed misalignment likely reflects a primordial tilt of the stellar spin axis relative to the protoplanetary disk, rather than dynamical interactions. HIP 41378 f is the first non-eccentric long-period (P&gt;100 days) planet observed with the RM effect, opening new constraints on planetary formation theories. This observation should motivate the exploration of planetary obliquities across a longer range of orbital distances through international collaboration.</description>

      <title>Dynamical origin of Theia, the last giant impactor on Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmochemical studies have proposed that Earth accreted roughly 5-10% of its mass from carbonaceous (CC) material, with a large fraction delivered late via its final impactor, Theia (the Moon-forming impactor). Here, we evaluate this idea using dynamical simulations of terrestrial planet formation, starting from a standard setup with a population of planetary embryos and planetesimals laid out in a ring centered between Venus and Earth's orbits, and also including a population of CC planetesimals and planetary embryos scattered inward by Jupiter. We find that this scenario can match a large number of constraints, including i) the terrestrial planets' masses and orbits; ii) the CC mass fraction of Earth; iii) the much lower CC mass fraction of Mars, as long as Mars only accreted CC planetesimals (but no CC embryos); iv) the timing of the last giant (Moon-forming) impact; and v) a late accretion phase dominated by non-carbonaceous (NC) bodies. For this scenario to work, the total mass in scattered CC objects must have been ~ 0.2 - 0.3 M$_{\oplus}$ , with an embryo-to-planetesimal mass ratio of at least 8, and CC embryos in the ~ 0.01 - 0.05 M$_{\oplus}$ mass range. In that case, our simulations show there are roughly 50-50 odds of Earth's last giant impactor (Theia) having been a carbonaceous object - either a pure CC embryo or an NC embryo that previously accreted a CC embryo. Our simulations thus provide dynamical validation of cosmochemical studies.</description>

      <title>The TESS Grand Unified Hot Jupiter Survey. III. Thirty More Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 30 transiting giant planets that were initially detected using data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. These new planets orbit relatively bright ($G \leq 12.5$) FGK host stars with orbital periods between 1.6 and 8.2 days, and have radii between 0.9 and 1.7 Jupiter radii. We performed follow-up ground-based photometry, high angular-resolution imaging, high-resolution spectroscopy and radial velocity monitoring for each of these objects to confirm that they are planets and determine their masses and other system parameters. The planets' masses span more than an order of magnitude ($0.17\,M_J &lt; M_p &lt; 3.3\,M_J$). For two planets, TOI-3593 b and TOI-4961 b, we measured significant non-zero eccentricities of $0.11^{+0.05}_{-0.03}$ and $0.18^{+0.04}_{-0.05}$ respectively, while for the other planets, the data typically provide a 1-$\sigma$ upper bound of 0.15 on the eccentricity. These discoveries represent a major step toward assembling a complete, magnitude-limited sample of transiting hot Jupiters around FGK stars.</description>

      <title>The ODYSSEUS Survey. Characterizing magnetospheric geometries and hotspot structures in T Tauri stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetospheric accretion is a key process that shapes the inner disks of T Tauri stars, controlling mass and angular momentum evolution. It produces strong ultraviolet and optical emission that irradiates the planet-forming environment. In this work, we characterize the magnetospheric geometries, accretion rates, extinction properties, and hotspot structures of 67 T Tauri stars in the largest and most consistent study of ultraviolet and optical accretion signatures to date. To do so, we apply an accretion flow model to velocity-resolved H$\alpha$ profiles for T Tauri stars from the HST/ULLYSES program with consistently-derived stellar parameters. We find typical magnetospheric truncation radii to be almost half of the usually-assumed value of 5 stellar radii. We then model the same stars' HST/STIS spectra with an accretion shock model, finding a diverse range of hotspot structures. Phase-folding multi-epoch shock models reveals rotational modulation of observed hotspot energy flux densities, indicative of hotspots that persist for at least 3 stellar rotation periods. For the first time, we perform a large-scale, self-consistent comparison of accretion rates measured using accretion flow and shock models, finding them to be consistent within $\sim$0.16 dex for contemporaneous observations. Finally, we find that up to 50% of the total accretion luminosity is at short wavelengths accessible only from space, highlighting the crucial role of ultraviolet spectra in constraining accretion spectral energy distributions, hotspot structure, and extinction.</description>

      <title>Six-yr SPIRou monitoring of the young planet-host dwarf AU Mic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit our spectropolarimetric and velocimetric analysis of the young M dwarf AU Mic based on data collected with SPIRou at the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope, over a monitoring period of 2041 d from 2019 to 2024. The longitudinal magnetic field, the small-scale magnetic field, and the differential temperature of AU Mic, derived from the unpolarized and circularly-polarized spectra, were clearly modulated with the stellar rotation period, with a pattern that evolved over time. The magnetic modeling with Zeeman-Doppler imaging provides a consistent description of the global field of AU Mic that agrees not only with the Least-Squares Deconvolved profiles of the circularly-polarized and unpolarized spectral lines, but also with the small-scale field measurements derived from the broadening of spectral lines, for each of the 11 subsets of the full data. We find that the large-scale field was mostly poloidal, with a dominant dipole component slightly tilted to the rotation axis which decreased from 1.4 to 1.1 kG before increasing at the end of the campaign. The average small-scale field followed a similar trend, decreasing from 2.8 to 2.6 kG then rising. The long-term magnetic evolution we report for AU Mic suggests that, if cyclic, the cycle period is significantly longer than 6 yr. From velocimetric data, we derived improved mass estimates for the two transiting planets, respectively equal to M_b = 6.3+2.5-1.8 M_earth and M_c = 11.6+3.3-2.7 M_earth, yielding very contrasting densities of 0.32+0.13-0.10 and 2.9+1.1-0.8 g/cm3, and a new 90% confidence upper limit of 4.9 M_earth for candidate planet d (period 12.7 d) suspected to induce the transit-timing variations of b and c. We also confirm our claim regarding candidate planet e orbiting with a period of 33.11+-0.06 d, albeit with a smaller mass of M_e = 21.1+5.4-4.3 M_earth.</description>

      <title>CAMPOS II. The onset of protostellar disk substructures and planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11577v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 1.3 mm CAMPOS survey has resolved 90 protostellar disks with ~15 au resolution across the Ophiuchus, Corona Australis, and Chamaeleon star-forming regions. To address the fundamental question, `When does planet formation begin?', we combined the CAMPOS sample with literature observations of Class 0-II disks (bolometric temperature, $T_{bol} \le 1900 K$). To investigate substructure detection rates as a function of $T_{bol}$, we restricted the sample to disks observed at the 1.3 mm wavelength, with inclinations below 75$^\circ$, linear resolution $\le 20$ au and resolved with at least 4 resolution elements ($\theta_{disk}/\theta_{res} \ge 4$). We also considered the effects of extinction correction and the inclusion of Herschel Space Telescope data on the $T_{bol}$ measurements to constrain the lower and upper limits of $T_{bol}$ for each source. We find that by $T_{bol}$ ~200-400 K, substructure detection rates increased sharply to ~60%, corresponding to an age of ~0.2-0.4 Myr. No substructures are detected in Class 0 disks. The ratio of disk-averaged brightness temperature to predicted dust temperature shows a trend of increasing values toward the youngest Class 0 disks, suggesting higher optical depths in these early stages. Our statistical analysis confirms that substructures similar to those in Class II disks are already common by the Class I stage, and the emergence of structures at early Class I could represent only an upper limit. Classifying disks with substructures into those with and without large central cavities, we find both populations coexisting across evolutionary stages, suggesting they are not necessarily evolutionarily linked. If protostellar disk substructures do follow an evolutionary sequence, then our results imply that disk substructures evolve very rapidly and thus can be present in all Class I/II stages and/or that they can be triggered at different times.</description>

      <title>Ground to Dust: Collisional Cascades and the Fate of Kardashev II Megaswarms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extraterrestrial intelligences are speculated to surround stars with structures to collect their energy or to signal distant observers. If they exist, these most likely are megaswarms, vast constellations of satellites (elements) in orbit around the hosts. Although long-lived megaswarms are extremely powerful technosignatures, they are liable to be subject to collisional cascades once guidance systems start failing. The collisional time is roughly an orbital period divided by the covering fraction of the swarm. Structuring the swarm orbits does not prolong the initial collisional time as long as there is enough randomness to ensure collisions, although it can reduce collision velocities. I further show that once the collisional cascade begins, it can develop extremely rapidly for hypervelocity collisions. Companion stars or planets in the stellar system induce perturbations through the Lidov-Kozai effect among others, which can result in orbits crossing within some millions of years. Radiative perturbations, including the Yarkovsky effect, also can destabilize swarms. Most megaswarms are thus likely to be short-lived on cosmic timescales without active upkeep. I discuss possible mitigation strategies and implications for megastructure searches.</description>

      <title>An Eccentric Sub-Neptune Moving Into the Evaporation Desert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Though missions such as Kepler, K2, and TESS have discovered $&gt;$2,000 sub-Neptune and Neptunian planets, there is a dearth of such planets at close-in (P$\lesssim$3 days) orbits. This feature, called the Neptune desert or the evaporation desert, is believed to be primarily shaped by planetary migration and photoevaporation. However, this region is not completely devoid of planets--a small number of very hot Neptunes reside within the desert. These planets provide an opportunity to directly probe the effects of migration and photoevaporation. We present confirmation of TOI-5800 b, an eccentric sub-Neptune on a $\approx$2.6 day period that is likely actively undergoing tidal migration. We use radial velocity measurements from the Carnegie Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS) to constrain TOI-5800 b's mass and eccentricity. We find that it has an unusually high eccentricity (0.39$\pm$0.07) for its short orbit. TOI-5800 is therefore currently experiencing high levels of tidal heating as it moves into the desert. Ranked as a top candidate for transmission and emission spectroscopy within its temperature and radius regime, TOI-5800 b is a prime target for atmospheric characterization with JWST. TOI-5800 b presents a unique opportunity to study the atmosphere of a planet undergoing tidal heating and to probe the composition of sub-Neptune planets.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Transport-induced Chemistry on Temperate sub-Neptune K2-18b, Part I: the Effects of Atmospheric Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The low equilibrium temperatures of temperate sub-Neptunes lead to extremely long chemical timescales in their upper atmospheres, causing the abundances of chemical species to be strongly shaped by atmospheric transport. Here, we used a three-dimensional (3D) general circulation model involving a passive tracer to investigate the atmospheric circulation and 3D transport of temperate gas-rich sub-Neptunes, using K2-18b as an example. We model K2-18b as a synchronous or asynchronous rotator, exploring spin-orbit resonances (SOR) of 2:1, 6:1, and 10:1. We find that the strong absorption of CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ induces a detached convective zone between 1 and 5 bar, resulting in strong vertical mixing at these levels. The upper atmosphere is dominated by eastward winds (an equatorial superrotating jet present in all simulations), leading to warmer evening terminators and approximately 20% higher passive tracer mass mixing ratios compared to the morning terminators. Rotation rates have minimal impact on the strength of global mean vertical mixing, but significantly influence the latitudinal distribution of passive tracers. For synchronous, 2:1 SOR, and 6:1 SOR simulations, passive tracers are more abundant in the upwelling branches at latitudes within 60$^\circ$, while for the 10:1 SOR simulation, strong transient eddies at high latitudes (&gt;70$^\circ$) between 0.1 to 1 bar can transport passive tracers upward from the deep atmosphere, making them more abundant there, despite their alignment with the downwelling branch of the large-scale circulation. This study focuses on the atmospheric dynamics and its influence on passive tracer transport, while a follow-up paper will incorporate active chemical species.</description>

      <title>Flickers, Bursts, and Dips: Detecting Rapid Variability with the g(2) Autocorrelation Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid optical transient events can be hard to detect because of the limited number of photons they produce. I discuss a method of inferring the presence of fast, chaotic variability in photometry using the normalized autocorrelation function, what is called $g^{(2)}$ in quantum optics. The variability's signature is a bump in the function at short lags. No periodicity is needed for the method to work. Versions of this method are attested in stellar variability studies, but its uses in some other subfields apparently have not been realized. I calculate expected signal-to-noise ratios with shot noise and scintillation. This method could be used to find unknown phenomena, particularly sub-millisecond optical variability. I present simple models of three example use cases: a flickering artificial "lantern" near a host sun, optical microbursts from the Crab pulsar, and frequent irregular transits of a star by cometary bodies.</description>
