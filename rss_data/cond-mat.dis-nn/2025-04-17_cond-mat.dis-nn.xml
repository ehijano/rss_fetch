      <title>Strong ergodicity breaking in dynamical mean-field equations for mixed p-spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytical solution to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of mean-field spin glasses has profoundly shaped our understanding of glassy dynamics, which take place in many diverse physical systems. In particular, the idea that during the aging dynamics, the evolution becomes slower and slower, but keeps wandering in an unbounded space (a manifold of marginal states), thus forgetting any previously found configuration, has been one of the key hypotheses to achieve an analytical solution. This hypothesis, called weak ergodicity breaking, has recently been questioned by numerical simulations and attempts to solve the dynamical mean-field equations (DMFE). In this work, we introduce a new integration scheme for solving DMFE that allows us to reach very large integration times, $t=O(10^6)$, in the solution of the spherical (3+4)-spin model, quenched from close to the mode coupling temperature down to zero temperature. Thanks to this new solution, we can provide solid evidence for strong ergodicity breaking in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics on mixed p-spin glass models. Our solution to the DMFE shows that the out-of-equilibrium dynamics undergo aging, but in a restricted space: the initial condition is never forgotten, and the dynamics takes place closer and closer to configurations reached at later times. During this new restricted aging dynamics, the fluctuation-dissipation relation is richer than expected.</description>

      <title>Rare-Event-Induced Ergodicity Breaking in Logarithmic Aging Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ergodicity breaking and aging effects are fundamental challenges in out-of-equilibrium systems. Various mechanisms have been proposed to understand the non-ergodic and aging phenomena, possibly related to observations in systems ranging from structural glass and Anderson glasses to biological systems and mechanical systems. While anomalous diffusion described by Levy statistics efficiently captures ergodicity breaking, the origin of aging and ergodicity breaking in systems with ultraslow dynamics remain unclear. Here, we report a novel mechanism of ergodicity breaking in systems exhibiting log-aging diffusion. This mechanism, characterized by increasingly infrequent rare events with aging, yields statistics deviating significantly from Levy distribution, breaking ergodicity as shown by unequal time- and ensemble-averaged mean squared displacements and two distinct asymptotic probability distribution functions. Notably, although these rare events contribute negligibly to statistical averages, they dramatically change the system's characteristic time. This work lays the groundwork for microscopic understanding of out-of-equilibrium systems and provides new perspectives on glasses and Griffiths-McCoy singularities.</description>

      <title>7-Methylquinolinium Iodobismuthate Memristor: Exploring Plasticity and Memristive Properties for Digit Classification in Physical Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates 7-methylquinolinium halobismuthates (I, Br, and Cl) in two aspects: (1) their structural and semiconducting properties influenced by anionic composition, and (2) their memristive and plasticity characteristics for neuromorphic and reservoir computing applications. Structural changes induced by halides form low-dimensional halobismuthate fragments, confirmed by crystallographic analysis. Optical band gaps were studied using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, aligning with density functional theory results. Due to solubility limitations, only bismuth iodide complexes were explored in electronic devices. Current-voltage scans showed pinched hysteresis loops, characteristic of memristors. Conductivity versus temperature study indicates combined ionic and electronic contributions to conductivity of the devices. Given that a memristor can function as a single synapse without the need for programming, aligning with the requirements of neuromorphic computing, the study investigated long-term depression, potentiation, and spike-time-dependent plasticity. As the potentiation-depression plots showed non-linearity with fading memory, these materials can be a good candidate for application in physical reservoir computing. To further assess this material, an electronic device with sixteen gold electrodes was applied, featuring one input and 15 output electrodes deposited on silicon substrate and covered with a layer of studied compound. Basic test to assess the complexity and non-linearity of the devices were conducted through a series of benchmark tasks, including waveform generation, NARMA-2, memory capacity assessment, and noise study under both DC and AC current. The ability of device in MNIST digit classification with 82.26% accuracy and voice classification for digit 2 for six different people with 82 % accuracy has been demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Learning transitions in classical Ising models and deformed toric codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conditional probability distributions describe the effect of learning an initially unknown classical state through Bayesian inference. Here we demonstrate the existence of a sharp learning transition for the two-dimensional classical Ising model, all the way from the infinite-temperature paramagnetic state down to the thermal critical state. The intersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising transition is a novel tricritical point. Our model also describes the effects of weak measurements on a family of quantum states which interpolate between the (topologically ordered) toric code and a trivial product state. Notably, the location of the above tricritical point implies that the quantum memory in the entire topological phase is robust to weak measurement, even when the initial state is arbitrarily close to the quantum phase transition separating topological and trivial phases. Our analysis uses a replica field theory combined with the renormalization group, and we chart out the phase diagram using a combination of tensor network and Monte Carlo techniques. Our results can be extended to study the more general effects of learning on both classical and quantum states.</description>

      <title>Generalization through variance: how noise shapes inductive biases in diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How diffusion models generalize beyond their training set is not known, and is somewhat mysterious given two facts: the optimum of the denoising score matching (DSM) objective usually used to train diffusion models is the score function of the training distribution; and the networks usually used to learn the score function are expressive enough to learn this score to high accuracy. We claim that a certain feature of the DSM objective -- the fact that its target is not the training distribution's score, but a noisy quantity only equal to it in expectation -- strongly impacts whether and to what extent diffusion models generalize. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory that partly explains this 'generalization through variance' phenomenon. Our theoretical analysis exploits a physics-inspired path integral approach to compute the distributions typically learned by a few paradigmatic under- and overparameterized diffusion models. We find that the distributions diffusion models effectively learn to sample from resemble their training distributions, but with 'gaps' filled in, and that this inductive bias is due to the covariance structure of the noisy target used during training. We also characterize how this inductive bias interacts with feature-related inductive biases.</description>

      <title>A Two-Phase Perspective on Deep Learning Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that learning in deep neural networks proceeds in two phases: a rapid curve fitting phase followed by a slower compression or coarse graining phase. This view is supported by the shared temporal structure of three phenomena: grokking, double descent and the information bottleneck, all of which exhibit a delayed onset of generalization well after training error reaches zero. We empirically show that the associated timescales align in two rather different settings. Mutual information between hidden layers and input data emerges as a natural progress measure, complementing circuit-based metrics such as local complexity and the linear mapping number. We argue that the second phase is not actively optimized by standard training algorithms and may be unnecessarily prolonged. Drawing on an analogy with the renormalization group, we suggest that this compression phase reflects a principled form of forgetting, critical for generalization.</description>

      <title>Single Complex-Frequency Resonance Mode in an Engineered Disordered Time-Varying Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a straightforward mechanism for achieving unique $k$-space resonance modes in one-dimensional time-varying cavities where periodic temporal modulation creates momentum band gaps through Floquet dynamics. By engineering the synergy between cavity resonance conditions and Floquet mode formation in photonic time crystals, we demonstrate the emergence of a single dominant momentum state that exhibits remarkable robustness against temporal disorder. Through analytical modeling and numerical verification, we show that the interplay between time-varying medium and cavity boundary conditions leads to amplification of specific waves followed by spatial mode selection. This engineered resonance mechanism enables insensitivity to initial wave source configuration and strong temporal disorder immunity. Our findings give a simple mechanism for exploiting narrow momentum bandgaps, and establish a foundation for developing high-quality temporal cavity lasers and advancing extreme temporal predictability in time-modulated systems.</description>

      <title>Exact Learning Dynamics of In-Context Learning in Linear Transformers and Its Application to Non-Linear Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformer models exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL), adapting to novel tasks from examples within their context, yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely mysterious. Here, we provide an exact analytical characterization of ICL emergence by deriving the closed-form stochastic gradient descent (SGD) dynamics for a simplified linear transformer performing regression tasks. Our analysis reveals key properties: (1) a natural separation of timescales directly governed by the input data's covariance structure, leading to staged learning; (2) an exact description of how ICL develops, including fixed points corresponding to learned algorithms and conservation laws constraining the dynamics; and (3) surprisingly nonlinear learning behavior despite the model's linearity. We hypothesize this phenomenology extends to non-linear models. To test this, we introduce theory-inspired macroscopic measures (spectral rank dynamics, subspace stability) and use them to provide mechanistic explanations for (1) the sudden emergence of ICL in attention-only networks and (2) delayed generalization (grokking) in modular arithmetic models. Our work offers an exact dynamical model for ICL and theoretically grounded tools for analyzing complex transformer training.</description>

      <title>Quantum-gas microscopy of the Bose-glass phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Disordered potentials fundamentally alter the transport properties and coherence of quantum systems. They give rise to phenomena such as Anderson localization in non-interacting systems, inhibiting transport. When interactions are introduced, the interplay with disorder becomes significantly more complex, and the conditions under which localization can be observed remain an open question. In interacting bosonic systems, a Bose glass is expected to emerge at low energies as an insulating yet compressible state without long-range phase coherence. While originally predicted to occur as a ground-state phase, more recent studies indicate that it exists at finite temperature. A key open challenge has been the direct observation of reduced phase coherence in the Bose-glass regime. In this study, we utilize ultracold bosonic atoms in a quantum-gas microscope to probe the emergence of the Bose-glass phase in a two-dimensional square lattice with a site-resolved, reproducible disordered potential. We identify the phase through in-situ distribution and particle fluctuations, via a local measurement of the Edwards-Anderson parameter. To measure the short-range phase coherence in the Bose glass, we employ Talbot interferometry in combination with single-atom-resolved detection. Finally, by driving the system in and out of the Bose-glass phase, we observe signatures for non-ergodic behavior.</description>

      <title>Seeing Beyond Dark-Field RGB Capabilities: Deep Spectral Extrapolation of Ultrasmall Plasmonic Nanogaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localized surface plasmons can confine light within a deep-subwavelength volume comparable to the scale of atoms and molecules, enabling ultrasensitive responses to near-field variations. On the other hand, this extreme localization also inevitably amplifies the unwanted noise from the response of local morphological imperfections, leading to complex spectral variations and reduced consistency across the plasmonic nanostructures. Seeking uniform optical responses has therefore long been a sought-after goal in nanoplasmonics. However, conventional probing techniques by dark-field (DF) confocal microscopy, such as image analysis or spectral measurements, can be inaccurate and time-consuming, respectively. Here, we introduce SPARX, a deep-learning-powered paradigm that surpasses conventional imaging and spectroscopic capabilities. In particular, SPARX can batch-predict broadband DF spectra (e.g., 500-1000 nm) of numerous nanoparticles simultaneously from an information-limited RGB image (i.e., below 700 nm). It achieves this extrapolative inference beyond the camera's capture capabilities by learning the underlying physical relationships among multiple orders of optical resonances. The spectral predictions only take milliseconds, achieving a speedup of three to four orders of magnitude compared to traditional spectral acquisition, which may take from hours to days. As a proof-of-principle demonstration for screening identical resonances, the selection accuracy achieved by SPARX is comparable to that of conventional spectroscopy techniques. This breakthrough paves the way for consistent plasmonic applications and next-generation microscopies.</description>

      <title>Many-body cages: disorder-free glassiness from flat bands in Fock space, and many-body Rabi oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We identify the many-body counterpart of flat bands, which we call many-body caging, as a general mechanism for non-equilibrium phenomena such as a novel type of glassy eigenspectrum order and many-body Rabi oscillations in the time domain. We focus on constrained systems of great current interest in the context of Rydberg atoms and synthetic or emergent gauge theories. We find that their state graphs host motifs which produce flat bands in the many-body spectrum at a particular set of energies. Basis states in Fock space exhibit Edwards-Anderson type parameters in the absence of quenched disorder, with an intricate, possibly fractal, distribution over Fock space which is reflected in a distinctive structure of a non-vanishing post-quench long-time Loschmidt echo, an experimentally accessible quantity.In general, phenomena familiar from single-particle flat bands manifest themselves in characteristic many-body incarnations, such as a reentrant `Anderson' delocalisation, offering a rich ensemble of experimental signatures in the abovementioned quantum simulators. The variety of single-particle flat band types suggests an analogous typology--and concomitant phenomenological richness to be explored--of their many-body counterparts.</description>

Abstract: The eigenvalue spectrum of the sum of large random matrices that are mutually "free", i.e., randomly rotated, can be obtained using the formalism of R-transforms, with many applications in different fields. We provide a direct interpretation of the otherwise abstract additivity property of R-transforms for the sum in terms of a dynamical evolution of "particles" (the eigenvalues), interacting through two-body and higher-body forces and subject to a Gaussian noise, generalizing the usual Dyson Brownian motion with Coulomb interaction. Interestingly, the appearance of an outlier outside of the bulk of the spectrum is signalled by a divergence of the "velocity" of the generalized Dyson motion. We extend our result to products of free matrices.</description>

      <title>Statistical mechanics model for Clifford random tensor networks and monitored quantum circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.02988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an exact mapping of Clifford (stabilizer) random tensor networks (RTNs) and monitored quantum circuits, onto a statistical mechanics model. With Haar unitaries, the fundamental degrees of freedom ('spins') are permutations because all operators commuting with the action of the unitaries on a tensor product arise from permutations of the tensor factors ('Schur-Weyl duality'). For unitaries restricted to the smaller Clifford group, the set of commuting operators, the 'commutant', forming the new 'spin' degrees of freedom, will be larger. We use the recent full characterization of this commutant by Gross et al., Comm. Math. Phys. 385, 1325 (2021), to construct the Clifford statistical mechanics models for on-site Hilbert space dimensions which are powers of a prime number $p$. We show that the Boltzmann weights are invariant under a symmetry group involving orthogonal matrices with entries in the finite number field ${\bf F}_p$. This implies that the symmetry group, and consequently all universal properties of entanglement transitions in Clifford circuits and RTNs will in general depend on, and only on the prime $p$. We show that Clifford monitored circuits with on-site Hilbert space dimension $d=p^M$ are described by percolation in the limits $d \to \infty$ at (a) $p=$ fixed but $M\to \infty$, and at (b) $M= 1$ but $p \to \infty$. In the limit (a) we calculate the effective central charge, and in the limit (b) we derive the following universal minimal cut entanglement entropy $S_A =(\sqrt{3}/\pi)\ln p \ln L_A$ for $d=p$ large at the transition. We verify those predictions numerically, and present extensive numerical results for critical exponents at the transition in monitored Clifford circuits for prime number on-site Hilbert space dimension $d=p$ for a variety of different values of $p$, and find that they approach percolation values at large $p$.</description>

Abstract: We study the deconfinement transition in (2+1)-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory both as a percolation transition of center vortices and as a localization transition for the low-lying Dirac modes. We study in detail the critical properties of the Anderson transition in the Dirac spectrum in the deconfined phase, showing that it is of BKT type; and the critical properties of the center-vortex percolation transition, showing that they differ from those of ordinary two-dimensional percolation. We then study the relation between localized modes and center vortices in the deconfined phase, identifying the simple center-vortex structures that mainly support the localized Dirac modes. As the system transitions to the confined phase, center vortices merge together into an infinite cluster, causing the low Dirac modes to delocalize.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced L\'evy flights of quantum information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a model of free fermions in one dimension, subject to frustrated (non-commuting) local measurements across adjacent sites, which resolves the fermions into non-orthogonal orbitals, misaligned from the underlying lattice. For maximal misalignment, superdiffusive behavior emerges from the vanishing of the measurement-induced quasiparticle decay rate at one point in the Brillouin zone, which generates fractal-scaling entanglement entropy $S \propto \ell^{1/3}$ for a subsystem of length $\ell$. We derive an effective non-linear sigma model with long-range couplings responsible for L\'evy flights in entanglement propagation, which we confirm with large-scale numerical simulations. When the misalignment is reduced, the entanglement exhibits, with increasing $\ell$, consecutive regimes of superdiffusive, $S\propto \ell^{1/3}$, diffusive, $S\propto \ln \ell$, and localized, $S = \rm{const}$, behavior. Our findings show how intricate fractal-scaling entanglement can be produced for local Hamiltonians and measurements.</description>

      <title>Applications of Statistical Field Theory in Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18553v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning algorithms have made incredible strides in the past decade, yet due to their complexity, the science of deep learning remains in its early stages. Being an experimentally driven field, it is natural to seek a theory of deep learning within the physics paradigm. As deep learning is largely about learning functions and distributions over functions, statistical field theory, a rich and versatile toolbox for tackling complex distributions over functions (fields) is an obvious choice of formalism. Research efforts carried out in the past few years have demonstrated the ability of field theory to provide useful insights on generalization, implicit bias, and feature learning effects. Here we provide a pedagogical review of this emerging line of research.</description>
