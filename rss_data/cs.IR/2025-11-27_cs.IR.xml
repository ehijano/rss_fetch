      <title>E-GEO: A Testbed for Generative Engine Optimization in E-Commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of large language models (LLMs), generative engines are becoming powerful alternatives to traditional search, reshaping retrieval tasks. In e-commerce, for instance, conversational shopping agents now guide consumers to relevant products. This shift has created the need for generative engine optimization (GEO)--improving content visibility and relevance for generative engines. Yet despite its growing importance, current GEO practices are ad hoc, and their impacts remain poorly understood, especially in e-commerce. We address this gap by introducing E-GEO, the first benchmark built specifically for e-commerce GEO. E-GEO contains over 7,000 realistic, multi-sentence consumer product queries paired with relevant listings, capturing rich intent, constraints, preferences, and shopping contexts that existing datasets largely miss. Using this benchmark, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study of e-commerce GEO, evaluating 15 common rewriting heuristics and comparing their empirical performance. To move beyond heuristics, we further formulate GEO as a tractable optimization problem and develop a lightweight iterative prompt-optimization algorithm that can significantly outperform these baselines. Surprisingly, the optimized prompts reveal a stable, domain-agnostic pattern--suggesting the existence of a "universally effective" GEO strategy. Our data and code are publicly available at https://github.com/psbagga17/E-GEO.</description>

      <title>Generating Querying Code from Text for Multi-Modal Electronic Health Record</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic health records (EHR) contain extensive structured and unstructured data, including tabular information and free-text clinical notes. Querying relevant patient information often requires complex database operations, increasing the workload for clinicians. However, complex table relationships and professional terminology in EHRs limit the query accuracy. In this work, we construct a publicly available dataset, TQGen, that integrates both \textbf{T}ables and clinical \textbf{T}ext for natural language-to-query \textbf{Gen}eration. To address the challenges posed by complex medical terminology and diverse types of questions in EHRs, we propose TQGen-EHRQuery, a framework comprising a medical knowledge module and a questions template matching module. For processing medical text, we introduced the concept of a toolset, which encapsulates the text processing module as a callable tool, thereby improving processing efficiency and flexibility. We conducted extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of our dataset and workflow, demonstrating their potential to enhance information querying in EHR systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Patch Aggregation: 3-Pass Pyramid Indexing for Vision-Enhanced Document Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Document centric RAG pipelines usually begin with OCR, followed by brittle heuristics for chunking, table parsing, and layout reconstruction. These text first workflows are costly to maintain, sensitive to small layout shifts, and often lose the spatial cues that contain the answer. Vision first retrieval has emerged as a strong alternative. By operating directly on page images, systems like ColPali and ColQwen preserve structure and reduce pipeline complexity while achieving strong benchmark performance. However, these late interaction models tie retrieval to a specific vision backbone and require storing hundreds of patch embeddings per page, creating high memory overhead and complicating large scale deployment.
  We introduce VisionRAG, a multimodal retrieval system that is OCR free and model agnostic. VisionRAG indexes documents directly as images, preserving layout, tables, and spatial cues, and builds semantic vectors without committing to a specific extraction. Our three pass pyramid indexing framework creates vectors using global page summaries, section headers, visual hotspots, and fact level cues. These summaries act as lightweight retrieval surrogates. At query time, VisionRAG retrieves the most relevant pages using the pyramid index, then forwards the raw page image encoded as base64 to a multimodal LLM for final question answering. During retrieval, reciprocal rank fusion integrates signals across the pyramid to produce robust ranking.
  VisionRAG stores only 17 to 27 vectors per page, matching the efficiency of patch based methods while staying flexible across multimodal encoders. On financial document benchmarks, it achieves 0.8051 accuracy at 10 on FinanceBench and 0.9629 recall at 100 on TAT DQA. These results show that OCR free, summary guided multimodal retrieval is a practical and scalable alternative to traditional text extraction pipelines.</description>

      <title>FITRep: Attention-Guided Item Representation via MLLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online platforms usually suffer from user experience degradation due to near-duplicate items with similar visuals and text. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) enable multimodal embedding, existing methods treat representations as black boxes, ignoring structural relationships (e.g., primary vs. auxiliary elements), leading to local structural collapse problem. To address this, inspired by Feature Integration Theory (FIT), we propose FITRep, the first attention-guided, white-box item representation framework for fine-grained item deduplication. FITRep consists of: (1) Concept Hierarchical Information Extraction (CHIE), using MLLMs to extract hierarchical semantic concepts; (2) Structure-Preserving Dimensionality Reduction (SPDR), an adaptive UMAP-based method for efficient information compression; and (3) FAISS-Based Clustering (FBC), a FAISS-based clustering that assigns each item a unique cluster id using FAISS. Deployed on Meituan's advertising system, FITRep achieves +3.60% CTR and +4.25% CPM gains in online A/B tests, demonstrating both effectiveness and real-world impact.</description>

      <title>RIA: A Ranking-Infused Approach for Optimized listwise CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reranking improves recommendation quality by modeling item interactions. However, existing methods often decouple ranking and reranking, leading to weak listwise evaluation models that suffer from combinatorial sparsity and limited representational power under strict latency constraints. In this paper, we propose RIA (Ranking-Infused Architecture), a unified, end-to-end framework that seamlessly integrates pointwise and listwise evaluation. RIA introduces four key components: (1) the User and Candidate DualTransformer (UCDT) for fine-grained user-item-context modeling; (2) the Context-aware User History and Target (CUHT) module for position-sensitive preference learning; (3) the Listwise Multi-HSTU (LMH) module to capture hierarchical item dependencies; and (4) the Embedding Cache (EC) module to bridge efficiency and effectiveness during inference. By sharing representations across ranking and reranking, RIA enables rich contextual knowledge transfer while maintaining low latency. Extensive experiments show that RIA outperforms state-of-the-art models on both public and industrial datasets, achieving significant gains in AUC and LogLoss. Deployed in Meituan advertising system, RIA yields a +1.69% improvement in Click-Through Rate (CTR) and a +4.54% increase in Cost Per Mille (CPM) in online A/B tests.</description>

      <title>Semantics Meet Signals: Dual Codebook Representationl Learning for Generative Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative recommendation has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm that unifies retrieval and generation, representing items as discrete semantic tokens and enabling flexible sequence modeling with autoregressive models. Despite its success, existing approaches rely on a single, uniform codebook to encode all items, overlooking the inherent imbalance between popular items rich in collaborative signals and long-tail items that depend on semantic understanding. We argue that this uniform treatment limits representational efficiency and hinders generalization. To address this, we introduce FlexCode, a popularity-aware framework that adaptively allocates a fixed token budget between a collaborative filtering (CF) codebook and a semantic codebook. A lightweight MoE dynamically balances CF-specific precision and semantic generalization, while an alignment and smoothness objective maintains coherence across the popularity spectrum. We perform experiments on both public and industrial-scale datasets, showing that FlexCode consistently outperform strong baselines. FlexCode provides a new mechanism for token representation in generative recommenders, achieving stronger accuracy and tail robustness, and offering a new perspective on balancing memorization and generalization in token-based recommendation models.</description>

      <title>ICPO: Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization for Efficient Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies, thereby facilitating more thorough exploration. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.</description>

      <title>Yesterday's News: Benchmarking Multi-Dimensional Out-of-Distribution Generalization of Misinformation Detection Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18122v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces misinfo-general, a benchmark dataset for evaluating misinformation models' ability to perform out-of-distribution generalization. Misinformation changes rapidly, much more quickly than moderators can annotate at scale, resulting in a shift between the training and inference data distributions. As a result, misinformation detectors need to be able to perform out-of-distribution generalization, an attribute they currently lack. Our benchmark uses distant labelling to enable simulating covariate shifts in misinformation content. We identify time, event, topic, publisher, political bias, misinformation type as important axes for generalization, and we evaluate a common class of baseline models on each. Using article metadata, we show how this model fails desiderata, which is not necessarily obvious from classification metrics. Finally, we analyze properties of the data to ensure limited presence of modelling shortcuts. We make the dataset and accompanying code publicly available: https://github.com/ioverho/misinfo-general</description>

      <title>Personalized Image Generation for Recommendations Beyond Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalization is central to human-AI interaction, yet current diffusion-based image generation systems remain largely insensitive to user diversity. Existing attempts to address this often rely on costly paired preference data or introduce latency through Large Language Models. In this work, we introduce REBECA (REcommendations BEyond CAtalogs), a lightweight and scalable framework for personalized image generation that learns directly from implicit feedback signals such as likes, ratings, and clicks. Instead of fine-tuning the underlying diffusion model, REBECA employs a two-stage process: training a conditional diffusion model to sample user- and rating-specific image embeddings, which are subsequently decoded into images using a pretrained diffusion backbone. This approach enables efficient, fine-tuning-free personalization across large user bases. We rigorously evaluate REBECA on real-world datasets, proposing a novel statistical personalization verifier and a permutation-based hypothesis test to assess preference alignment. Our results demonstrate that REBECA consistently produces high-fidelity images tailored to individual tastes, outperforming baselines while maintaining computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>LISRec: Modeling User Preferences with Learned Item Shortcuts for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User-item interaction histories are pivotal for sequential recommendation systems but often include noise, such as unintended clicks or actions that fail to reflect genuine user preferences. To address this, we propose Learned Item Shortcuts for Sequential Recommendation (LISRec), a novel framework that explicitly captures stable preferences by extracting personalized semantic shortcuts from historical interactions. LISRec first learns task-agnostic semantic representations to assess item similarities, then constructs a personalized semantic graph over all user-interacted items. By identifying the maximal semantic connectivity subset within this graph, LISRec selects the most representative items as semantic shortcuts to guide user preference modeling. This focused representation filters out irrelevant actions while preserving the diversity of genuine interests. Experimental results on the Yelp and Amazon Product datasets illustrate that LISRec achieves a 13% improvement over baseline recommendation models, showing its effectiveness in capturing stable user interests. Further analysis indicates that shortcut-based histories better capture user preferences, making more accurate and relevant recommendations. All codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/NEUIR/LISRec.</description>

      <title>Have We Really Understood Collaborative Information? An Empirical Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collaborative information serves as the cornerstone of recommender systems which typically focus on capturing it from user-item interactions to deliver personalized services. However, current understanding of this crucial resource remains limited. Specifically, a quantitative definition of collaborative information is missing, its manifestation within user-item interactions remains unclear, and its impact on recommendation performance is largely unknown. To bridge this gap, this work conducts a systematic investigation of collaborative information. We begin by clarifying collaborative information in terms of item co-occurrence patterns, identifying its main characteristics, and presenting a quantitative definition. We then estimate the distribution of collaborative information from several aspects, shedding light on how collaborative information is structured in practice. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of collaborative information on the performance of various recommendation algorithms. Finally, we highlight challenges in effectively capturing collaborative information and outlook promising directions for future research. By establishing an empirical framework, we uncover many insightful observations that advance our understanding of collaborative information and offer valuable guidelines for developing more effective recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Enhanced Adaptive Frequency Filter for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation has garnered significant attention for its ability to capture dynamic preferences by mining users' historical interaction data. Given that users' complex and intertwined periodic preferences are difficult to disentangle in the time domain, recent research is exploring frequency domain analysis to identify these hidden patterns. However, current frequency-domain-based methods suffer from two key limitations: (i) They primarily employ static filters with fixed characteristics, overlooking the personalized nature of behavioral patterns; (ii) While the global discrete Fourier transform excels at modeling long-range dependencies, it can blur non-stationary signals and short-term fluctuations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method called Wavelet Enhanced Adaptive Frequency Filter for Sequential Recommendation. Specifically, it consists of two vital modules: dynamic frequency-domain filtering and wavelet feature enhancement. The former is used to dynamically adjust filtering operations based on behavioral sequences to extract personalized global information, and the latter integrates wavelet transform to reconstruct sequences, enhancing blurred non-stationary signals and short-term fluctuations. Finally, these two modules work to achieve comprehensive performance and efficiency optimization in long sequential recommendation scenarios. Extensive experiments on four widely-used benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our work.</description>

      <title>Efficient Model-Agnostic Continual Learning for Next POI Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation improves personalized location-based services by predicting users' next destinations based on their historical check-ins. However, most existing methods rely on static datasets and fixed models, limiting their ability to adapt to changes in user behavior over time. To address this limitation, we explore a novel task termed continual next POI recommendation, where models dynamically adapt to evolving user interests through continual updates. This task is particularly challenging, as it requires capturing shifting user behaviors while retaining previously learned knowledge. Moreover, it is essential to ensure efficiency in update time and memory usage for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose GIRAM (Generative Key-based Interest Retrieval and Adaptive Modeling), an efficient, model-agnostic framework that integrates context-aware sustained interests with recent interests. GIRAM comprises four components: (1) an interest memory to preserve historical preferences; (2) a context-aware key encoding module for unified interest key representation; (3) a generative key-based retrieval module to identify diverse and relevant sustained interests; and (4) an adaptive interest update and fusion module to update the interest memory and balance sustained and recent interests. In particular, GIRAM can be seamlessly integrated with existing next POI recommendation models. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GIRAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining high efficiency in both update time and memory consumption.</description>

      <title>CLLMRec: LLM-powered Cognitive-Aware Concept Recommendation via Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growth of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) presents significant challenges for personalized learning, where concept recommendation is crucial. Existing approaches typically rely on heterogeneous information networks or knowledge graphs to capture conceptual relationships, combined with knowledge tracing models to assess learners' cognitive states. However, these methods face significant limitations due to their dependence on high-quality structured knowledge graphs, which are often scarce in real-world educational scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper proposes CLLMRec, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models through two synergistic technical pillars: Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation. The Semantic Alignment component constructs a unified representation space by encoding unstructured textual descriptions of learners and concepts. The Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation paradigm employs a teacher-student architecture, where a large teacher LLM (implemented as the Prior Knowledge Aware Component) extracts conceptual prerequisite relationships from its internalized world knowledge and distills them into soft labels to train an efficient student ranker. Building upon these foundations, our framework incorporates a fine-ranking mechanism that explicitly models learners' real-time cognitive states through deep knowledge tracing, ensuring recommendations are both structurally sound and cognitively appropriate. Extensive experiments on two real-world MOOC datasets demonstrate that CLLMRec significantly outperforms existing baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in generating truly cognitive-aware and personalized concept recommendations without relying on explicit structural priors.</description>

      <title>From Limited Labels to Open Domains:An Efficient Learning Method for Drone-view Geo-Localization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional supervised drone-view geo-localization (DVGL) methods heavily depend on paired training data and encounter difficulties in learning cross-view correlations from unpaired data. Moreover, when deployed in a new domain, these methods require obtaining the new paired data and subsequent retraining for model adaptation, which significantly increases computational overhead. Existing unsupervised methods have enabled to generate pseudo-labels based on cross-view similarity to infer the pairing relationships. However, geographical similarity and spatial continuity often cause visually analogous features at different geographical locations. The feature confusion compromises the reliability of pseudo-label generation, where incorrect pseudo-labels drive negative optimization. Given these challenges inherent in both supervised and unsupervised DVGL methods, we propose a novel cross-domain invariant knowledge transfer network (CDIKTNet) with limited supervision, whose architecture consists of a cross-domain invariance sub-network (CDIS) and a cross-domain transfer sub-network (CDTS). This architecture facilitates a closed-loop framework for invariance feature learning and knowledge transfer. The CDIS is designed to learn cross-view structural and spatial invariance from a small amount of paired data that serves as prior knowledge. It endows the shared feature space of unpaired data with similar implicit cross-view correlations at initialization, which alleviates feature confusion. Based on this, the CDTS employs dual-path contrastive learning to further optimize each subspace while preserving consistency in a shared feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDIKTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance under full supervision compared with those supervised methods, and further surpasses existing unsupervised methods in both few-shot and cross-domain initialization.</description>

      <title>The Structure-Content Trade-off in Knowledge Graph Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13380v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on knowledge graphs for factual reasoning, yet how retrieval design shapes their performance remains unclear. We examine how question decomposition changes the retrieved subgraph's content and structure. Using a hybrid retrieval function that controls the importance of initial question and subquestions, we show that subquestion-based retrieval improves content precision, but yields disjoint subgraphs, while question-based retrieval maintains structure at the cost of relevance. Optimal performance arises between these extremes, revealing that balancing retrieval content and structure is key to effective LLM reasoning over structured knowledge.</description>
