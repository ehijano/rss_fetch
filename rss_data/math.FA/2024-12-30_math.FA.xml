      <title>$p$-nuclearity of reduced group $L^p$-operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p\in (1,\infty)$ and let $G$ be a discrete group. G. An, J.-J. Lee and Z.-J. Ruan introduced $p$-nuclearity for $L^p$-operator algebras. They proved that the reduced group $L^p$-operator algebra $F^p_\lambda(G)$ is $p$-nuclear if $G$ is amenable. In this paper, we show that the converse is true. This answers an open problem concerning the $p$-nuclearity for reduced group $L^p$-operator algebras of N. C. Phillips.</description>

      <title>Strong factorization of ultradifferentiable vectors associated with compact Lie group representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a strong factorization theorem of Dixmier-Malliavin type for ultradifferentiable vectors associated with equicontinuous compact Lie group representations on sequentially complete locally convex Hausdorff spaces. In particular, this solves [Conjecture 6.4; J. Funct. Anal. 262 (2012), 667-681] for analytic vectors in the case of compact Lie groups.</description>

      <title>Mixed Fourier norm spaces of analytic functions on the upper half-plane and Toeplitz operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study weighted spaces of functions with mixed norm on the upper half-plane, defined in terms of Fourier transform. We give a characterization of analytic functions within these spaces, and in particular, we provide an analog of the Paley-Wiener theorem in this setting. As an application, we consider Toeplitz operators with vertical symbols in these new spaces.</description>

      <title>$(INV)$ condition and regularity of the inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f \colon \Omega \to \Omega' $ be a Sobolev mapping of finite distortion between planar domains $\Omega $ and $\Omega'$, satisfying the $(INV)$ condition and coinciding with a homeomorphism near $\partial\Omega $. We show that $f$ admits a generalized inverse mapping $h \colon \Omega' \to \Omega$, which is also a Sobolev mapping of finite distortion and satisfies the $(INV)$ condition.
  We also establish a higher-dimensional analogue of this result: if a mapping $f \colon \Omega \to \Omega' $ of finite distortion is in the Sobolev class $W^{1,p}(\Omega, \mathbb{R}^n)$ with $p &gt; n-1$ and satisfies the $(INV)$ condition, then $f$ has an inverse in $W^{1,1}(\Omega', \mathbb{R}^n)$ that is also of finite distortion.
  Furthermore, we characterize Sobolev mappings satisfying $(INV)$ whose generalized inverses have finite $n$-harmonic energy.</description>

      <title>Inverses of integral transforms of RKHSs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fourier transform and its inverse are well-known to have complex conjugate integral kernels. S.~Saitoh demonstrated that this relationship extends to the theory of integral transforms of Hilbert spaces of functions under certain conditions. In this paper, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the inverse of an integral transform of a Hilbert space of functions to be represented by a complex conjugate integral kernel. As an application, we present an alternative proof of Plancherel's theorem using the theory of reproducing kernels.</description>

      <title>A note on disjoint hypercyclicity for invertible bilateral pseudo-shifts on $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We first give a note on disjoint hypercyclicity for invertible bilateral pseudo-shifts on $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z})$, $1\leq p &lt;\infty$. It is already known that if a tuple of bilateral weighted shifts on $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z})$, $1\leq p &lt;\infty$, is disjoint hypercyclic, then non of the weighted shifts is invertible. We show that as for pseudo-shifts which is a generalization of weighted shifts, this fact is not true. We give an example of invertible bilateral pseudo-shifts on $\ell^{p}(\mathbb{Z})$, $1\leq p &lt;\infty$, which are disjoint hypercyclic and whose inverses are also disjoint hypercyclic. Next we partially answer to the open problem posed by Martin, Menet and Puig (2022)\cite{MMP22} concerned with disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic, that is, we show that as for the operators on a reflexive Banach space, reiteratively hypercyclic ones are disjoint hypercyclic if and only if they are disjoint reiteratively hypercyclic.</description>

      <title>A study on the dual of $C(X)$ with the topology of (strong) uniform convergence on a bornology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article begins by deriving a measure-theoretic decomposition of continuous linear functionals on $C(X)$, the space of all real-valued continuous functions on a metric space $(X, d)$, equipped with the topology $\tau_\mathcal{B}$ of uniform convergence on a bornology $\mathcal{B}$. We characterize the bornologies for which $(C(X), \tau_{\mathcal{B}})^*=(C(X), \tau_{\mathcal{B}}^s)^*$, where $\tau_{\mathcal{B}}^s$ represents the topology of strong uniform convergence on $\mathcal{B}$. Furthermore, we examine the normability of $\tau_{ucb}$, the topology of uniform convergence on bounded subsets, on $(C(X), \tau_{\mathcal{B}})^*$, and explore its relationship with the operator norm topology. Finally, we derive a topology on measures that shares a connection with $(C(X), \tau_{\mathcal{B}})^*$ when endowed with $\tau_{ucb}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the structure of the set $\Delta$ consisting of pairs of closed subspaces that have a common complement in a Hilbert space previously studied by Lauzon and Treil (J. Funct. Anal. 212: 500--512, 2004). We prove that $\Delta$ is the base space of a real analytic fiber bundle constructed in terms of geometric objects associated to the Grassmann manifold. As a consequence we determine the homotopy type of $\Delta$.</description>

      <title>Endpoint estimates of discrete fractional operators on discrete weighted Lebesgue spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $0&lt;\alpha&lt;1$ and $\frac{1}{q}=1-\alpha$. We first obtain that the function $\omega :\mathbb{Z} \rightarrow (0,\infty)$ belongs to weight class of $\mathcal{A} (1,q)(\mathbb{Z})$ if and only if discrete fractional maximal operator $M_{\alpha}$ or discrete Riesz potential $I_\alpha$ is bounded from $l_{\omega}^{1}(\mathbb{Z})$ to $l_{\omega^q}^{q,weak}(\mathbb{Z})$. Then for $p=\frac{1}{\alpha}$, we further obtain that the function $\omega$ belongs to weight class of $\mathcal{A} (p,\infty)(\mathbb{Z})$ if and only if discrete Riesz potential $I_\alpha$ has a property resembling discrete bounded mean oscillation. Moreover, we give another simple proof of $I_{\alpha}:l_{\omega ^p}^{p}(\mathbb{Z}) \rightarrow l_{\omega ^q}^{q}(\mathbb{Z})$ for $\omega \in \mathcal{A}(p,q)(\mathbb{Z})$, $1&lt;p&lt;\frac{1}{\alpha}$ and $\frac{1}{q}=\frac{1}{p}-\alpha$. As applications, more weighted norm inequalities for $M_{\alpha}$ and $I_\alpha$ are established when $\omega \in \mathcal{A}(1,q)(\mathbb{Z})$ or $\omega \in \mathcal{A}(p,\infty)(\mathbb{Z})$, and some of them are new even in continuous setting.}</description>

      <title>Characterization of decay rates for discrete operator semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T$ be a power-bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space $X$, and let $S$ be a bounded linear operator from another Hilbert space $Y$ to $X$. We investigate the non-exponential rate of decay of $\|T^nS\|$ as $n \to \infty$. First, when $X = Y$ and $S$ commutes with $T$, we characterize the decay rate of $\|T^nS\|$ by the growth rate of $\|(\lambda I - T)^{-k}S\|$ as $|\lambda| \downarrow 1$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$. Next, we provide another characterization by means of an integral estimate of $\|(\lambda I - T)^{-k}S\|$. The second characterization is then applied to asymptotic estimates for perturbed discrete operator semigroups. Finally, we present some results on the relation between the decay rate of $\|T^nS\|$ and the boundedness of the sum $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f(n)\|T^nSy\|^p$ for all $y \in Y$ in the Banach space setting, where $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to(0,\infty)$ and $p \geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Local and Global Bifurcation for Periodic Solutions of Hamiltonian Systems via Comparison Theory for the Spectral Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain local and global bifurcation for periodic solutions of Hamiltonian systems by using a new way to apply a comparison principle of the spectral flow that was originally introduced by Pejsachowicz in a joint work with the third author. A particular novelty is the study of global bifurcation, which to the best of our knowledge has not been done via the spectral flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06011v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize supercyclic weighted composition operators on various function spaces. Moreover, we also characterize supercyclic adjoint of the weighted composition operator and supercyclic left multipliers acting on the space of compact operators. Next, we introduce the concept of Cesaro hyper-transitivity and give an example of a weighted composition operator which is supercyclic, but not Cesaro hyper-transitive. Finally, we illustrate our results with concrete examples. In addition, we introduce a class of non-porous subsets of the space of continuous functions on the real line vanishing at infinity. As an application, we consider the weighted composition operator on this space and we give sufficient conditions that ensure that the set of non-hypercyclic vectors for this operator is non-porous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a general framework of functional and Fourier analysis on domains with a free action of an Abelian Lie group $G$. Namely, on a domain of the form $G\times Y$ we introduce the appropriate spaces of distributions and measurable functions, establishing their most basic properties. Then we consider the half-Fourier transform $f(x,y)\mapsto\hat f(\xi,y)$ in the first variable, and discuss the behaviour of function spaces on $G\times Y$ and $\hat G\times Y$ under this transform. We introduce general mixed-Fourier-norm spaces on $G\times Y$, and the subspaces of holomorphic functions among them, and give an explicit descriptions of the Fourier images of these spaces.</description>

This extends and unifies the finiteness characterisations previously known for euclidean spaces and for finitely generated groups and their duals. We place particular emphasis on Fourier invariance throughout, reflecting the fundamental Fourier invariance of Brascamp--Lieb multilinear forms in this context.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of D and D' properties in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores the equivalence of two sequential properties, $D$ and $D'$, for dual Banach spaces under the weak* topology. Property $D$ ensures that any totally scalarly measurable function is also scalarly measurable, while property $D'$ states that every weakly* sequentially closed subspace of $X^*$ is weakly* closed. These properties, which are central to the study of the interplay between topology and measurability in Banach spaces, was left as an open question.
  By examining the topological and measurable structures induced by the Baire $\sigma$-algebra, we prove that properties $D$ and $D'$ are indeed equivalent. The proof utilizes the relationship between total sets, weak* closures, and scalar measurability, extending previous results on sequential properties of dual Banach spaces. Additionally, we revisit the failure of property $D$ in nonseparable Banach spaces with $M$-basic $\ell_1^+$-systems, providing a topological reinterpretation of this phenomenon. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the weak* topology and measurable mappings in Banach space theory.</description>

      <title>A sharp symmetrized free transport-entropy inequality for the semicircular law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, following the recent work of Fathi (2018) in the classical case, we provide by two different methods a sharp symmetrized free Talagrand inequality for the semicircular law, which improves the free TCI of Biane and Voiculescu (2000). The first proof holds only in the one-dimensional case and has the advantage of providing a connection with the machinery of free moment maps introduced by Bahr and Boschert (2023) and a free reverse Log-Sobolev inequality. This case also and sheds light on a dual formulation via the free version of the functional Blaschke-Santalo inequality. The second proof gives the result in a multidimensional setting and relies on a random matrix approximation approach developed by Biane (2003), Hiai, Petz and Ueda (2004) combined with Fathi's inequality on Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <title>Fr\'echet Means in Infinite Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While there exists a well-developed asymptotic theory of Fr\'echet means of random variables taking values in a general "finite-dimensional" metric space, there are only a few known results in which the random variables can take values in an "infinite-dimensional" metric space. Presently, we fill this gap by proving a fundamental continuity theorem for Fr\'echet means in metric spaces which admit a suitably powerful notion of "weak convergence". This allows us to recover, strengthen, and generalize all known asymptotic theory for Fr\'echet means; in particular, we expand the possible geometric settings where such theory can be applied, we reduce the moment assumptions to the provably minimal possible, and we completely remove assumptions about uniqueness of the Fr\'echet mean. We also analyze many examples.</description>

      <title>A note on the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkowski inequality for intrinsic volumes and the $L_p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first goal of this paper is to improve some of the results in \cite{BCPR}. Namely, we establish the $L_p$-Brunn-Minkwoski inequality for intrinsic volumes for origin-symmetric convex bodies that are close to the ball in the $C^2$ sense for a certain range of $p&lt;1$ (including negative values) and we prove that this inequality does not hold true in the entire class of origin-symmetric convex bodies for any $p&lt;1$. The second goal is to establish a uniqueness result for the (closely related) $L_p$-Christoffel-Minkowski problem. More specifically, we show uniqueness in the symmetric case when $p\in[0,1)$ and the data function $g$ in the right hand side is sufficiently close to the constant 1. One of the main ingredients of the proof is the existence of upper and lower bounds for the (convex) solution, that depend only $\|\log g\|_{L^\infty}$, a fact that might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>How to avoid order reduction in third-order exponential Runge--Kutta methods for problems with non-commutative operators?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of a subclass of exponential integrators, specifically explicit exponential Runge--Kutta methods. It is well known that third-order methods can suffer from order reduction when applied to linearized problems involving unbounded and non-commuting operators. In this work, we consider a fourth-stage third-order Runge--Kutta method, which successfully achieves the expected order of accuracy and avoids order reduction, as long as all required order conditions are satisfied. The convergence analysis is carried out under the assumption of higher regularity for the initial data. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Fundamental solutions for parabolic equations and systems: universal existence, uniqueness, representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a universal, conceptually simple and systematic method to prove well-posedness to Cauchy problems for weak solutions of parabolic equations with non-smooth, time-dependent, elliptic part having a variational definition. Our classes of weak solutions are taken with minimal assumptions. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a fundamental solution which seems new in this generality: it is shown to always coincide with the associated evolution family for the initial value problem with zero source and it yields representation of all weak solutions. Our strategy is a variational approach avoiding density arguments, a priori regularity of weak solutions or regularization by smooth operators. One of our main tools are embedding results which yield time continuity of our weak solutions going beyond the celebrated Lions regularity theorem and that is addressing a variety of source terms. We illustrate our results with three concrete applications : second order uniformly elliptic part with Dirichlet boundary condition on domains, integro-differential elliptic part, and second order degenerate elliptic part.</description>
