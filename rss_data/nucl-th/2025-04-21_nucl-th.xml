      <title>Rapidity scan with DCCI at LHC energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the dynamical core-corona initialization (DCCI2) model to include the baryon number evolution in the entire system created in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Introducing the source term for the baryon number, we describe the early-stage equilibration and later-stage hydrodynamic evolution of the baryon number throughout the system from midrapidity to forward rapidity. Through numerical simulations with this extended model, we show that extremely large baryon chemical potentials are realized in forward rapidity regions at the LHC energy and are comparable to those of the BES energies. Moreover, we show that fluctuations of baryon chemical potentials are large and, consequently, negative baryon chemical potential regions appear at midrapidity.</description>

      <title>Neutrino cooling rates due to nickel isotopes for presupernova evolution of massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation studies indicate that weak interaction rates on nickel isotopes play a crucial role in determining the electron-to-baryon ratio within the stellar interior during the late stages of core evolution. (Anti)neutrinos produced through weak decay processes escape from stellar regions with densities below 10^11 g/cm^3, carrying away energy and thereby reducing the core entropy. In this work, we present a microscopic calculation of neutrino and antineutrino cooling rates resulting from weak interactions on nickel isotopes in the mass range 56 &lt;= A &lt;= 71. The calculations are performed using the deformed proton-neutron Quasiparticle Random Phase Approximation (pn-QRPA) model. Recent investigations into the Gamow-Teller (GT) strength distributions of nickel isotopes demonstrate that the deformed pn-QRPA model successfully reproduces experimental charge-changing transition data.</description>

      <title>Ground-state nuclear properties of neutron-rich copper isotopes and lepton capture rates in stellar matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study consists of two separate investigations centered on neutron-rich isotopes of copper, utilizing two distinct nuclear models. In the first part, the nuclear ground-state properties of copper isotopes in the mass range 72 &lt;= A &lt;= 82 were analyzed using the relativistic mean field (RMF) model. Quadrupole moment-constrained RMF calculations were carried out with DD-ME2 and DD-PC1 density-dependent interactions to compute the ground-state binding energies, charge radii, proton and neutron radii, quadrupole moments, and deformation parameters for the 71-82Cu isotopes. The results show good agreement with the limited experimental data available and previous theoretical predictions. In addition, potential energy curves were evaluated to investigate the ground-state geometrical configurations of these isotopes. The second part of the study is devoted to calculating lepton capture rates under stellar conditions. While earlier works have provided allowed Gamow-Teller (GT) and unique first-forbidden (U1F) beta-decay rates for selected neutron-rich Cu isotopes in stellar environments, the corresponding lepton capture rates had not yet been computed. This paper presents, for the first time, those lepton capture rates.</description>

      <title>Correlations and fluctuations in a magnetized three-flavor PNJL model with and without inverse magnetic catalysis effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlations $\chi^{BQ}_{11},\ \chi^{BS}_{11} ,\ \chi^{QS}_{11}$ and quadratic (quartic) fluctuations $\chi^{B,\ Q,\ S}_{2,4}$ of baryon number $B$, electric charge $Q$ and strangeness $S$ are investigated in a three-flavor PNJL model at finite temperature and magnetic field. The inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) effect is introduced through the magnetic field dependent parameters $G(eB)$ or $T_0(eB)$, and we make comparison of the results in the cases with and without IMC effect. Since including IMC effect does not change the strength of phase transition under external magnetic field, it does not lead to qualitative difference in the correlations and fluctuations, but modifies their values. Under vanishing and nonvanishing magnetic field, the correlations and fluctuations increase with temperature, and then show the peak around the pseudocritical temperatures of chiral restoration and deconfinement phase transitions. The peak structure in $\chi^{BQ}_{11}$, $\chi^B_{4}$ and $\chi^Q_{4}$ are much more apparent than in others. The correlations and fluctuations along the phase transition line under external magnetic field are characterized by the scaled correlations ${\hat {\chi}}_{11}^{XY}=\frac{\chi_{11}^{XY}(eB,T_{pc}^c(eB))}{\chi_{11}^{XY}(eB=0,T_{pc}^c(eB=0))}$ and scaled quadratic (quartic) fluctuations ${\hat {\chi}}_{2,4}^{X}=\frac{\chi_{2,4}^{X}(eB,T_{pc}^c(eB))}{\chi_{2,4}^{X}(eB=0,T_{pc}^c(eB=0))}$, with $X,\ Y=B,\ Q,\ S$ and $X \neq Y$ at the pseudocritical temperature $T_{pc}^c$ of chiral restoration phase transition. They increase with magnetic fields due to the increase of phase transition strength under magnetic fields. Among them, ${\hat {\chi}}_{11}^{BQ}$ increases fastest, which may serve as the magnetometer of QCD.</description>

      <title>An effective finite-range Gogny-type interaction for the quantum molecular dynamics like model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an effective finite-range Gogny-type interaction that can be directly used in the quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) like model. Two methods for determining the parameters of the effective interaction are discussed. The first method establishes an approach to connect the conventional Gogny interaction in nuclear structure to that in heavy-ion collisions, the second method allows for the description of the symmetry energy varying from the supersoft to stiff, as well as the momentum-dependent symmetry potential, exhibiting behaviors ranging from monotonic to non-monotonic variations. This effective interaction opens up opportunities for a deeper understanding of finite-range interactions and non-monotonic momentum-dependent symmetry potentials in future studies.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Theory of Quasiparticles, Retarded Correlators and Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic theory provides a powerful framework for investigating macroscopic and microscopic properties of weakly and strongly interacting plasmas. By assuming a constant mass profile within the kinetic theory approach, we examine the collective behavior of a system of massive relativistic particles within the Maxwell-Boltzmann equilibrium distribution. We derive the two-point retarded correlation functions for both charge and energy-momentum tensor components at arbitrary momentum and frequency values. To obtain analytical results, we expand relations for very small and large mass-to-temperature ratios ($m/T$). For large ratios, no significant effects are observed in the charge, shear, or sound propagation channels. However, for small ratios in the charge correlation function within the hydrodynamic limit, the mass tends to shift the hydrodynamic poles toward the unstable region, i.e., $\text{Im}(\omega) \geq 0$. This instability emerges at a critical value of $(m/T)_c \simeq 1.234$. Furthermore, in the sound channel, the mass amplifies the standard propagating sound mode, converting it into a purely (positive) imaginary mode. Consequently, all modes in this channel become purely imaginary, with instability becoming a dominant characteristic. In contrast, in the shear channel, all modes converge to their massless limits. Similar to the massless case, a threshold value exists for $(k \tau)$, below which the correlators exhibit solutions. We find that hydrodynamic poles arise in the strong coupling regime, while the weak coupling regime features a logarithmic branch cut between $\omega = k$ and $\omega = -k$ that is analogous to the massless scenario. Additionally, we derive the shear and bulk viscosity transport coefficients, along with other coefficients up to third order in gradients, as an expansion in terms of small $(m/T)$.</description>

      <title>The quest for the quark-gluon plasma from the perspective of dynamical models of relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of heavy-ion collisions is one of the most exciting and challenging directions of science for the last four decades. On the theoretical side one deals with a non-abelian field theory, while on the experimental side today's largest accelerators are needed to enable these studies. The discovery of a new stage of matter - called the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) - and the study of its properties is one of the major achievements of modern physics. In this contribution we briefly review the history of theoretical descriptions of heavy-ion collisions based on dynamical models, focusing on the personal experiences in this inspiring field.</description>

      <title>Emulating multi-channel scattering based on the eigenvector continuation in the discrete basis formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an emulator for a multi-channel scattering problem based on the eigenvector continuation. To this end, we employ the Kohn variational principle formulated in the discrete basis formalism. We apply this to one-dimensional scattering problems with a Gaussian barrier. Both for a single-channel and two-channel problems, we demonstrate that the penetration probability as well as the wave functions are well reproduced by the emulator. In particular, the energy dependence of the penetrability in a wider range of energy from well below the barrier to well above the barrier is successfully reproduced.</description>

      <title>Probing high-order deformation effects in neutron-deficient nuclei $^{246,248}$No with improved potential-energy-surface calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-order deformation effects in even-even $^{246,248}$No are investigated by means of pairing self-consistent Woods-Saxon-Strutinsky calculations using the potential-energy-surface (PES) approach in an extended deformation space $(\beta_2, \beta_3,\beta_4,\beta_5,\beta_6,\beta_7, \beta_8)$. Based on the calculated two-dimensional-projected energy maps and different potential-energy curves, we find that the highly even-order deformations have an important impact on both the fission trajectory and energy minima, while the odd-order deformations, accompanying the even-order ones, primarily affect the fission path beyond the second barrier. Relative to the light actinide nuclei, nuclear ground state changes to the superdeformed configuration but the normally-deformed minimum, as the low-energy shape isomer, may still be primarily responsible for enhancing nuclear stability and ensuring experimental accessibility in $^{246,248}$No. Our present investigation indicates the nonnegligible impact of high-order deformation effects along the fission valley and will be helpful for deepening the understandings of different deformation effects and deformation couplings in nuclei, especially in this neutron-deficient heavy-mass region.</description>

      <title>Probing the octupole deformation of $^{238}$U in high-energy nuclear collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some atomic nuclei exhibit ``pear" shapes arising from octupole deformation ($\beta_3$), though direct experimental evidences for such exotic shapes remains scarce. Low-energy model studies suggest $^{238}$U may have a modest octupole deformation arising from collective vibrational degrees of freedom, in addition to a large prolate shape. We investigated the impact of this modest octupole shape on observables involving triangular flow ($v_3$) in high-energy nuclear collisions. Using a hydrodynamic framework, we show $v_3$ and its correlation with mean transverse momentum, $\langle v_3^2 \delta\pT \rangle$, exhibit strong sensitivity to $\beta_3$. We found that $\langle v_3^2\rangle$ follows a linear increase with $\beta_3^2$, while $\langle v_3^2 \delta\pT \rangle$ is suppressed in the presence of $\beta_3$. Our findings show that the collective-flow-assisted nuclear imaging method in high-energy nuclear collisions, when compared with experimental data, can provide unique constraints on higher-order deformations.</description>

      <title>Bremsstrahlung Gamma Ray as a Probe of Short-Range Correlations in Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nucleons in nuclei form temporally correlated pairs in close proximity, called short range correlation (SRC), which plays a crucial role in understanding nuclear structure and the fundamental properties of dense nuclear matter. The consequence of SRC on heavy-ion collisions (HICs) has remained unexplored until now. In this paper, we identify neutron-proton bremsstrahlung $\gamma$-ray emission from HICs as a new indicator of SRC in nuclei. By observing the hardening of the bremsstrahlung $\gamma$-ray spectrum, which results from the increase of high-momentum components above the Fermi surface in nucleon momentum distributions, we precisely determine the SRC fraction in nuclei to be $(21\pm7)\%$ at $3\sigma$ confidence levels. Our experiment identifies the first direct and accurate signature of SRC in low-energy HICs, providing a new method to study the parton momentum distribution of nucleons in nuclei.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on a established relation in Refs.~\cite{Guo:2023ecc,Guo:2024zal,Guo:2024pvt} that relates the integrated correlation functions for a trapped system to the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through a weighted integral, we propose to extract the infinite volume scattering phase shifts through quantum simulation of the integrated correlation functions of trapped two-particle systems on quantum computers. The integrated correlation function can be computed by an ancilla-based algorithm proposed in Ref.~\cite{PhysRevA.64.022319}. The proposal is demonstrated with a simple contact interaction fermion model.</description>

      <title>Study of the Coulomb and nuclear breakup of $^{11}$Be using a Halo-EFT description at N$^2$LO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: The halo effective field theory (Halo-EFT) provides a very efficient description of loosely-bound nuclei in models of reaction. It offers a very systematical ranking of the significance of nuclear-structure observables in reaction calculations. This greatly helps to infer reliable structure information from reaction cross sections. However, for a meaningful analysis, the Halo-EFT scheme needs to have converged. Purpose: In a previous study [P. Capel, D. R. Phillips, and H.-W. Hammer, Phys. Rev. C 98, 034610 (2018)], NLO descriptions of 11Be have been developed and lead to excellent agreement with existing breakup data. However, the convergence of the scheme at NLO was not fully demonstrated. Moreover, a significant dependence on the regulator of the effective 10Be-n interaction has been observed. Method: We develop Halo-EFT descriptions of 11Be at N2LO and use them in an accurate breakup-reaction code. We compare our theoretical cross sections with experiment on Pb and C targets at about 70 MeV/nucleon. Results: On Pb, the N2LO descriptions of 11Be lead to little change to the NLO results of the previous study, confirming the convergence of that scheme. On C, the reaction is significantly affected by the presence of d resonances in the low-energy spectrum of 11Be. In the Halo-EFT power counting these resonances appear only at N2LO; our new descriptions include them naturally. Going to N2LO removes also the cutoff dependence observed in the previous study. Conclusions: We demonstrate the convergence of the Halo-EFT description of 11Be at NLO for Coulomb breakup and at N2LO for nuclear-dominated dissociation. The reliability of the nuclear-structure information inferred in the previous study is thus confirmed.</description>

      <title>Evolutions of in-medium baryon-baryon scattering cross sections and stiffness of dense nuclear matter from Bayesian analyses of FOPI proton flow excitation functions</title>

Abstract: Within a Bayesian statistical framework using a Gaussian Process (GP) emulator for an isospin-dependent Boltzmann-Uehling-Uhlenbeck (IBUU) transport model simulator of heavy-ion reactions with momentum-independent Skyrme interactions, we infer from the proton directed and elliptical flow in mid-central Au+Au reactions at beam energies from 150 to 1200 MeV/nucleon taken by the FOPI Collaboration the posterior Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) of the in-medium baryon-baryon scattering cross section (BBSCS) modification factor $X$ (with respect to their free-space values) and the stiffness parameter $K$ of dense nuclear matter. We find that the most probable value of $X$ evolves from around 0.7 to 1.0 as the beam energy $E_{beam}/A$ increases. On the other hand, the posterior PDF($K$) may have dual peaks having roughly the same height or extended shoulders at high $K$ values. More quantitatively, the posterior PDF($K$) changes from having a major peak around 220 MeV characterizing a soft EOS in the reaction at $E_{beam}/A$=150 MeV to one that peaks around 320 MeV indicating a stiff EOS in the reactions at $E_{beam}/A$ higher than about 600 MeV. The transition from soft to stiff happens in mid-central Au+Au reactions at beam energies around 250 MeV/nucleon in which $K=220$ MeV and $K=320$ MeV are approximately equally probable. Altogether, the FOPI proton flow excitation function data indicate a gradual hardening of hot and dense nuclear matter as its density and temperature increase in reactions with higher beam energies.</description>

      <title>Neutron versus proton scattering on exotic nuclei: the $^9$He example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron scattering on exotic nuclides is a class of processes which can not be studied directly now and in any observable future. Resonance proton scattering of exotic nuclide on a thick target in inverse kinematics can be used to infer the properties of the low-energy neutron scattering of this nuclide assuming the isobaric symmetry. However, the results of such resonance proton scattering reactions are so far analyzed in theoretical approaches (optical, R-matrix models), which are missing important aspects of isospin dynamics, isospin violation in continuum and threshold dynamics. The isospin conserving coupled-channel model (ICM) is proposed, which provides a more reliable basis for understanding of such experimental studies. Qualitatively different phase shifts for the $^{8}$He+$p$ $T=5/2$ and $T=3/2$ resonances are predicted by ICM with quite unusual profile for the $T=5/2$ states. Alternative interpretation of the existing $^{8}$He+$p$ data is proposed. The observable properties of the $T=5/2$ resonances may be strongly affected by the isobaric-partner $T=3/2$ states. Crucial importance of studies of the neutron-emission channel for disentangling this possible influence is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Effects on Nuclear Short Range Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal nuclear many-body effects on short range correlations by ab initio no-core shell model calculations of the scaling factor a2. The factor a2 characterizes the abundance of SRC pairs and is linearly related to the EMC effect. Our study employs the fifth-order N4LO chiral nuclear force without softening, enabling to distinguish the influences of nuclear states with different quantum numbers on SRC. It is striking to find that a2 is reduced and close in triplet isobaric analog states of neighboring nuclei, indicating that it is insufficient to estimate SRC abundances by considering only mean-field shell structures. This is explained as specific nuclear states suppress the formation of deuteron-like component, impacting our understandings of the link between high-energy partonic properties and low-energy nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Applicability of Hydrodynamics in Hadronic Phase of Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.14792v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hadronic phase and its dynamics in relativistic heavy-ion collisions are topics of immense discussion. The hadronic phase contains various massive hadrons with an abundance of the lightest hadron, i.e., $\pi$-mesons (pions). In this paper, we consider that pions are in thermal equilibrium in the hadronic phase and use second-order viscous hydrodynamics for a medium of massive pions to obtain its expansion to the boundary of the kinetic freeze-out. We achieve the kinetic freeze-out boundary with the Knudsen number $Kn&gt;1$ limit. When this condition is met, hydrodynamics expansion breaks down, and the mean free path becomes sufficiently large in comparison with the system size so that the particle yields are preserved. Further, we investigate the effect of the massive fluid on the resonance particle yields, including re-scattering and regeneration, along with the natural decay widths of the resonances. The resonances can play an essential role in determining the characteristics of the hadronic phase as they have sufficiently small lifetimes, which may be comparable to the hadronic phase lifetime. In the current study, we predict the hadronic phase lifetime, which is further used to determine the $K^*(892)^0/K$, $\phi(1020)/K$, and $\rho(770)^0/\pi$ yield ratios at the kinetic freeze-out. We calculate these ratios as a function of charged particle multiplicity and transverse momentum and compare the findings with experimental data. Our calculations qualitatively agree with the experimental data, indicating a possible hydrodynamical evolution of the hadronic phase.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of a polarized neutron by internal weak nuclear forces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is proven that a polarized neutron gets accelerated by internal nuclear forces along the coherent rotation of its spin. The net force upon the neutron arises from the weak nuclear interactions between its quarks. It is the result of the simultaneous breaking of parity symmetry by the chiral interactions between the neutron's quarks, and of time-reversal symmetry along the inversion of their spins. The variation of the neutron's kinetic momentum is accompanied with the transfer of an equivalent momentum to the fields of the Z and W bosons that mediate the interactions, in the opposite direction. The effect is linear in Fermi's constant. Using the simplest hadron models, an upper bound of the order of meters per second is estimated for the velocity variation of the polarized neutron along the spin-flip process.</description>

      <title>Study of transport properties of a hot and dense QCD matter using a novel approximation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have studied the charge and the heat transport properties of a hot and dense QCD matter by solving the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation using a novel approximation method. Following the recently developed novel relaxation time approximation (RTA) model, we have proposed a novel Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) model with a modified collision integral to carry out the aforementioned study. We have also compared our findings with the results of the novel RTA, the standard RTA and the standard BGK models. Our observation shows that the novel collision integrals for both the RTA and BGK models decrease the charge and the heat transport phenomena in the medium, as evidenced by the reduced values of the transport coefficients, such as the electrical conductivity and the thermal conductivity, when compared to the standard RTA and standard BGK models. Furthermore, certain observables, such as the thermal diffusion constant and the Lorenz number have been explored using the novel approaches of the aforesaid models. We have found an overall decreasing trend of the thermal diffusion constant with the temperature in the novel BGK model, similar to the novel RTA model, but the magnitude remains higher throughout the temperature range. However, the magnitude of the thermal diffusion constant in the proposed novel BGK model remains lower than its value in the standard BGK model. The magnitude of the Lorenz number in the novel BGK model remains higher than that in the standard BGK model, but it is lower than that in the novel RTA model. We have also observed that the Lorenz number in all cases has an increasing trend at low temperatures, showing a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law, whereas at high temperatures, it becomes saturated. The Lorenz number remaining above unity indicates that the thermal conductivity prevails over the electrical conductivity in the aforesaid models.</description>

      <title>Nuclear deformation effects in photoproduction of $\rho$ mesons in ultraperipheral isobaric collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the $\rho^{0}$ meson photoproduction in ultraperipheral isobaric collisions between $_{44}^{96}\textrm{Ru}+_{44}^{96}\textrm{Ru}$ and $_{40}^{96}\textrm{Zr}+_{40}^{96}\textrm{Zr}$ at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, employing the dipole model with the equivalent photon approximation. By implementing the Woods-Saxon distribution to represent the nuclear mass density, which is derived from density functional theory with an inclusion of nuclear deformation effects, we have calculated the transverse momentum $q_{T}$ spectra in isobaric collisions. We observe the characteristic dip behavior in these spectra, indicative of diffraction phenomena in high-energy physics. We notice that the deformation effects cause a nearly linear increase with $q_{T}^{2}$ for $q_{T}^{2}\lesssim0.015$ $\textrm{GeV}^{2}$, aligning with experimental observations. We offer a simple explanation for the observed behavior in these spectra by introducing the effective width of the nuclei in the thickness function. We also extend our discussion on the $\rho^{0}$ meson photoproduction with the targets $^{63}\textrm{Cu}$,$^{197}\textrm{Au}$, and $^{238}\textrm{U}$.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Hydrodynamization and the Emergence of Attractors: a Unified Description of Hydrodynamization in Kinetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: "Attractor" solutions for the pre-hydrodynamic, far-from-equilibrium, evolution of the matter produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions have emerged as crucial descriptors of the rapid hydrodynamization of quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Adiabatic Hydrodynamization (AH) has been proposed as a framework with which to describe, explain, and predict attractor behavior that draws upon an analogy to the adiabatic approximation in quantum mechanics. In this work, we systematize the description of pre-hydrodynamic attractors in kinetic theory by showing how to use the AH framework to identify these long-lived solutions to which varied initial conditions rapidly evolve, demonstrating the robustness of this framework. In a simplified QCD kinetic theory in the small-angle scattering limit, we use AH to explain both the early- and late-time scaling behavior of a longitudinally expanding gluon gas in a unified framework. In this context, we show that AH provides a unified description of, and intuition for, all the stages of what in QCD would be bottom-up thermalization, starting from a pre-hydrodynamic attractor and ending with hydrodynamization. We additionally discuss the connection between the notions of scaling behavior and adiabaticity and the crucial role of time-dependent coordinate redefinitions in identifying the degrees of freedom of kinetic theories that give rise to attractor solutions. The tools we present open a path to the intuitive explanation of how attractor behavior arises and how the attractor evolves in all stages of the hydrodynamization of QGP in heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the chemical and kinetic nonequilibrium dynamics of the Higgs boson during the primordial Universe QGP (quark-gluon plasma) epoch $130\mathrm{\,GeV}&gt;T&gt;10\mathrm{\,GeV}$. We show that the Higgs bosons is always out of chemical abundance equilibrium with a fugacity $\Upsilon_h = 0.69$ due to virtual decay channels. Additionally, Higgs momentum distribution is found to be ``cold'' for $T&lt;25$\,GeV, since the scattering rate drops below the production rate.</description>

      <title>Correlation studies of the $^{7}$He excited states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unbound nucleus $^{7}$He was recently studied in the $^2$H($^{6}$He,$^1$H)$^{7}$He reaction at 29 $A\,$MeV beam energy in Ref.[M.S. Golovkov et al., Phys. Rev. C 109, L061602 (2024)]. The excitation spectrum of $^{7}$He was measured up to $E_T=8$ MeV ($E_T$ is energy above the $^{6}$He-$n$ threshold). Angular distribution for the $^{6}$He-$n$ decay of the $^{7}$He $3/2^-$ ground state can be explained by a strong spin alignment induced by a reaction mechanism. The correlation information for the higher-lying $^{7}$He excitations is available as backward-forward asymmetry for the $^{6}$He-$n$ decay in the $^{7}$He frame. The asymmetry function has an expressed energy profile which may be explained by using quite restrictive assumptions about structure of $^{7}$He excitations or/and peculiarities of the reaction mechanism. In the analysis of [M.S. Golovkov et al., Phys. Rev. C 109, L061602 (2024)] the observation the $s_{1/2}$ state in $^{7}$He is declared with $E_r \approx 2.0$ MeV. Our work is based on the same $^{7}$He data. However, the data analysis was improved and also the data interpretation is substantiated with the detailed PWBA reaction studies and coupled-channel calculations of the $^{7}$He continuous spectrum. The idea of the $s_{1/2}$ resonant state with $E_r \approx 2.0$ is rejected. In addition, the position of the $1/2^-$ state in $^{7}$He is confined to the interval $E_r=2.2-3.0$ MeV, with ``preferred'' value 2.6 MeV. There is indication on the second $3/2^-$ state in the data with $E_r \sim 4.5$ MeV and with the lower resonance energy limit $E_r \gtrsim 3.5$ MeV. Importance and prospects of more detailed correlation studies of $^{7}$He continuum are discussed.</description>
