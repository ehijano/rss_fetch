      <title>Pointwise-Sparse Actuator Scheduling for Linear Systems with Controllability Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address optimal scheduling of control inputs given a hard constraint on the number of input channels active at any time. For a sparsely controllable system, we characterize the sparse actuator schedules that make the system controllable, and then devise a greedy selection algorithm that guarantees controllability while heuristically providing low control effort. We further show how to enhance our greedy algorithm via Markov chain Monte Carlo-based optimization.</description>

      <title>A continuous-time fundamental lemma and its application in data-driven optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven control of discrete-time and continuous-time systems is of tremendous research interest. In this paper, we explore data-driven optimal control of continuous-time linear systems using input-output data. Based on a density result, we rigorously derive error bounds for finite-order polynomial approximations of elements of the system behavior. To this end, we leverage a link between latent variables and flat outputs of controllable systems. Combined with a continuous-time counterpart of the fundamental lemma by Willems et al., we characterize the suboptimality resulting from polynomial approximations in data-driven linear-quadratic optimal control problems. Finally, we draw upon a numerical example to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>The shortest experiment for linear system identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the following problem: given an upper bound of the state-space dimension and lag of a linear time-invariant system, design a sequence of inputs so that the system dynamics can be recovered from the resulting input-output data. As our main result we propose a new online experiment design method, meaning that the selection of the inputs is iterative and guided by data samples collected in the past. We show that this approach leads to the shortest possible experiments for linear system identification. In terms of sample complexity, the proposed method outperforms offline methods based on persistency of excitation as well as existing online experiment design methods.</description>

      <title>Inertial Methods with Viscous and Hessian driven Damping for Non-Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12518v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we aim to study non-convex minimization problems via second-order (in-time) dynamics, including a non-vanishing viscous damping and a geometric Hessian-driven damping. Second-order systems that only rely on a viscous damping may suffer from oscillation problems towards the minima, while the inclusion of a Hessian-driven damping term is known to reduce this effect without explicit construction of the Hessian in practice. There are essentially two ways to introduce the Hessian-driven damping term: explicitly or implicitly. For each setting, we provide conditions on the damping coefficients to ensure convergence of the gradient towards zero. Moreover, if the objective function is definable, we show global convergence of the trajectory towards a critical point as well as convergence rates. Besides, in the autonomous case, if the objective function is Morse, we conclude that the trajectory converges to a local minimum of the objective for almost all initializations. We also study algorithmic schemes for both dynamics and prove all the previous properties in the discrete setting under proper choice of the step-size.</description>

      <title>An optimal boundary control problem related to the time dependent Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a boundary control problem for the evolutionary Navier-Stokes equations, under mixed boundary conditions, in two dimensions. The cost functional here considered is of quadratic type, depending on both state and control variables. We provide a comprehensive theoretical framework to address the analysis and the derivation of a system of first-order optimality conditions that characterizes the solution of the control problem. We take advantage of an adequate treatment of the Dirichlet control through the study of the reduced functional. Despite the fact that this approach is quite common, a detailed analysis for the case of mixed boundary conditions with is still lacking. Finally, solution-finding algorithms of descent type are proposed and illustrated with several simulations.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Reachability of Stochastic Control Systems: A Contraction-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a framework for studying the probabilistic reachability of stochastic control systems. Given a stochastic system, we introduce a separation strategy for reachability analysis that decouples the effect of deterministic input/disturbance and stochastic uncertainty. A remarkable feature of this separation strategy is its ability to leverage any deterministic reachability framework to capture the effect of deterministic input/disturbance. Furthermore, this separation strategy encodes the impact of stochastic uncertainty on reachability analysis by measuring the distance between the trajectories of the stochastic system and its associated deterministic system. Using contraction theory, we provide probabilistic bounds on this trajectory distance and estimate the propagation of stochastic uncertainties through the system. By combining this probabilistic bound on trajectory distance with two computationally efficient deterministic reachability methods, we provide estimates for probabilistic reachable sets of the stochastic system. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework through numerical experiments on a feedback-stabilized inverted pendulum.</description>

      <title>Base Models for Parabolic Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) appear in many disciplines to model the evolution of various mathematical objects, such as probability flows, value functions in control theory, and derivative prices in finance. It is often necessary to compute the solutions or a function of the solutions to a parametric PDE in multiple scenarios corresponding to different parameters of this PDE. This process often requires resolving the PDEs from scratch, which is time-consuming. To better employ existing simulations for the PDEs, we propose a framework for finding solutions to parabolic PDEs across different scenarios by meta-learning an underlying base distribution. We build upon this base distribution to propose a method for computing solutions to parametric PDEs under different parameter settings. Finally, we illustrate the application of the proposed methods through extensive experiments in generative modeling, stochastic control, and finance. The empirical results suggest that the proposed approach improves generalization to solving PDEs under new parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Information Compression in Dynamic Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the reasons why stochastic dynamic games with an underlying dynamic system are challenging is since strategic players have access to enormous amount of information which leads to the use of extremely complex strategies at equilibrium. One approach to resolve this challenge is to simplify players' strategies by identifying appropriate compression of information maps so that the players can make decisions solely based on the compressed version of information, called the information state. For finite dynamic games with asymmetric information, inspired by the notion of information state for single-agent control problems, we propose two notions of information states, namely mutually sufficient information (MSI) and unilaterally sufficient information (USI). Both these information states are obtained with information compression maps independent of the strategy profile. We show that Bayes-Nash Equilibria (BNE) and Sequential Equilibria (SE) exist when all players use MSI-based strategies. We prove that when all players employ USI-based strategies the resulting sets of BNE and SE payoff profiles are the same as the sets of BNE and SE payoff profiles resulting when all players use full information-based strategies. We prove that when all players use USI-based strategies the resulting set of weak Perfect Bayesian Equilibrium (wPBE) payoff profiles can be a proper subset of all wPBE payoff profiles. We identify MSI and USI in specific models of dynamic games in the literature. We end by presenting an open problem: Do there exist strategy-dependent information compression maps that guarantee the existence of at least one equilibrium or maintain all equilibria that exist under perfect recall? We show, by a counterexample, that a well-known strategy-dependent information compression map used in the literature does not possess any of the properties of MSI or USI.</description>

      <title>Characterization of generic parameter families of constraint mappings in optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to understand generic behavior of constraint functions in optimization problems relying on singularity theory of smooth mappings. To this end, we will focus on the subgroup $\mathcal{K}[G]$ of the Mather's group $\mathcal{K}$, whose action to constraint map-germs preserves the corresponding feasible set-germs (i.e.~the set consisting of points satisfying the constraints). We will classify map-germs with small stratum $\mathcal{K}[G]_e$-codimensions, and calculate the codimensions of the $\mathcal{K}[G]$-orbits of jets represented by germs in the classification lists and those of the complements of these orbits. Applying these results and a variant of the transversality theorem, we will show that families of constraint mappings whose germ at any point in the corresponding feasible set is $\mathcal{K}[G]$-equivalent to one of the normal forms in the classification list compose a residual set in the entire space of constraint mappings with at most $4$-parameters. These results enable us to quantify genericity of given constraint mappings, and thus evaluate to what extent known test suites are generic.</description>

      <title>Geometric and computational hardness of bilevel programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We first show a simple but striking result in bilevel optimization: unconstrained $C^\infty$ smooth bilevel programming is as hard as general extended-real-valued lower semicontinuous minimization. We then proceed to a worst-case analysis of box-constrained bilevel polynomial optimization.  We show in particular that any extended-real-valued semi-algebraic function, possibly non-continuous, can be expressed as the value function of a polynomial bilevel program. Secondly, from a computational complexity perspective, the decision version of polynomial bilevel programming is one level above NP in the polynomial hierarchy ($\Sigma^p_2$-hard). Both types of difficulties are uncommon in non-linear programs for which objective functions are typically continuous and belong to the class NP. These results highlight the irremediable hardness attached to general bilevel optimization and the necessity of imposing some form of regularity on the lower level.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a derivative-free Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm for nonlinear least squares problems, where the Jacobian matrices are approximated via orthogonal spherical smoothing. It is shown that the gradient models which use the approximate Jacobian matrices are probabilistically first-order accurate, and the high probability complexity bound of the algorithm is also given.</description>

      <title>A Methodology Establishing Linear Convergence of Adaptive Gradient Methods under PL Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adaptive gradient-descent optimizers are the standard choice for training neural network models. Despite their faster convergence than gradient-descent and remarkable performance in practice, the adaptive optimizers are not as well understood as vanilla gradient-descent. A reason is that the dynamic update of the learning rate that helps in faster convergence of these methods also makes their analysis intricate. Particularly, the simple gradient-descent method converges at a linear rate for a class of optimization problems, whereas the practically faster adaptive gradient methods lack such a theoretical guarantee. The Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (PL) inequality is the weakest known class, for which linear convergence of gradient-descent and its momentum variants has been proved. Therefore, in this paper, we prove that AdaGrad and Adam, two well-known adaptive gradient methods, converge linearly when the cost function is smooth and satisfies the PL inequality. Our theoretical framework follows a simple and unified approach, applicable to both batch and stochastic gradients, which can potentially be utilized in analyzing linear convergence of other variants of Adam.</description>

Abstract: We propose and analyse a variant of the recently introduced kinetic based optimization method that incorporates ideas like survival-of-the-fittest and mutation strategies well-known from genetic algorithms. Thus, we provide a first attempt to reach out from the class of consensus/kinetic-based algorithms towards genetic metaheuristics. Different generations of genetic algorithms are represented via two species identified with different labels, binary interactions are prescribed on the particle level and then we derive a mean-field approximation in order to analyse the method in terms of convergence. Numerical results underline the feasibility of the approach and show in particular that the genetic dynamics allows to improve the efficiency, of this class of global optimization methods in terms of computational cost.</description>

Abstract: We consider a singular control problem that aims to maximize the expected cumulative rewards, where the instantaneous returns depend on the state of a controlled process. The contributions of this paper are twofold. Firstly, to establish sufficient conditions for determining the optimality of the one-barrier strategy when the uncontrolled process $X$ follows a spectrally negative L\'evy process with a L\'evy measure defined by a completely monotone density. Secondly, to verify the optimality of the $(2n+1)$-barrier strategy when $X$ is a Brownian motion with a drift. Additionally, we provide an algorithm to compute the barrier values in the latter case.</description>

Abstract: We study the controllability of a class of $N$-dimensional degenerate parabolic equations with single interior point degeneracy. We employ the Galerkin method to prove the existence of solutions for the equations. The analysis is then divided into two cases based on whether the degenerate point $x=0$ lies within the control region $\omega_0$ or not. For each case, we establish specific Carleman estimates. As a result, we achieve null controllability in the first case $0\in\omega_0$ and unique continuation and approximate controllability in the second case $0\notin\omega_0$.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the School Bus Routing Problem with Open Offer Policy (SBRP-OOP) that seeks to improve capacity usage and minimize the bus fleet by openly offering a monetary incentive to students willing to opt out of using a bus. We propose a mathematical formulation to determine a pricing strategy that balances the trade-off between incentive payments for students who choose not to use the bus with the expected savings obtained from operating fewer buses. To evaluate the effectiveness of the approach, we conducted simulations using both synthetic and real instances from a real operational context in the Williamsville Central School District (WCSD) of New York.</description>

      <title>An inexact $q$-order regularized proximal Newton method for nonconvex composite optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06871v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper concerns the composite problem of minimizing the sum of a twice continuously differentiable function $f$ and a nonsmooth convex function. For this class of nonconvex and nonsmooth problems, by leveraging a practical inexactness criterion and a novel selection strategy for iterates, we propose an inexact $q$-order regularized proximal Newton method for $q\in[2,3]$, which becomes an inexact cubic regularization (CR) method for $q=3$. We prove that the whole iterate sequence converges to a stationary point for the KL objective function; and when the objective function has the KL property of exponent $\theta\in(0,\frac{q-1}{q})$, the convergence has a local $Q$-superlinear rate of order $\frac{q-1}{\theta q}$. In particular, under a local H\"{o}lderian error bound of order $\gamma\in(\frac{1}{q-1},1]$ on a second-order stationary point set, we show that the iterate and objective value sequences converge to a second-order stationary point and a second-order stationary value, respectively, with a local $Q$-superlinear rate of order $\gamma(q\!-\!1)$, specified as the $Q$-quadratic rate for $q=3$ and $\gamma=1$. This is the first practical inexact CR method with $Q$-quadratic convergence rate for nonconvex composite optimization. We validate the efficiency of the CR method with ZeroFPR as the inner solver by applying it to composite optimization problems with highly nonlinear $f$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two systems of two conservation laws that are defined on complementary spatial intervals and coupled by an interface as a single port-Hamiltonian system. In case of a fixed interface position, we characterize the boundary and interface conditions for which the associated port-Hamiltonian operator generates a contraction semigroup. Furthermore, we present sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of the generated $C_0$-semigroup. The results are illustrated by the example of two acoustic waveguides coupled by an interface consisting of some membrane.</description>

      <title>Proving the Chow-Rashevskii Theorem \`a la Rashevskii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new independent proof of a generalised version of the theorem by Rashevskii, which appeared in [Uch. Zapiski Ped. Inst. K. 2 (1938), 83 -- 94] and from which the classical Chow-Rashevskii Theorem follows as a corollary. The proof is structured to allow generalisations to the case of orbits of compositions of flows in absence of group structures, thus appropriate for applications in Control Theory. In fact, the same structure of the proof has been successfully exploited in [C. Giannotti, A. Spiro and M. Zoppello, arXiv 2401.07555 \&amp; 2401.07560 (2024)] to determine new controllability criteria for real analytic non-linear control systems. It also yields a corollary, which can be used to derive results under lower regularity assumptions, as it is illustrated by a simple explicit example.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning Can Find Friends That Are Advantageous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05050v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Federated Learning (FL), the distributed nature and heterogeneity of client data present both opportunities and challenges. While collaboration among clients can significantly enhance the learning process, not all collaborations are beneficial; some may even be detrimental. In this study, we introduce a novel algorithm that assigns adaptive aggregation weights to clients participating in FL training, identifying those with data distributions most conducive to a specific learning objective. We demonstrate that our aggregation method converges no worse than the method that aggregates only the updates received from clients with the same data distribution. Furthermore, empirical evaluations consistently reveal that collaborations guided by our algorithm outperform traditional FL approaches. This underscores the critical role of judicious client selection and lays the foundation for more streamlined and effective FL implementations in the coming years.</description>

      <title>An L-BFGS-B approach for linear and nonlinear system identification under $\ell_1$- and group-Lasso regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a very efficient numerical method based on the L-BFGS-B algorithm for identifying linear and nonlinear discrete-time state-space models, possibly under $\ell_1$- and group-Lasso regularization for reducing model complexity. For the identification of linear models, we show that, compared to classical linear subspace methods, the approach often provides better results, is much more general in terms of the loss and regularization terms used (such as penalties for enforcing system stability), and is also more stable from a numerical point of view. The proposed method not only enriches the existing set of linear system identification tools but can also be applied to identifying a very broad class of parametric nonlinear state-space models, including recurrent neural networks. We illustrate the approach on synthetic and experimental datasets and apply it to solve a challenging industrial robot benchmark for nonlinear multi-input/multi-output system identification. A Python implementation of the proposed identification method is available in the package jax-sysid, available at https://github.com/bemporad/jax-sysid.</description>

      <title>Implementation of soft-constrained MPC for Tracking using its semi-banded problem structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a popular control approach due to its ability to consider constraints, including input and state restrictions, while minimizing a cost function. However, in practice, these constraints can result in feasibility issues, either because the system model is not accurate or due to the existence of external disturbances. To mitigate this problem, a solution adopted by the MPC community is the use of soft constraints. In this article, we consider a not-so-typical methodology to encode soft constraints in a particular MPC formulation known as MPC for Tracking (MPCT), which has several advantages when compared to standard MPC formulations. The motivation behind the proposed encoding is to maintain the semi-banded structure of the ingredients of a recently proposed solver for the considered MPCT formulation, thus providing an efficient and fast solver when compared to alternative approaches from the literature. We show numerical results highlighting the benefits of the formulation and the computational efficiency of the solver.</description>

      <title>Finite-difference least square methods for solving Hamilton-Jacobi equations using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple algorithm to approximate the viscosity solution of Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) equations by means of an artificial deep neural network. The algorithm uses a stochastic gradient descent-based method to minimize the least square principle defined by a monotone, consistent numerical scheme. We analyze the least square principle's critical points and derive conditions that guarantee that any critical point approximates the sought viscosity solution. The use of a deep artificial neural network on a finite difference scheme lifts the restriction of conventional finite difference methods that rely on computing functions on a fixed grid. This feature makes it possible to solve HJ equations posed in higher dimensions where conventional methods are infeasible. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm through numerical studies on various canonical HJ equations across different dimensions, showcasing its potential and versatility.</description>
