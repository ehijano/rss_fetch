      <title>Landau levels in the mixed state of two-dimensional nodal superconductors: models, featured magneto-optical response and quantized thermal Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Landau quantization of low-energy quasiparticles (QPs) in the mixed state of gapless superconductors is a celebrated problem. So far, the only superconducting system that has been shown to host Landau levels (LLs) of Bogoliubov QPs is the Weyl superconductor. Here, we first investigate the QPs in the mixed state of two Weyl superconductors, an intrinsic one and a heterostructure one, and reveal that the QP states in the former do not form LLs, in contrast to those in the latter where LLs of QPs are shown to exist. The key is whether the low-energy Hamiltonian respects a generalized chiral symmetry. Following the analysis, we show that a twodimensional superconducting system -- a topological insulator-superconductor heterostructure respecting the generalized chiral symmetry -- exhibits LLs with Chern number $\pm 1$ in the mixed state. We also show featured responses resulting from the LLs, including peaked magneto-optical conductivity and quantized thermal Hall conductivity, which could be used as experimental probes to detect LLs in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Kondo Coherence and Localized Magnetic Moments in the Normal State of Molten Salt-Flux Grown UTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of Kondo lattice coherence in UTe2 leads to the formation of a heavy Fermi liquid state from which superconductivity emerges at lower temperature. In Kondo lattice systems, the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and muon Knight shift have proven to be particularly sensitive to the properties of the developing heavy-electron fluid. Here we report muon Knight shift measurements on high-quality UTe2 single crystals grown by a molten salt-flux method. Together with previous data from a single crystal grown by a chemical-vapor transport method, our results show the contribution of the heavy-electron liquid to the muon Knight shift increases below a crossover temperature T* ~ 30 K in accord with a universal scaling function of T/T* for heavy-fermion materials. An observed departure from this universal scaling below a temperature T ~ 12 K at certain muon stopping sites signifies a reversal of the Kondo hybridization and a relocalization of U 5f moments with an antiferromagnetic coupling. The preservation of universal scaling at a different muon site demonstrates a coexistence of itinerant and localized 5f electron states preceding the superconducting phase transition.</description>

      <title>Using Principal Component Analysis to Distinguish Different Dynamic Phases in Superconducting Vortex Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortices in type-II superconductors driven over random disorder are known to exhibit a remarkable variety of distinct nonequilibrium dynamical phases that arise due to the competition between vortex-vortex interactions, the quenched disorder, and the drive. These include pinned states, elastic flows, plastic or disordered flows, and dynamically reordered moving crystal or moving smectic states. The plastic flow phases can be particularly difficult to characterize since the flows are strongly disordered. Here we perform principal component analysis (PCA) on the positions and velocities of vortex matter moving over random disorder for different disorder strengths and drives. We find that PCA can distinguish the known dynamic phases as well as or better than previous measures based on transport signatures or topological defect densities. In addition, PCA recognizes distinct plastic flow regimes, a slowly changing channel flow and a moving amorphous fluid flow, that do not produce distinct signatures in the standard measurements. Our results suggest that this position and velocity based PCA approach could be used to characterize dynamic phases in a broader class of systems that exhibit depinning and nonequilibrium phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Model for the commensurate charge-density waves in under-hole-doped cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple model of the commensurate charge-density wave (CCDW) portion of the underdoped pseudogap regions of monolayer Bi$_2$Sr$_{2-x}$La$_x$CuO$_{6-x}$ (Bi2201), bilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Bi2212), and trilayer Bi$_2$Sr$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{10+\delta}$ (Bi2223) cuprate superconductors is presented and studied. Above the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ but below the pseudogap transition temperature $T_p &gt; T_c$, the CCDW forms on the oxygen sites in the CuO$_2$ layers with excess charges of $\pm\delta e$, where $e$ is the electronic charge, forming on alternating oxygen sites. This model is equivalent to $N$-layer versions of the two-dimensional Ising model for spins on a square lattice with repulsive interactions $J' , J&gt;0$ between near-neighbor inter- and intralayer sites, respectively. For strong coupling, we show analytically for sections of $L\times M\times N$ sites that the partition function in the $J'\rightarrow\pm \infty$ limits reduces to that for an effective single layer with $L\times M$ sites and $J$ replaced by $NJ$. The CCDW is therefore strongly enhanced and stabilized by multilayer structures, likely accounting for the enhanced THz emission observed from the intrinsic Josephson junctions in underdoped Bi2212 mesas and for the many experiments on Bi2212 and related compounds purporting to provide evidence for a superconducting order parameter with $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave symmetry.</description>

      <title>Signature of superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10-x single crystals grown at ambient pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nickelates have attracted enormous attention since the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 under high pressure. However, whether superconducting nickelate single crystals can be prepared at ambient pressure remains elusive. Here we report signature of superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10-x single crystals grown from potassium carbonate flux at ambient pressure. Single crystal X-ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy investigations re-vealed high-quality single crystals with perfect stacking of trilayers. Resistivity measurements indicate that the metal-to-metal transition observed at ambient pressure was suppressed under high pressure, and a sharp drop occurred at ~30 K at 77.9 GPa, consistent with superconductivity in pressurized La4Ni3O10 single crystals grown by the floating zone method at an oxygen pressure of &gt;18 bar. Our results not only provide an important path to prepare high-quality nickelate single crystals but also support superconductivity in nickelates under high pressure, promoting more systematic and in-depth research in this compelling field.</description>

      <title>Highly Uniform Magnetic and Electronic Environment in Non-Centrosymmetric Superconductor LaRhGe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of $^{139}$La NMR measurements in the non-centrosymmetric superconductor LaRhGe$_3$. This material crystallizes in a tetragonal structure without inversion symmetry and exhibits type-I superconductivity below 385 mK. We observed remarkably sharp NMR signals, indicating that the magnetic and electronic properties of the sample are extremely uniform in LaRhGe$_3$ despite the complex crystal structure. Our NMR results indicate that LaRhGe$_3$ is a weakly correlated semimetal in the normal state.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant electromagnetic responses in superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gauge invariance is of fundamental importance to make physically meaningful predictions. In superconductors, the use of mean-field Hamiltonians that lack $U(1)$ symmetry often leads to gauge-dependent results. While solutions to this problem for the linear response of conventional superconductors have been well-known, a unified understanding for unconventional superconductors or nonlinear responses has not been established. This study provides the full detail of the general theoretical framework that allows us to compute responses at arbitrary orders in external fields in a gauge-invariant manner for both conventional and unconventional superconductors. Our construction generalizes the consistent fluctuations of order parameters method for full photon vertices and has a pictorial illustration using Feynman diagrams of the response kernel.</description>

      <title>Ab initio modeling of single-photon detection in superconducting nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a kinetic equation approach and Density Functional Theory, we model the nonequilibrium quasiparticle and phonon dynamics of a thin superconducting film under optical irradiation ab initio. We extend this model to develop a theory for the detection of single photons in superconducting nanowires. In doing so, we create a framework for exploring new superconducting materials for enhanced device performance beyond the state-of-the-art. Though we focus in this study on superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, these methods are general, and they can be extended to model other superconducting devices, including transition-edge sensors, microwave resonators, and superconducting qubits. Our methods effectively integrate ab initio materials modeling with models of nonequilibrium superconductivity to perform practical modeling of superconducting devices, providing a comprehensive approach that connects fundamental theory with device-level applications.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Casimir force between superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Casimir force follows from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and yields a nonlinear attractive force between closely spaced conductive objects. Its magnitude depends on the conductivity of the objects up to optical frequencies. Measuring the Casimir force in superconductors should allow to isolate frequency-specific contributions to the Casimir effect, as frequencies below the superconducting gap energy are expected to contribute differently than those above it. There is significant interest in this contribution as it is suspected to contribute to an unexplained discrepancy between predictions and measurements of the Casimir force, which questions the basic principles on which estimates of the magnitude are based. Here, we observe the Casimir force between superconducting objects for the first time, through the nonlinear dynamics it imparts to a superconducting drum resonator in a microwave optomechanical system. There is excellent agreement between the experiment and the Casimir force magnitude computed for this device across three orders of magnitude of displacement. Furthermore, the Casimir nonlinearity is intense enough that, with a modified design, this device type should operate in the single-phonon nonlinear regime. Accessing this regime has been a long-standing goal that would greatly facilitate quantum operations of mechanical resonators.</description>

      <title>Crossed Andreev reflection in collinear $p$-wave magnet-triplet superconductor junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) is a fundamental quantum transport phenomenon with significant implications for spintronics and superconducting devices. However, its experimental detection and enhancement remain challenging. In this work, we propose a junction comprising $p$-wave magnets and a triplet superconductor as a promising platform to enhance CAR. The setup features a triplet superconductor sandwiched between two collinear $p$-wave magnets, rotated by $180^\circ$ relative to one another, enabling precise control of transport processes. We show that CAR can dominate over electron tunneling (ET) for specific parameter regimes, such as the orientation angle of the $p$-wave magnets and the chemical potential. Enhanced CAR is achieved when the constant energy contours of the two spins in the $p$-wave magnets are well-separated. Additionally, the conductivities exhibit Fabry-P\'erot-type oscillations due to interference effects, with CAR diminishing as the superconductor length exceeds the decay length of the wavefunctions. These findings highlight the potential of collinear $p$-wave magnet-superconductor junctions as a robust platform for the experimental study and enhancement of CAR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study theoretically Meissner effect in non-Hermitian systems of BCS type via superfluid stiffness. We show that depending on the values of the mean fields, chemical potential, and temperature, we obtain paramagnetic or diamagnetic Meissner effect. Notably, positive real part of the product of mean fields guarantees diamagnetic Meissner effect in an $s$-wave 3D non-Hermitian superconductor. Once the mean fields are close to being anti-Hermitian, 2D $s$-, $p_x$-, and $d$-wave superconductors exhibit interesting behaviour, including paramagnetic Meissner effect for certain parameters.</description>

      <title>Tuning the structure and superconductivity of SrNi$_2$P$_2$ by Rh substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SrNi$_2$P$_2$ is unique among the ThCr$_2$Si$_2$ class since it exhibits a temperature induced transition upon cooling from an uncollapsed tetragonal (ucT) state to a one-third-collapsed orthorhombic (tcO) state where one out of every three P-rows bond across the Sr layers. This compound is also known for exhibiting bulk superconductivity below 1.4 K at ambient pressure. In this work, we report on the effects of Rh substitution in Sr(Ni$_{1-x}$Rh$_x$)$_2$P$_2$ on the structural and superconducting properties. We studied the variation of the nearest P-P distances as a function of the Rh fraction at room temperature, as well as its temperature dependence for selected compositions. We find that increasing the Rh fraction leads to a decrease in the transition temperature between the ucT and tcO states, until a full suppression of the tcO state for $x\geq 0.166$. The superconducting transition first remains nearly insensitive to the Rh fraction, and then it increases to 2.3 K after the tcO state is fully suppressed. These results are summarized in a phase diagram, built upon the characterization by energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, resistance, magnetization and specific heat measurements done on crystalline samples with varying Rh content. The relationship between band structure, crystal structure and superconductivity is discussed based on previously reported band structure calculations on SrRh$_2$P$_2$. Moreover, the effect of Rh fraction on the stress-induced structural transitions is also addressed by means of strain-stress studies done by uniaxial compression of single-crystalline micropillars of Sr(Ni$_{1-x}$Rh$_x$)$_2$P$_2$.</description>

      <title>Topological chiral superconductivity beyond pairing in a Fermi liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18067v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a mechanism to produce superconductivity by strong purely repulsive interactions for flat dispersion $\varepsilon \sim k^4$, without using pairing instability in Fermi-liquid. The resulting superconductors break both time-reversal and reflection symmetries in the orbital motion of electrons, and exhibit non-trivial topological order. Our findings suggest that this topological chiral superconductivity is more likely to emerge near or between fully spin-valley polarized metallic phase and Wigner crystal phase. These topological chiral superconductors can be fully or partially spin-valley polarized. For partial spin-valley polarization, the ratios of electron densities associated with different spin-valley quantum numbers are quantized as simple rational numbers. Furthermore, many of these topological chiral superconductors exhibit charge-4 or higher condensation, neutral quasiparticles with fractional statistics, and/or gapless chiral edge states. Two of the topological chiral superconductors are in the same phases as the ``spin''-triplet or spinless $p+ \textrm{i} p$ BCS superconductor, while others are in different phases than any BCS superconductors. The same mechanism is also used to produce anyon superconductivity between fractional anomalous quantum Hall states in the presence of a periodic potential.</description>
