      <title>Optimization of resources for digital radio transmission over IBOC FM through max-min fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equitable distribution of resources in a network is a complex process, considering that not all nodes have the same requirements, and the In-Band On-Channel (IBOC) hybrid transmission system is no exception. The IBOC system utilizes a hybrid in-band transmission to simultaneously broadcast analog and digital audio over the FM band. This article proposes the use of a Max-Min Fairness (MMF) algorithm, with a strategy to optimize resource allocation for IBOC FM transmission in a multiservice scenario. Additionally, the MMF algorithm offers low computational complexity for implementation in low-cost embedded systems, aiming to achieve fair resource distribution and provide adequate Quality of Service (QoS) levels for each node in the RF network, considering channel conditions and traffic types. The article explores a scenario under saturated traffic conditions to assess the optimization capabilities of the MMF algorithm under well-defined traffic and channel conditions. The evaluation process yielded highly favorable results, indicating that theMMF algorithm can be considered a viable alternative for bandwidth optimization in digital broadcasting over IBOC on FM with 95% confidence, and it holds potential for implementation in other digital broadcasting system.</description>

      <title>The ESPRIT algorithm under high noise: Optimal error scaling and noisy super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subspace-based signal processing techniques, such as the Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariant Techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm, are popular methods for spectral estimation. These algorithms can achieve the so-called super-resolution scaling under low noise conditions, surpassing the well-known Nyquist limit. However, the performance of these algorithms under high-noise conditions is not as well understood. Existing state-of-the-art analysis indicates that ESPRIT and related algorithms can be resilient even for signals where each observation is corrupted by statistically independent, mean-zero noise of size $\mathcal{O}(1)$, but these analyses only show that the error $\epsilon$ decays at a slow rate $\epsilon=\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(n^{-1/2})$ with respect to the cutoff frequency $n$. In this work, we prove that under certain assumptions of bias and high noise, the ESPRIT algorithm can attain a significantly improved error scaling $\epsilon = \mathcal{\tilde{O}}(n^{-3/2})$, exhibiting noisy super-resolution scaling beyond the Nyquist limit. We further establish a theoretical lower bound and show that this scaling is optimal. Our analysis introduces novel matrix perturbation results, which could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Next Generation Multiple Access for IMT Towards 2030 and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple access techniques are fundamental to the design of wireless communication systems, since many crucial components of such systems depend on the choice of the multiple access technique. Because of the importance of multiple access, there has been an ongoing quest during the past decade to develop next generation multiple access (NGMA). Among those potential candidates for NGMA, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has received significant attention from both the industrial and academic research communities, and has been highlighted in the recently published International Mobile Telecommunications (IMT)-2030 Framework. However, there is still no consensus in the research community about how exactly NOMA assisted NGMA should be designed. This perspective is to outline three important features of NOMA assisted NGMA, namely multi-domain utilization, multi-mode compatibility, and multi-dimensional optimality, where important directions for future research into the design of NOMA assisted NGMA are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Aided Cooperative Localization under Dense Urban Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless network technology provides automobiles with the connectivity feature to consolidate the concept of vehicular networks that collaborate on conducting cooperative driving tasks. The full potential of connected vehicles, which promises road safety and quality driving experience, can be leveraged if machine learning models guarantee the robustness in performing core functions including localization and controls. Location awareness, in particular, lends itself to the deployment of location-specific services and the improvement of the operation performance. The localization entails direct communication to the network infrastructure, and the resulting centralized positioning solutions readily become intractable as the network scales up. As an alternative to the centralized solutions, this article addresses decentralized principle of vehicular localization reinforced by machine learning techniques in dense urban environments with frequent inaccessibility to reliable measurement. As such, the collaboration of multiple vehicles enhances the positioning performance of machine learning approaches. A virtual testbed is developed to validate this machine learning model for real-map vehicular networks. Numerical results demonstrate universal feasibility of cooperative localization, in particular, for dense urban area configurations.</description>

      <title>Random Walk in Random Permutation Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random walk is an explainable approach for modeling natural processes at the molecular level. The Random Permutation Set Theory (RPST) serves as a framework for uncertainty reasoning, extending the applicability of Dempster-Shafer Theory. Recent explorations indicate a promising link between RPST and random walk. In this study, we conduct an analysis and construct a random walk model based on the properties of RPST, with Monte Carlo simulations of such random walk. Our findings reveal that the random walk generated through RPST exhibits characteristics similar to those of a Gaussian random walk and can be transformed into a Wiener process through a specific limiting scaling procedure. This investigation establishes a novel connection between RPST and random walk theory, thereby not only expanding the applicability of RPST, but also demonstrating the potential for combining the strengths of both approaches to improve problem-solving abilities.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS for Integration of Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zak-OTFS input/output (I/O) relation is predictable and non-fading when the delay and Doppler periods are greater than the effective channel delay and Doppler spreads, a condition which we refer to as the crystallization condition. The filter taps can simply be read off from the response to a single Zak-OTFS point (impulse) pulsone waveform, and the I/O relation can be reconstructed for a sampled system that operates under finite duration and bandwidth constraints. Predictability opens up the possibility of a model-free mode of operation. The time-domain realization of a Zak-OTFS point pulsone is a pulse train modulated by a tone, hence the name, pulsone. The Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of a pulsone is about $15$ dB, and we describe a general method for constructing a spread pulsone for which the time-domain realization has a PAPR of about 6dB. We construct the spread pulsone by applying a type of discrete spreading filter to a Zak-OTFS point pulsone. The self-ambiguity function of the point pulsone is supported on the period lattice ${\Lambda}_{p}$, and by applying a discrete chirp filter, we obtain a spread pulsone with a self-ambiguity function that is supported on a rotated lattice ${\Lambda^*}$. We show that if the channel satisfies the crystallization conditions with respect to ${\Lambda^*}$ then the effective DD domain filter taps can simply be read off from the cross-ambiguity between the channel response to the spread pulsone and the transmitted spread pulsone. If, in addition, the channel satisfies the crystallization conditions with respect to the period lattice ${\Lambda}_{p}$, then in an OTFS frame consisting of a spread pilot pulsone and point data pulsones, after cancelling the received signal corresponding to the spread pulsone, we can recover the channel response to any data pulsone.</description>

      <title>Unifying Privacy Measures via Maximal $(\alpha,\beta)$-Leakage (M$\alpha$beL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a family of information leakage measures called maximal $(\alpha,\beta)$-leakage (M$\alpha$beL), parameterized by real numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$ greater than or equal to 1. The measure is formalized via an operational definition involving an adversary guessing an unknown (randomized) function of the data given the released data. We obtain a simplified computable expression for the measure and show that it satisfies several basic properties such as monotonicity in $\beta$ for a fixed $\alpha$, non-negativity, data processing inequalities, and additivity over independent releases. We highlight the relevance of this family by showing that it bridges several known leakage measures, including maximal $\alpha$-leakage $(\beta=1)$, maximal leakage $(\alpha=\infty,\beta=1)$, local differential privacy (LDP) $(\alpha=\infty,\beta=\infty)$, and local Renyi differential privacy (LRDP) $(\alpha=\beta)$, thereby giving an operational interpretation to local Renyi differential privacy. We also study a conditional version of M$\alpha$beL on leveraging which we recover differential privacy and Renyi differential privacy. A new variant of LRDP, which we call maximal Renyi leakage, appears as a special case of M$\alpha$beL for $\alpha=\infty$ that smoothly tunes between maximal leakage ($\beta=1$) and LDP ($\beta=\infty$). Finally, we show that a vector form of the maximal Renyi leakage relaxes differential privacy under Gaussian and Laplacian mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Nonadaptive Noise-Resilient Group Testing with Order-Optimal Tests and Fast-and-Reliable Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Group testing (GT) is the Boolean version of spare signal recovery and, due to its simplicity, a marketplace for ideas that can be brought to bear upon related problems, such as heavy hitters, compressed sensing, and multiple access channels. The definition of a "good" GT varies from one buyer to another, but it generally includes (i) usage of nonadaptive tests, (ii) limiting to $O(k \log n)$ tests, (iii) resiliency to test noise, (iv) $O(k \mathrm{poly}(\log n))$ decoding time, and (v) lack of mistakes. In this paper, we propose $Gacha~GT$. Gacha is an elementary and self-contained, versatile and unified scheme that, for the first time, satisfies all criteria for a fairly large region of parameters, namely when $\log k &lt; \log(n)^{1-1/O(1)}$. Outside this parameter region, Gacha can be specialized to outperform the state-of-the-art partial-recovery GTs, exact-recovery GTs, and worst-case GTs.
  The new idea Gacha brings to the market is a redesigned Reed--Solomon code for probabilistic list-decoding at diminishing code rates over reasonably-large alphabets. Normally, list-decoding a vanilla Reed--Solomon code is equivalent to the nontrivial task of identifying the subsets of points that fit low-degree polynomials. In this paper, we explicitly tell the decoder which points belong to the same polynomial, thus reducing the complexity and enabling the improvement on GT.</description>

      <title>Generalized Rainbow Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a new framework for designing differentially private (DP) mechanisms via randomized graph colorings, called rainbow differential privacy. In this framework, datasets are nodes in a graph, and two neighboring datasets are connected by an edge. Each dataset in the graph has a preferential ordering for the possible outputs of the mechanism, and these orderings are called rainbows. Different rainbows partition the graph of connected datasets into different regions. We show that if a DP mechanism at the boundary of such regions is fixed and it behaves identically for all same-rainbow boundary datasets, then a unique optimal $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP mechanism exists (as long as the boundary condition is valid) and can be expressed in closed-form. Our proof technique is based on an interesting relationship between dominance ordering and DP, which applies to any finite number of colors and for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP, improving upon previous results that only apply to at most three colors and for $\epsilon$-DP. We justify the homogeneous boundary condition assumption by giving an example with non-homogeneous boundary condition, for which there exists no optimal DP mechanism.</description>

      <title>On the Maximum Theta Series over Unimodular Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theta series of a lattice has been extensively studied in the literature and is closely related to a critical quantity widely used in the fields of physical layer security and cryptography, known as the flatness factor, or equivalently, the smoothing parameter of a lattice. Both fields raise the fundamental question of determining the (globally) maximum theta series over a particular set of volume-one lattices, namely, the stable lattices. In this work, we present a property of unimodular lattices, a subfamily of stable lattices, to verify that the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$ achieves the largest possible value of theta series over the set of unimodular lattices. Such a result moves towards proving a conjecture recently stated by Regev and Stephens-Davidowitz: any unimodular lattice, except for those lattices isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$, has a strictly smaller theta series than that of $\mathbb{Z}^{n}$. Our techniques are mainly based on studying the ratio of the theta series of a unimodular lattice to the theta series of $\mathbb{Z}^n$, called the secrecy ratio. We relate the Regev and Stephens-Davidowitz conjecture with another conjecture for unimodular lattices, known in the literature as the Belfiore-Sol\'e conjecture. The latter assumes that the secrecy ratio of any unimodular lattice has a symmetry point, which is exactly where the global minimum of the secrecy ratio is achieved.</description>
