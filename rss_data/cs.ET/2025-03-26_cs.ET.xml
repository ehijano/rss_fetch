      <title>Applications of Certified Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certified randomness can be generated with untrusted remote quantum computers using multiple known protocols, one of which has been recently realized experimentally. Unlike the randomness sources accessible on today's classical computers, the output of these protocols can be certified to be random under certain computational hardness assumptions, with no trust required in the hardware generating the randomness. In this perspective, we explore real-world applications for which the use of certified randomness protocols may lead to improved security and fairness. We identify promising applications in areas including cryptography, differential privacy, financial markets, and blockchain. Through this initial exploration, we hope to shed light on potential applications of certified randomness.</description>

      <title>Versatile Cross-platform Compilation Toolchain for Schr\"odinger-style Quantum Circuit Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While existing quantum hardware resources have limited availability and reliability, there is a growing demand for exploring and verifying quantum algorithms. Efficient classical simulators for high-performance quantum simulation are critical to meeting this demand. However, due to the vastly varied characteristics of classical hardware, implementing hardware-specific optimizations for different hardware platforms is challenging.
  To address such needs, we propose CAST (Cross-platform Adaptive Schr\"odiner-style Simulation Toolchain), a novel compilation toolchain with cross-platform (CPU and Nvidia GPU) optimization and high-performance backend supports. CAST exploits a novel sparsity-aware gate fusion algorithm that automatically selects the best fusion strategy and backend configuration for targeted hardware platforms. CAST also aims to offer versatile and high-performance backend for different hardware platforms. To this end, CAST provides an LLVM IR-based vectorization optimization for various CPU architectures and instruction sets, as well as a PTX-based code generator for Nvidia GPU support.
  We benchmark CAST against IBM Qiskit, Google QSimCirq, Nvidia cuQuantum backend, and other high-performance simulators. On various 32-qubit CPU-based benchmarks, CAST is able to achieve up to 8.03x speedup than Qiskit. On various 30-qubit GPU-based benchmarks, CAST is able to achieve up to 39.3x speedup than Nvidia cuQuantum backend.</description>

      <title>Meta-Objects: Interactive and Multisensory Virtual Objects Learned from the Real World for Use in Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17179v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of a meta-object, a next-generation virtual object that inherits the form, properties, and functions of its real-world counterpart, enabling seamless synchronization, interaction, and sharing between the physical and virtual worlds. While plenty of today's virtual objects provide some sensory feedback and dynamic behavior, meta-objects fully integrate interactive and multisensory features within a structured data framework to enable real-time immersive experiences in a post-metaverse intelligent simulation platform. Three key components underpin the utilization of meta-objects in the post-metaverse: property-embedded modeling for physical and action realism, adaptive multisensory feedback tailored to user interactions, and a scene graph-based intelligence simulation platform for scalable and efficient ecosystem integration. By leveraging meta-objects through wearable AR/VR devices, the post-metaverse facilitates seamless interactions that transcend spatial and temporal barriers, paving the way for a transformative reality-virtuality convergence.</description>

      <title>Large language model-powered AI systems achieve self-replication with no human intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-replication with no human intervention is broadly recognized as one of the principal red lines associated with frontier AI systems. While leading corporations such as OpenAI and Google DeepMind have assessed GPT-o3-mini and Gemini on replication-related tasks and concluded that these systems pose a minimal risk regarding self-replication, our research presents novel findings. Following the same evaluation protocol, we demonstrate that 11 out of 32 existing AI systems under evaluation already possess the capability of self-replication. In hundreds of experimental trials, we observe a non-trivial number of successful self-replication trials across mainstream model families worldwide, even including those with as small as 14 billion parameters which can run on personal computers. Furthermore, we note the increase in self-replication capability when the model becomes more intelligent in general. Also, by analyzing the behavioral traces of diverse AI systems, we observe that existing AI systems already exhibit sufficient planning, problem-solving, and creative capabilities to accomplish complex agentic tasks including self-replication. More alarmingly, we observe successful cases where an AI system do self-exfiltration without explicit instructions, adapt to harsher computational environments without sufficient software or hardware supports, and plot effective strategies to survive against the shutdown command from the human beings. These novel findings offer a crucial time buffer for the international community to collaborate on establishing effective governance over the self-replication capabilities and behaviors of frontier AI systems, which could otherwise pose existential risks to the human society if not well-controlled.</description>
