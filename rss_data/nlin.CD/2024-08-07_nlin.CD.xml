      <title>Fock-space delocalization and the emergence of the Porter-Thomas distribution from dual-unitary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chaotic dynamics of quantum many-body systems are expected to quickly randomize any structured initial state, delocalizing it in Fock space. In this work, we study the spreading of an initial product state in Hilbert space under dual-unitary dynamics, captured by the inverse participation ratios and the distribution of overlaps (bit-string probabilities). We consider the self-dual kicked Ising model, a minimal model of many-body quantum chaos which can be seen as either a periodically driven Floquet model or a dual-unitary quantum circuit. Both analytically and numerically, we show that the inverse participation ratios rapidly approach their ergodic values, corresponding to those of Haar random states, and establish the emergence of the Porter-Thomas distribution for the overlap distribution. Importantly, this convergence happens exponentially fast in time, with a time scale that is independent of system size. We inspect the effect of local perturbations that break dual-unitarity and show a slowdown of the spreading in Fock space, indicating that dual-unitary circuits are maximally efficient at preparing random states.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Review on Cislunar Expansion and Space Domain Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cislunar region is crucial for expanding human presence in space in the forthcoming decades. This paper presents a comprehensive review of recent and anticipated Earth-Moon missions, and ongoing space domain awareness initiatives. An introduction to the dynamics as well as periodic trajectories in the Cislunar realm is presented. Then, a review of modern Cislunar programs as well as smaller missions are compiled to provide insights into the key players pushing towards the Moon. Trends of Cislunar missions and practices are identified, including the identification of regions of interest, such as the South Pole and the Near-rectilinear halo orbit. Finally, a review of the current state and short-comings of space domain awareness (SDA) in the region is included, utilizing the regions of interest as focal points for required improvement. The SDA review is completed through the analysis of the Artemis 1 trajectory.</description>

      <title>Ghost channels and ghost cycles guiding long transients in dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical descriptions and modeling of natural systems have generally focused on fixed points, with saddles and saddle-based phase-space objects such as heteroclinic channels/cycles being central concepts behind the emergence of quasi-stable long transients. Reliable and robust transient dynamics observed for real, inherently noisy systems is, however, not met by saddle-based dynamics, as demonstrated here. Generalizing the notion of ghost states, we provide a complementary framework that does not rely on the precise knowledge or existence of (un)stable fixed points, but rather on slow directed flows organized by ghost sets in ghost channels and ghost cycles. Moreover, we show that appearance of these novel objects is an emergent property of a broad class of models, typically used for description of natural systems.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Low-Rank Input-Output Operator for Forced Linearized Dynamics with Unsteady Base Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00790v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the linear growth of disturbances due to external forcing is crucial for flow stability analysis, flow control, and uncertainty quantification. These applications typically require a large number of forward simulations of the forced linearized dynamics, often in a brute-force fashion. When dealing with simple steady-state or periodic base flows, there exist powerful and cost-effective solution operator techniques. Once these solution operators are constructed, they can be used to determine the response to various forcings with negligible computational cost. However, these methods do not apply to problems with arbitrarily time-dependent base flows. This paper develops and investigates reduced-order modeling with time-dependent bases (TDBs) to build low-rank solution operators for forced linearized dynamics with arbitrarily time-dependent base flows. In particular, we use forced optimally time-dependent decomposition (f-OTD), which extracts the time-dependent correlated structures of the flow response to various excitations. Several demonstrations are included to illustrate the utility of the f-OTD low-rank approximation for performing global transient stability analysis. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of f-OTD in computing the post-transient response of linearized Navier-Stokes equations to a large number of impulses, which has applications in flow control.</description>
