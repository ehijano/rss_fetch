      <title>Universal Magnetocaloric Effect near Quantum Critical Point of Magnon Bose-Einstein Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), a macroscopic quantum phenomenon arising from phase coherence and bosonic statistics, has been realized in quantum magnets. Here, we report the observation of a universal magnetocaloric effect (MCE) near a BEC quantum critical point (QCP) in copper sulfate crystal ($CuSO_4 \cdot 5H_2O$). By conducting magnetocaloric and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, we uncover a field-driven BEC QCP, evidenced by the universal scaling law $T_c \propto (B_c - B)^{2/3}$ and the perfect data collapse of the magnetic Gr\"uneisen ratio. Thermal excitation triggers a dimensional crossover to a 1D quantum-critical regime, where the MCE scaling strictly matches the universality class of 1D Fermi gases. Notably, the quantum-critical MCE enables cooling down to 12.8 mK without helium-3, with very fast thermal relaxation rate that is critical for high cooling power. This work demonstrates the universal MCE in magnon BEC systems, using a common copper sulfate compound as a paradigmatic example, and paves the way for next-generation sub-Kelvin cooling.</description>

      <title>Isolated spin ladders in Ln$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ (Ln:La-Nd) metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present the discovery and characterization of a series of antimonides Ln$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ (Ln: La--Nd) which exhibit well-isolated, $n=2$ rare-earth spin ladders. We discuss the structure of the new compounds, with a particular focus on the magnetic Ln spin ladders. Nd$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ and Ce$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ exhibit antiferromagnetic interactions and a well-defined doublet ground state, whereas Pr$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ exhibits a weakly magnetic singlet ground state. Nd$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ is a poor metal with an electrical resistivity of 0.1m$\Omega$-cm at 300K and weak temperature dependence. The thermal conductivity along the ladder exhibits significant field dependence even at 40K, considerably higher than the magnetic ordering temperature of 1.1K. Compared to compounds with transition metal spin ladders, the rare-earth elements impart much lower energy scales, making these compounds highly tunable with external stimuli like magnetic fields. The diverse magnetism of the rare-earth ions and RKKY interactions further contribute to the potential for a wide array of rich magnetic ground states, positioning these materials as a rare example of an inorganic square spin-ladder platform.</description>

      <title>Photodynamic melting of phase-reversed charge stripes and enhanced condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between charge stripes and pairing is a longstanding point of scrutiny in a broad class of unconventional superconductors since, in some cases, it is unclear whether their intertwining benefits the ensuing superfluidity. Experiments that explore the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of these systems try to tip the balance in favor of one phase or the other by selective coupling to relevant modes. Leveraging the fact that competition between stripes and pairing is not exclusive to fermionic systems, we explore the photoirradiation dynamics of interacting hardcore bosons, in which density wave phase-reversal melting gives rise to enhanced superfluid properties, quantified by the dynamic amplification of zero-momentum occupancy and charge stiffness. Our results, obtained using unbiased methods for an interacting system on a ladder geometry, demonstrate how one can engineer time-dependent perturbations to release suppressed orders, potentially providing insight into the underlying mechanism in related experiments.</description>

      <title>Magic Entropy in Hybrid Spin-Boson Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce entropic measures to quantify non-classical resource in hybrid spin-boson systems. We discuss the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy in the framework of phase space quantisation and define an analogous hybrid magic entropy and a mutual magic entropy that capture the distribution of quantum magic across spin and bosonic subsystems. We use these entropic measures to demonstrate two key phenomena: the detection of the superradiant phase transition in the Dicke model and the dynamics of magic in the Jaynes-Cummings model following a quench. We develop a Monte Carlo numerical scheme to enable practical computation in many-body examples.</description>

      <title>Multiorbital character of the density wave instability in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates exhibit high-temperature superconductivity closely intertwined with charge and spin density wave order. However, fundamental questions persist regarding the interplay between the associated density wave (DW) fluctuations and superconductivity, as well as the orbital character and symmetry underlying the DW instabilities. Here we utilize polarized Raman scattering to investigate the phononic and electronic Raman responses of the trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ across its concomitant charge and spin density wave transitions. In addition to distinct phonon anomalies occurring below the transition temperature, we observe a depletion of continuum spectral weight up to 114 meV and a pronounced peak centered at this energy. By combining momentum-selective information from polarized electronic Raman scattering with model calculations involving both Ni-3$d_{x^2 - y^2}$ and Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals, we identify 114 meV as the energy scale $2\Delta_\mathrm{DW}$ of the DW gap, characterized by incoherent opening and non-mean-field behavior. Furthermore, the model calculations reveal that the corresponding $2\Delta_\mathrm{DW}$ peak exhibits a multiorbital origin, thus shedding light on the nature of the DW instabilities in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$.</description>

      <title>Role of Plaquette Term in Genuine $2+1$D String Dynamics on Quantum Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of quantum simulators of $2+1$D lattice gauge theories (LGTs), a fundamental open question is under what circumstances the observed physics is genuinely $2+1$D rather than effectively $1+1$D. Here, we address this question in the ongoing strong effort to quantum-simulate string dynamics in $2+1$D LGTs on state-of-the-art quantum hardware. Through tensor network simulations and analytic derivations, we show that the plaquette term, which represents a magnetic field and only emerges in $d&gt;1$ spatial dimensions, plays a crucial role in \textit{genuine} $2+1$D string dynamics deep in the confined regime. In its absence and for minimal-length (Manhattan-distance) strings, we demonstrate how string breaking, although on a lattice in $d=2$ spatial dimensions, can be effectively mapped to a $1+1$D dynamical process independently of lattice geometry. Our findings not only answer the question of what qualifies as genuine $2+1$D string dynamics, but also serve as a clear guide for future quantum simulation experiments of $2+1$D LGTs.</description>

      <title>Quantum criticality and nonequilibrium dynamics on a Lieb lattice of Rydberg atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum simulators offer a promising approach to the exploration of strongly interacting many-body systems, with applications spanning condensed matter, statistical mechanics, and high-energy physics. Through a combination of quantum experiments, numerical calculations, and analytical methods, we demonstrate a rich set of phenomena accessible on such quantum simulators by studying an array of Rydberg atoms placed on the Lieb lattice. First, we map out the ground states and phase diagram of the system, identifying a range of density-wave-ordered phases,and find excellent agreement between theory and experiment. Allowing for local control of the detuning field thereafter, we discover a quantum analog of the classical liquid--vapor transition and probe its underlying hysteretic dynamics. Furthermore, we study out-of-equilibrium quantum quenches and observe anomalously slow relaxation dynamics arising from kinetic constraints. These results highlight how geometric control offered by neutral-atom simulators can extend the frontiers of programmable quantum matter, enabling access to complex phases, metastability, and thermalization dynamics in many-body quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A quantum computing approach to efficiently simulating correlated materials using impurity models and dynamical mean field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated electrons is a formidable challenge, at the forefront of condensed matter physics and computational chemistry alike, and it is one of the targets for quantum computing. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some correlated behavior, but it is limited by the need to calculate the Green's function for the impurity model. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum circuit that joins the Gaussian state preparation with the time evolution to compute the necessary Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability of the circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 physical qubits and 1 ancilla). We discuss the potential paths forward towards realizing this use case of quantum computing in materials science.</description>

      <title>Observing Differential Spin Currents by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling spin currents, i.e., the flow of spin angular momentum, in small magnetic devices is the principal objective of spin electronics, a main contender for future energy efficient information technologies. Surprisingly, a pure spin current has never been measured directly since the associated electric stray fields and/or shifts in the non-equilibrium spin-dependent distribution functions are too small for conventional experimental detection methods optimized for charge transport. Here we report that resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) can bridge this gap by measuring the spin current carried by magnons -- the quanta of the spin wave excitations of the magnetic order -- in the presence of temperature gradients across a magnetic insulator. This is possible due to the sensitivity of the momentum- and energy-resolved RIXS intensity to minute changes in the magnon distribution under non-equilibrium conditions. We use the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation to extract transport parameters, such as the magnon lifetime at finite momentum, essential for the realization of magnon spintronics.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Fluctuations of Critical Fermi Surfaces</title>

Abstract: Fluctuations of conserved quantities within a subsystem are non-local observables that provide unique insights into quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we study bipartite charge (and spin) fluctuations across interaction-driven ``metal-insulator transitions'' out of Landau Fermi liquids. The ``charge insulators'' include a class of non-Fermi-liquid states of fractionalized degrees of freedom, such as compressible composite Fermi liquids (for spinless electrons) and incompressible spin-liquid Mott insulators (for spin-$1/2$ electrons). We find that charge fluctuations $F$ exhibit distinct leading-order scalings across the transition: $F \sim L\log(L)$ in Landau Fermi liquids and $F \sim L$ in charge insulators, where $L$ is the linear size of the subsystem. In composite Fermi liquids, under certain conditions, we also identify a universal constant term $-f(\theta)|\sigma_{xy}|/(2\pi)$ when the subsystem geometry contains a sharp corner, where $f(\theta)$ denotes a function of the corner angle, and $\sigma_{xy}$ is the Hall conductivity. At the critical point, provided the transition is continuous, the leading scaling $F\sim L$ is accompanied by a subleading universal corner contribution $-\log(L)f(\theta)C_{\rho}/2$ with the same angle dependence $f(\theta)$, and the universal coefficient $C_{\rho}$ is directly related to the predicted universal jumps in longitudinal and Hall resistivities. These results establish fluctuation-transport relations, paving the way for numerical and experimental studies of unconventional quantum criticalities in metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have studied theoretically the specific heat of a large number of non-frustrated magnetic structures described by the Heisenberg model for systems with total angular momentum $J=7/2$, corresponding to the 4f$^7$ configuration of Gd$^{+3}$ and Eu$^{+2}$. For a given critical temperature (determined by the magnitude of the exchange interactions), we find that, to a high degree of accuracy, the specific heat is governed by two primary parameters: the effective number of neighbors, which dictates the extent of quantum fluctuations, and the axial anisotropy. Using these two parameters we fit the specific heat of four Gd compounds and two Eu compounds, achieving a remarkable agreement. Our work opens the possibility of describing the specific heat of 4f$^7$ systems within a general framework.</description>

      <title>Predicted versatile topological nodal magnons in Tb-based icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11286v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a recently-established band representation analysis, we discover two distinct types of topological nodal magnons in the real-space antiferroic ordering of whirling spin arrangements in the Tb-based icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants, both of which originate from a composite band (co-)representation $A\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(24)$ and its constituent elementary band representations. The first type is doubly-degenerate nodal line network and nodal planes associated with two-dimensional irreducible band representation, while the second type is a nodal line network due to accidental band inversions. Since our analysis, which relies solely on magnetocrystalline symmetry, is valid for a wide range of materials and spin textures belonging to the same magnetic space group irrespective of composition, these findings offer new universal insights into the research of Tb-based quasicrystal approximants as well as a contribution to broadening the range of topological magnon-hosting materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I present a theory of transport and optical response in quantum materials that is based on the assumption that the motion of the charge carriers obeys the correspondence principle, in the sense that the quantum-mechanically averaged carrier diffusion in time is analogous to the classical case. In bad metals, where wave-like coherence is lost at each hop between neighboring atoms, this leads to strange $T$-linear resistivities with apparently Planckian scattering rates as well as both the stretched Drude and displaced Drude peaks that are commonly observed in optical absorption experiments. The present framework might also indicate a solution to the problem of universal dielectric relaxation in insulators.</description>

      <title>Magic Boundaries of 3D Color Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05033v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate boundaries of 3D color codes and provide a systematic classification into 101 distinct boundary types, including two novel classes. The first class consists of 1 boundary and is generated by sweeping the codimension-1 (2D) $T$-domain wall across the system and attaching it to the $X$-boundary that condenses only magnetic fluxes. Since the $T$-domain wall cannot condense on the $X$-boundary, a new magic boundary is produced, where the boundary stabilizers contain $XS$-stabilizers going beyond the conventional Pauli stabilizer formalism, and hence contains 'magic'. Neither electric nor magnetic excitations can condense on such a magic boundary, and only the composite of the magnetic flux and codimension-2 (1D) $S$-domain wall can condense on it, which makes the magic boundary going beyond the classification of the Lagrangian subgroup. The second class consists of 70 boundaries and is generated by sweeping the $S$-domain wall across a codimension-1 submanifold and attaching it to the boundary. This generates a codimension-2 (1D) nested boundary at the intersection. We also connect these novel boundaries to their previously discovered counterpart in the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory, equivalent to three copies of 3D toric codes, where the $S$ and $T$ domain walls correspond to gauged symmetry-protected topological (SPT) defects. New boundaries are produced whenever the corresponding symmetry of the SPT defect remains unbroken on the boundary. Applications of the magic boundaries include implementing fault-tolerant non-Clifford logical gates, e.g., in the context of fractal topological codes.</description>

      <title>Explicit decoders using fixed-point amplitude amplification based on QSVT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06051v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliably transmitting quantum information via a noisy quantum channel is a central challenge in quantum information science. While constructing a decoder is crucial to this goal, little was known about quantum circuit implementations of decoders that reach high communication rates. In this paper, we provide two decoders with explicit quantum circuits capable of recovering quantum information when the decoupling condition is satisfied, i.e., when quantum information is in principle recoverable. These are applicable to both entanglement-assisted and non-assisted settings. By developing a technique that relies on a symmetric structure of the decoders, we show that they are applicable to any noise model. As a consequence, for any noisy channel, our decoders can be used to achieve a communication rate arbitrarily close to the quantum capacity by increasing the number of channel uses. To construct the decoders, we employ the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), extending a previous approach applicable only to erasure noise. Our constructions offer advantages in the computational cost, largely reducing the circuit complexity compared to previous explicit decoders. Through an investigation of the decoding problem, unique advantages of the QSVT-based FPAA are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Charge ordering and spontaneous topological Hall effect in bilayer skyrmion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmion crystals with zero net skyrmion charge and zero topological Hall response are interesting candidate phases which can occur at a vanishing magnetic field in centrosymmetric systems. We study a minimal bilayer model of skyrmion crystals having opposite chirality and topological charge in the two layers, and show that it can host nearly flat electronic bands with quasi-uniform Berry curvature and quantum metric. Using Hartree-Fock theory, we show that weak to moderate short-range electron interactions induce two distinct types of symmetry breaking patterns depending on the band dispersion: an intra-unit-cell charge density modulation from Chern band mixing or a layer-imbalanced phase with a nonzero ferroelectric polarization. Both phases break inversion symmetry leading to a spontaneous and large net topological Hall effect, with the phase diagram tunable by external electric fields. Our results may be relevant to centrosymmetric skyrmion materials such as Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ and Gd$_3$Ru$_4$Al$_{12}$ as well as artificially engineered heterostructures. We also discuss its relation to recent work on twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers.</description>

      <title>Viewing protected superconducting qubits through the lens of the cat qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We draw analogies between protected superconducting qubits and bosonic qubits by studying the fluxonium Hamiltonian in its Fock basis. The mean-field phase diagram of fluxonium (at the sweet spot) is identified, with a region in parameter space that is characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry-broken ground states. In the heavy fluxonium limit, these ground states are well approximated by squeezed coherent states in a Fock basis (corresponding to persistent current states with definite flux but indefinite charge), and simple expressions are provided for them in terms of the circuit parameters. We study the noise bias in fluxonium via a universal Lindblad master equation and find that the bit-flip rate is exponentially small in $E_j/(k_B T)$, while the phase-flip rate does not get worse with this ratio. Analogous behavior is found in $\cos(2 \theta)$ qubits. We describe cat-qubit-inspired bias-preserving $X$ and $CX$ gates for fluxonium. We discuss first steps towards generating an Ising interaction between protected superconducting qubits on a two-dimensional lattice, with the aim of achieving a passive quantum memory by coupling a static Hamiltonian to a generic thermal bath.</description>

      <title>Holographic central charge for sine dilaton gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the holographic central charge ($c_{sDG}$) associated with sine dilaton gravity (sDG) in the semiclassical limit. In the low energy limit, the sDG flows into the ordinary JT gravity which is a conjectured dual of ordinary Schwarzian quantum mechanics at strong coupling. We compute the associated central charge ($c_{JT}$), which reveals $c_{sDG}&gt;c_{JT}$. We identify this as an artifact of the UV completion of JT gravity in terms of sine dilaton gravity.</description>

      <title>Striped Superconductor in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of a superconductor is fundamentally determined by the symmetries broken in its order parameter. Here, we report an exceptionally exotic superconducting phase in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene that simultaneously breaks rotational, translational, and time-reversal symmetries. We show that superconductivity emerges from a quarter-metallic state and is accompanied by the onset of stripe charge order. This unique intertwinement is revealed by angle-resolved transport measurements, which demonstrate dissipationless current confined to a single principal axis-forming one-dimensional-like superconducting channels -- while the orthogonal direction remains resistive down to the lowest temperatures. The formation of stripe order is marked by a first-order melting transition, evidenced by pronounced thermal hysteresis upon warming and cooling. In addition, magnetic-field-induced switching between superconducting states -- reminiscent of behavior previously observed in rhombohedral tetra- and pentalayer graphene -- signals time-reversal symmetry breaking. Collectively, these observations reveal a previously unrecognized quantum phase: a chiral superconductor embedded within a stripe-ordered anomalous Hall state.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle Interference of Spin-Triplet Superconductors: Application to UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) obtained from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a powerful method to help extract the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors. We examine the general properties of QPI on surfaces of spin-triplet superconductors, where the properties of the $\vec d$-vector order parameter and topological surface bound states offer important differences from QPI on spin-singlet superconducting materials. We then apply the theory to a model specific to UTe$_2$, and compare the resulting QPI with recent STM measurements. We conclude that the two candidate Cooper pair instabilities $B_{2u}$ and $B_{3u}$ exhibit distinct features in the QPI intensity to discriminate these using the experimental data. Characteristic features of the emergent topological surface states protected by chiral symmetry in general, and by mirror symmetries in the case of UTe$_2$, provide further unique signatures to help pinpointing the pairing symmetry channel in this material.</description>

      <title>Proximity-induced Rashba spin-orbit interaction in BaMnO$_\text{3}|$KTaO$_\text{3}$ heterostructure for antiferromagnetic spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic spintronics, a promising technology for ultra-fast electronic devices, faces several challenges, including the lack of materials simultaneously hosting robust antiferromagnetism and adequate Rashba-like interaction. We design a heterostructure of BaMnO$_3|$KTaO$_3$ with the idea of proximity-inducing strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction from KTaO$_3$ part to BaMnO$_3$ part, where the latter is already a robust antiferromagnet. Within our DFT calculations, the heterostructure reveals BaMnO$_3$ bands near the Fermi level with a significant magnetic moment per Mn atom and a decent ordering temperature. Further, the BaMnO$_3$ bands in the heterostructure exhibit linear Rashba interaction with a sizable Rashba coefficient, owing to its proximity to KTaO$_3$. Our work can motivate future research by demonstrating the road map to proximity-induced Rashba interaction for antiferromagnetic spintronics.</description>

      <title>Chiral anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall effect in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that chiral anomaly is not limited to Weyl semimetals (WSMs), but are also shown by a larger class of materials called spin orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs),which has shed more insight into the origin of chiral anomaly as a Fermi surface property rather than a nodal property. In this study, we explore nonlinear transport responses in SOC-NCMswithin the framework of semiclassical dynamics, employing the Maxwell-Boltzmann transport theory augmented by charge conservation and momentum-dependent scattering processes. We take into account both non-magnetic and magnetic impurity scattering mechanisms. We demonstrate that the chiral-anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall (CNLH) response exhibits a characteristic quadratic dependence on the applied magnetic field and remains negative for both types of impurities. We find that magnetic scatterers leading to enhanced/suppressed interband scattering modifies the magnitude of the signal, but does not affect its qualitative behavior. In contrast, the presence of tilt in the band dispersion induces a pronounced anisotropic response, including a magnetic-field-direction dependent sign reversal that can be categorized into weak and strong regimes. Furthermore, the CNLH response shows substantial directional anisotropy governed by the relative orientation of the external magnetic field and the tilt vector. Our findings will be helpful in designing the experimental setup to get direction-dependent conductivity, which can be tuned externally with the help of magnetic impurity sites.</description>
