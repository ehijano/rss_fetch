      <title>Phenomenological Simulation of Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06666v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes an algorithmic system called SQT for the computer simulation of a wide class of quantum experiments on entangled particles. SQT maintains a hidden internal state for each particle and it provides an initialization process and measurement processes with visual outputs and a means of connecting these in software to make the simulator for a given experiment in Quantum Mechanics. The statistical behavior of the Quantum Mechanical system is replicated by incorporating the probabilities that are observed in real world quantum experiments. SQT is thus a tool to provide educational understanding of quantum systems and this tool removes the mystery surrounding entangled particles. It shows that only initial measurement probabilities and conditional probabilities of transition from the previous state and no earlier to the next state are sufficient inputs for the simulator to replicate all Quantum Mechanical experiments in the simulator and no other inputs such as complex numbers have to be entered into the simulator. The simulator, unlike the real world quantum system, can display the hidden sub-quantum state after which it can be seen that there is no spooky interaction between entangled particles at all. SQT therefore provides a new interpretation of quantum phenomena that may well replace the Copenhagen interpretation founded by Niels Bohr and it answers Einstein's final question regarding whether Quantum Mechanics can be considered a complete theory or not.</description>
