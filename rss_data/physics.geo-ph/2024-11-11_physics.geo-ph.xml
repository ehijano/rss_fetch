      <title>On nonlinear transitions, minimal seeds and exact solutions for the geodynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearly fifty years ago, Roberts (1978) postulated that Earth's magnetic field, which is generated by turbulent motions of liquid metal in its outer core, likely results from a subcritical dynamo instability characterised by a dominant balance between Coriolis, pressure and Lorentz forces. Here we numerically explore the generation of subcritical geomagnetic fields using techniques from optimal control and dynamical systems theory to uncover the nonlinear dynamical landscape underlying dynamo action. Through nonlinear optimisation, via direct-adjoint looping, we identify the minimal seed - the smallest magnetic field that attracts to a nonlinear dynamo solution. Additionally, using the Newton-hookstep algorithm, we converge stable and unstable travelling wave solutions to the governing equations. By combining these two techniques, complex nonlinear pathways between attracting states are revealed, providing insight into a potential subcritical origin of the geodynamo. This paper showcases these methods on the widely studied benchmark of Christensen et al. (2001), laying the foundations for future studies in more extreme and realistic parameter regimes. We show that the minimal seed reaches a nonlinear dynamo solution by first attracting to an unstable travelling wave solution, which acts as an edge state separating a hydrodynamic solution from a magnetohydrodynamic one. Furthermore, by carefully examining the choice of cost functional, we establish a robust optimisation procedure that can systematically locate dynamo solutions on short time horizons with no prior knowledge of its structure.</description>

      <title>Planetesimal gravitational collapse in a gaseous environment: Thermal and dynamic evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetesimal formation models often invoke the gravitational collapse of pebble clouds to overcome various barriers to grain growth and propose processes to concentrate particles sufficiently to trigger this collapse. On the other hand, the geochemical approach for planet formation constrains the conditions for planetesimal formation and evolution by providing temperatures that should be reached to explain the final composition of planetesimals, the building blocks of planets. To elucidate the thermal evolution during gravitational collapse, we used numerical simulations of a self-gravitating cloud of particles and gas coupled with gas drag. Our goal is to determine how the gravitational energy relaxed during the contraction is distributed among the different energy components of the system, and how this constrains a thermal and dynamical planetesimal's history. We identify the conditions necessary to achieve a temperature increase of several hundred kelvins, and as much as 1600 K. Our results emphasise the key role of the gas during the collapse.</description>
