      <title>Versatile CMOS Analog LIF Neuron for Memristor-Integrated Neuromorphic Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterogeneous systems with analog CMOS circuits integrated with nanoscale memristive devices enable efficient deployment of neural networks on neuromorphic hardware. CMOS Neuron with low footprint can emulate slow temporal dynamics by operating with extremely low current levels. Nevertheless, the current read from the memristive synapses can be higher by several orders of magnitude, and performing impedance matching between neurons and synapses is mandatory. In this paper, we implement an analog leaky integrate and fire (LIF) neuron with a voltage regulator and current attenuator for interfacing CMOS neurons with memristive synapses. In addition, the neuron design proposes a dual leakage that could enable the implementation of local learning rules such as voltage-dependent synaptic plasticity. We also propose a connection scheme to implement adaptive LIF neurons based on two-neuron interaction. The proposed circuits can be used to interface with a variety of synaptic devices and process signals of diverse temporal dynamics.</description>

      <title>LoPT: Low-Rank Prompt Tuning for Parameter Efficient Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In prompt tuning, a prefix or suffix text is added to the prompt, and the embeddings (soft prompts) or token indices (hard prompts) of the prefix/suffix are optimized to gain more control over language models for specific tasks. This approach eliminates the need for hand-crafted prompt engineering or explicit model fine-tuning. Prompt tuning is significantly more parameter-efficient than model fine-tuning, as it involves optimizing partial inputs of language models to produce desired outputs.
  In this work, we aim to further reduce the amount of trainable parameters required for a language model to perform well on specific tasks. We propose Low-rank Prompt Tuning (LoPT), a low-rank model for prompts that achieves efficient prompt optimization. The proposed method demonstrates similar outcomes to full parameter prompt tuning while reducing the number of trainable parameters by a factor of 5. It also provides promising results compared to the state-of-the-art methods that would require 10 to 20 times more parameters.</description>

      <title>Aerial Push-Button with Two-Stage Tactile Feedback using Reflected Airborne Ultrasound Focus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed a new aerial push-button with tactile feedback using focused airborne ultrasound. This study has two significant novelties compared to past related studies: 1) ultrasound emitters are equipped behind the user's finger and reflected ultrasound emission that is focused just above the solid plane placed under the finger presents tactile feedback to a finger pad, and 2) tactile feedback is presented at two stages during pressing motion; at the time of pushing the button and withdrawing the finger from it. The former has a significant advantage in apparatus implementation in that the input surface of the device can be composed of a generic thin plane including touch panels, potentially capable of presenting input touch feedback only when the user touches objects on the screen. We experimentally found that the two-stage tactile presentation is much more effective in strengthening perceived tactile stimulation and feeling of input completion when compared with a conventional single-stage method. This study proposes a composition of an aerial push-button in much more practical use than ever. The proposed system composition is expected to be one of the simplest frameworks in the airborne ultrasound tactile interface.</description>

      <title>Improving Performance Prediction of Electrolyte Formulations with Transformer-based Molecular Representation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Development of efficient and high-performing electrolytes is crucial for advancing energy storage technologies, particularly in batteries. Predicting the performance of battery electrolytes rely on complex interactions between the individual constituents. Consequently, a strategy that adeptly captures these relationships and forms a robust representation of the formulation is essential for integrating with machine learning models to predict properties accurately. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach leveraging a transformer-based molecular representation model to effectively and efficiently capture the representation of electrolyte formulations. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on two battery property prediction tasks and the results show superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Prediction based computation offloading and resource allocation for multi-access ISAC enabled IoT system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the new era of the Internet of Things (IoT), tasks are now being migrated to edge sites closer to data generators. Mobile devices inherently encounter limitations in terms of energy and computational processing capabilities. In high mobility paradigm, ISAC provides a promising foundation for integrating deployment management within dynamic spatial settings. We are interested in applying prediction mechanism to resource allocation management by extracting data attributes, focusing on ISAC related contexts of the trajectory and velocity and making the allocating decision. We present a system design, a theoretical framework and an implementation of the ClusterMan software package. The numerical suggests that the strong clustering subset of feature may yield high accuracy up to 97\% in the prediction results.</description>

      <title>Solving a Real-World Package Delivery Routing Problem Using Quantum Annealers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Research focused on the conjunction between quantum computing and routing problems has been very prolific in recent years. Most of the works revolve around classical problems such as the Traveling Salesman Problem or the Vehicle Routing Problem. The real-world applicability of these problems is dependent on the objectives and constraints considered. Anyway, it is undeniable that it is often difficult to translate complex requirements into these classical formulations.The main objective of this research is to present a solving scheme for dealing with realistic instances while maintaining all the characteristics and restrictions of the original real-world problem. Thus, a quantum-classical strategy has been developed, coined Q4RPD, that considers a set of real constraints such as a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles, priority deliveries, and capacities characterized by two values: weight and dimensions of the packages. Q4RPD resorts to the Leap Constrained Quadratic Model Hybrid Solver of D-Wave. To demonstrate the application of Q4RPD, an experimentation composed of six different instances has been conducted, aiming to serve as illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Feature Representation on the Accuracy of Photonic Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic Neural Networks (PNNs) are gaining significant interest in the research community due to their potential for high parallelization, low latency, and energy efficiency. PNNs compute using light, which leads to several differences in implementation when compared to electronics, such as the need to represent input features in the photonic domain before feeding them into the network. In this encoding process, it is common to combine multiple features into a single input to reduce the number of inputs and associated devices, leading to smaller and more energy-efficient PNNs. Although this alters the network's handling of input data, its impact on PNNs remains understudied. This paper addresses this open question, investigating the effect of commonly used encoding strategies that combine features on the performance and learning capabilities of PNNs. Here, using the concept of feature importance, we develop a mathematical methodology for analyzing feature combination. Through this methodology, we demonstrate that encoding multiple features together in a single input determines their relative importance, thus limiting the network's ability to learn from the data. Given some prior knowledge of the data, however, this can also be leveraged for higher accuracy. By selecting an optimal encoding method, we achieve up to a 12.3% improvement in accuracy of PNNs trained on the Iris dataset compared to other encoding techniques, surpassing the performance of networks where features are not combined. These findings highlight the importance of carefully choosing the encoding to the accuracy and decision-making strategies of PNNs, particularly in size or power constrained applications.</description>
