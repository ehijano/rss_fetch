      <title>Jet-Induced Enhancement of Deuteron Production in $pp$ and $p$-Pb Collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jet-associated deuteron production in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and $p$-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV is studied in the coalescence model by using the phase-space information of proton and neutron pairs from a multiphase transport (AMPT) model at the kinetic freezeout. In the low transverse momentum ($p_T$) region $p_T/A &lt; 1.5$ GeV/$c$, where $A$ is the mass number of a nucleus, the in-jet coalescence factor $B_2^\text{In-jet}$ for deuteron production, given by the ratio of the in-jet deuteron number to the square of the in-jet proton number, is found to be larger than the coalescence factor $B_2$ in the medium perpendicular to the jet by a factor of about 10 in $pp$ collisions and of 25 in $p-$Pb collisions, which are consistent with the ALICE measurements at the LHC. Such large low-momentum enhancements mainly come from coalescence of nucleons inside the jet with the medium nucleons. Coalescence of nucleons inside the jet dominates deuteron production only at the higher $p_T$ region of $p_T/A\gtrsim 4$ GeV/$c$, where both the yield ratio $d/p$ of deuteron to proton numbers and the $B_2$ are also significantly larger in the jet direction than in the direction perpendicular to the jet due to the strong collinear correlation among particles produced from jet fragmentation. Studying jet-associated deuteron production in relativistic nuclear collisions thus opens up a new window to probe the phase-space structure of nucleons inside jets.</description>

      <title>Ternary fission with the emission of long-range $\alpha$ particles in fission of the heaviest nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most probable outcome of the ternary fission is the emission of two heavy fragments and one light-charged particle. In about 90\%, these are $\alpha$ particles, which often referred to as the long-range alpha (LRA). Such decay has been extensively studied over decades in various heavy fissioning systems. The probability of such a process has been found to be about (2-4)$\times 10^{-3}$ relative to binary fission. The experimental data showed an increasing trend in the probability of such a process with an increase in fissility parameter within the range of 35 - 39. In the last decades, a region of the heaviest nuclei has been substantially expanded in both proton and neutron numbers. This includes neutron-deficient heavy and superheavy nuclei with fissility parameters, which are significantly exceeding the aforementioned range. In the present work, the currently available experimental data on the probability of the LRA emission, which is a representative of ternary fission, are discussed. The probabilities of LRA emission were calculated within the various empirical approaches, including the presently suggested semi-empirical expression. The latter one was derived on the basis of the $\alpha$-decay property of the fissioning nucleus. The results of all approaches discussed show that the probabilities of LRA emission are substantial (up to a percentage) in the fission of neutron-deficient heavy and superheavy nuclei.</description>

      <title>The $p\Lambda$ and $pp\Lambda$ correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present the study of $p\Lambda$ and $pp\Lambda$ scattering processes using femtoscopic correlation functions. This observable has been recently used to access the low-energy interaction of hadrons emitted in the final state of high-energy collisions, delivering unprecedented precision information of the interaction among strange hadrons. The formalism for particle pairs is well established and it relates the measured correlation functions with the scattering wave function and the emission source. In the present work we analyze the $NN\Lambda$ scattering in free space and relate the corresponding wave function to the $pp\Lambda$ correlation measurement performed by the ALICE collaboration. The three-body problem is solved using the hyperspherical adiabatic basis. Regarding the $p\Lambda$ and $pp\Lambda$ interactions, different models are used and their impact on the correlation function is studied. The three body force considered in this work is anchored to describe the binding energy of the hypertriton and to give a good description of the two four-body hypernuclei. As a main result we have observed a huge, low-energy peak in the $pp\Lambda$ correlation function, mainly produced by the $J^\pi=1/2^+$ three-body state. The study of this peak from an experimental as well as a theoretical point of view will provide important constraints to the two- and three-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Correlation of neutrinoless double-beta decay nuclear matrix elements with nucleon-nucleon phase shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an ab initio study of the correlation between nuclear matrix elements of neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay and nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts in the $^1S_0$ channel. Starting from thirty-four statistically weighted interactions derived from chiral effective field theory, we apply the valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group to calculate nuclear matrix elements in four key experimental isotopes. Comparing with the $^1S_0$-channel phase shifts given from each interaction, in all cases we observe a strong correlation for scattering energies above 75 MeV. Furthermore, a global sensitivity analysis, enabled by newly developed machine-learning emulators, confirms that the nuclear matrix elements of the decay depend primarily on the $C_{1S0}$ low-energy constant, which is associated with the phase shifts in that partial wave. These results provide the first clear correlation between $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay nuclear matrix elements and a measured observable and will therefore serve as a crucial component in ongoing and future refinements of ab initio uncertainty estimates.</description>

      <title>Extended Generator Coordinate Method: eGCM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generator coordinate method (GCM) was introduced in nuclear physics by Wheeler and his collaborators in 1950's and it is still one of the mostly used approximations for treating nuclear large amplitude collective motion (LACM). GCM was inspired by similar methods introduced in molecular and condensed matter physics in the late 1920's, after the Schr\"odinger equation became the tool of choice to describe quantum phenomena. Unfortunately GCM and its precursors in molecular and condensed matter physics have one major drawback, they are not controllable approximations. GCM is typically implemented in practice either in a static or time-dependent formulation. In 1983 Reinhard, Cusson, and Goeke suggested replacing the static basis set of GCM many-body wave functions with the solutions of the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) Slater determinants. In this manner one would use a set of (generalized) Slater determinants which could include internal excitations. The interest in this new type of time-dependent GCM (TDGCM) was revived in recent years, but unfortunately this new TDGCM framework has a very serious flaw, which prevents it from describing correctly many anticipated features in a properly formulated TDGCM framework, such as interference and entanglement. I present here the alternative formulation of the GCM, the extended GCM (eGCM), which fully addresses these issues and also allows for a straightforward numerical implementation with projection on total angular momentum and hopefully also on particle number projection.</description>

      <title>Bayesian analysis of nucleon-nucleon scattering data in pionless effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform Bayesian model calibration of two-nucleon ($NN$) low-energy constants (LECs) appearing in an $NN$ interaction based on pionless effective field theory (EFT). The calibration is carried out for potentials constructed using naive dimensional analysis in $NN$ relative momenta ($p$) up to next-to-leading order [NLO, $O(p^2)$] and next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order [N3LO, $O(p^4)$]. We consider two classes of pionless EFT potential: one that acts in all partial waves and another that is dominated by $s$-wave physics. The two classes produce broadly similar results for calibrations to $NN$ data up to $E_{\rm lab}=5$ MeV. Our analysis accounts for the correlated uncertainties that arise from the truncation of the pionless EFT. We simultaneously estimate both the EFT LECs and the parameters that quantify the truncation error. This permits the first quantitative estimates of the pionless EFT breakdown scale, $\Lambda_b$: the 95% intervals are $\Lambda_b \in [50.11,63.03]$ MeV at NLO and $\Lambda_b \in [72.27, 88.54]$ MeV at N3LO. Invoking naive dimensional analysis for the $NN$ potential, therefore, does not lead to consistent results across orders in pionless EFT. This exemplifies the possible use of Bayesian tools to identify inconsistencies in a proposed EFT power counting.</description>

      <title>Old neutron stars as a new probe of relic neutrinos and sterile neutrino dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the kinetic cooling (heating) of old neutron stars due to coherent scattering with relic neutrinos (sterile neutrino dark matter) via Standard Model neutral-current interactions. We take into account several important physical effects, such as gravitational clustering, coherent enhancement, neutron degeneracy and Pauli blocking. We find that the anomalous cooling of nearby neutron stars due to relic neutrino scattering might actually be observable by current and future telescopes operating in the optical to near-infrared frequency band, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), provided there is a large local relic overdensity that is still allowed. Similarly, the anomalous heating of neutron stars due to coherent scattering with keV-scale sterile neutrino dark matter, could also be observed by JWST or future telescopes, which would probe hitherto unexplored parameter space in the sterile neutrino mass-mixing plane.</description>

      <title>Linearized fluctuating hydrodynamics via random polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that an ensemble of backgrounds best understands hydrodynamic dispersion relations in a medium with few degrees of freedom and is therefore subject to strong thermal fluctuations. In the linearized regime, dispersion relations become describeable by polynomials with random coefficients. We give a short review of this theory and perform a numerical study of the distribution of the roots of polynomials whose coefficients are of the order of a Knudsen series but fluctuate in accordance with canonical fluctuations of temperature. We find that, remarkably, the analytic structure of the poles of fluctuating dispersion relations is very different from deterministic ones, particularly regarding the distribution of imaginary parts with respect to real components. We argue that this provides evidence that hydrodynamic behavior persists, and is enhanced, by non-perturbative background fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Calculation of Some Integrals over Gaussian Measure with Nuclear Covariance Operator in Separable Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to construct convergent series for the approximate calculation of certain integrals over the Gaussian measure with a nuclear covariance operator, nonlocal propagator, in separable Hilbert space. Such series arise, for example, in the model with the interaction Lagrangian $\sinh^{2(p+1)}\varphi$, where $p \in \mathbb{N}$ and $\varphi$ is the scalar field, although the problem can be solved in general form for a fairly wide class of Lagrangians: an even, strictly convex, continuous, non-negative function with a single zero value for $\varphi=0$ and for $|\varphi|\rightarrow +\infty$ growing faster than $\varphi^{2}$. We strictly define the scattering matrix, $\mathcal{S}$-matrix, at the zero value of the classical field, argument of the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix, of such a theory in terms of the corresponding integral, find the iterated expansion for the integrand (the Gaussian measure doesn't expand) over two orthonormal bases of functions, prove the validity of summation and integration interchange and thus find the expansion of the $\mathcal{S}$-matrix at the zero value of the classical field into the iterated series in powers of the interaction action. The individual terms of the resulting series have the form of a canonical partition function (CPF), and the methods of statistical physics are applicable to them. In particular, we express them in terms of Bell polynomials. It is important to note that such iterated series cannot be reduced to the perturbation theory (PT) series, since in the proposed model the latter diverges as $e^{n^{2}}$, where $n \in \mathbb {N}$ is the PT order. Along the way, we provide detailed mathematical background, including Beppo Levi's monotone convergence theorem (MCT) and Henri Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem (DCT), without which the presented calculation would be significantly more complex.</description>

      <title>An evidence of pion condensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pion condensation is a theoretical prediction, where pions form a special state of matter under certain extreme conditions in heavy ion collisions or neutron stars. However, there is currently no solid experimental evidence confirming the existence of pion condensation. We present a near-direct evidence for the existence of pion condensation. In actively changing galactic processes protons can be accelerated to very high energies and collide with the medium (protons or nuclei). The kinetic energy of the protons is mainly used to produce a large number of pions in the central region via gluons. When the collision energy exceeds a certain threshold, the huge amount of soft gluons condensed in protons pour into the central region, the number of pion increases abruptly to the saturation limit, and almost all the available collision energy is used to make pions, creating a dense, low-temperature pion condensation environment. Due to energy conservation and relativistic covariance, the gamma ray spectra produced by condensed pions exhibit recognizable broken power law with the gluon condensation characteristics. We find that they are already present in many recorded gamma ray spectra. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for the generation of pion condensation, which is prevalent in the formation of high-energy cosmic rays, and deepen our understanding of related topics in a variety of disciplines, including particle physics, astrophysics, condensed matter physics and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Weakly Bound Light Nuclei in Central Collider Experiments: a Challenge in Favor of a Late Continuous Decoupling Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Arguments are presented that the reaction products of central high energy nuclear collisions up to collider energies can rigorously be interpreted in terms of a continuous decoupling mechanism based on continuous equations of motion. The various aspects of the collision dynamics are investigate in terms of the individual decoupling processes. Thereby each observed particle decouples during its own temporal decoupling window. This includes a ``very late'' decoupling of the faintly bound Hypertritons observed in recent ALICE experiments. The success of the strategy relays on 200 years old wisdom and leads to a revised interpretation of the entire decoupling process.</description>

Abstract: We study multi-particle azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. We use initial conditions obtained from a Monte-Carlo Glauber model and evolve them within a viscous relativistic hydrodynamics framework that eventually gives way to a transport model in the late hadronic stage of the evolution. We compute the multi-particle symmetric and asymmetric cumulants and present the results for their sensitivity to the shear and bulk viscosities during the hydrodynamic evolution. We also check their sensitivity to resonance decay and hadronic interactions. We show that these observables are more sensitive to the transport properties than the traditional flow observables.</description>

      <title>Electron scattering cross section for light nuclei within the unified electroweak theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06407v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the multipole expansion within the unified electroweak theory to develop a complete calculation method of the electron scattering cross section for light nuclei. The specific calculations for 6,7Li and 7Be nuclei indicate that the conventional impulse approximation can be applied to the electron-nucleus scattering only when the incident electron energy does not exceed twice the nucleon mass. In addition, the quasi-elastic scattering cross section of 7Li in the excitation from its ground state to the nearest excited state and that of elastic scattering in the ground state are independently treated, whereas they have not been separately measured in experiments. The obtained scattering cross sections corresponding to an appropriate adjustment of the harmonic oscillator parameter along with the V-A structure interpret reasonably well the available experimental data at MeV energies and provide predictive information at GeV energies. This gives new perspectives in studying the structure of nuclei and the weak interactions via electron or lepton scattering at high (GeV) energies, considering nuclei rather than quarks.</description>

      <title>On a possible $^{3}_{\phi}$H hypernucleus with HAL QCD interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of the Faddeev formalism in configuration space, we investigate bound states in the $\phi NN$ system with total isospin $T=0$ and $T=1$. The recently proposed lattice HAL QCD $\phi N$ potential in the $^{4}S_{3/2}$ channel does not support either $\phi N$ or $\phi NN$ bound states. The HAL QCD $\phi N$ potential in the $^{2}S_{1/2}$ channel suggests the bound states for $\phi N$ and $\phi NN (S=0)$ systems. However, the binding energies are highly sensitive to variations of the enhancement factor $\beta$, and the $\phi NN$ system is extremely strongly bound in the state $S=0$. Considering a spin-averaged potential %$(\frac{1}{3}V_{\phi N}^{1/2}+\frac{2}{3}V_{\phi N}^{3/2})$ for the state $S=1$ yields a bound state for $^3_\phi$H $(S=1)$ hypernucleus with the binding energy (BE) 14.9 MeV when $\beta = 6.9$. The evaluation of the BE for the $S=1$, $T=1$ three-body state results in 5.47 MeV. %Also, We evaluated the BE for the $S=1$, $T=1$ three-body state as 5.47 MeV. Additionally, calculations using our approach confirm the bound states for the $\phi NN$ ($S=2,T=0$ and $S=1, T=1$) system previously predicted with the Yukawa-type potential motivated by the QCD van der Waals attractive force, mediated by multi-gluon exchanges.</description>

      <title>The Smile of Cheshire Cat At High Density</title>

Abstract: Baryons in finite nuclei, nuclear matter and dense compact-star matter are described in terms of Cheshire Cat for QCD. A potential conceptual link, admittedly short in mathematical rigor, between their manifestations is made by what's called Cheshire Cat Principle. Put in terms taken ``dual" to QCD variables, going to very high density exposes quantum Hall droplets -- or pancakes -- at which the dilaton-limit fixed point with $g_A\to 1$, $f_\pi\to f_\chi$ -- where $f_\pi$ and $f_\chi$ are respectively the pion and dilaton decay constants -- and the baryon parity-doubling are reached. This scenario suggests a thus-far totally unexplored structure of dual baryonic matter at high density which does neither require nor rule out (rapid) first-order phase transitions from hadrons to quarks in the core of compact stars on the verge of gravitational collapse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.06758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a resource paper concerning enhancement of observable time-reversal breaking effects by nuclear structure, aimed at AMO experimentalists. It's intended to support a white paper by providing some orientation on what can be said about some particular isotopes. Any conclusions are qualitative, and the reader should consult and cite the primary references and reviews rather than this arXiv alone.</description>

      <title>Medium induced mixing, spatial modulations and critical modes in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mixing between the chiral condensate and the density in hot and dense QCD matter is familiar. We show that the mixing relevant for the ground state is considerably more extensive, and in particular also involves gluonic degrees of freedom. As a result, the Hessian of the QCD effective action is non-Hermitian, but retains a symmetry under combined charge- and complex conjugation. This can lead to complex-conjugate pairs of eigenvalues of this Hessian, signaling regimes with spatially modulated correlations. Furthermore, based on the analytic structure of the quark determinant at a chiral critical point, we demonstrate that the corresponding massless critical mode is composed of the chiral condensate, the density and the Polyakov loops. Due to an avoided crossing, the critical mode turns out to be disconnected from the chiral condensate in vacuum. We present general arguments for all these features and illustrate them through explicit model calculations.</description>

      <title>Hadron Production in Ultra-relativistic Nuclear Collisions and Finite Baryon-Size Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate relative hadron yield production of various like and unlike mass particles in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions by employing a statistical thermal model with finite-sized baryons (antibaryons) to imitate the hard-core repulsive interactions leading to the excluded volume type effect. A strong evidence of strangeness suppression relative to the non-strange ones, mainly pions, particularly at higher energies is also observed. This study also indicates that at chemical freeze-out the particle ratios and strangeness suppression in the system obtained theoretically are sensitive to baryonic (antibaryonic) hard-core radius ($r_B$). A comparison with earlier analysis involving the strangeness suppression effect is made where baryons and antibaryons were treated as point-like particles. The available experimental data showing energy dependence of various particle ratios are well described throughout the range of centre-of-mass energy ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$). The value of hard-core radius between 0.76 to 0.79 fm is found to fit the data quite well using $\chi^{2}$ minimization technique. Two different chemical freeze-out stages are found where the earlier one belongs to baryonic (hyperonic), antibaryonic (antihyperonic) states and the later one to mesonic degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>On interpretation of fluctuations of conserved charges at high T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04194v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations of conserved charges calculated on the lattice which can be measured experimentally, are well reproduced by a hadron resonanse gas model at temperatures below T_{ch} ~ 155 MeV and radically deviate from the hadron resonance gas predictions above the chiral restoration crossover. This behavior is typically interpreted as an indication of deconfinement in the quark-gluon plasma regime. We present an argument that this interpretation may be too simple. The argument is based on the scaling of quantities with the number of colors: demonstration of deconfinement and QGP requires observable that is sensitive to N_c^2 gluons while the conserved charges are sensitive only to quarks and above T_{ch} scale as N_c^1. The latter scaling is consistent with the existence of an intermediate regime characterized by restored chiral symmetry and by approximate chiral spin symmetry which is a symmetry of confining interaction. In this regime the energy density, pressure and entropy density scale as N_c^1. In the large N_c limit this regime might become a distinct phase separated from the hadron gas and from QGP by phase transitions. A natural observable that associates with deconfinement and is directly sensitive to deconfined N_c^2-1 gluons is the Polyakov loop; in the N_c=3 world it remains very close to 0 at temperatures well above chiral crossover, reaches the value 0.5 around 3T_{ch} and the value close to 1 at temperatures ~1 GeV.</description>

      <title>Probing the internal structures of $p\Omega$ and $\Omega\Omega$ with their production at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strange dibaryons $p\Omega$ ($^5\rm{S}_2$) and $\Omega\Omega$ ($^1\rm{S}_0$) are likely bound, existing either in molecular states like the deuteron or as more exotic compact six-quark states. Here, we investigate the production of these two dibaryons in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=2.76 TeV at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) within a covariant coalescence model, which employs a blast-wave-like parametrization for the phase-space configurations of constituent particles at freeze-out. For the molecular states, the $p\Omega$ and $\Omega\Omega$ are produced via $p$-$\Omega$ and $\Omega$-$\Omega$ coalescence, respectively, while for the six-quark states, they are formed through $uudsss$ and $ssssss$ coalescence. We find that the yield ratio $N_{p\Omega}/N_{\Omega}$ and $N_{\Omega\Omega}/N_{\Omega}$ have a distinct centrality dependence between the molecular and multi-quark states, thus offering a promising way for distinguishing the two states. Our results suggest that the measurements of $p\Omega$ and $\Omega\Omega$ production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions can shed light on their internal structures.</description>

      <title>Charge radii of $^{11-16}$C, $^{13-17}$N and $^{15-18}$O determined from their charge-changing cross-sections and the mirror-difference charge radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge-changing cross-sections of $^{11-16}$C, $^{13-17}$N and $^{15-18}$O on a carbon target have been determined at energies around 300 MeV/nucleon. A nucleon separation energy dependent correction factor has been introduced to the Glauber model calculation for extracting the nuclear charge radii from the experimental CCCSs. The charge radii of $^{11}$C, $^{13,16}$N and $^{15}$O thus were determined for the first time. With the new radii, we studied the experimental mirror-difference charge radii ($\Delta R_{\text {ch}}^{\text {mirror}}$) of $^{11}$B-$^{11}$C, $^{13}$C-$^{13}$N, $^{15}$N-$^{15}$O, $^{17}$N-$^{17}$Ne pairs for the first time. We find that the $\Delta R_{\text {ch}}^{\text {mirror}}$, including both bound and weakly bound proton-rich mirror partners, are reproduced by the empirical relation to the isospin asymmetry predicted by the $ab$ $initio$ calculations.</description>
