      <title>Symmetric Persistent Tensors and their Hessian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent tensors, introduced in [Quantum 8 (2024), 1238], and inspired by quantum information theory, form a recursively defined class of tensors that remain stable under the substitution method and thereby yield nontrivial lower bounds on tensor rank. In this work, we investigate the symmetric case-namely, symmetric persistent tensors, or equivalently, persistent polynomials. We establish that a symmetric tensor in $\mathrm{Sym}^n \mathbb{C}^d$ is persistent if the determinant of its Hessian equals the $d(n-2)$-th power of a nonzero linear form. The converse is verified for cubic tensors ($n=3$) or for $d \leq 3$, by leveraging classical results of B. Segre. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Hessian of a symmetric persistent tensor factors as the $d$-th power of a form of degree $(n-2)$. Our main results provide an explicit necessary and sufficient criterion for persistence, thereby offering an effective algebraic characterization of this class of tensors. Beyond characterization, we present normal forms in small dimensions, place persistent polynomials within prehomogeneous geometry, and connect them with semi-invariants, homaloidal polynomials, and Legendre transforms. Particularly, we prove that all persistent cubics are homaloidal.</description>

      <title>On Modified Diagonal Cycles and the Beauville Decomposition of the Ceresa Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a curve of genus $g \geq 2$, and let $J$ be its Jacobian. The choice of a degree 1 divisor $e$ on $C$ gives an embedding of $C$ into $J$; we denote by $[C]_{}^{e}\in \mathrm{CH}\left( J;\mathbb{Q} \right) $ the class in the Chow group of $J$ defined by the image of this embedding. It is known from the work of S.-W. Zhang that the vanishing of the Ceresa cycle $\mathrm{Cer}(C,e):=[C]^{e} - [-1]_* [C]^e$ is equivalent to both the vanishing of the 1st Beauville component $[C]_{(1)}^e$ and the vanishing of the 3rd Gross--Kudla--Schoen modified diagonal cycle $\Gamma^3(C,e) \in \mathrm{CH}(C^3;\mathbb{Q})$. In this paper, we extend this result to show that the vanishing of the $s$-th Beauville component $[C]^e_{(s)}$ for $s \geq 1$ is equivalent to the vanishing of the $(s+2)$-nd modified diagonal cycle $\Gamma^{s + 2}(C, e) \in \mathrm{CH}(C^{s+2};\mathbb{Q})$. We also establish "successive vanishing" results for these cycles: for instance, if $\Gamma^n(C, e) = \Gamma^{n + 1}(C, e)=0$, then $\Gamma^{k}(C, e) = 0$ for all $k \geq n$. In the $s=1$ case, we show an integral refinement to the original statement, relating the order of torsion of $\mathrm{Cer}(C,e) \in \mathrm{CH}(J;\mathbb{Z})$ to that of $\Gamma^3(C,e) \in \mathrm{CH}(C^3;\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study sections of line bundles on the nested Hilbert scheme of points on the affine plane. We describe the spaces of sections in terms of certain ideals introduced by Haiman, and find explicit bases for them by analyzing the trailing terms in some monomial order. As a consequence, we compute the Newton-Okounkov bodies for nested Hilbert schemes.</description>

      <title>The condensed homotopy type of a scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a condensed version of the \'etale homotopy type of a scheme, which refines both the usual \'etale homotopy type of Friedlander-Artin-Mazur and the pro\'etale fundamental group of Bhatt-Scholze. In the first part of this paper, we prove that this condensed homotopy type satisfies descent along integral morphisms and that the expected fiber sequences hold. We also provide explicit computations, for example, for rings of continuous functions. A key ingredient in many of our arguments is a description of the condensed homotopy type using the Galois category of a scheme introduced by Barwick-Glasman-Haine.
  In the second part, we focus on the fundamental group of the condensed homotopy type in more detail. We show that, unexpectedly, the fundamental group of the condensed homotopy type of the affine line $\mathbf{A}^1_{\mathbf{C}}$ over the complex numbers is nontrivial. Nonetheless, its Noohi completion recovers the pro\'etale fundamental group of Bhatt-Scholze. Moreover, we show that a mild correction, passing to the quasiseparated quotient, fixes most of this group's quirks. Surprisingly, this quotient is often a topological group.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of resolving singularities via the blow-up of the module of derivations. Our main results are a positive answer for the case of curves and log-canonical surface singularities, i.e., a finite sequence of blow-ups along the module of derivations resolves the singularities of such varieties.</description>

      <title>Noether-Type Inequalities for Big Divisors on Algebraic Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D$ be a big integral divisor on a smooth projective surface $X$. In this paper, we study Noether-type inequalities for $D$. The key ingredient is the introduction of a numerical invariant $\mathfrak{e}(D)$, which depends only on the negative part $N$ of $D$. In particular, $\mathfrak{e}(D)=0$ if $D$ is nef. As an application, we establish an inequality between the volume and the pluri-sectional index of a canonical foliated surface of general type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present note studies \emph{surjective rational endomorphisms} $f: \mathbb{P}^2 \dashrightarrow \mathbb{P}^2$ with \emph{cubic} terms and the indeterminacy locus $I_f \ne \emptyset$. We develop an experimental approach, based on some Python programming and Machine Learning, towards the classification of such maps; a couple of new explicit $f$ is constructed in this way. We also prove (via pure projective geometry) that a general non-regular cubic endomorphism $f$ of $\mathbb{P}^2$ is surjective if and only if the set $I_f$ has cardinality at least $3$.</description>

      <title>Bidifferentials, Lagrangian projections and the Virasoro extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic zero. We prove that a Lagrangian supplement of $H^0(C, \Omega_C)$ in the de Rham cohomology group $H^1_{dR}(C)$ determines and is determined by a particular type of symmetric bidifferential on $C^2$ (its polar divisor must be twice the diagonal and have biresidue one along it). When $k$ is the complex field, a natural choice of such supplement is $H^{0,1}(C)$ and we show that this corresponds with the bidifferential that after a twist is the rational $2$-form on $C^2$ found by Biswas-Colombo-Frediani-Pirola. We determine the cohomology class carried by that $2$-form and define an analogue of this form as rational $n$-form on $C^n$ that is regular on the $n$-point configuration space of $C$.
  The proof relies on a local version of the above correspondence, which can be stated in terms of a complete discrete valuation ring. We use this local version also to construct in a natural manner the Virasoro extension of the Lie algebra of derivations of a local field.</description>

      <title>Potent categorical represeentations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and motivate -- based on ongoing joint work with Germ\'an Stefanich -- the notion of potent categorical representations of a complex reductive group $G$, specifically a conjectural Langlands correspondence identifying potent categorical representations of $G$ and its Langlands dual $\check G$. We emphasize the symplectic nature of potent categorical representations in their simultaneous dependence on parameters in maximal tori for $G$ and $\check G$, specifically how their conjectural Langlands correspondence fits within a 2-categorical Fourier transform. Our key tool to make various ideas precise is higher sheaf theory and its microlocalization, specifically a theory of ind-coherent sheaves of categories on stacks. The constructions are inspired by the physics of 3d mirror symmetry and S-duality on the one hand, and the theory of double affine Hecke algebras on the other. We also highlight further conjectures related to ongoing programs in and around geometric representation theory.</description>

      <title>Conjectural Positivity for Pontryagin Product in Equivariant K-theory of Loop Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected simply-connected simple algebraic group over $\mathbb{C}$ and let $T$ be a maximal torus, $B\supset T$ a Borel subgroup and $K$ a maximal compact subgroup. Then, the product in the (algebraic) based loop group $\Omega(K)$ gives rise to a comultiplication in the topological $T$-equivariant $K$-ring $K_T^{top}(\Omega(K))$. Recall that $\Omega(K)$ is identified with the affine Grassmannian $\mathcal{X}$ (of $G$) and hence we get a comultiplication in $ K_T^{top}(\mathcal{X})$. Dualizing, one gets the Pontryagin product in the $T$-equivariant $K$-homology $K^T_0(\mathcal{X})$, which in-turn gets identified with the convolution product (due to S. Kato). Now, $ K_T^{top}(\mathcal{X})$ has a basis $\{\xi^w\}$ over the representation ring $R(T)$ given by the ideal sheaves corresponding to the finite codimension Schubert varieties $X^w$ in $\mathcal{X}$. We make a positivity conjecture on the comultiplication structure constants in the above basis. Using some results of Kato, this conjecture gives rise to an equivalent conjecture on the positivity of the multiplicative structure constants in $T$-equivariant quantum $K$-theory $QK_T(G/B)$ in the Schubert basis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a natural definition of open Hurwitz numbers, where the weight of each ramified covering includes an integer parameter $N$ taken to the power that is equal to the number of boundary components of a Riemann surface with boundary mapping to $\mathbb{CP}^1$. We prove that the resulting sequence of partition functions, depending on $N\in\mathbb{Z}$, is a tau-sequence of the mKP hierarchy, or in other words it is a sequence of tau-functions of the KP hierarchy where each tau-function is obtained from the previous one by a B\"acklund-Darboux transformation. Our result is motivated by a previous observation of Alexandrov and the first two authors that the refined intersection numbers on the moduli spaces of Riemann surfaces with boundary give a tau-sequence of the mKP hierarchy.</description>

This generalizes the Weyl group invariance of characters of finite-dimensional representations of $\mathfrak{g}$.</description>

      <title>Computing moment polytopes - with a focus on tensors, entanglement and matrix multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensors are fundamental in mathematics, computer science, and physics. Their study through algebraic geometry and representation theory has proved very fruitful in the context of algebraic complexity theory and quantum information. In particular, moment polytopes have been understood to play a key role. In quantum information, moment polytopes (also known as entanglement polytopes) provide a framework for the single-particle quantum marginal problem and offer a geometric characterization of entanglement. In algebraic complexity, they underpin quantum functionals that capture asymptotic tensor relations. More recently, moment polytopes have also become foundational to the emerging field of scaling algorithms in computer science and optimization.
  Despite their fundamental role and interest from many angles, much is still unknown about these polytopes, and in particular for tensors beyond $\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$ and $\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2\otimes\mathbb{C}^2$ only sporadically have they been computed. We give a new algorithm for computing moment polytopes of tensors (and in fact moment polytopes for the general class of reductive algebraic groups) based on a mathematical description by Franz (J. Lie Theory 2002).
  This algorithm enables us to compute moment polytopes of tensors of dimension an order of magnitude larger than previous methods, allowing us to compute with certainty, for the first time, all moment polytopes of tensors in $\mathbb{C}^3\otimes\mathbb{C}^3\otimes\mathbb{C}^3$, and with high probability those in $\mathbb{C}^4\otimes\mathbb{C}^4\otimes\mathbb{C}^4$ (which includes the $2\times 2$ matrix multiplication tensor). We discuss how these explicit moment polytopes have led to several new theoretical directions and results.</description>

      <title>When any four solutions are independent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that if any four distinct solutions of a rational difference equation are algebraically independent, then any number of distinct solutions to the equation are independent. A nontrivial variant of this result is given for autonomous difference equations or algebraic dynamical systems, where we show the degree of nonminimality is at most one. The results have a natural interpretation in terms of invariant or periodic subvarieties of algebraic dynamical systems and $\sigma$-varieties. Surprisingly, the proofs of these results rely on the classification of finite simple groups.</description>

      <title>Linear Shafarevich Conjecture in positive characteristic, Hyperbolicity and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a complex quasi-projective normal variety $X$ and a linear representation $\varrho:\pi_1(X)\to {\rm GL}_{N}(K)$ with $K$ any field of positive characteristic, we mainly establish the following results:
  1. the construction of the Shafarevich morphism ${\rm sh}_\varrho:X\to {\rm Sh}_\varrho(X)$ associated with $\varrho$.
  2. In cases where $X$ is projective, $\varrho$ is faithful and the $\Gamma$-dimension of $X$ is at most two (e.g. $\dim X=2$), we prove that the Shafarevich conjecture holds for $X$.
  3. In cases where $\varrho$ is big, we prove that the Green-Griffiths-Lang conjecture holds for $X$.
  4. When $\varrho$ is big and the Zariski closure of $\varrho(\pi_1(X))$ is a semisimple algebraic group, we prove that $X$ is pseudo Picard hyperbolic, and strongly of log general type.
  5. If $X$ is special or $h$-special, then $\varrho(\pi_1(X))$ is virtually abelian.
  We also prove Claudon-H\"oring-Koll\'ar's conjecture for complex projective manifolds with linear fundamental groups of any characteristic.</description>

      <title>Deformation of moduli spaces of meromorphic $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ via unfolding of irregular singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unfolding singular points in linear differential equations is a classical technique for studying the properties of irregular singularities by relating them to regular singularities. In this paper, we propose a general framework for unfolding unramified irregular singularities of meromorphic connections on the trivial principal $G$-bundle over $\mathbb{P}^{1}$.
  One of our main results is the description of the unfolding of singularities in terms of deformations of their moduli spaces. We show that every moduli space of irreducible meromorphic $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$ can be deformed into a moduli space of irreducible Fuchsian $G$-connections on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$.
  Furthermore, we study the unfolding of additive Deligne-Simpson problems, in which the unfolding of irregular singularities naturally generates a family of such problems. As an application of our main result, we prove that a Deligne-Simpson problem for $G$-connections with unramified irregular singularities admits a solution if and only if every unfolded Deligne-Simpson problem in the family admits a simultaneous solution.
  We also provide a combinatorial and diagrammatic framework of the unfolding process in terms of spectral types and unfolding diagrams. Finally, we address a conjecture proposed by Oshima concerning the existence of irreducible $G$-connections that realize prescribed spectral types and their unfoldings. Our main result gives an affirmative answer to this conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $K$-theoretic enumerative geometry of cyclic Nakajima quiver varieties, with particular focus on $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$, the equivariant Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$. The direct sum over $m$ of the equivariant $K$-theories of these varieties is known to be isomorphic to the ring symmetric functions in $l$ colors, with structure sheaves of torus fixed points identified with wreath Macdonald polynomials. Using properties of wreath Macdonald polynomials and the recent identification of the Maulik-Okounkov quantum affine algebra for cyclic quivers with the quantum toroidal algebras of type $A$, we derive an explicit formula for the generating function of capped vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^{m}([\mathbb{C}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}_{l}])$ with descendants given by exterior powers of the $0$th tautological bundle. We also sharpen the large framing vanishing results of Okounkov, providing a class of descendants and cyclic quiver varieties for which the capped vertex functions are purely classical. Our results also suggest certain integrality and wall-crossing conjectures for capped vertex functions.</description>

      <title>A Brill-Noether Theorem for (toric) surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The classical Brill-Noether theorem states that a map from a general curve to a projective space deforms in a family of expected dimension as long as its image does not lie in any hyperplane. In this note, we observe, as a direct consequence of standard results on Severi varieties, an analogous statement for maps from a general curve to any smooth, projective surface. Namely, a non-constant map deforms in a family of expected dimension as long as its image has anti-canonical degree at least 4.
  In the case of toric surfaces, curves of anti-canonical degree at most 3 admit a particularly elegant description in terms certain toric contractions. We raise the question of whether a Brill-Noether theorem could hold for toric varieties of higher dimension.</description>

      <title>Tschirnhausen Bundles of Quintic Covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06942v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A degree $d$ genus $g$ cover of the complex projective line by a smooth irreducible curve $C$ yields a vector bundle on the projective line by pushforward of the structure sheaf. We classify the bundles that arise this way when $d = 5$. Equivalently, we classify which $\mathbb{P}^3$-bundles over $\mathbb{P}^1$ contain smooth irreducible degree $5$ covers of $\mathbb{P}^1$.
  Our main contribution is proving the existence of \emph{smooth} covers whose structure sheaf has the desired pushforward. We do this by showing that the substack of singular curves has positive codimension in the moduli stack of finite flat covers with desired pushforward. To compute the dimension of the space of singular curves, we prove a (relative) ``minimization theorem'', which is the geometric analogue of Bhargava's sieving argument when computing the densities of discriminants of quintic number fields.</description>

      <title>A Seifert-van Kampen Theorem and the Frobenius Action on Tame Fundamental Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X = P^1_{\mathbb{F}_p}-B$, where $B$ is a divisor with $n$ distinct geometric points, and view $X$ as a $\mathbb{F}_q$-variety with $q = p^r$ for some $r$, we then obtain a short exact sequence of tame fundamental groups:
  \[1\to \pi_1^t(X_{\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}})\to \pi_1^t(X_{\mathbb{F}_q})\to \mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}/\mathbb{F}_q)\to 1.\]
  This gives rise to an action of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}/\mathbb{F}_q)$ on $\pi_1^t(X_{\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}})$ once an $\mathbb{F}_q$-point in $X_{\mathbb{F}_q}$ is fixed. Using Harbater's formal patching, we prove a version of the Seifert-van Kampen theorem, which further yields a purely algebraic description of the action of $\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}/\mathbb{F}_q)$ on the $n$ generators of $\pi_1^t(X_{\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}})$ assigned to each geometric point of $B_{\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}}$. Based on this, we give a purely algebraic computation of $\pi_1^t(X_{\overline{\mathbb{F}_q}})$, and thereby obtain an explicit description of the tame fundamental group of $X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.04419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assuming the abundance conjecture in dimension $d$, we establish a non-algebraicity criterion of foliations: any log canonical foliation of rank $\le d$ with $\nu\neq\kappa$ is not algebraically integrable, answering question of Ambro--Cascini--Shokurov--Spicer. Under the same hypothesis, we prove abundance for klt algebraically integrable adjoint foliated structures of dimension $\le d$ and show the existence of good minimal models or Mori fiber spaces. In particular, when $d=3$, all these results hold unconditionally.
  Using similar arguments, we solve a problem proposed by Lu and Wu on abundance of surface adjoint foliated structures that are not necessarily algebraically integrable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:alg-geom/9506022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper first generalises the Bogomolov-Tian-Todorov unobstructedness theorem to the case of Calabi-Yau threefolds with canonical singularities. The deformation space of such a Calabi-Yau threefold is no longer smooth, but the general principle is that the obstructions to deforming such a threefold are precisely the obstructions to deforming the singularities of the threefold. Secondly, these results are applied to smoothing singular Calabi-Yau threefolds with crepant resolutions. Any such Calabi-Yau threefold with isolated complete intersection singularities which are not ordinary double points is smoothable. A Calabi-Yau threefold with non-complete intersection isolated singularities is proved to be smoothable under much stronger hypotheses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that only finitely many Shimura curves can have gonality bounded by a given number, and we study the computability of this finite set. Motivated by the relation between hyperellipticity (that is, gonality 2) and the vanishing of the modified diagonal cycle, we conjecture that such vanishing occurs for only finitely many Shimura curves. We establish several finiteness and classification results toward this conjecture and, as a by-product, obtain explicit examples of curves with vanishing modified diagonal cycles. Our computations are based on modular form data from the database \textsf{LMFDB}, and some of them are carried out using the computer algebra system \textsf{Sage}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Riemann hierarchy is the simplest example of rank one, ($1$+$1$)-dimensional integrable system of nonlinear evolutionary PDEs. It corresponds to the dispersionless limit of the Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy. In the language of formal variational calculus, we address the classification problem for deformations of the Riemann hierarchy satisfying different extra requirements (general deformations, deformations as systems of conservation laws, Hamiltonian deformations, and tau-symmetric deformations), under the natural group of coordinate transformations preserving each of those requirements. We present several results linking previous conjectures of Dubrovin-Liu-Yang-Zhang (for the tau-symmetric case) and of Arsie-Lorenzoni-Moro (for systems of conservation laws) to the double ramification hierarchy construction of integrable hierarchies from partial CohFTs and F-CohFTs. We prove that, if the conjectures are true, DR hierarchies of rank one are universal objects in the space of deformations of the Riemann hierarchy. We also prove a weaker version of the DLYZ conjecture and that the ALM conjecture implies (the main part of) the DLYZ conjecture. Finally we characterize those rank one F-CohFTs which give rise to Hamiltonian deformations of the Riemann hierarchy.</description>

Abstract: We consider a derivation $\mathsf{D}$ on the ring $\Lambda$ of symmetric functions and investigate its combinatorial, algebraic and geometric properties. More precisely, we show that $\mathsf{D}$ restricts to a quasi-isometry, with respect to the Hall product, on the graded component of $\Lambda$ of each positive degree and provide a chain-rule formula with respect to the plethysm operation. Furthermore, we relate the geometry of the Schur functions supporting $\mathsf{D}(f)$, where $f\in \Lambda$ is an homogeneous symmetric function, to that of $f$.</description>
