      <title>Urban mobility network centrality predicts social resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cities thrive on social interactions that foster well-being, innovation, and prosperity; yet, exogenous shocks such as pandemics, hurricanes, and wildfires can severely disrupt them. Different urban venues exhibit widely divergent response patterns, raising key questions about what factors contribute to these differences and how we can anticipate and respond. Understanding these questions is crucial for safeguarding social resilience, the capacity of urban venues to maintain both visitation and diversity. In this study, we analyze large-scale human mobility data from 15 US cities covering more than 103 million residents across three distinct urban shocks. Despite a general trend of declining visitation and weakened social mixing, 36.28%-53.01% of venues exhibit reduced segregation, and 21.04%-38.55% of venues exhibit increased visitation. By constructing a mobility network interlinking types of urban venues, we reveal that eigenvector network centrality tends to indicate the provision of essential services and robustly predicts social resilience across varied urban shocks. Specifically, centrality elevates the explanatory power by more than 80% in predicting both segregation and mobility change, compared with more intuitive features. Furthermore, compared to peripheral venues, core venues featuring shorter visit distances, broader neighborhood visitation, shorter visitor dwell times, and steadier popularity throughout the day. Such patterns imply a dual social mechanism: core venues sustain social ties through frequent informal interaction, while peripheral ones facilitate deeper engagement around specialized interests and their corresponding social circles. By bridging urban mobility research with economic theories that distinguish staple from discretionary products, we propose a well-and-pool analogy that suggests how people spend their varying urban mobility budgets.</description>

      <title>UniRank: A Multi-Agent Calibration Pipeline for Estimating University Rankings from Anonymized Bibliometric Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present UniRank, a multi-agent LLM pipeline that estimates university positions across global ranking systems using only publicly available bibliometric data from OpenAlex and Semantic Scholar. The system employs a three-stage architecture: (a) zero-shot estimation from anonymized institutional metrics, (b) per-system tool-augmented calibration against real ranked universities, and (c) final synthesis. Critically, institutions are anonymized -- names, countries, DOIs, paper titles, and collaboration countries are all redacted -- and their actual ranks are hidden from the calibration tools during evaluation, preventing LLM memorization from confounding results. On the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings ($n=352$), the system achieves MAE = 251.5 rank positions, Median AE = 131.5, PNMAE = 12.03%, Spearman $\rho = 0.769$, Kendall $\tau = 0.591$, hit rate @50 = 20.7%, hit rate @100 = 39.8%, and a Memorization Index of exactly zero (no exact-match zero-width predictions among all 352 universities). The systematic positive-signed error (+190.1 positions, indicating the system consistently predicts worse ranks than actual) and monotonic performance degradation from elite tier (MAE = 60.5, hit@100 = 90.5%) to tail tier (MAE = 328.2, hit@100 = 20.8%) provide strong evidence that the pipeline performs genuine analytical reasoning rather than recalling memorized rankings.

      <title>Constrained graph generation: Preserving diameter and clustering coefficient simultaneously</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating graphs subject to strict structural constraints is a fundamental computational challenge in network science. Simultaneously preserving interacting properties-such as the diameter and the clustering coefficient- is particularly demanding. Simple constructive algorithms often fail to locate vanishingly small sets of feasible graphs, while traditional Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers suffer from severe ergodicity breaking. In this paper, we propose a two-step hybrid framework combining Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and MCMC sampling. First, we design a layered ACO heuristic to perform a guided global search, effectively locating valid graphs with prescribed diameter and clustering coefficient. Second, we use these ACO-designed graphs as structurally distinct seed states for an MCMC rewiring algorithm. We evaluate this framework across a wide range of graph edge densities and varying diameter-clustering-coefficient constraint regimes. Using the spectral distance of the normalized Laplacian to quantify structural diversity of the resulting graphs, our experiments reveal a sharp contrast between the methods. Standard MCMC samplers remain rigidly trapped in an isolated subset of feasible graphs around their initial seeds. Conversely, our hybrid ACO-MCMC approach successfully bridges disconnected configuration landscapes, generating a vastly richer and structurally diverse set of valid graphs.</description>

      <title>A Mixed-Method Framework for Evaluating the Social Impact of Community Cooperation Projects in Developing Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.20009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Why do some community-cooperation projects catalyse participation through durable, resilient collaboration networks while others result in negligible impact and leave the local social fabric unchanged? We argue outcomes hinge on participation architecture: simple, visible routines -- onboarding help, templated tasks, lightweight contribution/benefit tracking -- that create easy ``entry portals'' and route work across clusters without heavy hierarchy. We introduce Project Intervention Response Analysis (PIRA), a mixed anthropological-network-analysis framework that compares observed community networks with counterfactual networks absent from project-induced ties. PIRA also adds a new egocentric metric to detect ``architectural alters'' -- latent facilitators and boundary spanners. We begin validating PIRA in a three-month field study in Pomerini, Tanzania, where NGOs coordinated citizens, associations, and specialists. Findings indicate that sociotechnical participation architectures -- not charismatic hubs -- underwrite durable coordination. PIRA offers a reusable method to link organizational design mechanisms to formal network signatures.</description>

      <title>OpenClaw AI Agents as Informal Learners at Moltbook: Characterizing an Emergent Learning Community at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Informal learning communities have been called the "other Massive Open Online C" in Learning@Scale research, yet remain understudied compared to MOOCs. We present the first empirical study of a large-scale informal learning community composed entirely of AI agents. Moltbook, a social network exclusively for AI agents powered by autonomous agent frameworks such as OpenClaw, grew to over 2.8 million registered agents in three weeks. Analyzing 231,080 non-spam posts across three phases of community evolution, we find three key patterns. First, participation inequality is extreme from the start (comment Gini = 0.889), exceeding human community benchmarks. Second, AI agents exhibit a "broadcasting inversion": statement-to-question ratios of 8.9:1 to 9.7:1 contrast sharply with the question-driven dynamics of human learning communities, and comment-level analysis of 1.55 million comments reveals a "parallel monologue" pattern where 93% of comments are independent responses rather than threaded dialogue. Third, we document a characteristic engagement lifecycle: explosive initial growth (184K posts from 32K authors in 11 days), a spam crisis (57,093 posts deleted by the platform), and engagement decline (mean comments: 31.7 -&gt; 8.3 -&gt; 1.7) that had not reversed by the end of our observation window despite effective spam removal. Sentiment analysis reveals a selection effect: comment tone becomes more positive as engagement declines, suggesting that casual participants disengage first while committed contributors remain. These findings have direct implications for hybrid human-AI learning platforms.</description>

      <title>PerSoMed: A Large-Scale Balanced Dataset for Persian Social Media Text Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research introduces the first large-scale, well-balanced Persian social media text classification dataset, specifically designed to address the lack of comprehensive resources in this domain. The dataset comprises 36,000 posts across nine categories (Economic, Artistic, Sports, Political, Social, Health, Psychological, Historical, and Science &amp; Technology), each containing 4,000 samples to ensure balanced class distribution. Data collection involved 60,000 raw posts from various Persian social media platforms, followed by rigorous preprocessing and hybrid annotation combining ChatGPT-based few-shot prompting with human verification. To mitigate class imbalance, we employed undersampling with semantic redundancy removal and advanced data augmentation strategies integrating lexical replacement and generative prompting. We benchmarked several models, including BiLSTM, XLM-RoBERTa (with LoRA and AdaLoRA adaptations), FaBERT, SBERT-based architectures, and the Persian-specific TookaBERT (Base and Large). Experimental results show that transformer-based models consistently outperform traditional neural networks, with TookaBERT-Large achieving the best performance (Precision: 0.9622, Recall: 0.9621, F1- score: 0.9621). Class-wise evaluation further confirms robust performance across all categories, though social and political texts exhibited slightly lower scores due to inherent ambiguity. This research presents a new high-quality dataset and provides comprehensive evaluations of cutting-edge models, establishing a solid foundation for further developments in Persian NLP, including trend analysis, social behavior modeling, and user classification. The dataset is publicly available to support future research endeavors.</description>

      <title>Spiking Graph Predictive Coding for Reliable OOD Generalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphs provide a powerful basis for modeling Web-based relational data, with expressive GNNs to support the effective learning in dynamic web environments. However, real-world deployment is hindered by pervasive out-of-distribution (OOD) shifts, where evolving user activity and changing content semantics alter feature distributions and labeling criteria. These shifts often lead to unstable or overconfident predictions, undermining the trustworthiness required for Web4Good applications. Achieving reliable OOD generalization demands principled and interpretable uncertainty estimation; however, existing methods are largely post-hoc, insensitive to distribution shifts, and unable to explain where uncertainty arises especially in high-stakes settings. To address these limitations, we introduce SpIking GrapH predicTive coding (SIGHT), an uncertainty-aware plug-in graph learning module for reliable OOD Generalization. SIGHT performs iterative, error-driven correction over spiking graph states, enabling models to expose internal mismatch signals that reveal where predictions become unreliable. Across multiple graph benchmarks and diverse OOD scenarios, SIGHT consistently enhances predictive accuracy, uncertainty estimation, and interpretability when integrated with GNNs.</description>

      <title>Hypergraphs as Weighted Directed Self-Looped Graphs: Spectral Properties, Clustering, Cheeger Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraphs naturally arise when studying group relations and have been widely used in the field of machine learning. To the best of our knowledge, the recently proposed edge-dependent vertex weights (EDVW) modeling is one of the most generalized modeling methods of hypergraphs, i.e., most existing hypergraph conceptual modeling methods can be generalized as EDVW hypergraphs without information loss. However, the relevant algorithmic developments on EDVW hypergraphs remain nascent: compared to the spectral theories for graphs, its formulations are incomplete, the spectral clustering algorithms are not well-developed, and the hypergraph Cheeger Inequality is not well-defined. To this end, deriving a unified random walk-based formulation, we propose our definitions of hypergraph Rayleigh Quotient, NCut, boundary/cut, volume, and conductance, which are consistent with the corresponding definitions on graphs. Then, we prove that the normalized hypergraph Laplacian is associated with the NCut value, which inspires our proposed HyperClus-G algorithm for spectral clustering on EDVW hypergraphs. Finally, we prove that HyperClus-G can always find an approximately linearly optimal partitioning in terms of both NCut and conductance. Additionally, we provide extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings from an empirical perspective. Code of HyperClus-G is available at https://github.com/iDEA-iSAIL-Lab-UIUC/HyperClus-G.</description>

      <title>Detecting Early and Implicit Suicidal Ideation via Longitudinal and Information Environment Signals on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On social media, several individuals experiencing suicidal ideation (SI) do not disclose their distress explicitly. Instead, signs may surface indirectly through everyday posts or peer interactions. Detecting such implicit signals early is critical but remains challenging. We frame early and implicit SI as a forward-looking prediction task and develop a computational framework that models a user's information environment, consisting of both their longitudinal posting histories as well as the discourse of their socially proximal peers. We adopted a composite network centrality measure to identify top neighbors of a user, and temporally aligned the user's and neighbors' interactions -- integrating the multi-layered signals in a fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model. In a Reddit study of 1,000 (500 Case and 500 Control) users, our approach improves early and implicit SI detection by an average of 10% over all other baselines. These findings highlight that peer interactions offer valuable predictive signals and carry broader implications for designing early detection systems that capture indirect as well as masked expressions of risk in online environments.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Micro-level User Interventions on Macro-level Misinformation Spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: User interventions such as nudges, prebunking, and contextualization have been widely studied as countermeasures against misinformation, and shown to suppress individual users' sharing behavior. However, it remains unclear whether and to what extent such individual-level effects translate into reductions in collective misinformation prevalence. In this study, we incorporate user interventions as reductions in users' susceptibility within an empirically calibrated network-based misinformation diffusion model. We then systematically evaluate how intervention strength, scale, timing, target selection, and combinations of interventions affect overall misinformation prevalence through numerical simulations. The simulation results reveal that current user-level interventions may not necessarily produce sufficient collective effects. Specifically, each intervention alone only modestly suppresses misinformation prevalence, and even when design adjustments such as expanding intervention scale, implementing interventions earlier, or strategically selecting target users are introduced, the resulting gains in suppression remain limited. Although combining multiple interventions improves the suppression effect compared to using each intervention alone, achieving substantial reductions in misinformation prevalence remains difficult within realistically attainable intervention levels. This study quantitatively clarifies the gap between micro-level user interventions and macro-level misinformation spread, and demonstrates the limitations of evaluating misinformation countermeasures based solely on individual-level effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Grassroots Federation: Fair Democratic Governance at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02208v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for the fair democratic governance of federated digital communities that form and evolve dynamically, where small groups self-govern and larger groups are represented by assemblies selected via sortition. Prior work addressed static fairness conditions; here, we formalize a dynamic setting where federations evolve over time through communities forming, joining, and splitting, in all directions-bottom-up, top-down, and middle-out-and adapt the fairness guarantees. The main technical challenge is reconciling integral seat allocations with dynamic, overlapping federations, so that child communities always meet their persistent floors while long-run averages converge to proportional fairness. Overcoming these challenges, we introduce a protocol that ensures fair participation and representation both persistently (at all times) and eventually (in the limit after stabilization), extending the static fairness properties to handle structural changes.
  Prior work shows that grassroots federations can be specified via atomic transactions among assembly members, and that Constitutional Consensus can realize both these transactions and the democratic processes leading to them. Together, the four works form a complete design for an egalitarian, fairly governed, large-scale decentralized sovereign digital community platform.</description>

      <title>Unfolded Laplacian Spectral Embedding: A Theoretically Grounded Approach to Dynamic Network Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamic relational data arise in many machine learning applications, yet their evolving structure poses challenges for learning representations that remain consistent and interpretable over time. A common approach is to learn time varying node embeddings, whose usefulness depends on well defined stability properties across nodes and across time. We introduce Unfolded Laplacian Spectral Embedding (ULSE), a principled extension of unfolded adjacency spectral embedding to normalized Laplacian operators, a setting where stability guarantees have remained out of reach. We prove that ULSE satisfies both cross-sectional and longitudinal stability under a dynamic stochastic block model. Moreover, the Laplacian formulation yields a dynamic Cheeger-type inequality linking the spectrum of the unfolded normalized Laplacian to worst case conductance over time, providing structural insight into the embeddings. Empirical results on synthetic and real world dynamic networks validate the theory.</description>

      <title>The Price-Pareto growth model of networks with community structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new analytical framework for modelling degree sequences in individual communities of real-world networks, e.g., citations to papers in different fields. Our work is inspired by a recent modification of the Price's model, which assumes that citations are gained partly accidentally, and to some extent preferentially. Our work addresses the need to represent the heterogeneity of various scientific domains, as standard homogeneous models fail to capture the distinct growth ratios and citing cultures of different fields. Extending the model to networks with a community structure allows us to devise the analytical formulae for, amongst others, citation counts in each cluster and their inequality as described by the Gini index. We also show that a citation count distribution in each community tends to a Pareto type II distribution. Thanks to the derived model parameter estimators, the new model can be fitted to real citation and similar networks.</description>

      <title>Strategic Expression, Popularity Traps, and Welfare in Social Media</title>

Abstract: Social media platforms systematically reward popularity over authenticity, incentivizing users to strategically tailor their expression for attention. In this paper, we introduce (i) an attention-seeking model, distinct from canonical mechanisms of conformity, learning, persuasion, and (mis)information transmission in social networks literature, and (ii) the first utilitarian framework defined directly over observable social media platform metrics, filling a critical gap in the social media literature. In the model, agents hold fixed heterogeneous authentic opinions and derive (i) utility gains from the popularity of their own posts -- measured by likes received, and (ii) utility gains (losses) from exposure to content that aligns with (diverges from) their authentic opinion. Social media interaction acts as a state-dependent welfare amplifier: light topics generate Pareto improvements, whereas intense topics make everyone worse off in a polarized society (e.g., political debates during elections). Moreover, strategic expression amplifies social media polarization during polarized events while dampening it during unified events (e.g., national celebrations). Consequently, strategic distortions magnify welfare outcomes, expanding aggregate gains in light topics while exacerbating losses in intense, polarized ones. Counterintuitively, strategic agents often face a popularity trap: posting a more popular opinion is individually optimal, yet collective action by similar agents eliminates their authentic opinion from the platform, leaving them worse off than under the authentic-expression benchmark. Preference-based algorithms -- widely used by platforms -- or homophilic exposures discipline popularity-driven behavior, narrowing the popularity trap region and limiting its welfare effects.</description>

      <title>Governing Social Media as a Public Utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12535v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms connect billions, but their business models often amplify societal harm through misinformation, which is linked to polarization, violence, and declining mental health. Current governance frameworks, such as the U.S. Section 230 and the EU Digital Services Act, delegate content moderation to corporations. This creates structural conflicts of interest because misinformation drives engagement, and engagement drives profit. We propose a public utility model for social media governance that prioritizes the public good over commercial incentives. Integrating legislated content removal with democratic content moderation, the model protects free expression while mitigating societal harms. It frames social media as sovereign digital infrastructure governed through democratic oversight, transparent algorithms, and institutional safeguards.</description>

      <title>Buy versus Build an LLM: A Decision Framework for Governments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a new frontier of digital infrastructure that can support a wide range of public-sector applications, from general purpose citizen services to specialized and sensitive state functions. When expanding AI access, governments face a set of strategic choices over whether to buy existing services, build domestic capabilities, or adopt hybrid approaches across different domains and use cases. These are critical decisions especially when leading model providers are often foreign corporations, and LLM outputs are increasingly treated as trusted inputs to public decision-making and public discourse. In practice, these decisions are not intended to mandate a single approach across all domains; instead, national AI strategies are typically pluralistic, with sovereign, commercial and open-source models coexisting to serve different purposes. Governments may rely on commercial models for non-sensitive or commodity tasks, while pursuing greater control for critical, high-risk or strategically important applications.
  This paper provides a strategic framework for making this decision by evaluating these options across dimensions including sovereignty, safety, cost, resource capability, cultural fit, and sustainability. Importantly, "building" does not imply that governments must act alone: domestic capabilities may be developed through public research institutions, universities, state-owned enterprises, joint ventures, or broader national ecosystems. By detailing the technical requirements and practical challenges of each pathway, this work aims to serve as a reference for policy-makers to determine whether a buy or build approach best aligns with their specific national needs and societal goals.</description>
