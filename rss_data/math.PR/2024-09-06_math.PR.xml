      <title>Rank fluctuations of matrix products and a moment method for growing groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the cokernel $G_n = \mathbf{Cok}(A_{k} \cdots A_2 A_1)$ of a product of independent $n \times n$ random integer matrices with iid entries from generic nondegenerate distributions, in the regime where both $n$ and $k$ are sent to $\infty$ simultaneously. In this regime we show that the cokernel statistics converge universally to the reflecting Poisson sea, an interacting particle system constructed in arXiv:2312.11702, at the level of $1$-point marginals. In particular, $\operatorname{corank}(A_{k} \cdots A_2 A_1 \pmod{p}) \sim \log_p k$, and its fluctuations are $O(1)$ and converge to a discrete random variable defined in arXiv:2310.12275.
  The main difference with previous works studying cokernels of random matrices is that $G_n$ does not converge to a random finite group; for instance, the $p$-rank of $G_n$ diverges. This means that the usual moment method for random groups does not apply. Instead, we proceed by proving a `rescaled moment method' theorem applicable to a general sequence of random groups of growing size. This result establishes that fluctuations of $p$-ranks and other statistics still converge to limit random variables, provided that certain rescaled moments $\mathbb{E}[\#\operatorname{Hom}(G_n,H)]/C(n,H)$ converge.</description>

      <title>$SLE_6$ and 2-d critical bond percolation on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through the rotational invariance of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice we express Smirnov's edge parafermionic observable as a sum of two new edge observables. With the help of these two new edge observables we can apply the discrete harmonic analysis and conformal mapping theory to prove the convergence of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice to the trace of $SLE_6$ as the mesh size of the lattice tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Branching processes and bacterial growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We model the growth of a cell population using a piecewise deterministic Markov branching tree. In this model, each cell splits into two offspring at a division rate $B(x)$, which depends on its size $x$. The size of each cell increases exponentially over time, with a growth rate that varies for each individual. Expanding upon the model studied in \cite{hof}, we introduce a scenario with two types of bacteria: those with a young pole and those with an old pole. Additionally, we account for the possibility that a bacterium may not always divide into exactly two offspring. We will demonstrate that our branching process is well-defined and that it satisfies a many-to-one formula. Furthermore, we establish that the mean empirical measure of the model adheres to a growth-fragmentation equation when structured by size, growth rate, and type as state variables.</description>

      <title>Small gaps of GSE</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the smallest gaps for the Gaussian symplectic ensemble (GSE). We prove that the rescaled smallest gaps and their locations converge to a Poisson point process with an explicit rate. The approach provides an alternative proof for the GOE case and complements the results in \cite{FTW}. By combining the main results from \cite{BB, FTW, FW2}, the study of the smallest gaps for the classical random matrix ensembles C$\beta$E and G$\beta$E for $\beta = 1, 2,$ and $4$ is now complete.</description>

      <title>Emergence of regularity for limit points of McKean-Vlasov particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The empirical measure of an interacting particle system is a purely atomic random probability measure. In the limit as the number of particles grows to infinity, we show for McKean-Vlasov systems with common noise that this measure becomes absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure for almost all times, almost surely. The density possesses good regularity properties, and we obtain a moment bound for its (random) fractional Sobolev norm. This result is obtained for dynamics with a bounded drift, bounded and H\"older-continuous diffusion coefficients and when the diffusion coefficient for the idiosyncratic noise is uniformly elliptic. We directly study the sequence of particle systems via approximating their exchangeable dynamics by conditionally independent dynamics at the expense of an error. By using probabilistic means, the approximation and the error are controlled for each particle system, and the results are then passed to the large-system limit. The estimates thus obtained are combined via an analytic interpolation technique to derive a norm bound for the limiting random density. In this way, we obtain a regularity estimate for all cluster points, without requiring any knowledge of the dynamics of the limiting measure-valued flow.</description>

      <title>Variance reduction in Texas hold'em and in video poker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Texas hold'em, after an all-in bet is made and called before the flop, the turn, or the river, the two players sometimes agree to run it $n$ times, meaning that the remaining five, two, or one cards are dealt out $n$ times successively, with $1/n$ of the pot attached to each run. In $n$-play video poker, five cards are dealt exactly as in the conventional single-play game. After the player chooses which cards to hold, new cards are drawn to replace the discards, not just once but $n$ times independently, with $1/n$ of the bet attached to each draw. In both scenarios the players are attempting to reduce the variance of the return without changing the mean. We quantify the extent to which the variance is reduced.</description>

      <title>Periodic Pitman transforms and jointly invariant measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct explicit jointly invariant measures for the periodic KPZ equation (and therefore also the stochastic Burgers' and stochastic heat equations) for general slope parameters and prove their uniqueness via a one force--one solution principle. The measures are given by polymer-like transforms of independent Brownian bridges. We describe several properties and limits of these measures, including an extension to a continuous process in the slope parameter that we term the periodic KPZ horizon. As an application of our construction, we prove a Gaussian process limit theorem with an explicit covariance function for the long-time height function fluctuations of the periodic KPZ equation when started from varying slopes. In connection with this, we conjecture a formula for the fluctuations of cumulants of the endpoint distribution for the periodic continuum directed random polymer.
  To prove joint invariance, we address the analogous problem for a semi-discrete system of SDEs related to the periodic O'Connell-Yor polymer model and then perform a scaling limit of the model and jointly invariant measures. For the semi-discrete system, we demonstrate a bijection that maps our systems of SDEs to another system with product invariant measure. Inverting the map on this product measure yields our invariant measures. This map relates to a periodic version of the discrete geometric Pitman transform that we introduce and probe. As a by-product of this, we show that the jointly invariant measures for a periodic version of the inverse-gamma polymer are the same as those for the O'Connell-Yor polymer.</description>

      <title>Strong asymptotic freeness of Haar unitaries in quasi-exponential dimensional representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove almost sure strong asymptotic freeness of i.i.d. random unitaries with the following law: sample a Haar unitary matrix of dimension $n$ and then send this unitary into an irreducible representation of $U(n)$. The strong convergence holds as long as the irreducible representation arises from a pair of partitions of total size at most $n^{\frac{1}{24}-\varepsilon}$ and is uniform in this regime.
  Previously this was known for partitions of total size up to $\asymp\log n/\log\log n$ by a result of Bordenave and Collins.</description>

      <title>On moments of the derivative of CUE characteristic polynomials and the Riemann zeta function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the derivative of the characteristic polynomial of $N \times N$ Haar distributed unitary matrices. In the limit $N \to \infty$, we give a formula for general non-integer moments of the derivative for values of the spectral variable inside the unit disc. The formula we obtain is given in terms of a confluent hypergeometric function. We give an extension of this result to joint moments taken at different points, again valid for non-integer moment orders. For integer moments, our results simplify and are expressed as a single Laguerre polynomial. Using these moment formulae, we derive the mean counting function of zeros of the derivative in the limit $N \to \infty$. This motivated us to consider related questions for the derivative of the Riemann zeta function. Assuming the Lindel\"of hypothesis, we show that integer moments away from but approaching the critical line agree with our random matrix results. Within random matrix theory, we obtain an explicit expression for the integer moments, for finite matrix size, as a sum over partitions. We use this to obtain asymptotic formulae in a regime where the spectral variable approaches or is on the unit circle.</description>

      <title>Spectra of adjacency and Laplacian matrices of Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study adjacency and Laplacian matrices of Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi $r$-uniform hypergraphs on $n$ vertices with hyperedge inclusion probability $p$, in the setting where $r$ can vary with $n$ such that $r / n \to c \in [0, 1)$. Adjacency matrices of hypergraphs are contractions of adjacency tensors and their entries exhibit long range correlations. We show that under the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi model, the expected empirical spectral distribution of an appropriately normalised hypergraph adjacency matrix converges weakly to the semi-circle law with variance $(1 - c)^2$ as long as $\frac{d_{\avg}}{r^7} \to \infty$, where $d_{\avg} = \binom{n-1}{r-1} p$. In contrast with the Erd\H{o}s-R\'{e}nyi random graph ($r = 2$), two eigenvalues stick out of the bulk of the spectrum. When $r$ is fixed and $d_{\avg} \gg n^{r - 2} \log^4 n$, we uncover an interesting Baik-Ben Arous-P\'{e}ch\'{e} (BBP) phase transition at the value $r = 3$. For $r \in \{2, 3\}$, an appropriately scaled largest (resp. smallest) eigenvalue converges in probability to $2$ (resp. $-2$), the right (resp. left) end point of the support of the standard semi-circle law, and when $r \ge 4$, it converges to $\sqrt{r - 2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{r - 2}}$ (resp. $-\sqrt{r - 2} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{r - 2}}$). Further, in a Gaussian version of the model we show that an appropriately scaled largest (resp. smallest) eigenvalue converges in distribution to $\frac{c}{2} \zeta + \big[\frac{c^2}{4}\zeta^2 + c(1 - c)\big]^{1/2}$ (resp. $\frac{c}{2} \zeta - \big[\frac{c^2}{4}\zeta^2 + c(1 - c)\big]^{1/2}$), where $\zeta$ is a standard Gaussian. We also establish analogous results for the bulk and edge eigenvalues of the associated Laplacian matrices.</description>

      <title>Modelling the age distribution of longevity leaders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human longevity leaders with remarkably long lifespan play a crucial role in the advancement of longevity research. In this paper, we propose a stochastic model to describe the evolution of the age of the oldest person in the world by a Markov process, in which we assume that the births of the individuals follow a Poisson process with increasing intensity, lifespans of individuals are independent and can be characterized by a gamma-Gompertz distribution with time-dependent parameters. We utilize a dataset of the world's oldest person title holders since 1955, and we compute the maximum likelihood estimate for the parameters iteratively by numerical integration. Based on our preliminary estimates, the model provides a good fit to the data and shows that the age of the oldest person alive increases over time in the future. The estimated parameters enable us to describe the distribution of the age of the record holder process at a future time point.</description>

Abstract: We obtain strong converse inequalities for the Bernstein polynomials with explicit asymptotic constants. We give different estimation procedures in the central and non-central regions of [0,1]. The main ingredients in our approach are the following: representation of the derivatives of the Bernstein polynomials in terms of the Krawtchouk polynomials, estimates of different inverse moments of various random variables, sharp estimates of both absolute central moments of Bernstein polynomials and the total variation distance between binomial and Poisson distributions, and iterates of the Bernstein polynomials, together with their probabilistic representations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the regimes where an Erdos-Renyi random graph has torsion free eulerian magnitude homology groups. To this end, we start be introducing the eulerian Asao-Izumihara complex - a quotient CW-complex whose homology groups are isomorphic to direct summands of the graph eulerian magnitude homology group. We then proceed by producing a vanishing threshold for a shelling of eulerian Asao-Izumihara complex. This will lead to a result establishing the regimes where eulerian magnitude homology of Erdos-Renyi random graphs is torsion free.</description>

      <title>On the mean field limit of consensus based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consensus based optimization (CBO) employs a swarm of particles evolving as a system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs). Recently, it has been adapted to yield a derivative free sampling method referred to as consensus based sampling (CBS). In this paper, we investigate the ``mean field limit'' of a class of consensus methods, including CBO and CBS. This limit allows to characterize the system's behavior as the number of particles approaches infinity. Building upon prior work such as (Huang and Qiu, 2022), we establish the existence of a unique, strong solution for these finite-particle SDEs. We further provide uniform moment estimates, which allow to show a Fokker-Planck equation in the mean-field limit. Finally, we prove that the limiting McKean-Vlasov type SDE related to the Fokker-Planck equation admits a unique solution.</description>

      <title>Derivation of normal forms for dispersive PDEs via arborification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a systematic derivation of normal forms for dispersive equations using decorated trees introduced in arXiv:2005.01649. The key tool is the arborification map which is a morphism from the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra to the Shuffle Hopf algebra. It originates from Ecalle's approach to dynamical systems with singularities. This natural map has been used in many applications ranging from algebra, numerical analysis and rough paths. This connection shows that Hopf algebras also appear naturally in the context of dispersive equations and provide insights into some crucial decomposition.</description>

      <title>The Kneser--Poulsen phenomena for entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kneser--Poulsen conjecture asserts that the volume of a union of balls in Euclidean space cannot be increased by bringing their centres pairwise closer. We prove that its natural information-theoretic counterpart is true. This follows from a complete answer to a question asked in arXiv:2210.12842 about Gaussian convolutions, namely that the R\'enyi entropy comparisons between a probability measure and its contractive image are preserved when both undergo simultaneous heat flow.</description>

      <title>The loop equations for noncommutative geometries on quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a path integral over Dirac operators that averages over noncommutative geometries on a fixed graph, as the title reveals, partially using quiver representations. We prove algebraic relations that are satisfied by the expectation value of the respective observables, computed in terms of integrals over unitary groups, with weights given by the spectral action. These equations generalise the Makeenko-Migdal equations -- the constraints of lattice gauge theory -- from lattices to arbitrary graphs. As a perspective, these constraints are combined with positivity conditions (on a matrix of parametrised by composition of Wilson loops). A simple example of this combination known as `bootstrap' is fully worked out.</description>

Abstract: We study projection determinantal point processes and their connection to the squared Grassmannian. We prove that the log-likelihood function of this statistical model has $(n - 1)!/2$ critical points, all of which are real and positive, thereby settling a conjecture of Devriendt, Friedman, Reinke, and Sturmfels.</description>

      <title>Non-local heat equation with moving boundary and curve-crossing of delayed Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.09850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a non-local (in time) heat equation on a time-increasing parabolic set whose boundary is determined by a suitable curve. We provide a notion of solution for this equation and we study well-posedness under Dirichlet conditions outside the domain. A maximum principle is proved and used to derive uniqueness and continuity with respect to the initial datum of the solutions of the Dirichlet problem. Existence is proved by showing a stochastic representation based on the delayed Brownian motion killed on the boundary. Related properties on crossing probabilities of the delayed Brownian motion are obtained. The asymptotic behaviour of the mean square displacement of the process is determined, showing that the diffusive behaviour is anomalous.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic limit of the multi-component slow boundary WASEP with collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the hydrodynamic limit for a stochastic interacting particle system whose dynamics consists in a superposition of several dynamics: the exclusion rule, that dictates that no more than a particle per site with a fixed velocity is allowed; a collision dynamics, that dictates that particles at the same site can collide and originate particles with new velocities such that the linear momentum is conserved; a boundary dynamics that injects and removes particle in the system. This last dynamics destroys the conservation law, and its strength is regulated by a parameter $\theta$. The goal is the derivation of the hydrodynamic limit, and the boundary conditions change drastically according to the value of $\theta$.</description>

      <title>Quasi-limiting behaviour of the sub-critical Multitype Bisexual Galton-Watson Branching Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quasi-limiting behaviour of bisexual subcritical Galton-Watson branching processes. While classical subcritical Galton-Watson processes have been extensively analyzed, bisexual Galton-Watson branching processes present unique difficulties because of the lack of the branching property. To prove the existence of and convergence to one or several quasi-stationary distributions, we leverage on recent developments linking bisexual Galton-Watson branching processes extinction to the eigenvalue of a concave operator.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we resolve a question of D'Achille, Curien, Enriquez, Lyons, and \"Unel by showing that the cells of the ideal Poisson Voronoi tessellation are indistinguishable. This follows from an application of the Howe-Moore theorem and a theorem of Meyerovitch about the nonexistence of thinnings of the Poisson point process. We also give an alternative proof of Meyerovitch's theorem.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for orthonormal functions and probabilistic convergence of density functions of compact operators on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish some Strichartz estimates for orthonormal functions and probabilistic convergence of density functions related to compact operators on manifolds. Firstly, we present the suitable bound of $\int_{a\leq|s|\leq b}e^{isx}s^{-1+i\gamma}ds$ for the cases $\gamma \in \mathbb{R},a\geq0,b&gt;0,$ $\gamma \in \mathbb{R},\gamma\neq0,a,b\in \mathbb{R}$ and $\gamma \in \mathbb{R}$, which extends the result of Page 204 of Vega (199-211,IMA Vol. Math. Appl., 42, 1992.) Secondly, we prove that $\left|\gamma\int_{a}^{b}e^{isx}s^{-1+i\gamma}ds\right|\leq C(1+|\gamma|)^{2}(\gamma \in \mathbb{R},a,b\in \mathbb{R}),$ where $C$ is independent of $\gamma,a, b$, which extends Lemma 1 of Bez et al. (Forum of Mathematics, Sigma, 9(2021), 1-52). Thirdly, we extend the result of Theorems 8, 9 of R. Frank, J. Sabin (Amer. J. Math. 139(2017), 1649-1691.) with the aid of the suitable bound of the above complex integrals established in this paper. Fourthly, we establish the Strichartz estimates for orthonormal functions related to Boussinesq operator on the real line for both small time interval and large time interval and on the torus with small time interval; we also establish the convergence result of some compact operators in Schatten norm. Fifthly, we establish the convergence result related to nonlinear part of the solution to some operator equations in Schatten spaces. Finally, inspired by the work of Hadama and Yamamoto (Probabilistic Strichartz estimates in Schatten classes and their applications to Hartree equation, arxiv:2311.02713v1.), for $\gamma_{0}\in \mathfrak{S}^{2}$, we establish the probabilistic convergence of density functions of compact operator on manifolds with full randomization, which improves the result of Corollary 1.2 of Bez et al. (Selecta Math. 26(2020), 24 pp) in the probabilistic sense.</description>

      <title>Malliavin calculus on the Clifford algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00715v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deal with Malliavin calculus on the $L^2$ space of the $W^*$-algebra generated by fermion fields (the Clifford algebra). First, we verify the product formula for multiple integrals in It\^o-Clifford calculus, which is It\^o calculus on the Clifford algebra. Using this product formula, we can define the derivation operator and the divergence operator. Anti-symmetric Malliavin calculus thus constructed has properties similar to those of usual Malliavin calculus. The derivation operator and the divergence operator satisfy the canonical anti-commutation relations, and the divergence operator serves as an extension of the It\^o-Clifford stochastic integral, satisfying the Clark-Ocone formula. Subsequently, using this calculus, we consider the concentration inequality, the logarithmic Sobolev inequality, and the fourth-moment theorem. As for the logarithmic Sobolev inequality, only a weaker result is obtained. On the other hand, as for the concentration inequality, we obtain results that are almost similar to those of the usual case; moreover, the results concerning the fourth-moment theorem imply that, unlike in the case of the usual Brownian motion, convergence in distribution cannot be deduced from the convergence of the fourth moment.</description>

      <title>Discrete stochastic maximal $ L^p $-regularity and convergence of a spatial semidiscretization for a stochastic parabolic equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04615v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the boundedness of the \( H^\infty \)-calculus for the negative discrete Laplace operator subject to homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. The discrete Laplace operator is realized via the finite element method, and we demonstrate that its \( H^\infty \)-calculus is uniformly bounded with respect to the spatial mesh size. Using this result, we deduce the discrete stochastic maximal \( L^p \)-regularity estimate for a spatial semidiscretization. Additionally, we provide (almost) optimal error estimates for the semidiscretization under a broad class of spatial \( L^q \)-norms.</description>

      <title>The Gerber-Shiu Expected Discounted Penalty Function: An Application to Poverty Trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider a risk process to model the capital of a household. Our work focuses on the analysis of the trapping time of such a process, where trapping occurs when a household's capital level falls into the poverty area. A function analogous to the classical Gerber-Shiu function is introduced, which incorporates information on the trapping time, the capital surplus immediately before trapping and the capital deficit at trapping. We derive, under some assumptions, a model belonging to the family of generalised beta (GB) distributions that describes the distribution of the capital deficit at trapping given that trapping occurs. Affinities between the capital deficit at trapping and a class of poverty measures, known as the Foster-Greer-Thorbecke (FGT) index, are presented. The versatility of this model to estimate FGT indices is assessed using household microdata from Burkina Faso's Enqu\^ete Multisectorielle Continue (EMC) 2014.</description>
