      <title>A Lightweight Deep Learning-based Model for Ranking Influential Nodes in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying influential nodes in complex networks is a critical task with a wide range of applications across different domains. However, existing approaches often face trade-offs between accuracy and computational efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose 1D-CGS, a lightweight and effective hybrid model that integrates the speed of one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1D-CNN) with the topological representation power of GraphSAGE for efficient node ranking. The model uses a lightweight input representation built on two straightforward and significant topological features: node degree and average neighbor degree. These features are processed through 1D convolutions to extract local patterns, followed by GraphSAGE layers to aggregate neighborhood information. We formulate the node ranking task as a regression problem and use the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to generate ground truth influence scores. 1D-CGS is initially trained on synthetic networks generated by the Barabasi-Albert model and then applied to real world networks for identifying influential nodes. Experimental evaluations on twelve real world networks demonstrate that 1D-CGS significantly outperforms traditional centrality measures and recent deep learning models in ranking accuracy, while operating in very fast runtime. The proposed model achieves an average improvement of 4.73% in Kendall's Tau correlation and 7.67% in Jaccard Similarity over the best performing deep learning baselines. It also achieves an average Monotonicity Index (MI) score 0.99 and produces near perfect rank distributions, indicating highly unique and discriminative rankings. Furthermore, all experiments confirm that 1D-CGS operates in a highly reasonable time, running significantly faster than existing deep learning methods, making it suitable for large scale applications.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Closed Loop Dynamics Between a Social Media Recommender System and Users' Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a mathematical model to study the coupled dynamics of a Recommender System (RS) algorithm and content consumers (users). The model posits that a large population of users, each with an opinion, consumes personalised content recommended by the RS. The RS can select from a range of content to recommend, based on users' past engagement, while users can engage with the content (like, watch), and in doing so, users' opinions evolve. This occurs repeatedly to capture the endless content available for user consumption on social media. We employ a campaign of Monte Carlo simulations using this model to study how recommender systems influence users' opinions, and in turn how users' opinions shape the subsequent recommended content. We take an interest in both the performance of the RS (e.g., how users engage with the content) and the user's opinions, focusing on polarisation and radicalisation of opinions. We find that different opinion distributions are more susceptible to becoming polarised than others, many content stances are ineffective in changing user opinions, and creating viral content is an effective measure in combating polarisation of opinions.</description>

      <title>Studying Disinformation Narratives on Social Media with LLMs and Semantic Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis develops a continuous scale measurement of similarity to disinformation narratives that can serve to detect disinformation and capture the nuanced, partial truths that are characteristic of it. To do so, two tools are developed and their methodologies are documented. The tracing tool takes tweets and a target narrative, rates the similarities of each to the target narrative, and graphs it as a timeline. The second narrative synthesis tool clusters tweets above a similarity threshold and generates the dominant narratives within each cluster. These tools are combined into a Tweet Narrative Analysis Dashboard. The tracing tool is validated on the GLUE STS-B benchmark, and then the two tools are used to analyze two case studies for further empirical validation. The first case study uses the target narrative "The 2020 election was stolen" and analyzes a dataset of Donald Trump's tweets during 2020. The second case study uses the target narrative, "Transgender people are harmful to society" and analyzes tens of thousands of tweets from the media outlets The New York Times, The Guardian, The Gateway Pundit, and Fox News. Together, the empirical findings from these case studies demonstrate semantic similarity for nuanced disinformation detection, tracing, and characterization.

      <title>A Blockchain-Based Quality Control Model for Online Collaboration Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative content generation (CCG) enables collective creation of artifacts like scientific articles. Quality is a paramount concern in CCG, and a multitude of methods have been proposed to evaluate the quality of artifacts. Nevertheless, the majority of these methods are reliant on centralized architectures, which present challenges pertaining to security, privacy, and availability. Blockchain technology proffers a potential resolution to these challenges, by furnishing a decentralized and immutable ledger of quality scores. In this manuscript, we introduce a blockchain-based quality control model for CCG that uses a semi-iterative algorithm to interdependently compute quality scores of artifacts and reputation of nodes. Our model addresses critical challenges in academic informetrics, such as citation manipulation, transparency in collaborative scholarship, and decentralized trust in metric computation. Our model also exhibits sensitivity to processing latency, rendering it more agile in the presence of delays. Our model's quality scores, evaluated against PageRank and HITS baselines, show comparable performance, with additional assessments of throughput, latency, and robustness against malicious nodes confirming its reliability. A theoretical comparison with recent studies validates its feasibility for real world informetric application.</description>

      <title>Structural-Aware Key Node Identification in Hypergraphs via Representation Learning and Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evaluating node importance is a critical aspect of analyzing complex systems, with broad applications in digital marketing, rumor suppression, and disease control. However, existing methods typically rely on conventional network structures and fail to capture the polyadic interactions intrinsic to many real-world systems. To address this limitation, we study key node identification in hypergraphs, where higher-order interactions are naturally modeled as hyperedges. We propose a novel framework, AHGA, which integrates an Autoencoder for extracting higher-order structural features, a HyperGraph neural network-based pre-training module (HGNN), and an Active learning-based fine-tuning process. This fine-tuning step plays a vital role in mitigating the gap between synthetic and real-world data, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and generalization across diverse hypergraph topologies. Extensive experiments on eight empirical hypergraphs show that AHGA outperforms classical centrality-based baselines by approximately 37.4%. Furthermore, the nodes identified by AHGA exhibit both high influence and strong structural disruption capability, demonstrating their superiority in detecting multifunctional nodes.</description>

      <title>Wardropian Cycles make traffic assignment both optimal and fair by eliminating price-of-anarchy with Cyclical User Equilibrium for compliant connected autonomous vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connected and Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) open the possibility for centralised routing with full compliance, making System Optimal traffic assignment attainable. However, as System Optimum makes some drivers better off than others, voluntary acceptance seems dubious. To overcome this issue, we propose a new concept of Wardropian cycles, which, in contrast to previous utopian visions, makes the assignment fair on top of being optimal, which amounts to satisfaction of both Wardrop's principles. Such cycles, represented as sequences of permutations to the daily assignment matrices, always exist and equalise, after a limited number of days, average travel times among travellers (like in User Equilibrium) while preserving everyday optimality of path flows (like in System Optimum). We propose exact methods to compute such cycles and reduce their length and within-cycle inconvenience to the users. As identification of optimal cycles turns out to be NP-hard in many aspects, we introduce a greedy heuristic efficiently approximating the optimal solution. Finally, we introduce and discuss a new paradigm of Cyclical User Equilibrium, which ensures stability of optimal Wardropian Cycles under unilateral deviations.
  We complement our theoretical study with large-scale simulations. In Barcelona, 670 vehicle-hours of Price-of-Anarchy are eliminated using cycles with a median length of 11 days-though 5% of cycles exceed 90 days. However, in Berlin, just five days of applying the greedy assignment rule significantly reduces initial inequity. In Barcelona, Anaheim, and Sioux Falls, less than 7% of the initial inequity remains after 10 days, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in improving traffic performance with more ubiquitous social acceptability.</description>

      <title>FlashGuard: Novel Method in Evaluating Differential Characteristics of Visual Stimuli for Deterring Seizure Triggers in Photosensitive Epilepsy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the virtual realm, individuals with photosensitive epilepsy (PSE) encounter challenges when using devices, resulting in exposure to unpredictable seizure-causing visual stimuli. The current norm for preventing epileptic flashes in media is to detect asynchronously when a flash will occur in a video, then notifying the user. However, there is a lack of a real-time and computationally efficient solution for dealing with this issue. To address this issue and enhance accessibility for photosensitive viewers, FlashGuard, a novel approach, was devised to assess the rate of change of colors in frames across the user's screen and appropriately mitigate stimuli, based on perceptually aligned color space analysis in the CIELAB color space. The detection system is built on analyzing differences in color, and the mitigation system works by reducing luminance and smoothing color transitions. This study provides novel insight into how intrinsic color properties contribute to perceptual differences in flashing for PSE individuals, calling for the adoption of broadened WCAG guidelines to better account for risk. These insights and implementations pave the way for stronger protections for individuals with PSE from dangerous triggers in digital media, both in policy and in software.</description>

      <title>Flexible Bidding in Service-Oriented Combinatorial Spectrum Forward Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional combinatorial spectrum auctions mainly rely on fixed bidding and matching processes, which limit participants' ability to adapt their strategies and often result in suboptimal social welfare in dynamic spectrum sharing environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approximately truthful combinatorial forward auction scheme with a flexible bidding mechanism aimed at enhancing resource efficiency and maximizing social welfare. In the proposed scheme, each buyer submits a combinatorial bid consisting of the base spectrum demand and adjustable demand ranges, enabling the auctioneer to dynamically optimize spectrum allocation in response to market conditions. To standardize the valuation across heterogeneous frequency bands, we introduce a Spectrum Equivalent Mapping (SEM) coefficient. A greedy matching algorithm is employed to determine winning bids by sorting buyers based on their equivalent unit bid prices and allocating resources within supply constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed flexible bidding mechanism significantly outperforms existing benchmark methods, achieving notably higher social welfare in dynamic spectrum sharing scenarios.</description>

      <title>Democracy for DAOs: An Empirical Study of Decentralized Governance and Dynamic (Case Study Internet Computer SNS Ecosystem)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) rely on governance mechanism without centralized leadership. This paper presents an empirical study of user behavior in governance for a variety of DAOs, ranging from DeFi to gaming, using the Internet Computer Protocol DAO framework called SNS (Service Nervous System). To analyse user engagement, we measure participation rates and frequency of proposals submission and voter approval rates. We evaluate decision duration times to determine DAO agility. To investigate dynamic aspects, we also measure metric shifts in time. We evaluate over 3,000 proposals submitted in a time frame of 20 months from 14 SNS DAOs. The selected DAO have been existing between 6 and 20 months and cover a wide spectrum of use cases, treasury sizes, and number of participants. We also compare our results for SNS DAOs with DAOs from other blockchain platforms. While approval rates are generally high for all DAOs studied, SNS DAOs show slightly more alignment. We observe that the SNS governance mechanisms and processes in ICP lead to higher activity, lower costs and faster decisions. Most importantly, in contrast to studies which report a decline in participation over time for other frameworks, SNS DAOs exhibit sustained or increasing engagement levels over time.</description>

      <title>Improving Community Detection in Academic Networks by Handling Publication Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding potential research collaborators is a challenging task, especially in today's fast-growing and interdisciplinary research landscape. While traditional methods often rely on observable relationships such as co-authorships and citations to construct the research network, in this work, we focus solely on publication content to build a topic-based research network using BERTopic with a fine-tuned SciBERT model that connects and recommends researchers across disciplines based on shared topical interests. A major challenge we address is publication imbalance, where some researchers publish much more than others, often across several topics. Without careful handling, their less frequent interests are hidden under dominant topics, limiting the network's ability to detect their full research scope. To tackle this, we introduce a cloning strategy that clusters a researcher's publications and treats each cluster as a separate node. This allows researchers to be part of multiple communities, improving the detection of interdisciplinary links. Evaluation on the proposed method shows that the cloned network structure leads to more meaningful communities and uncovers a broader set of collaboration opportunities.</description>

      <title>FHSTP@EXIST 2025 Benchmark: Sexism Detection with Transparent Speech Concept Bottleneck Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sexism has become widespread on social media and in online conversation. To help address this issue, the fifth Sexism Identification in Social Networks (EXIST) challenge is initiated at CLEF 2025. Among this year's international benchmarks, we concentrate on solving the first task aiming to identify and classify sexism in social media textual posts. In this paper, we describe our solutions and report results for three subtasks: Subtask 1.1 - Sexism Identification in Tweets, Subtask 1.2 - Source Intention in Tweets, and Subtask 1.3 - Sexism Categorization in Tweets. We implement three models to address each subtask which constitute three individual runs: Speech Concept Bottleneck Model (SCBM), Speech Concept Bottleneck Model with Transformer (SCBMT), and a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa transformer model. SCBM uses descriptive adjectives as human-interpretable bottleneck concepts. SCBM leverages large language models (LLMs) to encode input texts into a human-interpretable representation of adjectives, then used to train a lightweight classifier for downstream tasks. SCBMT extends SCBM by fusing adjective-based representation with contextual embeddings from transformers to balance interpretability and classification performance. Beyond competitive results, these two models offer fine-grained explanations at both instance (local) and class (global) levels. We also investigate how additional metadata, e.g., annotators' demographic profiles, can be leveraged. For Subtask 1.1, XLM-RoBERTa, fine-tuned on provided data augmented with prior datasets, ranks 6th for English and Spanish and 4th for English in the Soft-Soft evaluation. Our SCBMT achieves 7th for English and Spanish and 6th for Spanish.</description>

      <title>How to Bridge Spatial and Temporal Heterogeneity in Link Prediction? A Contrastive Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal Heterogeneous Networks play a crucial role in capturing the dynamics and heterogeneity inherent in various real-world complex systems, rendering them a noteworthy research avenue for link prediction. However, existing methods fail to capture the fine-grained differential distribution patterns and temporal dynamic characteristics, which we refer to as spatial heterogeneity and temporal heterogeneity. To overcome such limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ontrastive Learning-based \textbf{L}ink \textbf{P}rediction model, \textbf{CLP}, which employs a multi-view hierarchical self-supervised architecture to encode spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Specifically, aiming at spatial heterogeneity, we develop a spatial feature modeling layer to capture the fine-grained topological distribution patterns from node- and edge-level representations, respectively. Furthermore, aiming at temporal heterogeneity, we devise a temporal information modeling layer to perceive the evolutionary dependencies of dynamic graph topologies from time-level representations. Finally, we encode the spatial and temporal distribution heterogeneity from a contrastive learning perspective, enabling a comprehensive self-supervised hierarchical relation modeling for the link prediction task. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world dynamic heterogeneous network datasets verify that our \mymodel consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art models, demonstrating an average improvement of 10.10\%, 13.44\% in terms of AUC and AP, respectively.</description>
