      <title>UniLabOS: An AI-Native Operating System for Autonomous Laboratories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous laboratories promise to accelerate discovery by coupling learning algorithms with robotic experimentation, yet adoption remains limited by fragmented software that separates high-level planning from low-level execution. Here we present UniLabOS, an AI-native operating system for autonomous laboratories that bridges digital decision-making and embodied experimentation through typed, stateful abstractions and transactional safeguards. UniLabOS unifies laboratory elements via an Action/Resource/Action&amp;Resource (A/R/A&amp;R) model, represents laboratory structure with a dual-topology of logical ownership and physical connectivity, and reconciles digital state with material motion using a transactional CRUTD protocol. Built on a distributed edge-cloud architecture with decentralized discovery, UniLabOS enables protocol mobility across reconfigurable topologies while supporting human-in-the-loop governance. We demonstrate the system in four real-world settings -- a liquid-handling workstation, a modular organic synthesis platform, a distributed electrolyte foundry, and a decentralized computation-intensive closed-loop system -- showing robust orchestration across heterogeneous instruments and multi-node coordination. UniLabOS establishes a scalable foundation for agent-ready, reproducible, and provenance-aware autonomous experimentation.</description>

      <title>Q-A3C2: Quantum Reinforcement Learning with Time-Series Dynamic Clustering for Adaptive ETF Stock Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional ETF stock selection methods and reinforcement learning models such as the Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) often suffer from high-dimensional feature spaces and overfitting when applied to complex financial markets. Moreover, static clustering algorithms fail to capture evolving market regimes, as the cluster with higher returns in one period may not remain optimal in the next. To address these limitations, this paper proposes Q-A3C2, a quantum-enhanced A3C framework that integrates time-series dynamic clustering. By embedding Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) into the policy network, Q-A3C2 enhances nonlinear feature representation and enables adaptive decision-making at the cluster level. Experimental results on the S and P 500 constituents show that Q-A3C2 achieves a cumulative return of 17.09%, outperforming the benchmark's 7.09%, demonstrating superior adaptability and exploration in dynamic financial environments.</description>

      <title>Batched Training for QLSTM vs. QFWP: A System-Oriented Approach to EPC-Aware RMSE-DA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare two quantum sequence models, QLSTM and QFWP, under an Equal Parameter Count (EPC) and adjoint differentiation setup on daily EUR USD forecasting as a controlled one dimensional time series case study. Across 10 random seeds and batch sizes from 4 to 64, we measure component wise runtimes including train forward, backward, full train, and inference, as well as accuracy including RMSE and directional accuracy. Batched forward scales well by about 2.2 to 2.4 times, but backward scales modestly, with QLSTM about 1.01 to 1.05 times and QFWP about 1.18 to 1.22 times, which caps end to end training speedups near 2 times. QFWP achieves lower RMSE and higher directional accuracy at all batch sizes, supported by a Wilcoxon test with p less than or equal to 0.004 and a large Cliff delta, while QLSTM reaches the highest throughput at batch size 64, revealing a clear speed accuracy Pareto frontier. We provide an EPC aligned, numerically checked benchmarking pipeline and practical guidance on batch size choices, while broader datasets and hardware and noise settings are left for future work.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Simulation Guided Convolutional Neural Networks for Thermal Modeling of Friction Stir Welding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of temperature evolution is essential for understanding thermomechanical behavior in friction stir welding. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were performed using LAMMPS to model aluminum friction stir welding at the atomic scale, capturing material flow, plastic deformation, and heat generation during tool plunge, traverse, and retraction. Atomic positions and velocities were extracted from simulation trajectories and transformed into physics based two dimensional spatial grids. These grids represent local height variation, velocity components, velocity magnitude, and atomic density, preserving spatial correlations within the weld zone. A two-dimensional convolutional neural network was developed to predict temperature directly from the spatially resolved atomistic data. Hyperparameter optimization was carried out to determine an appropriate network configuration. The trained model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving a coefficient of determination R square of 0.9439, a root mean square error of 14.94 K, and a mean absolute error of 11.58 K on unseen test data. Class Activation Map analysis indicates that the model assigns higher importance to regions near the tool material interface, which are associated with intense deformation and heat generation in the molecular dynamics simulations. The results show that spatial learning from atomistic simulation data can accurately reproduce temperature trends in friction stir welding while remaining consistent with physical deformation and flow mechanisms observed at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>S&amp;P 500 Stock's Movement Prediction using CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is about predicting the movement of stock consist of S&amp;P 500 index. Historically there are many approaches have been tried using various methods to predict the stock movement and being used in the market currently for algorithm trading and alpha generating systems using traditional mathematical approaches [1, 2].
  The success of artificial neural network recently created a lot of interest and paved the way to enable prediction using cutting-edge research in the machine learning and deep learning. Some of these papers have done a great job in implementing and explaining benefits of these new technologies. Although most these papers do not go into the complexity of the financial data and mostly utilize single dimension data, still most of these papers were successful in creating the ground for future research in this comparatively new phenomenon. In this paper, I am trying to use multivariate raw data including stock split/dividend events (as-is) present in real-world market data instead of engineered financial data. Convolution Neural Network (CNN), the best-known tool so far for image classification, is used on the multi-dimensional stock numbers taken from the market mimicking them as a vector of historical data matrices (read images) and the model achieves promising results. The predictions can be made stock by stock, i.e., a single stock, sector-wise or for the portfolio of stocks.</description>

      <title>Shape Optimization of Eigenfrequencies in MEMS Gyroscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) gyroscopes are widely used in consumer and automotive applications. They have to fulfill a vast number of product requirements which lead to complex mechanical designs of the resonating structure. Arriving at a final design is a cumbersome process that relies heavily on human experience in conjunction with design optimization methods. In this work, we apply node-based shape optimization to the design of a MEMS gyroscope. For that purpose, we parametrize the coordinates of the nodes of the finite element method (FEM) mesh that discretize the shapes of the springs. We then implement the gradients of the mechanical eigenfrequencies and typical MEMS manufacturability constraints, with respect to the design parameters, in a FEM code. Using gradient-based optimization we tune the gyroscope's frequency split and shift spurious modes away from the first three multiples of the gyroscope's drive frequency while manufacturability constraints are fulfilled. The resulting optimized design exhibits novel geometrical shapes which defy any human intuition. Overall, we demonstrate that shape optimization can not only solve optimization problems in MEMS design without required human intervention, but also explores geometry solutions which can otherwise not be addressed. In this way, node-based shape optimization opens up a much larger space of possible design solutions, which is crucial for facing the ever increasing product requirements. Our approach is generic and applicable to many other types of MEMS resonators.</description>

      <title>Shape Optimization of Geometrically Nonlinear Modal Coupling Coefficients: An Application to MEMS Gyroscopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Micro- and nanoelectromechanical system (MEMS and NEMS) resonators can exhibit rich nonlinear dynamics as they are often operated at large amplitudes with high quality factors and possess a high mode density with a variety of nonlinear modal couplings. Their impact is strongly influenced by internal resonance conditions and by the strength of the modal coupling coefficients. On one hand, strong nonlinear couplings are of academic interest and promise novel device concepts. On the other hand, however, they have the potential to disturb the linear system behavior on which industrial devices such as gyroscopes and micro mirrors are based on. In either case, being able to optimize the coupling coefficients by design is certainly beneficial. A main source of nonlinear modal couplings are geometric nonlinearities. In this work, we apply node-based shape optimization to tune the geometrically nonlinear 3-wave coupling coefficients of a MEMS gyroscope. We demonstrate that individual coupling coefficients can be tuned over several orders of magnitude by shape optimization, while satisfying typical constraints on manufacturability and operability of the devices. The optimized designs contain unintuitive geometrical features far away from any solution an experienced human MEMS or NEMS designer could have thought of. Thus, this work demonstrates the power of shape optimization for tailoring the complex nonlinear dynamic properties of MEMS and NEMS resonators.</description>

      <title>Convolutional autoencoders for the reconstruction of three-dimensional interfacial multiphase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic investigation of convolutional autoencoders for the reduced-order representation of three-dimensional interfacial multiphase flows. Focusing on the reconstruction of phase indicators, we examine how the choice of interface representation, including sharp, diffuse, and level-set formulations, impacts reconstruction accuracy across a range of interface complexities. Training and validation are performed using both synthetic datasets with controlled geometric complexity and high-fidelity simulations of multiphase homogeneous isotropic turbulence. We show that the interface representation plays a critical role in autoencoder performance. Excessively sharp interfaces lead to the loss of small-scale features, while overly diffuse interfaces degrade overall accuracy. Across all datasets and metrics considered, a moderately diffuse interface provides the best balance between preserving fine-scale structures and achieving accurate reconstructions. These findings elucidate key limitations and best practices for dimensionality reduction of multiphase flows using autoencoders. By clarifying how interface representations interact with the inductive biases of convolutional neural networks, this work lays the foundation for decoupling the training of autoencoders for accurate state compression from the training of surrogate models for temporal forecasting or input-output prediction in latent space.</description>

      <title>A coupled finite element-virtual element method for thermomechanical analysis of electronic packaging structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a finite element and virtual element (FE-VE) coupled method for thermomechanical analysis in electronic packaging structures. The approach partitions computational domains strategically, employing FEM for regular geometries to maximize computational efficiency and VEM for complex shapes to enhance geometric flexibility. Interface compatibility is maintained through coincident nodal correspondence, ensuring solution continuity across domain boundaries while reducing meshing complexity and computational overhead. Validation through electronic packaging applications demonstrates reasonable agreement with reference solutions and acceptable convergence characteristics across varying mesh densities. The method effectively captures thermal distributions and stress concentrations in multi-material systems, establishing a practical computational framework for electronic packaging analysis involving complex geometries.
