      <title>Universality in the Anticoncentration of Noisy Quantum Circuits at Finite Depths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the anticoncentration properties of quantum circuits in the presence of different sources of noise. In the \textit{weak-noise regime}, we show that different types of noise act in a similar fashion, leading to a universal distribution for the probability of a given bit-string, largely independent of the specific noise channel or circuit architecture. In addition, we can identify three distinct depth-dependent regimes, each signaled by a different scaling of cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) fidelity over time. In the shallow-depth regime, noise effects are perturbatively small; in the intermediate regime, circuit-induced fluctuations and noise compete on equal footing; and in the deep-depth regime, the output distribution becomes effectively classical, up to corrections that are exponentially small in the noise strength. We provide quantitative predictions for the anticoncentration of generic circuits at finite depth, which we benchmark with numerical simulations giving perfect agreement even for shallow circuits. Our findings are directly applicable to current quantum processors and demonstrate universal behavior beyond random-matrix-theory regimes which are only applicable at large depths.</description>

      <title>Energy-independent tomography of Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of tomography of bosonic Gaussian states is presumably as old as quantum optics, but only recently, their precise and rigorous study have been moving into the focus of attention, motivated by technological developments. In this work, we present an efficient and experimentally feasible Gaussian state tomography algorithm with provable recovery trace-distance guarantees, whose sample complexity depends only on the number of modes, and - remarkably - is independent of the state's photon number or energy, up to doubly logarithmic factors. Our algorithm yields a doubly-exponential improvement over existing methods, and it employs operations that are readily accessible in experimental settings: the preparation of an auxiliary squeezed vacuum, passive Gaussian unitaries, and homodyne detection. At its core lies an adaptive strategy that systematically reduces the total squeezing of the system, enabling efficient tomography. Quite surprisingly, this proves that estimating a Gaussian state in trace distance is generally more efficient than directly estimating its covariance matrix. Our algorithm is particularly well-suited for applications in quantum metrology and sensing, where highly squeezed - and hence high-energy - states are commonly employed. As a further contribution, we establish improved sample complexity bounds for standard heterodyne tomography, equipping this widely used protocol with rigorous trace-norm guarantees.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Modeling of a Memory-Assisted Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution System in Free-Space Metropolitan Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On the pathway to quantum key distribution on a global scale, will be the realization of metropolitan-sized Memory Assisted Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution (MA-MDI-QKD) systems. Here, we present a simplistic and intuitive stochastic model to predict key distribution rates in a MA-MDI-QKD scheme that addresses the real-world parameters inherent to free-space quantum communication channels. Specific to our algorithm, the memory-assisted based system allows us to leverage the advantage of asynchronously loaded quantum memory when predicting the distribution rates. Specifically, by focusing on metropolitan distances, we perform simulations tailored toward a system based on free-space links and field-deployable quantum memory. We show the capabilities of our model to predict key rate distributions over ranges of 10-50 km for a set of atmospheric-based parameters and selection of QM efficiencies and coherence times. This tool provides impactful insights into the deployment and optimization of practical MA-MDI-QKD networks in urban environments. Our streamlined approach is a valuable addition to existing quantum network simulators for the smooth integration of quantum networking into the field of communications engineering.</description>

      <title>Contextuality from the vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contextuality, a key resource for quantum advantage, is a phenomenon where the outcome of a measurement is not independent of other compatible measurements, violating the premise of classical hidden variable descriptions of the theory. We investigate the harvesting of contextuality from the vacuum of a quantum field using Unruh-DeWitt detectors. We show that interactions with the field can endow initially non-contextual detectors with contextuality with respect to Heisenberg-Weyl measurements, as quantified by contextual fraction. The harvested contextuality correlates with the emergence of Wigner function negativity, in agreement with known equivalences between these notions. Our results establish contextuality harvesting as a fundamental phenomenon in relativistic quantum information, highlighting it as a resource that can be extracted directly from the quantum vacuum.</description>

      <title>Experimental tests of a model of the quantum measurement process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We suggest and describe how to analyze new types of experiments that would test a proposed model of the quantum measurement process. That model produces the Born Rule as a corollary, and so agrees with conventional quantum predictions. The proposed experiments include a new type of "interrupted measurement," which would allow falsification or confirmation of the model. In order to compare it with standard quantum mechanics predictions, we also develop a new testable extrapolation of the Born Rule into the extended experimental regime.</description>

      <title>Improving VQE Parameter Quality on Noisy Quantum Processors with Cost-Effective Readout Error Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inherent noise in current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices presents a major obstacle to the accurate implementation of quantum algorithms such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for quantum chemistry applications. This study examines the impact of error mitigation strategies on VQE performance. We show that, for small molecular systems, an older-generation 5-qubit quantum processing unit (IBMQ Belem), when combined with optimized Twirled Readout Error Extinction (T-REx), achieves ground-state energy estimations an order of magnitude more accurate than those obtained from a more advanced 156-qubit device (IBM Fez) without error mitigation. Our findings demonstrate that T-REx, a computationally inexpensive error mitigation technique, substantially improves VQE accuracy not only in energy estimation, but more importantly in optimizing the variational parameters that characterize the molecular ground state. Consequently, state-vector simulated energies suggest that the accuracy of the optimized variational parameters provides a more reliable benchmark of VQE performance than quantum hardware energy estimates alone. Our results point to the critical role of error mitigation in extending the utility of noisy quantum hardware for molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Squeezed Light in Quantum Dot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cavity-QED theory for generating squeezed light from semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) integrated in microcavities. We formulate equations of motion for an inhomogeneously broadened QD ensemble that is incoherently pumped and simultaneously driven by a coherent seed field, solve for steady states, and compute the output-field quadrature variances. The analysis identifies operating conditions that yield amplitude-quadrature squeezing, with photon-number fluctuations reduced below the coherent-state limit and squeezing levels as large as 5 dB attainable with presently accessible QD and cavity parameters using only ~ 1 uW pump power. We further show that quantum correlations originating from four-wave mixing play a dual role: they both shape the gain spectrum and generate squeezing. These correlations constitute the quantum counterpart of the mean-field (semiclassical) mechanisms responsible for self-mode-locking in QD lasers and the ultra-narrow lasing linewidths achieved under self-injection locking.</description>

      <title>Wide-spectrum security of quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementations of quantum key distribution (QKD) need vulnerability assessment against loopholes in their optical scheme. Most of the optical attacks involve injecting or receiving extraneous light via the communication channel. An eavesdropper can choose her attack wavelengths arbitrarily within the quantum channel passband to maximise the attack performance, exploiting spectral transparency windows of system components. Here we propose a wide-spectrum security evaluation methodology to achieve full optical spectrum safety for QKD systems. This technique requires transmittance characterisation in a wide spectral band with a high sensitivity. We report a testbench that characterises insertion loss of fiber-optic components in a wide spectral range of 400 to 2300 nm and up to 70 dB dynamic range. To illustrate practical application of the proposed methodology, we give a full Trojan-horse attack analysis for some typical QKD system configurations and discuss briefly induced-photorefraction and detector-backflash attacks. Our methodology can be used for certification of QKD systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Differential Equation Solvers with Low State Preparation Cost: Eliminating the Time Dependence in Dissipative Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear dissipative differential equation is a fundamental model for a large number of physical systems, such as quantum dynamics with non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, open quantum system dynamics, diffusion process and damped system. In this work, we propose efficient quantum algorithms for simulating linear dissipative differential equations. The key idea of our algorithms is to perform the simulation only over an effective time period when the dynamics has not significantly dissipated yet, rather than over the entire physical evolution period. We conduct detailed analysis on the complexity of our algorithms and show that, while maintaining low state preparation cost, our algorithms can completely eliminate the time dependence. This is a more than exponential improvement compared to the previous state-of-the-art quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Identity and Quantify Various Dissipation Mechanisms of Josephson Junction in Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinpointing the dissipation mechanisms and evaluating their impacts to the performance of Josephson junction (JJ) are crucial for its application in superconducting circuits. In this work, we demonstrate the junction-embedded resonator (JER) as a platform which enables us to identify and quantify various dissipation mechanisms of JJ. JER is constructed by embedding JJ in the middle of an open-circuit, 1/2 {\lambda} transmission-line resonator. When the 1st and 2nd harmonics of JER are excited, JJ experiences different boundary conditions, and is dominated by internal and external dissipations, respectively. We systematically study these 2 dissipation mechanisms of JJ by varying the JJ area and number. Our results unveil the completely different behaviors of these 2 dissipation mechanisms, and quantitatively characterize their contributions, shedding a light on the direction of JJ optimization in various applications.</description>

      <title>Dirac monopole magnets in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically establish that non-Hermitian perturbations induce a topological transformation of point-like Dirac monopoles into extended monopole distributions, characterized by distinct charge configurations emergent from three distinct Berry connection forms. Using piecewise adiabatic evolution, we confirm the validity of these configurations through observations of complex geometric phases. Most critically, we find a quantitative relation $\Delta \phi_d = \Delta \phi_g$, which quantifies how cumulative minute energy differences (\(\Delta \phi_d\)) manifest as geometric phase shifts (\(\Delta \phi_g\)) uniquely in non-Hermitian systems. We further propose a scheme leveraging soliton dynamics in dissipative two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, enabling direct measurement of these topological signatures. These results establish a milestone for understanding Dirac monopole charge distributions and measuring complex geometric phases in non-Hermitian systems, with far-reaching implications for topological quantum computing and non-Hermitian photonics.</description>

      <title>The practical issues of side-channel-secure quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to provide theoretically unconditional security for cryptographic key sharing. However, practical implementations remain vulnerable due to non-ideal devices and potential security loopholes at both the source and detection sides of QKD systems. The side-channel-secure (SCS) protocol addresses these challenges by encoding bits in vacuum and non-vacuum states and introducing a third-party measurement node, thereby repelling attacks targeting the detection side as well as external lab attacks on the source side. In this work, we consider the state-dependent correlated errors and Trojan-horse attack while preserving the SCS protocol's key advantage-specifically, requiring only upper bounds on intensities characterization without needing a full description of quantum states in infinite dimensions. Numerical results demonstrate that when the reflected light intensity from Trojan-horse attacks falls below $10^{-6}$, Eve can scarcely extract additional key information from the reflections. This work makes the SCS protocol more practical.</description>

      <title>Robust and Efficient Quantum Reservoir Computing with Discrete Time Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development of machine learning and quantum computing has placed quantum machine learning at the forefront of research. However, existing quantum machine learning algorithms based on quantum variational algorithms face challenges in trainability and noise robustness. In order to address these challenges, we introduce a gradient-free, noise-robust quantum reservoir computing algorithm that harnesses discrete time crystal dynamics as a reservoir. We first calibrate the memory, nonlinear, and information scrambling capacities of the quantum reservoir, revealing their correlation with dynamical phases and non-equilibrium phase transitions. We then apply the algorithm to the binary classification task and establish a comparative quantum kernel advantage. For ten-class classification, both noisy simulations and experimental results on superconducting quantum processors match ideal simulations, demonstrating the enhanced accuracy with increasing system size and confirming the topological noise robustness. Our work presents the first experimental demonstration of quantum reservoir computing for image classification based on digital quantum simulation. It establishes the correlation between quantum many-body non-equilibrium phase transitions and quantum machine learning performance, providing new design principles for quantum reservoir computing and broader quantum machine learning algorithms in the NISQ era.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently mapping quantum programs onto Distributed quantum computing (DQC) are challenging, particularly when considering the heterogeneous quantum processing units (QPUs) with different structures. In this paper, we present a comprehensive compilation framework that addresses these challenges with three key insights: exploiting structural patterns within quantum circuits, using clustering for initial qubit placement, and adjusting qubit mapping with annealing algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods and the capability to handle complex heterogeneous distributed quantum systems. Our evaluation shows that our method reduces the objective value at most 88.40\% compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Non-Commutative weak measurements: Entanglement, Symmetry Breaking, and the Role of Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The preparation of long-range entangled (LRE) states via quantum measurements is a promising strategy, yet its stability against realistic, non-commuting measurement noise remains a critical open question. Here, we systematically investigate the rich phase structure emerging from a minimal model of competing, non-commuting weak measurements: nearest-neighbor Ising ($Z_iZ_j$) and single-qubit transverse ($X_i$) operators. We analyze three experimentally relevant scenarios based on which measurement outcomes are read out: complete readout, no readout, and partial readout. Using a replica mean-field theory for higher dimensions, complemented by numerical simulations in one dimension, we derive the complete finite-time and stationary phase diagrams. Our analysis reveals a striking dependence on the readout protocol. Complete readout yields a direct transition between a short-range entangled (SRE) phase and a pure LRE phase. No readout (pure decoherence) precludes entanglement but exhibits a strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) transition into a classically ordered mixed state. Most intriguingly, partial readout interpolates between these limits, featuring a mixed-state phase transition where the system can become trapped in the SWSSB phase or, for weaker non-commutativity, undergo successive symmetry breaking to reach a mixed LRE phase. A novel technical contribution is the use of a channel-fidelity-based partition function that allows us to simultaneously characterize both entanglement and SWSSB order, revealing a deep interplay between them in the replica limit. These results provide a cohesive picture for understanding measurement phase transitions, SWSSB, and mixed-state phase transitions, offering crucial insights for designing robust state preparation protocols on noisy quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: Simulating fermionic systems on qubit-based quantum computers often demands significant computational resources due to the requirement to map fermions to qubits. Thus, designing a fault-tolerant quantum computer that operates directly with fermions offers an effective solution to this challenge. Here, we introduce a protocol for fault-tolerant fermionic quantum computation utilizing fermion-to-fermion low-density parity-check codes. Our method employs a fermionic low-density parity-check code memory, which transfers its state to fermionic color code processors assisted by lattice surgery, where logical operations are subsequently performed. To construct the fermionic low-density parity-check memory, we develop a systematic approach for creating fermionic stabilizer codes based on self-dual Calderbank-Shor-Steane codes. We present examples demonstrating these codes' significantly improved coding rate compared to the fermionic color code. Finally, we simulate the dynamics of a fermionic system using our protocol, illustrating effective error suppression.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Control of Photon-Number Probabilities via Phase-Controlled Quantum Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministically tailoring optical Fock states beyond the single-photon level is crucial for boson sampling, loss-tolerant photonic qubits, and quantum-enhanced sensing, however has yet remained elusive. Here, we report an all-linear-optical protocol that converts a resonantly driven single-photon emitter into a deterministic generator of vacuum--single-photon--two-photon states. A phase-stabilized, path-unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer combines vacuum--single-photon interference and Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, providing two knobs to shape photon-number probabilities. By tuning these knobs, we observe a dynamic transition from antibunching to strong bunching in correlation measurements. A fully quantum-mechanical, discrete time-bin model maps these results onto the tailored photon statistics. The same framework predicts that two indistinguishable emitters would extend the accessible space to deterministic NOON states and single-photon filtering. This protocol relying on linear optics and available single-photon sources provides a scalable, chip-compatible, and platform-independent route to on-demand and deterministic few-photon resources for quantum metrology, photonic computing, as well as long-distance quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Incorporating device characterization into security proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Typical security proofs for quantum key distribution (QKD) rely on having some model for the devices, with the security guarantees implicitly relying on the values of various parameters of the model, such as dark count rates or detector efficiencies. Hence to deploy QKD in practice, we must establish how to certify or characterize the model parameters of a manufacturer's QKD devices. We present a rigorous framework for analyzing such procedures, laying out concrete requirements for both the security proofs and the certification or characterization procedures. In doing so, we describe various forms of conclusions that can and cannot be validly drawn from such procedures, addressing some potential misconceptions. We also discuss connections to composable security frameworks and some technical aspects that remain to be resolved in that direction.</description>

      <title>Multipole expansion for dispersion forces -- watch this trace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light-matter interaction models invariably rely on the multipole expansion of the electromagnetic potentials generated by complex charge distributions. These multipoles are typically taken to be traceless, however, for a correct evaluation of dispersion forces at all distances, the validity of this assumption has to be checked carefully. Here, we revisit the concept of dispersion forces on an atom near a dielectric surface from the perspective of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics and find that, beyond the quadrupole, the multipoles cannot always be taken as fully traceless. In particular, we show that the trace of the octupole moment contributes to Casimir-Polder interactions beyond the electrostatic regime.</description>

      <title>Quantum-enhanced parameter estimation in continuously monitored boundary time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum-enhanced parameter estimation in boundary time crystals (BTCs) via continuous monitoring. By analytically deriving the global quantum Fisher information rate, we show that in the time-crystal phase the ultimate precision exhibits a cubic scaling with the system size, $f_{\mathrm{global}}\sim N^3$, surpassing both the sensitivity at the critical point and the standard quantum limit (SQL). We then numerically demonstrate that this bound can be attained already at finite $N$ using experimentally accessible strategies: continuous photodetection and, in particular, continuous homodyne detection. Moving towards realistic implementations, we derive the fundamental precision limits for inefficient detection ($\eta&lt;1$). While inefficiencies asymptotically restore SQL scaling, a constant-factor quantum advantage remains possible, diverging as $\eta\!\to\!1$. Numerical simulations show that homodyne detection outperforms photodetection in approaching the ultimate bound and consistently provides a collective advantage over independent single-qubit protocols, which grows with $N$.</description>

      <title>Quantum control of Nitrogen-Vacancy spin in Diamonds: Towards matter-wave interferometry with massive objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in previously unexplored regimes. It also opens the possibility of probing the interface between QM and GR, such as testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several approaches are being explored, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds with embedded spins as test particles which, in combination with Stern-Gerlach forces, enable the realization of a closed-loop matter-wave interferometer in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. Here we present our work on quantum control of a nitrogen-vacancy spin system in bulk diamonds and in levitated diamonds as a step towards Stern-Gerlach interferometry with levitated nanodiamonds. Our simulations show that the current state of the art for spin coherence time in nanodiamonds of a few tens of microseconds, is good enough to enable an SGI spatial splitting on the order of nanometers for an ND composed of 10^7 atoms. We would be happy to make available more details upon request.</description>

      <title>Universal Statistics of Charges Exchanges in Non-Abelian Quantum Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive detailed and intergral fluctuation relations as well as a Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation constraining the exchange statistics of an arbitrary number of non-commuting conserved quantities among two quantum systems in transport setups arbitrary far from equilibrium. These universal relations, valid without the need of any efficacy parameter, extend the well-known heat exchange fluctuation theorems for energy and particle transport to the case of non-Abelian quantum transport, where the non-commutativity of the charges allows bending standard thermodynamic rules. In particular, we show that this can lead to apparent violations of the second law of thermodynamics, it enhances precision in the current fluctuations, and it allows for the inversion of all currents against their affinity biases.</description>

      <title>Robust Self-Testing of Multiqudit Supersinglet Slater States via Constant Number of Binary Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-testing is a powerful device-independent technique that enables one to deduce the forms of both the quantum state and the measurements involved in a physical experiment based solely on observed correlations. Although numerous schemes for self-testing multipartite entangled states have been proposed, they are typically difficult to implement experimentally, as their complexity increases significantly with the number of subsystems or the local dimension. In this work, we introduce the first self-testing scheme of a relevant class of multiqudit genuinely entangled states that exploits only a constant number of binary measurements per observer, which significantly reduces the experimental effort to implement the scheme. Specifically, it enables the self-testing of multipartite Slater (or supersinglet) states composed of $d$ qu\textit{d}its with odd $d$ using only four two-outcome measurements per observer. Moreover, we prove that our scheme is robust to noise and experimental imperfections. For systems of even local dimension $d$, we also provide an adapted version of the scheme that requires only $d$ binary measurements per observer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In distributed quantum computing, the final solution of a problem is usually achieved by catenating these partial solutions resulted from different computing nodes, but intolerable errors likely yield in this catenation process. In this paper, we propose a universal error correction scheme to reduce errors and obtain effective solutions. Then, we apply this error correction scheme to designing a distributed phase estimation algorithm that presents a basic tool for studying distributed Shor's algorithm and distributed discrete logarithm algorithm as well as other distributed quantum algorithms. Our method may provide a universal strategy of error correction for a kind of distributed quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Neutralization of Levitated Charged Nanodiamond: Towards matter-wave interferometry with massive objects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle, can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in completely new regimes, as well as the interface between QM and GR, e.g., testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several paths are being pursued, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds as our particle, and a spin embedded in the ND together with Stern-Gerlach forces, to achieve a closed loop in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community.
  In this work we demonstrate the neutralization of levitated nanodiamonds using ultraviolet photoemission, and characterize the dependence of this process on both the illumination wavelength and particle size. Furthermore, we demonstrate discrete, single-electron charge manipulation of levitated nanodiamond in a needle Paul trap at a pressure of 0.5\,Torr. Finally, we demonstrate fast neutralization of levitated nanodiamonds, achieving a neutralization rate much faster than the state of the art. As neutralization is crucial to avoid spatial decoherence, this constitutes a significant step towards the realization of a nanodiamond spatial interferometer. We would be happy to make available more details upon request.</description>

      <title>Quantum Co-Magnetometer Using Diamond Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers and Rubidium Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in chip scale magnetic quantum sensing have produced platforms that pair unprecedented sensitivity with extreme miniaturization. Here, we demonstrate a hybrid quantum sensor by combining Nitrogen-Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond with a rubidium (Rb) vapor cell, designed for precise magnetic field measurements and quantum exploration. The hybrid comagnetometer leverages the high resolution vector magnetic sensing of NV centers along with the high scalar field sensitivity of the Rb vapor, enhancing the estimation of the magnetic field in terms of magnitude, direction and spatial distribution. A micromachined mm scale vapor cell containing Rb atoms is paired with a bulk diamond, enabling optical and microwave control of both quantum systems for integrated field estimation. Simulations and experimental results confirm the improved accuracy of the system in magnetic field measurements, demonstrating a beyond 10 dB improvement. This NV and Rb platform offers a versatile route toward portable, sensitive magnetometry and opens new possibilities for integrated, multi-modal quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Trotter-based quantum algorithm for solving transport equations with exponentially fewer time-steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extent to which quantum computers can simulate physical phenomena and solve the partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern them remains a central open question. In this work, one of the most fundamental PDEs is addressed: the multidimensional transport equation with space- and time-dependent coefficients. We present a quantum numerical scheme based on three steps: quantum state preparation, evolution, and measurement of relevant observables. The evolution step combines a high-order centered finite difference with a time-splitting scheme based on product formula approximations, also known as Trotterization. Novel numerical analysis is introduced to bound the different sources of error and we prove that, for the product formula approximations, vector norm analysis guarantees similar accuracy with exponentially fewer time steps than operator-norm-based approaches, thereby significantly reducing the projected computational resources. We also present efficient quantum circuits and numerical simulations that confirm the predicted vector-norm scaling. We report results on real quantum hardware for the one-dimensional convection equation, and solve a non-linear ordinary differential equation via its associated Liouville equation, a particular case of transport equations. This work provides a practical framework for efficiently simulating transport phenomena on quantum computers, with potential applications in plasma physics, molecular gas dynamics and non-linear dynamical systems, including chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Detection of non-absolute separability in quantum states and channels through moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum information and computation, generation of entanglement through unitary gates remains a significant and active area of research. However, there are states termed as absolutely separable, from which entanglement cannot be created through any non-local unitary action. Thus, from a resource-theoretic perspective, non-absolutely separable states are useful as they can be turned into entangled states using some appropriate unitary gates. In this work, we propose an efficient method to detect non-absolutely separable states. Our approach relies on evaluating moments that can bypass the need for full state tomography, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. We then present several examples in support of our detection scheme. We also address a closely related problem concerning states whose partial transpose remains positive under any arbitrary non-local unitary action. Furthermore, we examine the effectiveness of our moment-based approach in the detection of quantum channels that are not absolutely separating, which entails the detection of resource preserving channels. Finally, we demonstrate the operational significance of non-absolutely separable states by proving that every such state can provide an advantage in a quantum-channel discrimination task.</description>

      <title>Complex Heat Capacity as a Witness of Spatio-Temporal Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel witness of temporal quantum entanglement using the imaginary component of the complex heat capacity - a measurable thermodynamic quantity in temperature-modulated calorimetry. By establishing a direct correspondence between complex heat capacity and the pseudo-density matrix formalism, our approach enables the characterisation of both spatial and temporal quantum correlations without demanding additional state-level manipulation beyond initial tomography. We analytically demonstrate this connection for an open quantum system modelled by a qubit coupled to a thermal bath, and show how both pseudo-density matrix negativity and violations of a temporal CHSH inequality emerge as indicators of non-classical temporal correlations. We further identify bounds on the imaginary heat capacity that guarantee temporal entanglement, providing an experimentally accessible criterion at the macroscopic scale. This framework offers a feasible route for probing temporal quantum effects in condensed-matter systems and opens a viable path toward experimental realisation.</description>

      <title>Colour Codes Reach Surface Code Performance using Vibe Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional quantum colour codes hold significant promise for quantum error correction, offering advantages such as planar connectivity and low overhead logical gates. Despite their theoretical appeal, the practical deployment of these codes faces challenges due to complex decoding requirements compared to surface codes. This paper introduces vibe decoding which, for the first time, brings colour code performance on par with the surface code under practical decoding. Our approach leverages an ensemble of belief propagation decoders - each executing a distinct serial message passing schedule - combined with localised statistics post-processing. We refer to this combined protocol as VibeLSD. The VibeLSD decoder is highly versatile: our numerical results show it outperforms all practical existing colour code decoders across various syndrome extraction schemes, noise models, and error rates. By estimating qubit footprints through quantum memory simulations, we show that colour codes can operate with overhead that is comparable to, and in some cases lower than, that of the surface code. This, combined with the fact that localised statistics decoding is a parallel algorithm, makes VibeLSD suitable for implementation on specialised hardware for real-time decoding. Our results establish the colour code as a practical architecture for near-term quantum hardware, providing improved compilation efficiency for both Clifford and non-Clifford gates without incurring additional qubit overhead relative to the surface code.</description>

Abstract: As simulations of quantum systems cross the limits of classical computability, both quantum and classical approaches become hard to verify. Scaling predictions are therefore based on local structure and asymptotic assumptions, typically with classical methods being used to evaluate quantum simulators where possible. Here, in contrast, we use a quantum annealing processor to produce a ground truth for evaluating classical tensor-network methods whose scaling has not yet been firmly established. Our observations run contrary to previous scaling predictions, demonstrating the need for caution when extrapolating the accuracy of classical simulations of quantum dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the virtuous cycle of competition between classical and quantum simulations can lend insight in both directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing and machine learning have given rise to quantum machine learning (QML), with growing interest in learning from sequential data. Quantum recurrent models like QLSTM are promising for time-series prediction, NLP, and reinforcement learning. However, designing effective variational quantum circuits (VQCs) remains challenging and often task-specific. To address this, we propose DiffQAS-QLSTM, an end-to-end differentiable framework that optimizes both VQC parameters and architecture selection during training. Our results show that DiffQAS-QLSTM consistently outperforms handcrafted baselines, achieving lower loss across diverse test settings. This approach opens the door to scalable and adaptive quantum sequence learning.</description>

      <title>Spin versus Magic: Lessons from Gluon and Graviton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum property of non-stabiliserness, also known as magic, plays a key role in designing quantum computing systems. How to produce, manipulate and enhance magic remains mysterious, such that concrete examples of physical systems that manifest magic behaviour are sought after. In this paper, we study two-particle scattering of gluons and gravitons in Yang--Mills theory and General Relativity, as well as their supersymmetric extensions. This provides an interesting case of two-qubit systems, differing only in the physical spin of the qubits. We show that magic is generically produced in both theories, and also show that magic typically decreases as the spin of the qubits increases. The maximal magic in each case is found to be substantially less than the known upper bound. Differences in the profile of magic generation can be traced to the known physics of each theory, as manifested in relations between their respective scattering amplitudes. Our case study may provide useful insights into understanding magic in other systems.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Energy and Topological Mass from a Constant Magnetic Field and Boundary Conditions in Coupled Scalar Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the combined effects of a uniform magnetic field and boundary conditions on vacuum energy and topological mass generation in a coupled scalar field theory. The system consists of a real scalar field, subject to Dirichlet boundary conditions, interacting via self- and cross-couplings with a gauge-coupled complex scalar field obeying mixed boundary conditions between two perfectly reflecting parallel plates. The magnetic field induces Landau quantization, leading to novel contributions. Employing zeta-function regularization within the effective potential formalism, we derive the renormalized effective potential up to second order in the coupling constants without imposing a vanishing magnetic field in the renormalization scheme. Our renormalization approach preserves magnetic contributions while properly removing divergences, enabling a consistent treatment of finite-size corrections, magnetic effects, and interaction terms. We compute the vacuum energy per unit area of the plates, analyze the emergence of a topological mass from boundary and magnetic contributions, and evaluate the first-order coupling-constant corrections at two-loop order. Detailed asymptotic analysis are presented for both weak- and strong-field regimes, revealing exponential suppression at high magnetic fields and nontrivial polynomial and logarithmic behavior in the weak-field limit.</description>

      <title>Microstructural and preliminary optical and microwave characterization of erbium doped CaMoO$_4$ thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores erbium-doped calcium molybdate (CaMoO$_4$) thin films grown on silicon and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates, as a potential solid state system for C-band (utilizing the $\sim$1.5 $\mu$m Er$^{3+}$ 4f-4f transition) quantum emitters for quantum network applications. Through molecular beam epitaxial growth experiments and electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and reflection electron diffraction studies, we identify an incorporation limited deposition regime that enables a 1:1 Ca:Mo ratio in the growing film leading to single phase CaMoO$_4$ formation that can be in-situ doped with Er (typically 2-100 ppm). We further show that growth on silicon substrates is single phase but polycrystalline in morphology; while growth on YSZ substrates leads to high-quality epitaxial single crystalline CaMoO$_4$ films. We perform preliminary optical and microwave characterization on the suspected $Y_1 - Z_1$ transition of 2 ppm, 200 nm epitaxial CaMoO$_4$ annealed thin films and extract an optical inhomogeneous linewidth of 9.1(1) GHz, an optical excited state lifetime of 6.7(2) ms, a spectral diffusion-limited homogeneous linewidth of 6.7(4) MHz, and an EPR linewidth of 1.10(2) GHz.</description>

      <title>Invariant Random Subgroups, Soficity, and L\"uck's determinant conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend L\"uck's determinant conjecture from groups to invariant random subgroups (IRS) of free groups, a framework generalizing groups where a non-sofic object is known to exist. For every free group, we prove the existence of an IRS satisfying the determinant conjecture that is not co-hyperlinear, and hence not co-sofic. This provides evidence that satisfying the determinant conjecture might be a weaker property than soficity for groups, and consequently the conjecture possibly holds for all groups. We use techniques from non-local games and $\mathsf{MIP}^* = \mathsf{RE}$, showing more generally when the latter can be used to narrow down when a von Neumann algebra (or IRS) contains a non-Connes embeddable object.</description>

      <title>Constrained Random Phase Approximation: the spectral method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA consistently yields larger Hubbard $U$ interaction values. Applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$, s-cRPA produces interaction parameters significantly closer to those required within DFT+$U$ to induce the experimentally observed insulating state, overcoming the metallic behavior predicted by standard density functionals. We also address the issue of negative interaction values found in the projector cRPA method for filled d-shells, demonstrating that s-cRPA offers superior numerical stability through electron conversion. Overall, s-cRPA is more robust and effectively overcomes the known underestimation of $U$ in standard cRPA, making it a promising tool for the community. Additionally, we have enhanced our implementation with features for computing multi-center interactions to analyze spatial decay and developed a low-scaling variant with a compressed Matsubara grid to efficiently obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of mutually unbiased bases via orbits: general theory and a $d=4$ case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum mechanics, mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) represent orthonormal bases that are as "far apart" as possible, and their classification reveals rich underlying geometric structure. Given a complex inner product space, we construct the space of its orthonormal bases as a discrete quotient of the complete flag manifold. We introduce a metric on this space, which corresponds to the "MUBness" distance. This allows us to describe equivalence between sets of mutually unbiased bases in terms of the geometry of this space. The subspace of bases that are unbiased with respect to the standard basis decomposes into orbits under a certain group action, and this decomposition corresponds to the classification of complex Hadamard matrices. More generally, we consider a list of $k$ MUBs, that one wishes to extend. The candidates are points in the subspace comprising all bases which are unbiased with respect to the entire list. This space also decomposes into orbits under a group action, and we prove that points in distinct orbits yield inequivalent MUB lists. Thus, we generalize the relation between complex Hadamard matrices and MUBs. As an application, we identify new symmetries that reduce the parameter space of MUB triples in dimension $4$ by a factor of $4$.</description>

      <title>A hybrid-frequency on-chip programmable synthetic-dimension simulator with arbitrary couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance photonic chips provide a powerful platform for analog computing, enabling the simulation of high-dimensional physical systems using low-dimensional devices with additional synthetic dimensions. The realization of large-scale complex simulations necessitates an architecture capable of arbitrary coupling configurations (encompassing symmetric, asymmetric and long-range coupling schemes) which is also crucial for scaling up. Previous approaches rely on excessive physical components to introduce asymmetric coupling, however, are restricted in reconfiguring and scaling by the relatively complicated structures. Here, to solve this problem, we propose a hybrid-frequency synthetic-dimension simulator architecture that combines both intra-resonant and inter-resonant frequency-lattice sites, and experimentally demonstrate it using the thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chip. Employing this hybrid programmable architecture, we are able to simulate both the regular and long-range coupled forms of diverse compound-lattice models, such as the Hall ladder, Creutz ladder (symmetric) and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH, asymmetric) model, on a single chip, simultaneously reducing the experimental requirements significantly. As results, the direct readout of the bandstructure of the SSH model is able to be achieved, to be distinguished from all previous works, and important phenomena such as spin-momentum locking, topological flat band and Aharonov-Bohm cage effect are also observed with lower experimental requirements. Furthermore, applications like piecewise-continuous optical frequency shifting can be enabled by cascading our devices. Our results offer promising insights for future large-scale complex on-chip simulators with arbitrary couplings.</description>

      <title>Distributed Shared Layered Storage Quantum Simulator: A novel quantum simulation system for efficient scaling and cost optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulators are essential tools for developing and testing quantum algorithms. However, the high-frequency traversal characteristic of quantum simulators represents an unprecedented demand in the history of IT, and existing distributed technologies is unable to meet this requirement, resulting in a single-node bottleneck of quantum simulator. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel Distributed Shared Layered Storage Quantum Simulator (DSLSQS). By leveraging an innovative distributed architecture in which multiple computational nodes share data storage directly, together with De-TCP/IP networking technology, DSLSQS effectively eliminates East-West data flow in distributed systems. This approach mitigates the bottleneck of distributed quantum simulation clusters and enhances the scalability. Moreover, the system employs layered storage technology, which reduces usage of expensive high-performance memory and substantially lowers simulation costs. Furthermore, this paper systematically analyzes the performance and cost constraints of distributed quantum simulator cluster, identifying distributed networking as the primary performance bottleneck and highlighting that minimizing storage costs is crucial to reducing the total cost. Finally, experimental evaluations with a 27-qubit simulation confirm the successful implementation of layered storage within the quantum simulator. DSLSQS significantly enhances simulation efficiency, yielding a performance improvement of over 350% compared to existing distributed technologies. These results underscore the superior performance and scalability of the proposed architecture in managing complex quantum computing tasks. This paper provides crucial insights for the practical deployment of quantum computing and presents an effective framework for the development of distributed quantum simulation clusters.</description>

      <title>Multifractality in high-dimensional graphs induced by correlated radial disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of models containing robust and analytically demonstrable multifractality induced by disorder correlations. Specifically, we investigate the statistics of eigenstates of disordered tight-binding models on two classes of rooted, high-dimensional graphs -- trees and hypercubes -- with a form of strong disorder correlations we term `radial disorder'. In this model, site energies on all sites equidistant from a chosen root are identical, while those at different distances are independent random variables (or their analogue for a deterministic but incommensurate potential, a case of which is also considered). Analytical arguments, supplemented by numerical results, are used to establish that this setting hosts robust and unusual multifractal states. The distribution of multifractality, as encoded in the inverse participation ratios (IPRs), is shown to be exceptionally broad. This leads to a qualitative difference in scaling with system size between the mean and typical IPRs, with the latter the appropriate quantity to characterise the multifractality. The existence of this multifractality is shown to be underpinned by an emergent fragmentation of the graphs into effective one-dimensional chains, which themselves exhibit conventional Anderson localisation. The interplay between the exponential localisation of states on these chains, and the exponential growth of the number of sites with distance from the root, is the origin of the observed multifractality.</description>

      <title>Optimizing energy conversion with nonthermal resources in steady-state quantum devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a framework for optimizing energy conversion processes in coherent quantum conductors fed by nonthermal resources. Such nonthermal resources, which cannot be characterized by temperatures or electrochemical potentials, occur in small-scale systems that are smaller than their thermalization length. Using scattering theory in combination with a Lagrange multiplier method, we optimize the device's performance based on the efficiency, precision, or a trade-off between the two at a given output current. The transmission properties leading to this optimal performance are identified. We showcase our findings with the example of a refrigerator exploiting experimentally relevant nonthermal resources, which could result from competing environments or from light irradiation. We show that the performance is improved compared to a device exploiting a thermal resource. Our results can serve as guidelines for the design of energy-conversion processes in future nanoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Direct energy dissipation measurements for a driven superfluid via the harmonic-potential theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate a method to directly measure energy dissipation for a linearly driven superfluid confined in a harmonic trap. The method relies on a perturbed version of the harmonic-potential theorem, according to which a potential perturbation - effectively acting as a stirrer - converts center-of-mass motional energy into internal energy. Energy conservation then enables a direct, quantitative determination of the dissipated energy from measurements of the macroscopic center-of-mass observables. Applying this method to a perturbed, driven Bose-Einstein condensate, we observe dissipation curves characteristic of superfluid flow, including a critical velocity that depends on the stirrer strength, consistent with previous studies. Our results are supported by mean-field simulations, which corroborate both the theoretical framework and the experimental findings.</description>

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain, and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations. A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task. On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Analysis of Charge Stability Diagrams with Transformers</title>

Abstract: Transformer models and end-to-end learning frameworks are rapidly revolutionizing the field of artificial intelligence. In this work, we apply object detection transformers to analyze charge stability diagrams in semiconductor quantum dot arrays, a key task for achieving scalability with spin-based quantum computing. Specifically, our model identifies triple points and their connectivity, which is crucial for virtual gate calibration, charge state initialization, drift correction, and pulse sequencing. We show that it surpasses convolutional neural networks in performance on three different spin qubit architectures, all without the need for retraining. In contrast to existing approaches, our method significantly reduces complexity and runtime, while enhancing generalizability. The results highlight the potential of transformer-based end-to-end learning frameworks as a foundation for a scalable, device- and architecture-agnostic tool for control and tuning of quantum dot devices.</description>

      <title>Exploration of Evolving Quantum Key Distribution Network Architecture Using Model-Based Systems Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.15733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realisation of significant advances in capabilities of sensors, computing, timing, and communication enabled by quantum technologies is dependent on engineering highly complex systems that integrate quantum devices into existing classical infrastructure. A systems engineering approach is considered to address the growing need for quantum-secure telecommunications that overcome the threat to encryption caused by maturing quantum computation. This work explores a range of existing and future quantum communication networks, specifically quantum key distribution network proposals, to model and demonstrate the evolution of quantum key distribution network architectures. Leveraging Orthogonal Variability Modelling and Systems Modelling Language as candidate modelling languages, the study creates traceable artefacts to promote modular architectures that are reusable for future studies. We propose a variability-driven framework for managing fast-evolving network architectures with respect to increasing stakeholder expectations. The result contributes to the systematic development of viable quantum key distribution networks and supports the investigation of similar integration challenges relevant to the broader context of quantum systems engineering.</description>

      <title>Effective programming of a photonic processor with complex interferometric structure</title>

Abstract: Reconfigurable photonics have rapidly become an invaluable tool for information processing. Light-based computing accelerators are promising for boosting neural network learning and inference and optical interconnects are foreseen as a solution to the information transfer bottleneck in high-performance computing. In this study, we demonstrate the successful programming of a transformation implemented using a reconfigurable photonic circuit with a non-conventional architecture. The core of most photonic processors is an MZI-based architecture that establishes an analytical connection between the controllable parameters and circuit transformation. However, several architectures that are substantially more difficult to program have improved robustness to fabrication defects. We use two algorithms that rely on different initial datasets to reconstruct the circuit model of a complex interferometer, and then program the required unitary transformation. Both methods performed accurate circuit programming with an average fidelity above 98\%. Our results provide a strong foundation for the introduction of non-conventional interferometric architectures for photonic information processing.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning has the potential to computationally outperform classical machine learning, but it is not yet clear whether it will actually be valuable for practical problems. While some artificial scenarios have shown that certain quantum machine learning techniques may be advantageous compared to their classical counterpart, evidence does not yet suggest that quantum machine learning has surpassed conventional approaches in dealing with standard classical datasets, such as MNIST dataset. In contrast, dealing with quantum data, such as quantum states or circuits, may be the task where we can benefit from quantum methods. Therefore, it is important to develop practically meaningful quantum datasets for which we expect quantum methods to be superior. In this paper, we propose a machine learning task that is likely to soon arise in the real world: clustering and classification of quantum circuits. We provide a dataset of quantum circuits optimized by the variational quantum eigensolver. We utilized six common types of Hamiltonians in condensed matter physics, with a range of 4-20 qubits, and applied ten different ansatz with varying depths (ranging from 3 to 32) to generate a quantum circuit dataset of six distinct classes, each containing 300 samples. We show that this dataset can be easily learned using quantum methods. In particular, we demonstrate a successful classification of our dataset using real four-qubit devices available through IBMQ. By providing a setting and an elementary dataset where quantum machine learning is expected to be beneficial, we hope to encourage and ease the advancement of the field.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Gaussian quantum optics with a limited number of non-linearities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well known in quantum optics that any process involving the preparation of a multimode gaussian state, followed by a gaussian operation and gaussian measurements, can be efficiently simulated by classical computers. Here, we provide evidence that computing transition amplitudes of Gaussian processes with a single-layer of non-linearities is hard for classical computers. To do so, we show how an efficient algorithm to solve this problem could be used to efficiently approximate outcome probabilities of a Gaussian boson sampling experiment. We also extend this complexity result to the problem of computing transition probabilities of Gaussian processes with two layers of non-linearities, by developing a Hadamard test for continuous-variable systems that may be of independent interest. Given recent experimental developments in the implementation of photon-photon interactions, our results may inspire new schemes showing quantum computational advantage or algorithmic applications of non-linear quantum optical systems realizable in the near-term.</description>

      <title>Routing in Quantum Repeater Networks with Mixed Efficiency Figures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08990v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores an approach to routing in quantum networks, which targets practical scenarios for quantum networks, mirroring real-world classical networks. By addressing practical constraints, we examine the impact of heterogeneous nodes with mixed efficiency figures on quantum network performance. In particular, we focus on some key parameters in an operational quantum network such as the fraction of nodes with a higher efficiency (called high-quality), path establishment order, end-to-end fidelity, i.e., a measure of the quality of the end-to-end entanglement established. Our simulations show that incorporating knowledge of node quality not only helps boost the fidelity of some of the routing paths but also reduces the number of blocked paths in the quantum network. The study also highlights the critical role of the fraction of high-quality nodes in end-to-end fidelity and explores the trade-offs between upgrading all nodes to high quality or retaining a subset of lower-quality nodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon addition to quantized light is of immense interest, both experimentally and theoretically. We identify a set of markers that play an important role in the context of photon addition to coherent states of light. These markers are directly computable from optical tomograms. We calculate the amplification gain due to photon addition, and the dependence of quadrature variances on relevant parameters, from the tomograms and compare them with results obtained after state reconstruction in a recent experiment. Our results match well with the fidelity plots reported by the experimenters. Our approach which circumvents state reconstruction could provide a viable procedure to identify specific aspects of photon addition to nonclassical light as well, from the tomograms themselves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding the minimal relative entropy of two quantum states under semidefinite constraints is a pivotal problem located at the mathematical core of various applications in quantum information theory. An efficient method for providing provable upper and lower bounds is the central result of this work. Our primordial motivation stems from the essential task of estimating secret key rates for QKD from the measurement statistics of a real device. Further applications include the computation of channel capacities, the estimation of entanglement measures and many more. We build on a recently introduced integral representation of quantum relative entropy by [Frenkel, Quantum 7, 1102 (2023)] and provide reliable bounds as a sequence of semidefinite programs (SDPs). Our approach ensures provable sublinear convergence in the discretization, while also maintaining resource efficiency in terms of SDP matrix dimensions. Additionally, we can provide gap estimates to the optimum at each iteration stage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04244v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certified randomness guaranteed to be unpredictable by adversaries is central to information security. The fundamental randomness inherent in quantum physics makes certification possible from devices that are only weakly characterised, i.e. requiring little trust in their implementation. It was recently shown that the amount of certifiable randomness can be greatly improved using the so-called Entropy Accumulation Theorem generalised to prepare-and-measure settings. Furthermore, this approach allows a finite-size analysis which avoids assuming that all rounds are independent and identically distributed. Here, we demonstrate this improvement in semi-device-independent randomness certification from untrusted measurements.</description>

Abstract: Given the diverse array of physical systems available for quantum computing and the absence of a well-defined quantum internet protocol stack, the design and optimisation of quantum networking protocols remain largely unexplored. To address this, we introduce an approach that facilitates the establishment of paths capable of delivering end-to-end fidelity above a specified threshold, without requiring detailed knowledge of the quantum network properties. In this study, we define algorithms that are specific instances of this approach and evaluate them in comparison to Dijkstra shortest path algorithm and a fully knowledge-aware algorithm through simulations. Our results demonstrate that one of the proposed algorithms consistently outperforms the other methods in delivering paths above the fidelity threshold, across various network topologies and the number of source-destination pairs involved, while maintaining significant levels of fairness among the users and being robust to inaccurate estimations of the expected end-to-end fidelity.</description>

      <title>Coprime Bivariate Bicycle Codes and Their Layouts on Cold Atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10001v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing is deemed to require error correction at scale to mitigate physical noise by reducing it to lower noise levels while operating on encoded logical qubits. Popular quantum error correction schemes include CSS code, of which surface codes provide regular mappings onto 2D planes suitable for contemporary quantum devices together with known transversal logical gates. Recently, qLDPC codes have been proposed as a means to provide denser encoding with the class of bivariate bicycle (BB) codes promising feasible design for devices.
  This work contributes a novel subclass of BB codes suitable for quantum error correction. This subclass employs {\em coprimes} and the product $xy$ of the two generating variables $x$ and $y$ to construct polynomials, rather than using $x$ and $y$ separately as in vanilla BB codes. In contrast to vanilla BB codes, where parameters remain unknown prior to code discovery, the rate of the proposed code can be determined beforehand by specifying a factor polynomial as an input to the numerical search algorithm. Using this coprime-BB construction, we found a number of surprisingly short to medium-length codes that were previously unknown. We also propose a layout on cold atom arrays tailored for coprime-BB codes. The proposed layout reduces both move time for short to medium-length codes and the number of moves of atoms to perform syndrome extractions. We consider an error model with global laser noise on cold atoms, and simulations show that our proposed layout achieves significant improvements over prior work across the simulated codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a numerical framework for establishing lower bounds on the conditional von-Neumann entropy in device-independent quantum cryptography and randomness extraction scenarios. Leveraging a hierarchy of semidefinite programs derived from the Navascu\'es-Pironio-Acin (NPA) hierarchy, our tool enables efficient computation of entropy bounds based solely on observed statistics, assuming the validity of quantum mechanics. The method's computational efficiency is ensured by its reliance on projective operators within the non-commutative polynomial optimization problem. The method facilitates provable bounds for extractable randomness in noisy scenarios and aligns with modern entropy accumulation theorems. Consequently, the framework offers an adaptable tool for practical quantum cryptographic protocols, expanding secure communication possibilities in untrusted environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09549v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to apply a quantum computing technique to compose artworks. The main idea is to revisit three paintings of different styles and historical periods: ''Narciso'', painted circa 1597-1599 by Michelangelo Merisi (Caravaggio), ''Les fils de l'homme'', painted in 1964 by Rene Magritte and ''192 Farben'', painted in 1966 by Gerard Richter. We utilize the output of a quantum computation to change the composition in the paintings, leading to a paintings series titled ''Quantum Transformation I, II, III''. In particular, the figures are discretized into square lattices and the order of the pieces is changed according to the result of the quantum simulation. We consider an Ising Hamiltonian as the observable in the quantum computation and its time evolution as the final outcome. From a classical subject to abstract forms, we seek to combine classical and quantum aesthetics through these three art pieces. Besides experimenting with hardware runs and circuit noise, our goal is to reproduce these works as physical oil paintings on wooden panels. With this process, we complete a full circle between classical and quantum techniques and contribute to rethinking Art practice in the era of quantum computing technologies.</description>

Abstract: We investigate how local distinguishability can restrict global properties of bi-partite states. We begin exploring how non-locality becomes limited by optimal local state discrimination and observe a non-trivial trade-off between the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) violation and success probability of local discrimination. We extend our findings to bounding the maximally entangled sate fidelity and global observables such as the energy. Our results show that optimal local state discrimination can become a powerful tool to limit global behaviours, e.g. from entangled adversaries in quantum cryptography.</description>

Abstract: We propose to employ the amplification mechanism of Grover's search algorithm to efficiently prepare entangled states of an ensemble of qubits. The conditional change of sign employed in the algorithm can be implemented by the phase shift of photons scattered on an optical cavity hosting an atomic ensemble. We show that collective Dicke states, GHZ states, and Schr\"odinger cat superpositions of $N$ atoms may be prepared deterministically by few ($\sim N^{1/4}$) photon scattering events without individual addressing of the atoms.</description>

      <title>Deterministic carving of quantum states with Grover's algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18884v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that iteration of a few ( $\sim N^{1/4}$) unitary steps of Grover's algorithm suffices to perfectly prepare a Dicke state of $N$ atoms in a cavity. We also show that a few subsequent Grover steps can be employed to generate GHZ and Cat states. The Grover iteration is physically realized by global qubit rotations and by the phase shift of single photons reflected on the cavity. Our protocols are deterministic and require no individual addressing of the atoms. A detailed error analysis accounting for spatial mode matching of the photon to the cavity, spontaneous emission, mirror scattering, and the finite bandwidth of the photon mode is used to predict the fidelity of the prepared states as a function of system parameters and atom-cavity cooperativity. The fidelity can be increased by heralding on detection of the reflected photon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08359v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and theoretically analyse a superconducting electric circuit which can be used to experimentally realize an autonomous quantum heat engine. Using a quasiclassical, non-Markovian theoretical model, we demonstrate that coherent microwave power generation can emerge solely from the heat flow through the circuit determined by non-linear circuit quantum electrodynamics. The predicted energy generation rate is sufficiently high for experimental observation with contemporary techniques, rendering this work a significant step toward the first experimental realization of an autonomous quantum heat engine based on Otto cycles.</description>

      <title>Quantum natural gradient with thermal-state initialization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are central to variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), yet their performance is hindered by complex loss landscapes that make their trainability challenging. Quantum natural gradient descent, which leverages the geometry of the parameterized space through quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix, offers a promising solution but has been largely limited to pure-state scenarios, with only approximate methods available for mixed-state settings. This paper addresses this question, originally posed in [Stokes et al., Quantum 4, 269 (2020)], by providing exact methods to compute three quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix-the Fisher-Bures, Wigner-Yanase, and Kubo-Mori information matrices-for PQCs initialized with thermal states. We prove that these matrix elements can be estimated using quantum algorithms combining the Hadamard test, classical random sampling, and Hamiltonian simulation. By broadening the set of quantum generalizations of Fisher information and realizing their unbiased estimation, our results enable the implementation of quantum natural gradient descent algorithms for mixed-state PQCs, thereby enhancing the flexibility of optimization when using VQAs. Another immediate consequence of our findings is to establish fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a state generated by an unknown PQC, when given sample access to such a state.</description>

      <title>The concept of minimal dissipation and the identification of work in autonomous systems: A view from classical statistical physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the concept of minimal dissipation has been brought forward as a means to define work performed on open quantum systems [Phys. Rev. A 105, 052216 (2022)]. We discuss this concept from the point of view of projection operator formalisms in classical statistical physics. We analyse an autonomous composite system which consists of a system and an environment in the most general sense (i.e. we neither impose conditions on the coupling between system and environment nor on the properties of the environment). One condition any useful definition of work needs to fulfill is that it reproduces the thermodynamic notion of work in the limit of weak coupling to an environment that has infinite heat capacity. We propose a projection operator route to a definition of work that reaches this limit and we discuss its relation to minimal dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Security analyses in quantum key distribution (QKD) and other adversarial quantum tasks often assume perfect device models. However, real-world implementations often deviate from these models. Thus, it is important to develop security proofs that account for such deviations from ideality. In this work, we develop a general framework for analysing imperfect threshold detectors, treating uncharacterised device parameters such as dark counts and detection efficiencies as adversarially controlled within some ranges. This approach enables a rigorous worst-case analysis, ensuring security proofs remain valid under realistic conditions. Our results strengthen the connection between theoretical security and practical implementations by introducing a flexible framework for integrating detector imperfections into adversarial quantum protocols.</description>

Abstract: Achieving industrial quantum advantage is unlikely without the use of quantum error correction (QEC). Other QEC codes beyond surface code are being experimentally studied, such as color codes and quantum Low-Density Parity Check (qLDPC) codes, that could benefit from new quantum processing unit (QPU) architectures. We introduce the six-qubit star lattice architecture that offers parallelism and effective local all-to-all connectivity and thus enables hardware-efficient implementation of certain QEC codes. As a first demonstration of this new architecture, we encode two logical qubits in a six-qubit superconducting QPU with a star-topology using the [[4, 2, 2]] code and characterize the logical states with the classical shadow framework. Logical life-time and logical error rate are measured over repeated quantum error detection cycles for various logical states including a logical Bell state. We measure logical state fidelities above 96 % for every cardinal logical state, find logical life-times above the best physical element, and logical error-per-cycle values ranging from 0.25(2) % to 0.91(3) %. In future, such star QPU can be tiled to enable QEC codes with high-weight and overlapping stabilizers for improved encoding rates.</description>

      <title>Locality-aware Pauli-based computation for local magic state preparation</title>

Abstract: Magic state distillation, a process for preparing magic states needed to implement non-Clifford gates fault-tolerantly, plays a crucial role in fault-tolerant quantum computation. Historically, it has been a major bottleneck, leading to the pursuit of computation schemes optimized for slow magic state preparation. Recent advances in magic state distillation have significantly reduced the overhead, enabling the simultaneous preparation of many magic states. However, the magic state transfer cost prevents the conventional layout from efficiently utilizing them, highlighting the need for an alternative scheme optimized for highly parallel quantum algorithms. In this study, we propose locality-aware Pauli-based computation, a novel compilation scheme that distills magic states in the computation area, aiming to reduce execution time by minimizing magic state transfer costs and improving locality. Numerical experiments on random circuit sampling and 2D Ising Hamiltonian simulation demonstrate that our scheme significantly reduces execution time, while incurring little or no additional spatial overhead, compared to sequential Pauli-based computation, a conventional computation scheme, and scales favorably with increasing qubit count.</description>

Abstract: We design the information-acquiring von Neumann architecture of a computer in a fine-grained or coarse-grained model, where information is carried by classical bits. This architecture enables both a Hamiltonian process converting a given input pure state to another output pure state of the system to be considered (functionality) and a physical process to acquire information (subjectivity). The latter process is identified with the projection hypothesis in projective quantum measurement in the ensemble interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Uhlmann and scalar Wilczek-Zee phases of degenerate quantum systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wilczek-Zee (WZ) holonomy arises in degenerate states while the Uhlmann holonomy characterizes finite-temperature topology. We investigate possible relationships between the Uhlmann phase and the scalar WZ phase, which reflects the Uhlmann and WZ holonomy respectively, in an exemplary four-level model with two doubly degenerate subspaces. Through exact solutions, we contrast the behavior of the Uhlmann and WZ connections and their associated phases. In the zero-temperature limit, the Uhlmann phase may or may not agree with the scalar WZ phase of the degenerate ground states due to obstructions from the Hamiltonian manifested as Dirac points. This is in stark contrast to non-degenerate systems where the correspondence between the Uhlmann and Berry phases in general holds. Our analyses further show that for the example studied here, the Uhlmann phase catches the singular behavior at the Dirac points while the WZ connection and scalar WZ phase vanish along a zero-field axis. We also briefly discuss possible experimental implications.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Random Walks in Biomolecular Networks</title>

Abstract: Biomolecular networks, such as protein-protein interactions, gene-gene associations, and cell-cell interactions, offer valuable insights into the complex organization of biological systems. These networks are key to understanding cellular functions, disease mechanisms, and identifying therapeutic targets. However, their analysis is challenged by the high dimensionality, heterogeneity, and sparsity of multi-omics data. Random walk algorithms are widely used to propagate information through disease modules, helping to identify disease-associated genes and uncover relevant biological pathways. In this work, we investigate the limitations of classical random walks and explore the potential of quantum random walks (QRWs) for biomolecular network analysis. We evaluate QRWs in two network-based applications. First, in a gene-gene interaction network associated with asthma, autism, and schizophrenia, QRWs more accurately rank disease-associated genes compared to classical methods. Second, in a structured multi-partite cell-cell interaction network derived from mouse brown adipose tissue, QRWs identify key driver genes in malignant cells that are overlooked by classical random walks. Our findings suggest that quantum random walks offer a promising alternative to classical approaches, with improved sensitivity to network structure and better performance in identifying biologically relevant features. This highlights their potential in advancing network medicine and systems biology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum speed limits set fundamental lower bounds on the time required for a quantum system to evolve between states. Traditional bounds, such as those by Mandelstam-Tamm and Margolus-Levitin, rely on state distinguishability and become trivial for cyclic evolutions where the initial and final states coincide. In this work, we explore an alternative approach based on isoholonomic inequalities, which bound the length of closed state space trajectories in terms of their holonomy. Building on a gauge-theoretic framework for mixed state geometric phases, we extend the concept of isoholonomic inequalities to closed curves of isospectral and isodegenerate density operators. This allows us to derive a new quantum speed limit that remains nontrivial for cyclic evolutions. Our results reveal deep connections between the temporal behavior of cyclic quantum systems and holonomy.</description>

      <title>Fast simulations of X-ray absorption spectroscopy for battery materials on a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a leading technique for understanding structural changes in advanced battery materials such as lithium-excess cathodes. However, extracting critical information like oxidation states from the experimental spectra requires expensive and time-consuming simulations. Building upon a recent proposal to simulate XAS using quantum computers, this work proposes a highly-optimized implementation of the time-domain algorithm for X-ray absorption. Among a host of improvements to Hamiltonian representation, circuit implementation, and measurement strategies, three optimizations are key to the efficiency of the algorithm. The first is the use of product formulas with the compressed double factorized form of the Hamiltonian. The second is recognizing that for spectroscopy applications, it is sufficient to control the error in the eigenvalues of the (approximate) Hamiltonian being implemented by the product formula, rather than the generic error on the full time evolution operator. Using perturbation theory to estimate this eigenvalue error, we find that significantly fewer Trotter steps are needed than expected from the time evolution error bound. The third is the choice of an optimized distribution of samples that takes advantage of the exponentially decaying Lorentzian kernel. Through constant factor resource estimates, we show that a challenging model Li$_4$Mn$_2$O cluster system with 18 spatial orbitals and 22 electrons in the active space can be simulated with 100 logical qubits and less than $4 \times 10^8$ T gates per circuit. Finally, the algorithm is implemented on a simulator, and the reconstructed spectrum is verified against a classical computational reference. The low cost of our algorithm makes it attractive to use on fault-tolerant quantum devices to accelerate the development and commercialization of high-capacity battery cathodes.</description>

Abstract: We describe an efficient quantum algorithm for solving the linear matrix equation AX+XB=C, where A, B, and C are given complex matrices and X is unknown. This is known as the Sylvester equation, a fundamental equation with applications in control theory and physics. Our approach constructs the solution matrix X/x in a block-encoding, where x is a rescaling factor needed for normalization. This allows us to obtain certain properties of the entries of X exponentially faster than would be possible from preparing X as a quantum state. The query and gate complexities of the quantum circuit that implements this block-encoding are almost linear in a condition number that depends on A and B, and depend logarithmically in the dimension and inverse error. We show how our quantum circuits can solve BQP-complete problems efficiently, discuss potential applications and extensions of our approach, its connection to Riccati equation, and comment on open problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08799v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce measurement-based quantum diffusion models that bridge classical and quantum diffusion theory through randomized weak measurements. The measurement-based approach naturally generates stochastic quantum trajectories while preserving purity at the trajectory level and inducing depolarization at the ensemble level. We address two quantum state generation problems: trajectory-level recovery of pure state ensembles and ensemble-average recovery of mixed states. For trajectory-level recovery, we establish that quantum score matching is mathematically equivalent to learning unitary generators for the reverse process. For ensemble-average recovery, we introduce local Petz recovery maps for states with finite correlation length and classical shadow reconstruction for general states, both with rigorous error bounds. Our framework establishes Petz recovery maps as quantum generalizations of reverse Fokker-Planck equations, providing a rigorous bridge between quantum recovery channels and classical stochastic reversals. This work enables new approaches to quantum state generation with potential applications in quantum information science.</description>

      <title>A 1.5-Query Lower Bound for the Unitary Synthesis Problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a new lower bound for the unitary synthesis problem in the so-called 1.5-query setting. Our analysis establishes that any attempt to implement arbitrary n-qubit unitaries via limited oracle access requires resources that exceed the fractional query threshold. This result extends the one-query lower bound of Lombardi, Ma, and Wright (2023) to the fractional query regime, and introduces a conservative and chaining-based approach to handle intermediate query complexities. As a consequence, we derive cryptographic implications, showing that pseudorandom quantum states remain secure against adversaries restricted to 1.5 queries. Our work provides both conceptual clarification of fractional-query complexity and practical insights into the design of quantum cryptographic protocols.</description>

      <title>Beyond Copenhagen: Following the Trail of Decoherence in Feynman's Light Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feynman's light microscope invites us to reconsider what we thought we knew about quantum reality. Rather than invoking wavefunction collapse to predict the loss of fringes in a monitored interferometer, Feynman analyzes the problem in terms of a disturbance. This approach raises the question of whether the classical world, including its localized particles and definite measurement outcomes, might emerge as the universe evolves smoothly according to Schr\"odinger's equation. Treating the particle and its environment as an entangled system, unmodified quantum mechanics shows remarkable success toward this end. This is the purview of decoherence theory. The question of wavefunction collapse then becomes one of what we want from the theory. Do we expect it to describe microscopic reality, or do we consider it to be only a tool for predicting measurement outcomes? Both options are uncomfortable. When applied to unmodified quantum mechanics, the first implies that each moment in time branches into a vast number of divergent macroscopic realities. While the second represents, for most practitioners, a weakened view of science. This article is written to be accessible to anyone with an undergraduate course in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Tautological Tuning of the Kostant-Souriau Quantization Map with Differential Geometric Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.11480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For decades, mathematical physicists have searched for a coordinate independent quantization procedure to replace the ad hoc process of canonical quantization. This effort has largely coalesced into two distinct research programs: geometric quantization and deformation quantization. Though both of these programs can claim numerous successes, neither has found mainstream acceptance within the more experimentally minded quantum physics community, owing both to their mathematical complexities and their practical failures as empirical models. This paper introduces an alternative approach to coordinate-independent quantization called tautologically tuned quantization. This approach uses only differential geometric structures from symplectic and Riemannian geometry, especially the tautological one form and vector field (hence the name). In its focus on physically important functions, tautologically tuned quantization hews much more closely to the ad hoc approach of canonical quantization than either traditional geometric quantization or deformation quantization and thereby avoid some of the mathematical challenges faced by those methods. Given its focus on standard differential geometric structures, tautologically tuned quantization is also a better candidate than either traditional geometric or deformation quantization for application to covariant Hamiltonian field theories, and therefore may pave the way for the geometric quantization of classical fields.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions and Quantum Defect Theory for van der Waals Potentials in Ultracold Molecular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.08694v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have provided exact two-body solutions to the 2D and 3D Schr\"odinger equations with isotropic van der Waals potentials of the form \(\pm 1/r^6\). Based on these solutions, we developed an analytical quantum defect theory (QDT) applicable to both quasi-2D and 3D geometries, and applied it to study the scattering properties and bound-state spectra of ultracold polar molecules confined in these geometries. Interestingly, we find that in the attractive (repulsive) van der Waals potential case, the short-range interaction can be effectively modeled by an infinite square barrier (finite square well), which leads to narrow and dense (broad and sparse) resonance structures in the quantum defect parameter. In the quasi-2D attractive case, shape resonances can appear in an ordered fashion across different partial waves, characterized by sharp phase jumps as the scattering energy is varied. Furthermore, the low-energy analytical expansions derived from QDT show excellent agreement with the exact numerical results, validating the accuracy and usefulness of our analytical approach in describing two-body physics governed by long-range van der Waals interactions.</description>

      <title>One-Electron Quantum Cyclotron as a Milli-eV Dark-Photon Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06519v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using trapped electrons as high-$Q$ resonators for detecting meV dark photon dark matter. When the rest energy of the dark photon matches the energy splitting of the two lowest cyclotron levels, the first excited state of the electron cyclotron will be resonantly excited. A proof-of-principle measurement, carried out with one electron, demonstrates that the method is background-free over a 7.4 day search. It sets a limit on dark photon dark matter at 148 GHz (0.6 meV) that is around 75 times better than previous constraints. Dark photon dark matter in the 0.1-1 meV mass range (20-200 GHz) could likely be detected at a similar sensitivity in an apparatus designed for dark photon detection.</description>

      <title>Matrix logistic map: fractal spectral distributions and transfer of chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard logistic map, $x'=ax(1-x)$, serves as a paradigmatic model to demonstrate how apparently simple non-linear equations lead to complex and chaotic dynamics. In this work we introduce and investigate its matrix analogue defined for an arbitrary matrix $X$ of a given order $N$. We show that for an arbitrary initial ensemble of hermitian random matrices with a continuous level density supported on the interval $[0,1]$, the asymptotic level density converges to the invariant measure of the logistic map. Depending on the parameter $a$ the constructed measure may be either singular, fractal or described by a continuous density. In a broader class of the map multiplication by a scalar logistic parameter $a$ is replaced by transforming $aX(\mathbb{I}-X)$ into $BX(\mathbb{I}-X)B^{\dagger}$, where $A=BB^{\dagger}$ is a fixed positive matrix of order $N$. This approach generalizes the known model of coupled logistic maps, and allows us to study the transition to chaos in complex networks and multidimensional systems. In particular, associating the matrix $B$ with a given graph we demonstrate the gradual transfer of chaos between subsystems corresponding to vertices of a graph and coupled according to its edges.</description>

      <title>Cohomotopy, Framed Links, and Abelian Anyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a natural identification of cobordism classes of framed links with the fundamental group of the group-completed configuration space of points in the plane, by appeal to Okuyama's previously underappreciated interval configuration model for the latter. Under Segal's theorem, these classes are integers generated by the Hopf generator in the 2-cohomotopy of the 3-sphere, and we identify these knot-theoretically with the writhe sum of the linking and framing number of links. We observe that this link invariant is the properly regularized Wilson line observable of abelian Chern-Simons theory, and show, in consequence of the main theorem, that this arises equivalently as the expectation value of pure quantum states on the group algebra, under link sum, of cobordism classes of framed links. Observing that these quantum states regard framed links as worldlines of anyons in that they assign a fixed complex phase factor to each crossing (braiding) of strands, we close with an outlook on implications for the identification of anyonic solitons in 2D electron gases as exotic flux quantized in Cohomotopy instead of in ordinary cohomology.</description>

      <title>Highly Excited Electron Cyclotron for QCD Axion and Dark-Photon Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using highly excited cyclotron states of a trapped electron to detect meV axion and dark photon dark matter, marking a significant improvement over our previous proposal and demonstration [Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 261801]. When the axion mass matches the cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$, the cyclotron state is resonantly excited, with a transition probability proportional to its initial quantum number, $n_c$. The sensitivity is enhanced by taking $n_c \sim 10^6 \left( \frac{0.1~\text{meV}}{\omega_c} \right)^2$. By optimizing key experimental parameters, we minimize the required averaging time for cyclotron detection to $t_{\text{ave}} \sim 10^{-6} $ seconds, permitting detection of such a highly excited state before its decay. An open-endcap trap design enables the external photon signal to be directed into the trap, rendering our background-free detector compatible with large focusing cavities, such as the BREAD proposal, while capitalizing on their strong magnetic fields. Furthermore, the axion conversion rate can be coherently enhanced by incorporating layers of dielectrics with alternating refractive indices within the cavity. Collectively, these optimizations enable us to probe the QCD axion parameter space from 0.1 meV to 2.3 meV (25-560 GHz), covering a substantial portion of the predicted post-inflationary QCD axion mass range. This sensitivity corresponds to probing the kinetic mixing parameter of the dark photon down to $\epsilon \approx 2 \times 10^{-16}$.</description>

      <title>Single-shot readout of the nuclear spin of an on-surface atom</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear spins owe their long-lived magnetic states to their excellent isolation from the environment. At the same time, a finite degree of interaction with their surroundings is necessary for reading and writing the spin state. Therefore, detailed knowledge of and control over the atomic environment of a nuclear spin is key to optimizing conditions for quantum information applications. While various platforms enabled single-shot readout of nuclear spins, their direct environments were either unknown or impossible to controllably modify on the atomic scale. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), combined with electron spin resonance (ESR), provides atomic-scale information of individual nuclear spins via the hyperfine interaction. Here, we demonstrate single-shot readout of an individual $^{\text{49}}$Ti nuclear spin with an STM. Employing a pulsed measurement scheme, we find its lifetime to be in the order of seconds. Furthermore, we shed light on the pumping and relaxation mechanisms of the nuclear spin by investigating its response to both ESR driving and tunnelling current, which is supported by model calculations. These findings give an atomic-scale insight into the nature of nuclear spin relaxation and are relevant for the development of atomically assembled qubit platforms.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction optimization at the complete basis set limit with Multiwavelets and DMRG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10808v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.</description>

      <title>Negative currents in Fabry-P\'erot cavities are caused by interfering paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been predicted that the time-dependent current in a Fabry-P\'erot cavity can turn negative even if the applied voltage pulses are always positive. It has also been suggested that the negative currents are related to interfering paths, however, an analytic description of this surprising phenomenon has so far been missing. Here we make use of Floquet scattering theory to demonstrate that the negative currents indeed are caused by the interference of scattering paths through the cavity with different numbers of roundtrips. Our analytic result can be tested in future experiments as it predicts exactly how the effect should be washed out by an increasing temperature. We show that a similar phenomenon is expected for the heat current, which may also turn negative.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the quantum Brownian motion of a point charge arising as a consequence of two fluctuating point-like boundaries. The study considers Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions imposed on a real massless scalar field. Additionally, we analyze the effects of a fluctuating compactification length on the random motion of the point charge, induced by the imposition of a quasi-periodic condition on the scalar field. By associating a wave function with the length scale of each system, we demonstrate that typical divergences, which commonly appear in scenarios with fixed boundaries and compactification size, are effectively smoothed out. This approach generalizes and extends previous results found in the literature, offering new insights into the regularization of divergences appearing in idealized systems.</description>

      <title>MC-PDFT Nuclear Gradients and L-PDFT Energies with Meta and Hybrid Meta On-Top Functionals for Ground- and Excited-State Geometry Optimization and Vertical Excitation Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) is a post-MCSCF multireference electronic-structure method that explicitly models strong electron correlation, and linearized pair-density functional theory (L-PDFT) is a recently developed multi-state extension that can accurately model conical intersections and locally-avoided crossings. Because MC-PDFT and L-PDFT rely on an on-top energy functional, their accuracy depends on the quality of the on-top functional used. Recent work has introduced translated meta-gradient-approximation (meta-GA) on-top functionals, and specifically the MC23 hybrid meta-GA on-top functional, which is the first on-top functional specifically optimized for MC-PDFT. Here we report the derivation and implementation of analytic nuclear gradients for MC-PDFT calculations using meta-GA and hybrid meta-GA on-top functionals. This development also enables analytic nuclear gradients for the widely successful tPBE0 hybrid on-top functional. Because MC-PDFT nuclear-gradient calculations involve the derivative of the on-top functional, this development also enables the use of meta-GA on-top functionals in L-PDFT single-point energy calculations. We use the new capabilities to test MC23 for ground-state geometries, excited-state geometries, and vertical excitation energies of s-trans-butadiene and benzophenone as well as to test MC23, another hybrid meta-GA, and seven other meta-GA on-top functionals for 441 vertical excitation energies. We find MC23 performs the best of all nine meta and hybrid meta functionals for vertical excitation energies and is comparable in accuracy to tPBE0 and to the NEVPT2 multireference wave function method. Additionally, we directly compare our MC-PDFT vertical excitation results to previously computed TD-DFT values and find that MC-PDFT outperforms even the best performing Kohn-Sham density functional.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Lambda-SX, a typed quantum lambda-calculus that supports multiple measurement bases. By tracking duplicability relative to arbitrary bases within the type system, Lambda-SX enables more flexible control and compositional reasoning about measurements. We formalise its syntax, typing rules, subtyping, and operational semantics, and establish its key meta-theoretical properties. This proof-of-concept shows that support for multiple bases can be coherently integrated into the type discipline of quantum programming languages.</description>
