      <title>Peregrine solitons and resonant radiation in cubic and quadratic media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the fascinating phenomena of resonant radiation emitted by transient rogue waves in cubic and quadratic nonlinear media, particularly those shed from Peregrine solitons, one of the main wavepackets used today to model real-world rogue waves. In cubic media, it turns out that the emission of radiation from a Peregrine soliton can be attributed to the presence of higher-order dispersion, but is affected by the intrinsic local longitudinal variation of the soliton wavenumber. In quadratic media, we reveal that a two-color Peregrine rogue wave can resonantly radiate dispersive waves even in the absence of higher-order dispersion, subjected to a phase-matching mechanism that involves the second harmonic wave, and to a concomitant difference-frequency generation process. In both cubic and quadratic media, we provide simple analytic criteria for calculating the radiated frequencies in terms of material parameters, showing excellent agreement with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Dynamic instabilities and turbulence of merged rotating Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18474v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the simulation results of merging harmonically confined rotating Bose-Einstein condensates in two dimensions. Merging of the condensate is triggered by positioning the rotation axis at the trap minima and moving both condensates towards each other while slowly ramping their rotation frequency. We analyze the dynamics of the merged condensate by letting them evolve under a single harmonic trap. We systematically investigate the formation of solitonic and vortex structures in the final, unified condensate, considering both non-rotating and rotating initial states. In both cases, merging leads to the formation of solitons that decay into vortex pairs through snake instability, and subsequently, these pairs annihilate. Soliton formation and decay-induced phase excitations generate sound waves, more pronounced when the merging time is short. We witness no sound wave generation at sufficiently longer merging times that finally leads to the condensate reaching its ground state. With rotation, we notice off-axis merging (where the rotation axes are not aligned), leading to the distortion and weakening of soliton formation. The incompressible kinetic energy spectrum exhibits a Kolmogorov-like cascade [$E(k) \sim k^{-5/3}$] in the initial stage for merging condensates rotating above a critical frequency and a Vinen-like cascade [$E(k) \sim k^{-1}$] at a later time for all cases. Our findings hold potential significance for atomic interferometry, continuous atomic lasers, and quantum sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Bridging Rayleigh-Jeans and Bose-Einstein condensation of a guided fluid of light with positive and negative temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the free propagation geometry of a light beam (or fluid of light) in a multimode waveguide. As a result of the effective photon-photon interactions, the photon fluid thermalizes to an equilibrium state during its conservative propagation. In this configuration, Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) thermalization and condensation of classical light waves have been recently observed experimentally in graded index multimode optical fibers characterized by a 2D parabolic trapping potential. As well-known, the properties of RJ condensation differ substantially from those of Bose-Einstein (BE) condensation: The condensate fraction decreases quadratically with the temperature for BE condensation, while it decreases linearly for RJ condensation. Furthermore, for quantum particles the heat capacity tends to zero at small temperatures, and it takes a constant value in the classical particle limit at high temperatures. This is in contrast with classical RJ waves, where the specific heat takes a constant value at small temperatures, and tends to vanish above the condensation transition in the normal (uncondensed) state. Here, we reconcile the thermodynamic properties of BE and RJ condensation: By introducing a frequency cut-off inherent to light propagation in a waveguide, we derive generalized expressions of the thermodynamic properties that include the RJ and BE limits as particular cases. We extend the approach to encompass negative temperatures. In contrast to positive temperatures, the specific heat does not display a singular behavior at negative temperatures, reflecting the non-critical nature of the transition to a macroscopic population of the highest energy level. Our work contributes to understanding the quantum-to-classical crossover in the equilibrium properties of light, within a versatile experimental platform based on nonlinear optical propagation in multimode waveguides.</description>
