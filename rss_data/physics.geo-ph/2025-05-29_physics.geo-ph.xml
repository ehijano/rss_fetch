      <title>Ocean-E2E: Hybrid Physics-Based and Data-Driven Global Forecasting of Extreme Marine Heatwaves with End-to-End Neural Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on the end-to-end forecast of global extreme marine heatwaves (MHWs), which are unusually warm sea surface temperature events with profound impacts on marine ecosystems. Accurate prediction of extreme MHWs has significant scientific and financial worth. However, existing methods still have certain limitations, especially in the most extreme MHWs. In this study, to address these issues, based on the physical nature of MHWs, we created a novel hybrid data-driven and numerical MHWs forecast framework Ocean-E2E, which is capable of 40-day accurate MHW forecasting with end-to-end data assimilation. Our framework significantly improves the forecast ability of extreme MHWs by explicitly modeling the effect of oceanic mesoscale advection and air-sea interaction based on a differentiable dynamic kernel. Furthermore, Ocean-E2E is capable of end-to-end MHWs forecast and regional high-resolution prediction using neural data assimilation approaches, allowing our framework to operate completely independently of numerical models while demonstrating high assimilation stability and accuracy, outperforming the current state-of-the-art ocean numerical forecasting-assimilation models. Experimental results show that the proposed framework performs excellently on global-to-regional scales and short-to-long-term forecasts, especially in those most extreme MHWs. Overall, our model provides a framework for forecasting and understanding MHWs and other climate extremes. Our codes are available at https://github.com/ChiyodaMomo01/Ocean-E2E.</description>

      <title>On the concentration distribution in turbulent thermals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent thermals emerge in a wide variety of geophysical and industrial flows, such as atmospheric cumulus convection and pollutant dispersal in oceans and lakes. They form when a volume of buoyant fluid, arising from thermal or compositional density differences, is instantly released from a source. As they rise or sink, heat and mass transfers are likely to occur with the surrounding environment, spanning multiple scales from macroscopic entrainment of ambient fluid to microscopic diffusive processes. Although turbulent thermals are typically investigated through their integral properties, mixing processes specifically depend on the internal distribution of concentration or temperature. Here, we use laboratory fluid dynamics experiments and direct numerical simulations to investigate the mixing of a passive scalar in turbulent thermals with large Reynolds numbers. We track the evolution of the concentration field, computing its moments and the probability density function. The concentration distribution exhibits self-similarity over time, except at high concentrations, possibly because of the presence of undiluted cores. These distributions are well approximated by an exponential probability density function. In the investigated range, we find that concentration distributions are largely independent of the P\'eclet and Reynolds numbers.</description>

      <title>SHARAD Illuminates Deeper Martian Subsurface Structures with a Boost from Very Large Rolls of the MRO Spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21810v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Throughout its mission, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) has often rolled about its along-track axis by up to 28{\deg} to partially compensate for the suboptimal location of the Shallow Radar (SHARAD) antenna along an edge of the spacecraft that is opposite the imaging payload deck, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of echoes returned from the surface. After recent modeling work predicted that a much larger roll would improve the S/N by ~10 dB relative to nadir-pointed observing, MRO began a limited series of 120{\deg} roll maneuvers to test the effects on radar sounding. Three such SHARAD very-large-roll (VLR) observations have been acquired since May 2023, and they show dramatic improvements in signal clarity and depth of penetration, with S/N increasing by 9, 11, and 14 dB over that of nearly coincident observations at 0{\deg} roll angle. In low dielectric terrains, the first and second VLR observations enabled basal detections at depths previously unachievable, reaching depths of 800 m in Medusae Fossae materials and 1500 m through the ice of Ultimi Scopuli, respectively. The second VLR observation also obtained enhanced reflections throughout the ice stack. In the higher dielectric terrain of Amazonis Planitia, the third VLR observation improved continuity of a dipping subsurface interface, but it revealed neither an extension of the interface to greater depths nor any deeper interfaces. The MRO mission intends to obtain more SHARAD VLR observations of polar terrains and of midlatitude glacial and ground ices, sediments, and volcanics.</description>

      <title>A Coupled Hydro-Morphodynamic Model for Sediment Transport using the Moment Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sediment transport is crucial in the hydro-morphodynamic evolution of free surface flows in shallow water environments, which is typically modeled under the shallow water assumption. In classical shallow water modeling for sediment transport, the vertical structure of the flow is collapsed into a depth-averaged and near-bed velocity, usually reconstructed empirically, e.g., using a parameterized logarithmic profile. In practice, large variations from such empirical profiles can occur. It is therefore essential to resolve the vertical structure of the velocity profile within the shallow water framework to better approximate near-bed velocity. This study introduces a model and simulations that incorporate vertical velocity variations and bottom erosion-deposition effects in sediment transport, providing a computationally efficient framework for predicting sediment dynamics in shallow water environments. We employ the so-called moment model approach for the velocity variation, which considers a polynomial expansion of the horizontal velocity in the scaled vertical direction. This allows the use of a complex velocity profile with an extended set of variables determined by the polynomial basis coefficients, resolving the vertical structure as part of the solution. The extended model comprises four components: (1) the standard shallow water equations; (2) moment equations governing evolution of the basis coefficients; (3) an evolution equation for sediment concentration; and (4) a transport equation for the bed. This enables a coupled model for bedload and suspended load transport. We use a hyperbolic regularization technique to ensure model stability and realistic eigenvalues. Several numerical tests, including dam-break cases with and without wet/dry fronts, validate our results against laboratory data.</description>

      <title>Filling the gap in the IERS C01 polar motion series in 1858.9-1860.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07868v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The C01 Earth orientation parameters (EOP) series provided by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) is the longest reliable record of the Earth's rotation. In particular, the polar motion (PM) series beginning from 1846 provides a basis for investigation of the long-term PM variations. However, the pole coordinate $Y_p$ in the IERS C01 PM series has a 2-year gap, which makes this series not completely evenly spaced. This paper presents the results of the first attempt to overcome this problem and discusses some ways to fill this gap. Two novel approaches were considered for this purpose: parametric astronomical model consisting of the bias and the Chandler and annual wobbles with linearly changing amplitudes, and data-driven model based on Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA). Both methods were tested with various options to ensure robust and reliable results. The results obtained by the two methods generally agree within the $Y_p$ errors in the IERS C01 series, but the results obtained by the SSA approach can be considered preferable because it is based on a more complete PM model.</description>

      <title>Large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating, stratified and inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory of various kinds of large-scale clustering of inertial particles in a rotating density stratified or inhomogeneous turbulent fluid flows. The large-scale particle clustering occurs in scales which are much larger than the integral scale of turbulence, and it is described in terms of the effective pumping velocity in a turbulent flux of particles. We show that for a fast rotating strongly anisotropic turbulence, the large-scale clustering occurs in the plane perpendicular to rotation axis in the direction of the fluid density stratification. We apply the theory of the large-scale particle clustering for explanation of the formation of planetesimals (progenitors of planets) in accretion protoplanetary discs. We determine the radial profiles of the radial and azimuthal components of the effective pumping velocity of particles which have two maxima corresponding to different regimes of the particle--fluid interactions: at the small radius it is the Stokes regime, while at the larger radius it is the Epstein regime. With the decrease the particle radius, the distance between the maxima increases. This implies that smaller-size particles are concentrated nearby the central body of the accretion disk, while larger-size particles are accumulated far from the central body. The dynamic time of the particle clustering is about $\tau_{\rm dyn} \sim 10^5$--$10^6$ years, while the turbulent diffusion time is about $10^7$ years, that is much larger than the characteristic formation time of large-scale particle clusters ($\sim \tau_{\rm dyn}$).</description>
