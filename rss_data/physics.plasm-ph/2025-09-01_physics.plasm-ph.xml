      <title>Coherent attosecond pulses generated by a relativistic electron beam interacting with an intense laser at a grazing angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between relativistic electron beams and intense laser fields has been extensively studied for generating high-energy radiation. However, achieving coherent radiation from such interactions needs to precisely control the phase matching of the radiationg electrons, which has proven to be exceptionally challenging. In this study, we demonstrate that coherent attosecond radiation can be produced when a laser pulse interacts at grazing angle with a relativistic electron beam. The electrons oscillate in the laser field and are modulated with a superluminal phase, coherent ultrashort pulse trains are produced in the far field at the Cherenkov angle. This is verified by theoretical modeling and numerical simulations, including three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations and far-field time-domain radiation simulations. Based on our proposed scheme, high-repetition-rate, compact, and high-energy attosecond pulse sources are feasible.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Reconnection and it's Dynamical Role in 2D Magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic Rayleigh-Taylor instability (MRTI) governs material transport and mixing in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas under the influence of gravity and magnetic fields. While magnetic reconnection is known to occur during MRTI evolution, its role in the evolution and energy dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the role of reconnection in the two-dimensional MRTI dynamics, using high-resolution simulations. We establish that reconnection, through facilitating plume merger, relieving magnetic tension, and enabling continued instability growth, forms an essential component for the long-term instability evolution. To quantify the role of reconnection in energy dynamics, we develop a robust automated reconnection detection algorithm and perform a statistical analysis across a range of magnetic field strengths. We find that reconnection accounts for up to $80\%$ of the magnetic-to-kinetic energy transfer in the weak magnetic field regime, while contributing minimally ($\approx 3\%$) to magnetic energy dissipation. Our results establish magnetic reconnection as a critical mechanism that regulates large-scale MRTI dynamics, with implications for astrophysical plasmas and turbulent mixing in magnetized flows.</description>

      <title>X-ray diffraction strains in laser-ablated aluminum, nickel, sodium and Invar: pressures to 475 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamically compressed materials in longitudinal waves are described by two physical models: hydrostatic pressure, with equal, normal, principal stresses or material uniaxially strained in the wave propagation direction. These models are disparate, so experimental comparisons and evaluations are important. Polycrystalline material in a state of hydrostatic pressure, will have no eccentricity of X-ray diffracted Debye-Scherrer rings. A general three-dimensional solution of Bragg diffracted X-rays based on principal crystallographic strains in the compression wave was found. The distortion of X-ray diffraction beams has been used for strain measurements; the analysis developed incorporates a strained reciprocal lattice and the incident X-ray beam. Strain distorted Polanyi surfaces form an annulus of compression with an ellipsoid of revolution in reciprocal space which is intersected by Ewald sphere for Bragg diffraction. The in-situ measurements for strain describe nanosecond diffraction evaluated using two planes, and both in the same crystallographic phase. Diffraction from Al, Ni, Na, and Invar quantify the compression axial strains in these materials: the compression axial ratios are 0.65, 1.05, 0.88 and 1.58 at pressures of 291, 402, 409, and 367 GPa for the respective materials. Crystal structure transformations with homogeneous pressurized stresses, mandating equal normal strains, should not be anticipated to agree with heterogeneous, uniaxially strained and sheared crystalline phases. Measurements support in-plane strains increasing with pressure, p, in fcc and hcp aluminum as with p in GPa.</description>
