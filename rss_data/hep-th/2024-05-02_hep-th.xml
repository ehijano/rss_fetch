      <title>Density of States, Black Holes and the Emergent String Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study universal features of the density of one-particle states $\rho(E)$ in weakly coupled theories of gravity at energies above the quantum gravity cutoff $\Lambda$, defined as the scale suppressing higher-derivative corrections to the Einstein--Hilbert action. Using thermodynamic properties of black holes, we show that in asymptotically flat spacetimes, certain features of $\rho(E)$ above the black hole threshold $M_{\rm min}$ are an indicator for the existence of large extra dimensions, and cannot be reproduced by any lower-dimensional field theory with finitely many fields satisfying the weak energy condition. Based on the properties of gravitational scattering amplitudes, we argue that there needs to exist a (possibly higher-dimensional) effective description of gravity valid up to the cutoff $\Lambda$. Combining this with thermodynamic arguments we demonstrate that $\rho(E)$ has to grow exponentially for energies $\Lambda \ll E \ll M_{\rm min}$. Furthermore we show that the tension of any weakly coupled $p$-brane with $p\geq 1$ is bounded from below by $\Lambda^{p-1}$. We use this to argue that any tower of weakly coupled states with mass below $\Lambda$ has to be a Kaluza--Klein (KK) tower. Altogether these results indicate that in gravitational weak-coupling limits the lightest tower of states is either a KK tower, or has an exponentially growing degeneracy thereby resembling a string tower. This provides evidence for the Emergent String Conjecture without explicitly relying on string theory or supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N} = 2$ Orbi-S-Folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of non-compact backgrounds of Type IIB string theory preserving eight supercharges by combining S-folds and non-perturbative 7-branes wrapping orbifolds, and study the four-dimensional superconformal field theories arising at low energy on $D3$-branes probing them. We draw a precise correspondence between this setup and the torus compactification of six-dimensional orbi-instanton theories with a Stiefel-Whitney twist, and use it to determine the main features of such strongly-coupled systems, like central charges, spectra of Coulomb-branch operators, networks of Higgs-branch flows. Finally, with the aim to improve our understanding of the landscape of $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories, and possibly to extend their classification beyond rank two, we provide a detailed catalogue of all the rank-three theories that our framework gives access to.</description>

      <title>Gravitational entropy is observer-dependent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum gravity, it has been argued that a proper accounting of the role played by an observer promotes the von Neumann algebra of observables in a given spacetime subregion from Type III to Type II. While this allows for a mathematically precise definition of its entropy, we show that this procedure depends on which observer is employed. We make this precise by considering a setup in which many possible observers are present; by generalising previous approaches, we derive density operators for the subregion relative to different observers (and relative to arbitrary collections of observers), and we compute the associated entropies in a semiclassical regime, as well as in some specific examples that go beyond this regime. We find that the entropies seen by distinct observers can drastically differ. Our work makes extensive use of the formalism of quantum reference frames (QRF); indeed, as we point out, the 'observers' considered here and in the previous works are nothing but QRFs. In the process, we demonstrate that the description of physical states and observables invoked by Chandrasekaran et al. [arXiv:2206.10780] is equivalent to the Page-Wootters formalism, leading to the informal slogan "PW=CLPW". It is our hope that this paper will help motivate a long overdue union between the QRF and quantum gravity communities. Further details will appear in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Stress Tensor and Current at Null Infinity in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the framework that reveals the intrinsic conserved stress tensor and current associated with the null infinity of a three-dimensional ($3d$) asymptotically flat spacetime. These are, respectively, canonical conjugates of degenerate metric and Ehresmann connection of the boundary Carrollian geometry. Their conservation reproduces the Bondi-mass and angular momentum conservation equations if the asymptotic boundary is endowed with a torsional affine connection that we specify. Our analysis and results shed further light on the $3d$ flat holography; the stress tensor and current give rise to an asymptotically flat fluid/gravity correspondence. The requirement of a well-defined $3d$ action principle yields Schwarzian action at null infinity governing the dynamics induced by reparametrizations over the celestial circle, in accord with the codimension $2$ holography of $3d$ flat spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Photon propagator for inflation in the general covariant gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon propagator for power-law inflation is considered in the general covariant gauges within the canonical quantization formalism. Photon mode functions in covariant gauges are considerably more complicated than their scalar counterparts, except for the special choice of the gauge-fixing parameter we call the simple covariant gauge. We explicitly construct the position space photon propagator in the simple covariant gauge, and find the result considerably more complicated than its scalar counterpart. This is because of the need for explicitly inverting the Laplace operator acting on the scalar propagator, which results in Appell's fourth function. Our propagator correctly reproduces the de Sitter and flat space limits. We use this propagator to compute two simple observables: the off-coincident field strength-field strength correlator and the energy-momentum tensor, both of which yield consistent results. As a spinoff of our computation we also give the exact expression for the Coulomb gauge propagator in power-law inflation in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

      <title>Heat capacity and quantum compressibility of dynamical spacetimes with thermal particle creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work continues the investigation in two recent papers on the quantum thermodynamics of spacetimes, 1) placing what was studied in [1] for thermal quantum fields in the context of early universe cosmology, and 2) extending the considerations of vacuum compressibility of dynamical spaces treated in [2] to dynamical spacetimes with thermal quantum fields. We begin with a warning that thermal equilibrium condition is not guaranteed to exist or maintained in a dynamical setting and thus finite temperature quantum field theory in cosmological spacetimes needs more careful considerations than what is often described in textbooks. A full description requires nonequilibrium quantum field theory in dynamical spacetimes using `in-in' techniques. A more manageable subclass of dynamics is where thermal equilibrium conditions are established at both the beginning and the end of evolution are both well defined. Here we shall assume an in-vacuum state. It has been shown that if the intervening dynamics has an initial period of exponential expansion, such as in inflationary cosmology, particles created from the parametric amplification of the vacuum fluctuations in the initial vacuum will have a thermal spectrum measured at the out-state. Under these conditions finite temperature field theory can be applied to calculate the quantum thermodynamic quantities. Here we consider a massive conformal scalar field in a closed four-dimensional Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe based on the simple analytically solvable Bernard-Duncan model. We calculate the energy density of particles created from an in-vacuum and derive the partition function. From the free energy we then derive the heat capacity and the quantum compressibility of the spacetimes with thermal particle creation. We end with some discussions and suggestions for further work in this program of studies.</description>

      <title>Rotations and boosts of Hermite functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide transformation matrices for arbitrary Lorentz transformations of multidimensional Hermite functions in any dimension. These serve as a valuable tool for analyzing spacetime properties of MHS fields, and aid in the description of the relativistic harmonic oscillator and digital image manipulation. We also focus on finite boosts and rotations around specific axes, enabling us to identify the Lorentz Lie algebra generators. As an application and to establish a contact with the literature we construct a basis in which the two dimensional rotation operator is diagonal. We comment on the use of hypergeometric functions, the Wigner d-functions, Kravchuk polynomials, Jacobi polynomials and generalized associated Legendre functions.</description>

      <title>Four loop renormalization in six dimensions using Forcer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the Forcer algorithm to renormalize a variety of six dimensional field theories to four loops. In order to achieve this we construct the Forcer master integrals in six dimensions from their four dimensional counterparts by using the Tarasov method. The $\epsilon$ expansion of the six dimensional masters are determined up to weight $9$ where $d$ $=$ $6$ $-$ $2\epsilon$. By applying the Forcer routine the four loop MSbar renormalization of $\phi^3$ theory is reproduced before gauge theories are considered. The renormalization of these theories is also determined in the MOMt scheme. For instance the absence of $\zeta_4$ and $\zeta_6$ is confirmed to five loops in the MOMt renormalization of $\phi^3$ theory. We also evaluate the three loop $\beta$-function of the gauge coupling in six dimensional QCD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper extends two previous one's on pure gravity dealing with Einstein-Hilbert and higher derivatives by including a massless scalar field as representative of matter. We study the renormalization to all orders of perturbation theory, provide the Slavnov-Taylor identity, symmetric partial differential equations and derive finiteness properties in the Landau gauge. It is shown that beginning with one-loop negative norm states originating from higher derivatives disappear.</description>

      <title>Supermassive gauginos in supergravity inflation with high-scale SUSY breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model of supergravity inflation we recently proposed can produce slow roll inflation and a realistic spectrum of particles even without F-term supersymmetry breaking. Supersymmetry is broken only by a D-term induced by a recently discovered new type of Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) term. Almost all supersymmetric partners of the standard model fields can get masses as high as the inflationary Hubble scale. The exception is gauginos, for which the vanishing of F-terms implies an exact cancellation that keeps their masses exactly zero. To cure this problem without spoiling the simplicity of our model we introduce a new term that further enlarges the space of supergravity effective actions. It is an F-term that, similarly to the new FI term, becomes singular in the supersymmetric limit. We show that this term can produce large gaugino masses without altering the spectrum of other states and without lowering the cutoff of the effecive theory.</description>

      <title>Connecting Infinity to Soft Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we study tree-level scattering amplitudes of gravitons under a natural deformation which in the large $z$ limit can be interpreted either as a $k$-hard-particle limit or as a $(n-k)$-soft-particle limit. When $k=2$ this becomes the standard BCFW deformation while for $k=3$ it leads to the Risager deformation. The hard- to soft-limit map we define motivates a way of computing the leading order behavior of amplitudes for large $z$ directly from soft limits. We check the proposal by applying the $k=3$ and $k=4$ versions to NMHV and N$^2$MHV gravity amplitudes respectively. The former reproduces in a few lines the result recently obtained by using CHY-like techniques in \cite{BCL}. The N$^2$MHV formula is also remarkably simple and we give support for it using a CHY-like computation. In the $k=2$ case applied to any gravity amplitude, the multiple soft-limit analysis reproduces the correct ${\cal O}(z^{-2})$ behavior while explicitly showing the source of the mysterious cancellation among Feynman diagrams that tames the behavior from the ${\cal O}(z^{n-5})$ of individual Feynman diagrams down to the ${\cal O}(z^{-2})$ of the amplitude.</description>

      <title>Universal Bounds on CFT Distance Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any unitary conformal field theory in two dimensions with the central charge $c$, we prove that, if there is a nontrivial primary operator whose conformal dimension $\Delta$ vanishes in some limit on the conformal manifold, the Zamolodchikov distance $t$ to the limit is infinite, the approach to this limit is exponential $\Delta = \exp(- \alpha t +O(1) )$, and the decay rate obeys the universal bounds $c^{-1/2} \leq \alpha \leq 1$. In the limit, we also find that an infinite tower of primary operators emerges without a gap above the vacuum and that the conformal field theory becomes locally a tensor product of a sigma-model in the large radius limit and a compact theory. As a corollary, we establish a part of the Distance Conjecture about gravitational theories in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. In particular, our bounds on $\alpha$ indicate that the emergence of exponentially light particles is inevitable as the moduli field corresponding to $t$ rolls beyond the Planck scale along the steepest path and that this phenomenon can begin already at the curvature scale of the bulk geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Abelian Higgs model with multiple scalar fields, but without mass terms. Solving the model non-perturbatively order-by-order in the number of scalar fields, we find that radiative corrections generate masses for the scalar and gauge boson, without spontaneous symmetry breaking. The mass scales are set by the $\Lambda$-parameter of the electroweak running coupling, thereby naturally avoiding the hierarchy problem. No part of our calculation employs a weak-coupling expansion, and we find that the perturbative vacuum is metastable, and hence must decay to the stable non-perturbative vacuum of the theory, which we identify. Although the field content of our Lagrangian is standard, our results predict the existence of two heavy scalar resonances in addition to the Higgs. We believe that these predicted resonances will ultimately allow experimentalists to discriminate between our method and standard solutions of the Higgs model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new computation of the renormalized graviton self-energy induced by a loop of massless, minimally coupled scalars on de Sitter background. Our result takes account of the need to include a finite renormalization of the cosmological constant, which was not included in the first analysis. We also avoid preconceptions concerning structure functions and instead express the result as a linear combination of 21 tensor differential operators. By using our result to quantum-correct the linearized effective field equation we derive logarithmic corrections to both the electric components of the Weyl tensor for gravitational radiation and to the two potentials which quantify the gravitational response to a static point mass.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical simulations of merging galaxy clusters: giant dark matter particle colliders, powered by gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terrestrial particle accelerators collide charged particles, then watch the trajectory of outgoing debris - but they cannot manipulate dark matter. Fortunately, dark matter is the main component of galaxy clusters, which are continuously pulled together by gravity. We show that galaxy cluster mergers can be exploited as enormous, natural dark matter colliders. We analyse hydrodynamical simulations of a universe containing self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) in which all particles interact via gravity, and dark matter particles can also scatter off each other via a massive mediator. During cluster collisions, SIDM spreads out and lags behind cluster member galaxies. Individual systems can have quirky dynamics that makes them difficult to interpret. Statistically, however, we find that the mean or median of dark matter's spatial offset in many collisions can be robustly modelled, and is independent of our viewing angle and halo mass even in collisions between unequal-mass systems. If the SIDM cross-section were sigma/m = 0.1cm^2/g = 0.18 barn/GeV, the 'bulleticity' lag would be ~5 percent that of gas due to ram pressure, and could be detected at 95 percent confidence in weak lensing observations of ~100 well-chosen clusters.</description>

      <title>Maximal acceleration in Rainbow gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive maximal acceleration of a massive particle in Rainbow gravity. Using eight-dimensional phase-space metric compatible with Rainbow gravity, we obtain the maximal acceleration, valid up to first order in the Rainbow gravity parameter $\eta$. Using the positivity condition on maximal acceleration, we find the upper bound on the Rainbow gravity parameter is of the order of $~10^{22}$ for positron and $10^{-44}$ for a black hole. After obtaining the expression for maximal acceleration for different choices of Rainbow functions, we derive corresponding modifications to Unruh temperature. Comparing with the observational value of the Unruh temperature, we find the upper bound on $\eta$ as $~10^{32}$ for positron radiation. %and of the order of $10^{-100}$ for radiation from a black hole. We then derive geodesic equations for different choices of Rainbow functions and also obtain Newtonian limit of these geodesic equations. We find that the changes in the value of maximum acceleration, maximum temperature and Newtonian force equation are dependent on the choices of Rainbow functions.</description>

Abstract: We clarify the conditions of the cosmic quantum chromodynamics (QCD) first-order phase transition in the early universe by carefully distinguishing the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions. While the chiral one with light quarks at zero chemical potential is unlikely to be first order based on the recent lattice QCD calculations, the latter one can be naturally extended with one extra rolling scalar to be first order. The argument is also valid for the dark QCD theory with arbitrary $N_c$ with a wide range of phase transition temperatures, which can be from hundreds of MeV up to beyond TeV. Notably, here we derive the general formula for the deconfinement phase transition potential of SU($N_c$) gauge theory characterized by the Polyakov loop. With the effective potential in hand, the gravitational wave spectrum is then determined via the sound shell model, which then enables us to give for the first time the quantitative analysis of the gravitational wave signals coming from the QCD deconfinement phase transition and awaits the check from future space interferometers.</description>

      <title>Using non-DESI data to confirm and strengthen the DESI 2024 spatially-flat $w_0w_a$CDM cosmological parameterization result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a combination of Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy data and non-CMB data that include Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae, Hubble parameter [$H(z)$], growth factor ($f\sigma_8$) measurements, and a collection of baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data, but not recent DESI 2024 BAO measurements, to confirm the DESI 2024 (DESI+CMB+PantheonPlus) data compilation support for dynamical dark energy with an evolving equation of state parameter $w(z) = w_0 + w_a z/(1+z)$. From our joint compilation of CMB and non-CMB data, in a spatially-flat cosmological model, we obtain $w_0 = -0.850 \pm 0.059$ and $w_a = -0.59^{+0.26}_{-0.22}$ and find that this dynamical dark energy is favored over a cosmological constant by $\sim 2\sigma$. Our data constraints on the flat $w_0w_a$CDM model are slightly more restrictive than the DESI 2024 constraints, with the DESI 2024 and our values of $w_0$ and $w_a$ differing by $-0.27\sigma$ and $0.44\sigma$, respectively. Our data compilation slightly more strongly favors the flat $w_0w_a$CDM model over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model than does the DESI 2024 data compilation.</description>

      <title>On the damping of spin waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, in ideal-spin hydrodynamics, the components of the spin tensor follow damped wave equations. The damping rate is related to nonlocal collisions of the particles in the fluid, which enter at first order in $\hbar$ in a semi-classical expansion. This rate provides an estimate for the timescale of spin equilibration and is computed by considering a system of spin-1/2 fermions subject to a quartic self-interaction. It is found that the relaxation times of the components of the spin tensor can become very large compared to the usual dissipative timescales of the system. Our results suggest that the spin degrees of freedom in a heavy-ion collision may not be in equilibrium by the time of freeze-out, and thus should be treated dynamically.</description>

      <title>Spin-spin correlators on the $\beta$/$\beta^{\star}$ boundaries in 2D Ising-like models: non-universality in the scaling region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate quantitative properties of correlation functions on the boundaries between two 2D Ising-like models with dual parameters $\beta$ and $\beta^{\star}$. Spin-spin correlators in such constructions without reflection symmetry with respect to transnational-invariant directions are usually represented as $2\times 2$ block Toeplitz determinants which are normally significantly harder than the scalar ($1\times 1$-blocked) versions. Nevertheless, we show that for the specific $\beta/\beta^{\star}$ boundaries considered in this work, the symbol matrices allow explicit commutative Wiener-Hopf factorizations. However, the Wiener-Hopf factors at different $z$ do not commute. We will show that due to this non-commutativity, "logarithmic divergences" and non-universal short distance contributions in the Wiener-Hopf factors fail to factorize out completely in the re-scaled correlators. This leads to non-universality of the leading large $r$ asymptotics at the order $\frac {e^{-r}}{r^{\frac{3}{2}}}$, even when the constant terms are re-scaled to be the same.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematical framework for symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy with a non-abelian symmetry group. To obtain a reduced density matrix that is block-diagonal in the non-abelian charges, we define subsystems operationally in terms of subalgebras of invariant observables. We derive exact formulas for the average and the variance of the typical entanglement entropy for the ensemble of random pure states with fixed non-abelian charges. We focus on compact, semisimple Lie groups. We show that, compared to the abelian case, new phenomena arise from the interplay of locality and non-abelian symmetry, such as the asymmetry of the entanglement entropy under subsystem exchange, which we show in detail by computing the Page curve of a many-body system with $SU(2)$ symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We present the two-loop mixed strong-electroweak virtual corrections to the charged current Drell-Yan process. The final-state collinear singularities are regularised by the lepton mass. The evaluation of all the relevant Feynman integrals, including those with up to two different internal massive lines, has been worked out relying on semi-analytical techniques, using complex-valued masses. We can provide, at any arbitrary phase-space point, the solution as a power series in the $W$-boson mass, around a reference value. Starting from these expansions, we can prepare a numerical grid for any value of the $W$-boson mass within their radius of convergence in a negligible amount of time.</description>

      <title>Towards quantum gravity with neural networks: Solving quantum Hamilton constraints of 3d Euclidean gravity in the weak coupling limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider 3-dimensional Euclidean gravity in the weak coupling limit of Smolin and show that it is BF-theory with $\text{U(1)}^3$ as a Lie group. The theory is quantised using loop quantum gravity methods. The kinematical degrees of freedom are truncated, on account of computational feasibility, by fixing a graph and deforming the algebra of the holonomies to impose a cutoff on the charge vectors. This leads to a quantum theory related to $\text{U}_q \text{(1)}^3$ BF-theory. The effect of imposing the cutoff on the charges is examined. We also implement the quantum volume operator of 3d loop quantum gravity. Most importantly we compare two constraints for the quantum model obtained: a master constraint enforcing curvature and Gauss constraint, as well as a combination of a quantum Hamilton constraint constructed using Thiemann's strategy and the Gauss master constraint. The two constraints are solved using the neural network quantum state ansatz, demonstrating its ability to explore models which are out of reach for exact numerical methods. The solutions spaces are quantitatively compared and although the forms of the constraints are radically different, the solutions turn out to have a surprisingly large overlap. We also investigate the behavior of the quantum volume in solutions to the constraints.</description>

Abstract: A new degravitation mechanism within the framework of scalar tensor gravity is proposed. The mechanism eliminates all constant contributions from the potential to the Friedmann equation, leaving only the kinematic and the dynamic terms of the potential to drive cosmic acceleration. We explore a scenario involving a density-triggered phase transition in the late-time universe, and argue that the resulting effective energy density and equation of state parameter can explain late-time cosmology when extrapolated to a region of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>The Inverse of Exact Renormalization Group Flows as Statistical Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We build on the view of the Exact Renormalization Group (ERG) as an instantiation of Optimal Transport described by a functional convection-diffusion equation. We provide a new information theoretic perspective for understanding the ERG through the intermediary of Bayesian Statistical Inference. This connection is facilitated by the Dynamical Bayesian Inference scheme, which encodes Bayesian inference in the form of a one parameter family of probability distributions solving an integro-differential equation derived from Bayes' law. In this note, we demonstrate how the Dynamical Bayesian Inference equation is, itself, equivalent to a diffusion equation which we dub Bayesian Diffusion. Identifying the features that define Bayesian Diffusion, and mapping them onto the features that define the ERG, we obtain a dictionary outlining how renormalization can be understood as the inverse of statistical inference.</description>

      <title>Pole-skipping of gravitational waves in the backgrounds of four-dimensional massive black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.15921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pole-skipping is a property of gravitational waves dictated by their behaviour at horizons of black holes. It stems from the inability to unambiguously impose ingoing boundary conditions at the horizon at an infinite discrete set of Fourier modes. The phenomenon has been best understood, when such a description exists, in terms of dual holographic (AdS/CFT) correlation function that take the value of '0/0' at these special points. In this work, we investigate details of pole-skipping purely from the point of view of classical gravity in 4d massive black hole geometries with flat, spherical and hyperbolic horizons, and with an arbitrary cosmological constant. We show that pole-skipping points naturally fall into two categories: the algebraically special points and a set of pole-skipping points that is common to the even and odd channels of perturbations. Our analysis utilises and generalises (to arbitrary maximally symmetric horizon topology and cosmological constant) the 'integrable' structure of the Darboux transformations, which relate the master field equations that describe the evolution of gravitational perturbations in the two channels. Finally, we provide new insights into a number of special cases: spherical black holes, asymptotically Anti-de Sitter black branes and pole-skipping at the cosmological horizon in de Sitter space.</description>

      <title>Crossed product algebras and generalized entropy for subregions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An early result of algebraic quantum field theory is that the algebra of any subregion in a QFT is a von Neumann factor of type III$_1$, in which entropy cannot be well-defined because such algebras do not admit a trace or density states. However, associated to the algebra is a modular group of automorphisms characterizing the local dynamics of degrees of freedom in the region, and the crossed product of the algebra with its modular group yields a type II$_\infty$ factor, in which traces and hence von Neumann entropy can be well-defined. In this work, we generalize recent constructions of the crossed product algebra for the TFD to, in principle, arbitrary spacetime regions in arbitrary QFTs, paving the way to the study of entanglement entropy without UV divergences. In contrast to previous works, we emphasize that this construction is independent of gravity. In this sense, the crossed product construction represents a refinement of Haag's assignment of nets of observable algebras to spacetime regions by providing a natural construction of a type II factor. We present several concrete examples: a QFT in Rindler space, a CFT in an open ball of Minkowski space, and arbitrary boundary subregions in AdS/CFT. In the holographic setting, we provide a novel argument for why the bulk dual must be the entanglement wedge, and discuss the distinction arising from boundary modular flow between causal and entanglement wedges for excited states and disjoint regions.</description>

Abstract: We derive the set of inequalities that is necessary and sufficient for nonlinear causality and linear stability of first-order relativistic hydrodynamics with either a $U(1)_V$ conserved current or a $U(1)_A$ current with a chiral anomaly or both. Our results apply to generic hydrodynamic frames in which no relations among the transport parameters are imposed. Furthermore, our analysis yields, to the best of our knowledge, the first theory of viscous chiral hydrodynamics proven to be causal and stable. We find that causality demands the absence of vorticity-induced heat flux, forcing a departure from the thermodynamic frame in the chiral case. The inequalities for causality and stability define a hypervolume in the space of transport parameters, wherein each point corresponds to a consistent formulation. Notably, causality is determined by just three combinations of transport parameters. We present our results in a form amenable to numerical hydrodynamic simulations.</description>

Abstract: We show how to capture both the non-unitary Page curve and replica wormhole-like contributions that restore unitarity in a toy quantum system with random dynamics. The motivation is to find the simplest dynamical model that captures this aspect of gravitational physics. In our model, we evolve with an ensemble of Hamiltonians with GUE statistics within microcanonical windows. The entropy of the averaged state gives the non-unitary curve, the averaged entropy gives the unitary curve, and the difference comes from matrix index contractions in the Haar averaging that connect the density matrices in a replica wormhole-like manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a Hamiltonian lattice model for the $(1+1)$-dimensional $\text{SU}(N_c)$ gauge theory coupled to one adjoint Majorana fermion of mass $m$. The discretization of the continuum theory uses staggered Majorana fermions. We analyze the symmetries of the lattice model and find lattice analogs of the anomalies of the corresponding continuum theory. An important role is played by the lattice translation by one lattice site, which in the continuum limit involves a discrete axial transformation. On a lattice with periodic boundary conditions, the Hilbert space breaks up into sectors labeled by the $N_c$-ality $p=0, \ldots N_c-1$. Our symmetry analysis implies various exact degeneracies in the spectrum of the lattice model. In particular, it shows that, for $m=0$ and even $N_c$, the sectors $p$ and $p'$ are degenerate if $|p-p'| = N_c/2$. In the $N_c = 2$ case, we explicitly construct the action of the Hamiltonian on a basis of gauge-invariant states, and we perform both a strong coupling expansion and exact diagonalization for lattices of up to $12$ lattice sites. Upon extrapolation of these results, we find good agreement with the spectrum computed previously using discretized light-cone quantization. One of our new results is the first numerical calculation of the fermion bilinear condensate.</description>

      <title>Casimir Forces in CFT with Defects and Boundaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum forces occurring between the defects and/or boundaries of a conformal field theory (CFT). We propose to model imperfect defects and boundaries as localized relevant double-trace operators that deform the CFT. Our focus is on pointlike and codimension-one planar defects. In the case of two parallel membranes, we point out that the CFT 2-point function tends to get confined and develops a tower of resonances with constant decay rate when the operator dimension approaches the free field dimension. Using a functional formalism, we compute the quantum forces induced by the CFT between a variety of configurations of pointlike defects, infinite plates and membranes. Consistency arguments imply that these quantum forces are attractive at any distance. Forces of Casimir-Polder type appear in the UV, while forces of Casimir type appear in the IR, in which case the CFT gets repelled from the defects. Most of the forces behave as a non-integer power of the separation, controlled by the dimension of the double-trace deformation. In the Casimir regime of the membrane-membrane configuration, the quantum pressure behaves universally as $1/\ell^d$, however information about the double-trace nature of the defects still remains encoded in the strength of the pressure.</description>

      <title>No U(1) 'electric-magnetic' duality in Einstein gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the question of whether classical general relativity obeys, beyond the linearised order, an analogue of the global U(1) electric-magnetic duality of Maxwell theory, with the Riemann tensor playing the role analogous to the field strength. Following contradictory claims in the literature, we present a simple gauge-invariant argument that the duality does not hold. The duality condition is the conservation of the helicity charge. Scattering amplitudes of gravitons in general relativity, and of gluons in Yang-Mills theory, violate this selection rule already at tree level. Indeed, the maximally-helicity-violating (MHV) amplitudes are famous for their simplicity. The duality in the linearised theories is, therefore, broken by the interactions. In contrast, the tree-level scattering amplitudes in duality-invariant theories of non-linear electromagnetism are known to obey helicity conservation. While the duality is not a symmetry of the full theory of general relativity, it does hold within a sector of the solution space, including vacuum type D solutions, where the duality is known to rotate between mass and NUT charge.</description>

      <title>Temporal Entanglement Entropy as a probe of Renormalization Group Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently introduced concept of timelike entanglement entropy has sparked a lot of interest. Unlike the traditional spacelike entanglement entropy, timelike entanglement entropy involves tracing over a timelike subsystem. In this work, we propose an extension of timelike entanglement entropy to Euclidean space ("temporal entanglement entropy"), and relate it to the renormalization group (RG) flow. Specifically, we show that tracing over a period of Euclidean time corresponds to coarse-graining the system and can be connected to momentum space entanglement. We employ Holography, a framework naturally embedding RG flow, to illustrate our proposal. Within cutoff holography, we establish a direct link between the UV cutoff and the smallest resolvable time interval within the effective theory through the irrelevant $T\bar T$ deformation. Increasing the UV cutoff results in an enhanced capability to resolve finer time intervals, while reducing it has the opposite effect. Moreover, we show that tracing over a larger Euclidean time interval is formally equivalent to integrating out more UV degrees of freedom (or lowering the temperature). As an application, we point out that the temporal entanglement entropy can detect the critical Lifshitz exponent $z$ in non-relativistic theories which is not accessible from spatial entanglement at zero temperature and density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that quantum fields confined to Lorentzian histories of freely falling networks in Minkowski spacetime probe entanglement properties of vacuum fluctuations that extend unrestricted across spacetime regions. Albeit instantaneous field configurations are localized on one-dimensional edges, angular momentum emerges on these network histories and establish the celebrated area scaling of entanglement entropy.</description>

      <title>Physical Yukawa Couplings in Heterotic String Compactifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the challenges of heterotic compactification on a Calabi-Yau threefold is to determine the physical $(\mathbf{27})^3$ Yukawa couplings of the resulting four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=1$ theory. In general, the calculation necessitates knowledge of the Ricci-flat metric. However, in the standard embedding, which references the tangent bundle, we can compute normalized Yukawa couplings from the Weil-Petersson metric on the moduli space of complex structure deformations of the Calabi-Yau manifold. In various examples (the Fermat quintic, the intersection of two cubics in $\mathbb{P}^5$, and the Tian-Yau manifold), we calculate the normalized Yukawa couplings for $(2,1)$-forms using the Weil-Petersson metric obtained from the Kodaira-Spencer map. In cases where $h^{1,1}=1$, this is compared to a complementary calculation based on performing period integrals. A third expression for the normalized Yukawa couplings is obtained from a machine learned approximate Ricci-flat metric making use of explicit harmonic representatives. The excellent agreement between the different approaches opens the door to precision string phenomenology.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=5$ SCFTs and quaternionic reflection groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was previously noted that for 3d SCFTs with $\mathcal{N}\geq 6$ the moduli space has the form of $\mathbb{C}^{4r}/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is a complex reflection group, at least following suitable gauging of finite symmetries. Here we argue that this observation can be extended also to 3d SCFTs with $\mathcal{N}\geq 5$ SUSY, where $\Gamma$ is now a quaternionic reflection group. To do this, we study the moduli space of the known 3d $\mathcal{N}=5$ SCFTs. For Lagrangian cases, the results for the moduli space are further checked using the superconformal index.</description>

      <title>de Sitter at all loops: the story of the Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the two-dimensional Schwinger model of a massless charged fermion coupled to an Abelian gauge field on a fixed de Sitter background. The theory admits an exact solution, first examined by Jayewardena, and can be analyzed efficiently using Euclidean methods. We calculate fully non-perturbative, gauge-invariant correlation functions of the electric field as well as the fermion and analyze these correlators in the late-time limit. We compare these results with the perturbative picture, for example by verifying that the one-loop contribution to the fermion two-point function, as predicted from the exact solution, matches the direct computation of the one-loop Feynman diagram. We demonstrate many features endemic of quantum field theory in de Sitter space, including the appearance of late-time logarithms, their resummation to de Sitter invariant expressions, and Boltzmann suppressed non-perturbative phenomena, with surprising late-time features.</description>

      <title>Nonlocal Gravity, Dark Energy and Conformal Symmetry: Testing the Hierarchies of Anomaly-Induced Actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal back-reaction generates cosmological models where the trace anomaly reflects the breaking of Weyl invariance. Analyzing these actions yields a dynamic approach to dark energy through anomaly-induced actions (AIAs), that are variational solutions of the trace anomaly functional constraint. Expanded around Minkowski space, they produce semiclassical correlators subject to hierarchical anomalous Ward identities, tied to conformal symmetry and diffeomorphism invariance. We focus on comparing the hierarchy of a specific 4-point function, particularly the 2-gravitons-2-photons correlator $(TTJJ)$, generated by AIAs, to free field theory realizations of the same correlator. We observe that the free field theory original hierarchy splits into one ordinary and one anomalous hierarchy, both satisfying the conservation Ward identities from diffeomorphism invariance. However, we find that the anomalous hierarchy derived from ordinary AIAs in both the Riegert or Fradkin-Vilkovisky gauges, are either affected by double poles or violate the hierarchy of the trace Ward identity, respectively. We show that correct forms of the anomalous hierarchies of 4-point functions (for the $TTTT$ and $TTJJ$), identified in a perturbative free field theory expansion around flat space, are characterised by anomaly poles, corresponding to a curvature expansion in $R\Box^{-1}$, together with Weyl invariant terms. We derive the effective action that generates the correct form of the hierarchy for the $TTJJ$.</description>

      <title>Quasiuniversality from all-in-all-out Weyl quantum criticality in pyrochlore iridates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify an exotic quasiuniversal behavior near the all-in-all-out Weyl quantum critical point in three-dimensional Luttinger semimetals, such as the pyrochlore iridates $R_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, with $R$ a rare-earth element. The quasiuniversal behavior is characterized by power laws with exponents that vary slowly over several orders of magnitude in energy or length. However, in contrast to the quasiuniversality discussed in the context of deconfined criticality, the present case is characterized by a genuinely-universal ultra-low-temperature behavior. In this limit, the pertinent critical exponents can be computed exactly within a renormalization group analysis. Experimental implications for the pyrochlore iridates are outlined.</description>

      <title>Peccei-Quinn Inflation at the Pole and Axion Kinetic Misalignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal extension of the Standard Model with the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) scalar field and explain the relic density of the QCD axion through the kinetic misalignment with a relatively small axion decay constant. To this purpose, we consider a slow-roll inflation from the radial component of the PQ field with the PQ conserving potential near the pole of its kinetic term and investigate the post-inflationary dynamics of the PQ field for reheating. The angular mode of the PQ field, identified with the QCD axion, receives a nonzero velocity during inflation due to the PQ violating potential, evolving with an approximately conserved Noether PQ charge. We determine the reheating temperature from the perturbative decays and scattering processes of the inflaton and obtain dark radiation from the axions produced from the inflaton scattering at a testable level in the future Cosmic Microwave Background experiments. We show the correlation between the reheating temperature, the initial velocity of the axion and the axion decay constant, realizing the axion kinetic misalignment for the correct relic density.</description>

      <title>Instanton NDA and Applications to Axion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple set of power counting rules which allows us to easily estimate calculable instanton effects up to $O(1)$ factors. We apply the resulting Instanton NDA to examine the effects of small instantons on various axion models. We confirm that mechanisms that increase the axion mass via small instantons generically also lead to an enhancement of misaligned instanton contributions to the axion potential, deepening the axion quality problem. For generic models, new sources of CP violation in the UV must be absent in order to raise the axion mass above the QCD prediction. However, we find that $Z_N$ and composite axions are UV-safe against these misalignment effects. Axion GUT models are also insensitive to UV contributions at the GUT scale, unless a very large number of extra states are introduced below this scale.</description>

      <title>Anomalous contribution to galactic rotation curves due to stochastic spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a proposed alternative to quantum gravity, in which the spacetime metric is treated as classical, even while matter fields remain quantum. Consistency of the theory necessarily requires that the metric evolve stochastically. Here, we show that this stochastic behaviour leads to a modification of general relativity at low accelerations. In the low acceleration regime, the variance in the acceleration produced by the gravitational field is high in comparison to that produced by the Newtonian potential, and acts as an entropic force, causing a deviation from Einstein's theory of general relativity. We show that in this "diffusion regime", the entropic force acts from a gravitational point of view, as if it were a contribution to the matter distribution. We compute modifications to the expectation value of the metric via the path integral formalism, and find a stochastic contribution which corresponds to a cosmological constant, anti-correlated with a contribution which has been used to fit galactic rotation curves without dark matter. We caution that a greater understanding of this effect is needed before conclusions can be drawn, most likely through numerical simulations, and provide a template for computing the deviation from general relativity which serves as an experimental signature of the Brownian motion of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Hidden BPS states of electroweak monopole and a new bound estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the BPS Lagrangian method, we obtain a distinct set of Bogomolny equations for the Cho-Maison monopoles from the bosonic sector of a regularized electroweak theory. In the limit of $n\rightarrow\infty$ of the permittivity regulator, $\epsilon\left(\rho^n\right)$, the mass of the monopole can be estimated to be $M_W\sim3.56$ TeV. This value is within the latest theoretical window, 2.98 TeV - 3.75 TeV. We also discuss some possible regularization mechanisms of electroweak monopole in the Yang-Mills sector and the existence of its BPS state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose our account of the meaning of local symmetries. We argue that the general covariance principle and gauge principle both are principles of democratic epistemic access to the law of physics, leading to ontological insights about the objective nature of spacetime. We further argue that relationality is a core notion of general-relativistic gauge field theory, tacitly encoded by its (active) local symmetries.</description>
