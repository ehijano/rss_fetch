      <title>Optimizing Broker Performance Evaluation through Intraday Modeling of Execution Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimizing execution costs for large orders is a fundamental challenge in finance. Firms often depend on brokers to manage their trades due to limited internal resources for optimizing trading strategies. This paper presents a methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of broker execution algorithms using trading data. We focus on two primary cost components: a linear cost that quantifies short-term execution quality and a quadratic cost associated with the price impact of trades. Using a model with transient price impact, we derive analytical formulas for estimating these costs. Furthermore, we enhance estimation accuracy by introducing novel methods such as weighting price changes based on their expected impact content. Our results demonstrate substantial improvements in estimating both linear and impact costs, providing a robust and efficient framework for selecting the most cost-effective brokers.</description>

      <title>Constrained monotone mean--variance investment-reinsurance under the Cram\'er--Lundberg model with random coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies an optimal investment-reinsurance problem for an insurer (she) under the Cram\'er--Lundberg model with monotone mean--variance (MMV) criterion. At any time, the insurer can purchase reinsurance (or acquire new business) and invest in a security market consisting of a risk-free asset and multiple risky assets whose excess return rate and volatility rate are allowed to be random. The trading strategy is subject to a general convex cone constraint, encompassing no-shorting constraint as a special case. The optimal investment-reinsurance strategy and optimal value for the MMV problem are deduced by solving certain backward stochastic differential equations with jumps. In the literature, it is known that models with MMV criterion and mean--variance criterion lead to the same optimal strategy and optimal value when the wealth process is continuous. Our result shows that the conclusion remains true even if the wealth process has compensated Poisson jumps and the market coefficients are random.</description>
