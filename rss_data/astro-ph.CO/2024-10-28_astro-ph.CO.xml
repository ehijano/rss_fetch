      <title>The Atacama Cosmology Telescope: A measurement of galaxy cluster temperatures through relativistic corrections to the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high electron temperature in galaxy clusters ($&gt;1\,$keV or $&gt;10^7\,$K) leads to corrections at the level of a few percent in their thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect signatures. Both the size and frequency dependence of these corrections, which are known as relativistic temperature corrections, depend upon the temperature of the objects. In this work we exploit this effect to measure the average temperature of a stack of Compton-$y$ selected clusters. Specifically, we apply the "spectroscopic method" and search for the temperature that best fits the clusters' signal measured at frequencies from 30 to 545 GHz by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and Planck satellite. We measure the average temperature of clusters detected in the ACT maps to be $8.5\pm 2.4\,$keV, with an additional systematic error of comparable amplitude dominated by passband uncertainty. Upcoming surveys, such as the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4, have the potential to dramatically improve upon these measurements and thereby enable precision studies of cluster temperatures with millimeter observations. The key challenge for future observations will be mitigating instrumental systematic effects, which already limit this analysis.</description>

      <title>A cosmological case study of a tower of warm dark matter states: $N$naturalness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the cosmological effects of a tower of warm dark matter states on the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and on large-scale structure (LSS). For concreteness, we consider the $N$naturalness model, which is a proposed mechanism to solve the Higgs hierarchy problem. In this framework, the sector of particles of the Standard Model is copied $N$ times where the Higgs mass-squared value is the only parameter that changes between sectors. The other sectors are similar to our own, except their particles are proportionally heavier and cooler compared to the Standard Model sector. Since each sector is extremely weakly coupled to other sectors, direct observations of the new particles are not expected. The addition of new photon-like species and new neutrino-like species, however, can be detected through the CMB and in LSS data. These additional neutrinos form a tower of states with increasing mass and decreasing temperature compared to the SM neutrinos. This tower causes a more gradual suppression of the matter power spectrum across different comoving wavenumbers than a single warm dark matter state would. We quantitatively explore these effects in the $N$naturalness model and compute the parameter space allowed by the Planck 2018, weak lensing, and Lyman-$\alpha$ datasets. Depending on the underlying parameters, Planck 2018 and weak lensing data can require $N$naturalness to be tuned at the $10\%$ level for Dirac neutrinos and at the $5\%$ level for Majorana neutrinos. The additional neutrino states are crucial in constraining the model, particularly through their suppression of the power spectrum at small scales. The inclusion of many warm dark matter species is computationally very challenging and we make detailed assessments of our approximations and comment on potential future improvements.</description>

      <title>Cosmological forecast for the weak gravitational lensing and galaxy clustering joint analysis in the CSST photometric survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the joint weak lensing and galaxy clustering analysis from the photometric survey operated by the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), and study the strength of the cosmological constraints. We employ a high-resolution JiuTian-1G simulation to construct a partial-sky light cone to $z=3$ covering 100 deg$^2$, and obtain the CSST galaxy mock samples based on an improved semi-analytical model. We perform a multi-lens-plane algorithm to generate corresponding synthetic weak lensing maps and catalogs. Then we generate the mock data based on these catalogs considering the instrumental and observational effects of the CSST, and use the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method to perform the constraints. The covariance matrix includes non-Gaussian contributions and super-sample covariance terms, and the systematics from intrinsic alignments, galaxy bias, photometric redshift uncertainties, shear calibration, and non-linear effects are considered in the analysis. We find that, for the joint analysis of the CSST weak lensing and galaxy clustering surveys, the cosmological parameters can be constrained to a few percent or even less than one percent level. This indicates the CSST photometric survey is powerful for exploring the Universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Dynamics in Einstein-Cartan Theory: Analysing Hubble Tension through Curvature and Torsion field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble tension refers to the significant discrepancy in the Hubble constant $H_{0}$ obtained from two different measurement methods in cosmology. One method derives data from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations by the Planck satellite, yielding a value of $67.4\pm{0.5} \ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}} \mathrm{Mpc^{-1}} $, while the other method relies on direct measurements of Type Ia supernovae, producing a value $73.04\pm{1.04} \ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}} \mathrm{Mpc^{-1}} $. This issue has persisted for several years. To theoretically explore potential solutions to this problem, this paper examines a model within the framework of Einstein-Cartan (EC) theory, where torsion is introduced with spin as the corresponding entity, allowing for the assumption $H = -\alpha \phi$. By employing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and utilizing Cosmic Chronometers (CC) data, we impose parameter constraints on various parameters in the Friedmann equations, particularly focusing on the curvature density parameter $\Omega_k$, to assess whether the model remains stable under this assumption and whether the estimated parameters align more closely with either of the observational results. In conclusion, we find that the parameter constraints in the model incorporating torsion ($ H_0 = 67.6^{+2.1}_{-2.7} \ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, obtained under the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraint with $\Omega_{k}=0$; $ H_0 = 66.2^{+4.4}_{-2.9} \ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, obtained under same constraint but set $\Omega_{k}$ as a free variable; $ H_0 = 68.8^{+2.9}_{-4.2} \ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}\ Mpc^{-1}}$, obtained under the Planck constraint) are more consistent with the value derived from CMB data, favoring the lower $H_0$ value.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Masses of Supercluster-Scale Filaments from Redshift Dispersions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a strategy for estimating the mass per unit length along supercluster-scale filaments that are oriented across the sky, based on mock redshift surveys of 264 filaments from the Millennium simulation. In our fiducial scenario, we place each simulated filament at a distance of 300 Mpc, perpendicular to the line of sight, and calculate the redshift dispersion using galaxies with magnitudes r&lt;19.5. Some regions are dynamically complicated in ways that interfere with finding a simple relationship between dispersion sigma and linear mass density mu. However, by examining individual overlapping segments along the filaments, we find a relationship that allows us to successfully predict log(mu) from log(sigma) with a scatter of about +/- 0.20 dex, for ~ 70% of the regions along filaments. This relationship is robust to changes in the distance to the filament if the physical segment length and the absolute magnitude for galaxy selection are held constant. The relationship between redshift dispersion and mass is similar to that obtained for a simple analytical model where filaments are dynamically relaxed, and we examine the possibility that the galaxies are indeed relaxed within the gravitational potential of the filament. We find that this is not the case; galaxy dynamics are strongly effected by infall to the filament and by orbits within groups and clusters</description>

      <title>Testing Refracted Gravity with kinematics of galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refracted Gravity (RG) is a a classical theory of gravity where a gravitational permittivity $ a monotonically-increasing function of the local density rho , is introduced in the Poisson equation to mimic the effect of dark matter at astrophysical scales. We use high precision spectroscopic data of two massive galaxy clusters, MACS J1206.2-0847 at redshift z=0.44, and Abell S1063 (RXC J2248.7-4431) at z=0.35, to determine the total gravitational potential in the context of RG and to constrain the three, supposedly universal, free parameters of this model. Using an upgraded version of the MG-MAMPOSSt algorithm, we perform a kinematic analysis which combines the velocity distribution of the cluster galaxies and the velocity dispersion profile of the stars within the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG). The unprecedented dataset used has been obtained by an extensive spectroscopic campaign carried out with the VIMOS and MUSE spectrographs at the ESO VLT. We found that RG describes the kinematics of these two clusters as well as Newtonian gravity, although the latter is slightly preferred. However, (i) each cluster requires a different set of the three free RG parameters, and (ii) the two sets are inconsistent with other results in the literature at different scales. We discuss the limitation of the method used to constrain the RG parameters as well as possible systematic effects which can give rise to the observed tension, notably deviations from the spherical symmetry and from the dynamical equilibrium of the clusters.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with voids from the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an accurate forecast of the expected constraining power from the main void statistics -- the void size function and the void-galaxy cross-correlation function -- to be measured by the Roman reference High Latitude Spectroscopic Survey from the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Relying on a realistic galaxy mock lightcone, covering 2000 square degrees, we find more than $8\times 10^4 $ voids and explore their constraining power in the framework of three different cosmological models: $\Lambda$CDM, $w$CDM, and $w_0 w_{\rm a}$CDM. This work confirms the strong complementarity of different void statistics and showcases the constraining power to be expected from Roman voids thanks to the combination of its high tracer density and large observed volume.</description>

      <title>Gauge Dependence of Gravitational Waves Induced by Primordial Isocurvature Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial isocurvature perturbations, which can arise from various sources in the early Universe, have the potential to leave observable imprints on the gravitational-wave background and provide insights into the nature of primordial fluctuations. In this study, we investigate the gauge dependence of induced gravitational waves (IGWs) sourced by these isocurvature perturbations. We analyze the energy density spectra of IGWs in three different gauges: synchronous, Newtonian, and uniform curvature gauges. To facilitate this analysis, we derive analytical solutions for the perturbations that contribute to the IGW spectra. Our results reveal significant differences in the energy spectra across these gauges. We find that the energy density of IGWs increases with conformal time as $\eta^8$ and $\eta^4$ for synchronous and uniform curvature gauges, respectively, while it converges in the Newtonian gauge. These findings highlight the importance of gauge choice in calculating IGWs and have implications for the interpretation of future observations of the gravitational-wave background.</description>

      <title>Blue Monsters at $z&gt;10$. Where has all their dust gone?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The properties of luminous, blue (a.k.a. Blue Monsters), super-early galaxies at redshift $z&gt;10$ have been successfully explained by the attenuation-free model (AFM) in which dust is pushed to kpc-scales by radiation-driven outflows. As an alternative to AFM, here we assess whether *attenuation-free* conditions can be replaced by a *dust-free* scenario in which dust is produced in very limited amounts and/or later destroyed in the interstellar medium. To this aim we compare the predicted values of the dust-to-stellar mass ratio, $\xi_d$, with those measured in 15 galaxies at $z&gt;10$ from JWST spectra, when outflows are not included. Our model constrains $\xi_d$ as a function of several parameters by allowing wide variations in the IMF, dust/metal production, and dust destruction for a set of SN progenitor models and explosion energies. We find $\log \xi_d \approx -2.2$ for all systems, indicative of the dominant role of SN dust production over destruction in these early galaxies. Such value is strikingly different from the data, which instead indicate $\log \xi_d &lt; -4$. We conclude that dust destruction alone can hardly explain the transparency of Blue Monsters. Other mechanisms, such as outflows, might be required.</description>

      <title>Testing cogenesis during reheating with primordial gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the cogenesis of baryon and dark matter (DM) in an extended reheating period after the end of slow-roll inflation. Within the regime of perturbative reheating, we consider different monomial potential of the inflaton field during reheating era. The inflaton condensate reheats the Universe by decaying into the Standard Model (SM) bath either via fermionic or bosonic decay modes. Assuming the leptogenesis route to baryogenesis in a canonical seesaw framework, we consider the bath to produce such RHNs during the period of reheating when the maximum temperature $T_{\rm max}$ of the SM bath is well above the reheating temperature $T_{\rm rh}$. The DM, assumed to be a SM gauge singlet field, also gets produced from the bath during the reheating period via UV freeze-in. In addition to obtaining different parameter space for such non-thermal leptogenesis and DM for both bosonic and fermionic reheating modes and the type of monomial potential, we discuss the possibility of probing such scenarios via spectral shape of primordial gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Stellar stripping efficiencies of satellites in numerical simulations: the effect of resolution, satellite properties and numerical disruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar stripping of satellites in cluster haloes is understood to play an important role in the production of intracluster light. Increasingly, cosmological simulations have been utilised to investigate its origin and assembly. However, such simulations typically model individual galaxies at relatively coarse resolutions, raising concerns about their accuracy. Although there is a growing literature on the importance of numerical resolution for the accurate recovery of the mass loss rates of dark matter (DM) haloes, there has been no comparable investigation into the numerical resolution required to accurately recover stellar mass loss rates in galaxy clusters.
  Using N-body simulations of satellite galaxies orbiting in a cluster halo represented by a static external potential, we conduct a set of convergence tests in order to explore the role of numerical resolution and force softening length on stellar stripping efficiency. We consider a number of orbital configurations, satellite masses and satellite morphologies. We find that stellar mass resolution is of minor importance relative to DM resolution. Resolving the central regions of satellite DM halos is critical to accurately recover stellar mass loss rates. Poorly resolved DM haloes develop cored inner profiles and, if this core is of comparable size to the stellar component of the satellite galaxy, this leads to significant over-stripping. To prevent this, relatively high DM mass resolutions of around $m_{\rm DM}\sim10^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$, better than those achieved by many contemporary cosmological simulations, are necessary.</description>

      <title>CLAP. I. Resolving miscalibration for deep learning-based galaxy photometric redshift estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obtaining well-calibrated photometric redshift probability densities for galaxies without a spectroscopic measurement remains a challenge. Deep learning discriminative models, typically fed with multi-band galaxy images, can produce outputs that mimic probability densities and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. However, such models may be affected by miscalibration that would result in discrepancies between the model outputs and the actual distributions of true redshifts. Our work develops a novel method called the Contrastive Learning and Adaptive KNN for Photometric Redshift (CLAP) that resolves this issue. It leverages supervised contrastive learning (SCL) and k-nearest neighbours (KNN) to construct and calibrate raw probability density estimates, and implements a refitting procedure to resume end-to-end discriminative models ready to produce final estimates for large-scale imaging data. The harmonic mean is adopted to combine an ensemble of estimates from multiple realisations for improving accuracy. Our experiments demonstrate that CLAP takes advantage of both deep learning and KNN, outperforming benchmark methods on the calibration of probability density estimates and retaining high accuracy and computational efficiency. With reference to CLAP, we point out that miscalibration is particularly sensitive to the method-induced excessive correlations among data instances in addition to the unaccounted-for epistemic uncertainties. Reducing the uncertainties may not guarantee the removal of miscalibration due to the presence of such excessive correlations, yet this is a problem for conventional deep learning methods rather than CLAP. These discussions underscore the robustness of CLAP for obtaining photometric redshift probability densities required by astrophysical and cosmological applications. This is the first paper in our series on CLAP.</description>

Abstract: In this work we have investigated the synergy between Stage-IV galaxy surveys and future GW observatories for constraining the underlying cosmological model of the Universe, focussing on photometric galaxy clustering, cosmic shear and GW magnification as cosmological probes. We have implemented a Fisher matrix approach for the evaluation of the full $6\times2$pt statistics composed by the angular power spectra of the single probes together with their combination. For our analysis, we have in particular considered dynamical dark energy and massive neutrino scenarios. We have found that the improvement to galaxy survey performance is below 1\%, in the case $\ell^{\rm GW}_{\rm max}=100$ and a luminosity distance error of $\sigma_{d_L}/d_L=10\%$. However, when extending the analysis to $\ell^{\rm GW}_{\rm max}=1000$, we find that the GW magnification improves the galaxy survey performance on all the cosmological parameters, reducing their errors by $3\%$-$5\%$, when $\sigma_{d_L}/d_L=10\%$, and by $10\%$-$18\%$ when $\sigma_{d_L}/d_L=1\%$, especially for $M_\nu$, $w_0$ and $w_a$. However, here our analysis is unavoidably optimistic: a much more detailed and realistic approach will be needed, especially by including systematic effects. But we can conclude that, in the case of future gravitational wave observatories the inclusion of the gravitational wave magnification can improve Stage-IV galaxy surveys performance on constraining the underlying cosmological model of the Universe.</description>

      <title>DESI 2024: Reconstructing Dark Energy using Crossing Statistics with DESI DR1 BAO data</title>

Abstract: We implement Crossing Statistics to reconstruct in a model-agnostic manner the expansion history of the universe and properties of dark energy, using DESI Data Release 1 (DR1) BAO data in combination with one of three different supernova compilations (PantheonPlus, Union3, and DES-SN5YR) and Planck CMB observations. Our results hint towards an evolving and emergent dark energy behaviour, with negligible presence of dark energy at $z\gtrsim 1$, at varying significance depending on the data sets combined. In all these reconstructions, the cosmological constant lies outside the $95\%$ confidence intervals for some redshift ranges. This dark energy behaviour, reconstructed using Crossing Statistics, is in agreement with results from the conventional $w_0$--$w_a$ dark energy equation of state parametrization reported in the DESI Key cosmology paper. Our results add an extensive class of model-agnostic reconstructions with acceptable fits to the data, including models where cosmic acceleration slows down at low redshifts. We also report constraints on $H_0r_d$ from our model-agnostic analysis, independent of the pre-recombination physics.</description>

      <title>Improving cosmological analyses of HI clustering by reducing stochastic noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18559v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-number-density tracers of large-scale structure, such as the HI-rich galaxies measured by 21 cm intensity mapping, have low sampling noise, making them particularly promising as cosmological probes. At large scales, this sampling noise can be subdominant to other scale-independent contributions to the power spectrum; such contributions arise from nonlinear bias, and exceed the sampling noise if at least one of the associated bias coefficients is sufficiently large. This has important consequences for cosmological constraints obtained from such tracers, since it indicates that using the power spectrum does not lead to optimal constraints even in the linear regime. In this paper, we provide a conservative estimate of the possible improvement in constraining power of a 21cm survey if one were to use an optimal analysis strategy (such as field-level analysis), where only the true sampling noise enters the error budget. We find that improvements in uncertainties on some cosmological parameters can be as large as 50%, depending on redshift, foreground cleaning efficiency, scales used in the analysis, and instrumental noise. One byproduct of our work is measurements of bias parameters and stochasticity for neutral hydrogen in the IllustrisTNG simulation over a wide range of redshifts; we provide simple fitting formulas for these measurements. Our results motivate further exploration of new optimal analysis techniques and provide important insights into the constraining power of current and future 21 cm surveys.</description>

      <title>Catalog-level blinding on the bispectrum for DESI-like galaxy surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the performance of the catalog-level blind analysis technique (blinding) presented in Brieden et al. (2020) in the context of a fixed template power spectrum and bispectrum analysis. This blinding scheme, which is tailored for galaxy redshift surveys similar to the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), has two components: the so-called "AP blinding" (concerning the dilation parameters $\alpha_\parallel,\alpha_\bot$) and "RSD blinding'' (redshift space distortions, affecting the growth rate parameter $f$). Through extensive testing, including checks for the RSD part in cubic boxes, the impact of AP blinding on mocks with realistic survey sky coverage, and the implementation of a full AP+RSD blinding pipeline, our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of the technique in preserving the integrity of cosmological parameter estimation when the analysis includes the bispectrum statistic. We emphasize the critical role of sophisticated -- and difficult to accidentally unblind -- blinding methods in precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>Bending the web: exploring the impact of modified gravity on the density field and halo properties within the cosmic web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13219v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of different Modified Gravity (MG) models on the large-scale structures (LSS) properties in relation to the cosmic web (CW), using N-body simulations of f(R) and nDGP models. We analyse the impact of the MG effect on the density field through density distribution and clustering statistics, and assess its influence on halo properties by examining the halo mass function and spin. We find that the PDF of dark matter density fields shift towards lower densities for stronger variants of f(R) and nDGP. Additionally, when segregated into CW environments, the stronger variants show a higher mean density in knots, and a lower mean density in voids compared to LCDM. For higher-order clustering statistics relative to LCDM, the scale-dependent f(R) variants exhibit a greater non-monotonic deviation as a function of scale when segregated into environments, compared to nDGP. Additionally, the halo mass function separated into CW environments shows a similar behaviour, introducing complex trends as a function of mass for f(R) and nDGP models. We also report up to a 15% enhancement in the angular momentum of halos in f(R) gravity models compared to LCDM, with similar differences when considering environmental segregation. We demonstrate that this difference in the spin arises largely due to different tidal torquing across the various MG models. Therefore, studying higher-order statistics of the cosmological fields and halo properties separated into CW components probes the additional physics contained within the MG models. We conclude that considering the effect of CW in MG studies increases the constraining power of these LSS statistics, and can further aid the distinction between the cosmologies that have an identical expansion history to the standard LCDM but differing underlying physics, such as the MG models presented in this work.</description>

      <title>Mitigation of nonlinear galaxy bias with a theoretical-error likelihood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stage-IV galaxy surveys will measure correlations at small cosmological scales with high signal-to-noise ratio. One of the main challenges of extracting information from small scales is devising accurate models, as well as characterizing the theoretical uncertainties associated with any given model. In this work, we explore the mitigation of theoretical uncertainty due to nonlinear galaxy bias in the context of photometric 2$\times$2-pt analyses. We consider linear galaxy bias as the fiducial model and derive the contribution to the covariance matrix induced by neglected higher-order bias. We construct a covariance matrix for the theoretical error in galaxy clustering and galaxy-galaxy lensing using simulation-based relations that connect higher-order parameters to linear bias. We test the modified likelihood in 2$\times$2-pt analyses based on two sets of mock data vectors: (1) simulated data vectors, constructed from those same relations between bias parameters, and (2) data vectors based on the AbacusSummit simulation suite. We then compare the performance of the theoretical-error approach to the commonly employed scale cuts. We find most theoretical-error configurations yield results equivalent to the scale cuts in terms of precision and accuracy, in some cases producing significantly stronger bounds on cosmological parameters. These results are independent of the maximum scale $k_\mathrm{max}$ in the analysis with theoretical error. The scenarios where linear bias supplemented by theoretical error is unable to recover unbiased cosmology are connected to inadequate modeling of the $gg$-$g\kappa$ covariance of theoretical error. In view of its removing the ambiguity in the choice of $k_\mathrm{max}$, as well as the possibility of attaining higher precision than the usual scale cuts, we consider this method to be promising for analyses of LSS in upcoming photometric galaxy surveys.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background anisotropies from inflation with non-Bunch-Davies states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been known that stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) have anisotropies generated by squeezed-type tensor non-Gaussianities originating from scalar-tensor-tensor (STT) and tensor-tensor-tensor cubic interactions. While the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities in the standard slow-roll inflation with the Bunch-Davies vacuum state are suppressed due to the so-called consistency relation, those in extended models with the violation of the consistency relation can be enhanced. Among such extended models, we consider the inflation model with the non-Bunch-Davies state that has been known to enhance the squeezed tensor non-Gaussianities. We explicitly formulate the primordial STT bispectrum induced during inflation in the context of Horndeski theory with the non-Bunch-Davies state and show that the induced SGWB anisotropies can be enhanced. We then discuss the detectability of those anisotropies in future gravitational wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Modelling the covariance matrix for the power spectra before and after the BAO reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) reconstruction plays a crucial role in cosmological analysis for spectroscopic galaxy surveys because it can make the density field effectively more linear and more Gaussian. The combination of the power spectra before and after the BAO reconstruction helps break degeneracies among parameters, then improve the constraints on cosmological parameters. It is therefore important to estimate the covariance matrix between pre- and post-reconstructed power spectra. In this work, we use perturbation theory to estimate the covariance matrix of the related power spectra multipoles, and check the accuracy of the derived covariance model using a large suite of dark matter halo catalogs at $z=0.5$. We find that the diagonal part of the auto covariance is well described by the Gaussian prediction, while the cross covariance deviates from the Gaussian prediction quickly when $k &gt; 0.1\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. Additionally, we find the non-Gaussian effect in the non-diagonal part of the cross covariance is comparable to, or even stronger than the pre-reconstruction covariance. By adding the non-Gaussian contribution, we obtain good agreement between analytical and numerical covariance matrices in the non-diagonal part up to $k \simeq 0.15\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The agreement in the diagonal part is also improved, but still under-predicts the correlation in the cross covariance block.</description>

      <title>Dark energy and inflation invoked in CCGG by locally contorted space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01088</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.01088v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmological implications of the Covariant Canonical Gauge Theory of Gravity (CCGG) are investigated. We deduce that, in a metric compatible geometry, the requirement of covariant conservation of matter invokes torsion of space-time. In the Friedman model this leads to a scalar field built from contortion and the metric with the property of dark energy, which transforms the cosmological constant to a time-dependent function. Moreover, the quadratic, scale invariant Riemann-Cartan term in the CCGG Lagrangian endows space-time with kinetic energy, and in the field equations adds a geometrical curvature correction to Einstein gravity. Applying in the Friedman model the standard $\Lambda$CDM parameter set, those equations yield a cosmological field depending just on one additional, dimensionless ``deformation'' parameter of the theory that determines the strength of the quadratic term, viz. the deviation from the Einstein-Hilbert ansatz. Moreover, the apparent curvature of the universe differs from the actual curvature parameter of the metric. The numerical analysis in that parameter space yields three cosmology types: (I) A bounce universe starting off from a finite scale followed by a steady inflation, (II) a singular Big Bang universe undergoing a secondary inflation-deceleration phase, and (III) a solution similar to standard cosmology but with a different temporal profile. The common feature of all scenarios is the graceful exit to the current dark energy era. The value of the deformation parameter can be deduced by comparing theoretical calculations with observations, namely with the SNeIa Hubble diagram and the deceleration parameter. That comparison implies a considerable admixture of scale invariant quadratic gravity to Einstein gravity. This theory also sheds new light on the resolution of the cosmological constant problem and of the Hubble tension.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that non-gravitational interactions between dark matter and baryonic matter can affect structural properties of galaxies. Detailed galaxy simulations and analytic estimates demonstrate that dark matter which collects inside white dwarf stars and ignites Type Ia supernovae can substantially alter star formation, stellar feedback, and the halo density profile through a dark matter-induced baryonic feedback process, distinct from usual supernova feedback in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Swampland Conjectures Constraints on Dark Energy from a Highly Curved Field Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay of the trans-Planckian censorship conjecture (TCC) and the swampland distance conjecture (SDC) in the context of multifield dark energy in a curved field space. In this scenario, the phase of accelerated expansion is realized as non-geodesic motion in a highly-curved field space, reminiscent of models developed in the context of inflation. The model features a stable attractor solution with near constant equation of state $w\simeq -1$, and predicts that the current era of accelerated expansion is eternal. The latter implies an eventual conflict with the TCC, which holds that the duration of any epoch of cosmic acceleration is bounded by the requirement that the large-scale observable universe is blind to Planck-scale early universe physics. This tension can be resolved by an interplay with the distance conjecture: for suitable parameter values, the apparent violation of the TCC occurs well after the fields have traversed a Planckian distance. The SDC then predicts a breakdown of the effective field theory (EFT) before the TCC can be violated. We derive the constraints on the model arising from the SDC+TCC and the de Sitter conjecture. We demonstrate that the model can be consistent with both swampland conjectures and observational data from Planck 2018 and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument.</description>

      <title>Using dust to constrain dark matter models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we use hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of Milky Way-type haloes to explore using dust as an observational tracer to discriminate between cold and warm dark matter (WDM) universes. Comparing a cold and 3.5 keV WDM particle model, we tune the efficiency of galaxy formation in our simulations using a variable supernova rate to create Milky Way systems with similar satellite galaxy populations while keeping all other simulation parameters the same. Cold dark matter (CDM), having more substructure, requires a higher supernova efficiency than WDM to achieve the same satellite galaxy number. These different supernova efficiencies create different dust distributions around their host galaxies, which we generate by post-processing the simulation output with the \powderday{} codebase. Analysing the resulting dust in each simulation, we find $\sim$4.5 times more dust in our CDM Milky Way haloes compared with WDM. The distribution of dust out to $R_{200\text{c}}$ is then explored, revealing that the WDM simulations are noticeably less concentrated than their CDM counterparts, although differences in substructure complicate the comparison. Our results indicate that dust is a possible unique probe to test theories of dark matter.</description>
