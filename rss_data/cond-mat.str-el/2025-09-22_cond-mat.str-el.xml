      <title>Asymptotically exact solution of the non-Hermitian disordered interacting Hatano-Nelson chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an asymptotically exact solution of a paradigmatic non-Hermitian model: the disordered interacting fermionic Hatano-Nelson model, or equivalently, the non-Hermitian spin-1/2 XXZ model. We use a renormalization group method suited for disordered systems and show that non-Hermitian couplings are relevant perturbations to the Hermitian model, which ultimately leads to a quantum-to-classical crossover. The ground state of the model consists of a collection of strongly coupled pairs of spins of arbitrary size at random positions which, unlike the Hermitian case, do not form singlets, but a mixture of the singlet and the $M=0$ triplet state. As a result, the magnetic susceptibility in the $x,y$-directions becomes negative and diverges at a finite small temperature. Additionally, in sharp contrast to the $\ln(L)$ increase observed in disordered Hermitian chains, the entanglement entropy of a partition of size $L$ saturates for large $L$, as the strongly coupled pairs become classical and stop contributing at large length scales.</description>

      <title>Fractional topological insulators at odd-integer filling: Phase diagram of two-valley quantum Hall model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall effect has recently been shown to exist in heterostructures of van der Waals materials without an externally applied magnetic field, e.g. in twisted bilayers of MoTe$_2$. These fractional Chern insulators break time-reversal symmetry spontaneously through polarization of the electron spins in a quantum spin Hall insulator band structure with flat bands. This prompts the question, which states could be realized if the spins remain unpolarized or polarize partially. Specifically, the possibility of time-reversal symmetric topological order arises. Here, we study this problem for odd integer filling of the bands, specifically focusing on vanishing and half valley polarization. Short of reliable microscopic models for small twist angles around $2.1^\circ$, we study the idealized situation of two Landau levels with opposite chirality, the two-valley quantum Hall model. Using exact diagonalization, we identify different phases arising in this model by tuning the interaction. In the physically relevant regime, the system initially exhibits phase-separated or valley-polarized states, which eventually transition into paired states by reducing onsite Coulomb repulsion.</description>

      <title>Joint commensuration in moir\'e charge-order superlattices drives shear topological defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of two-dimensional moir\'e systems has revolutionized the exploration of phenomena arising from strong correlations and nontrivial band topology. Recently, a moir\'e superstructure formed by two coexisting charge density wave (CDW) orders with slightly mismatched wavevectors has been realized. These incommensurate CDWs can collectively exhibit commensurability, resulting in the jointly commensurate CDW (JC-CDW). This JC-CDW hosts phenomena including electronic anisotropy and phase-modulated hysteresis, and holds promise for non-volatile optoelectronic memory devices. Realizing such functionality requires understanding how the spatial periodicity, coherence, and amplitude of this order evolve under perturbations. Here, we address these questions using time- and momentum-resolved techniques to probe light-induced dynamics in EuTe$_4$. Our time-resolved diffraction results show that under intense photoexcitation, the JC-CDW wavevector and coherence length remain locked along the CDW direction, indicating preserved moir\'e periodicity while the moir\'e potential depth is suppressed. This robustness governs the configuration of the photoexcited JC-CDW and leads to the formation of previously underexplored shear-type topological defects. Furthermore, we developed an approach to simultaneously track the temporal evolution of the amplitude and phase of a CDW by following two diffraction peaks corresponding to one order, with findings verified by time-resolved photoemission and electron diffraction. This methodology enables reconstruction of the momentum- and time-resolved evolution of the JC-CDW and direct visualization of shear-type topological defect formation. These findings not only highlight the unique robustness of JC-CDWs out of equilibrium, but also establish a platform for optical moir\'e engineering and manipulation of quantum materials through topological defect control.</description>

      <title>Positive magnetoconductance in SrVO3 double quantum wells with a magnetic EuTiO3 barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling Mott insulator states has been a long-standing topic in condensed matter physics. Among various controlling parameters, two-dimensional (2D) confinement in epitaxial heterostructures has been demonstrated to convert the correlated metallic nature of SrVO3 into a Mott insulator by reducing the quantum well thickness. Here, we fabricate double quantum well (DQW) structures of SrVO3 with a magnetic barrier of EuTiO3 to tune the hybridization of wave functions by a magnetic field. A significant positive magnetoconductance is observed for DQWs with barriers thinner than 2 nm, while DQWs with thicker barriers do not show such large positive magnetoconductance, instead behaving as a parallel circuit of two single QWs. The observed positive magnetoconductance is accounted in terms of enhanced hybridization of V 3d orbitals across the EuTiO3 barrier under a magnetic field, where the barrier height is reduced by the Zeeman splitting of Ti 3d bands in forced ferromagnetic ordering of localized 4f electrons on Eu2+sites.</description>

      <title>Much ado about MOFs: Metal-Organic-Frameworks as Quantum Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a highly tunable class of crystalline materials where metal atoms or clusters are connected by organic linkers. They offer a versatile platform for exploring quantum phenomena such as entangled magnetism, superconductivity, and topology. Particularly for magnetism, their modular chemistry enables extensive control over magnetic interactions, spin magnitudes, lattice geometries, and even light-responsiveness, making them a uniquely adaptable platform. However, despite their promise, their low-temperature behavior and magnetic properties remain largely unexplored and represent an underappreciated opportunity in quantum materials research. With potential applications ranging from quantum computation to energy transfer, we believe that MOFs and particularly {\it magnetic} MOFs offer a vast and largely untapped frontier for transformative discoveries and high-impact quantum materials research.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Frustration in CuYbSe$_2$: an Yb-Based Triangular Lattice Selenide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Yb based triangular lattice delafossites $A$Yb$X_2$ ($A$ = alkali metal, $X$ = O, S, Se) have recently been studied as quantum spin liquid candidates. We report the synthesis of powders and single crystals of CuYbSe$_2$ with a perfect triangular lattice of Yb$^{3+}$ moments. Magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements reveal no evidence of long-range magnetic ordering down to $1.8$~K in spite of a significant antiferromagnetic exchange between Yb$^{3+}$ moments, suggesting a frustrated magnetic system. Electrical resistivity measurements indicate insulating behavior, consistent with the localized nature of magnetic moments. Heat capacity reveals that CuYbSe$_2$ can be treated as an effective spin $S = 1/2$ triangular lattice antiferromagnet below $\sim 50$~K. Magnetic susceptibility measurements on single crystals reveals weak magnetic anisotropy. These properties position CuYbSe$_2$ as a promising candidate for a quantum spin liquid state and as a new platform for exploring exotic magnetic ground states in triangular lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Third-order quantum phase transitions of bosonic non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study phase transitions in bilayer and trilayer bosonic quantum Hall systems. In the absence of interlayer tunneling and interaction, each layer is chosen to have filling factor $\nu=1/2$ or $1$ to realize the Laughlin state or the Moore-Read state. By tuning interlayer tunneling and/or interaction, multiple phases can be generated. In the absence of interlayer interaction, three phase transitions appear when interlayer tunneling becomes sufficiently strong: (1) from two decoupled $\nu=1/2$ Laughlin states to the Moore-Read state in bilayer systems; (2) from one $\nu=1/2$ Laughlin state plus one $\nu=1$ Moore-Read state to the Read-Rezayi $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ state in bilayer systems; (3) from three decoupled $\nu=1/2$ Laughlin states to the Read-Rezayi $\mathbb{Z}_{3}$ state in trilayer systems. Numerical calculations suggest that these transitions are third-order ones. We propose non-Abelian Chern-Simons-Higgs theory to describe them. If both interlayer tunneling and interaction are present, one-component or multi-component composite fermion liquids and Jain states can be realized. This leads to intricate phase diagrams that host multiple phase transitions and possibly exotic critical points.</description>

      <title>Universal Scaling Functions of the Gr{\"u}neisen Ratio near Quantum Critical Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gr\"uneisen ratio, defined as $\Gamma_g \equiv (1/T) (\partial T/\partial g)_S$, serves as a highly sensitive probe for detecting quantum critical points (QCPs) driven by an external feild $g$ and for characterizing the magnetocaloric effect (MCE). Near a QCP, the Gr\"uneisen ratio displays a universal divergence which is governed by a universality-class-dependent scaling function stemming from the scale invariance. In this work, we systematically investigate the universal scaling functions of Gr\"uneisen ratio in both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) quantum spin systems, including the transverse-field Ising model, the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model, the quantum $q$-state Potts model ($q=3,4$) and the $J_1$-$J_2$ columnar dimer model. Our approach employs the thermal tensor-network method for infinite-size 1D systems and the stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE QMC) simulations for 2D systems, enabling precise calculations of the Gr\"uneisen ratio near QCPs. Through data collapse analysis, we extract the corresponding scaling functions, which establish quantitative frameworks to interpret magnetocaloric experiments and guide the development of ultralow-temperature refrigeration.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of $\mathrm{CP}^{N-1}$ skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive several exact results for the dynamics of CP$^{N-1}$ skyrmions with arbitrary $N$. Fractonic continuity equation is shown to hold for arbitrary CP$^{N-1}$ fluid implying the conservation of the topological charge and the dipole moment. Inclusion of the Gilbert damping modifies the continuity equation, resulting in the violation of the dipole moment conservation but not of the topological charge. Thiele's equation for the CP$^{N-1}$ skyrmion follows from the modified continuity equation. The Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) algebra in the long-wavelength limit is derived for arbitrary CP$^{N-1}$ fluid. In the case of CP$^2$ skyrmions, we identify two kinds of energetically stable skyrmions in which the quadrupolar moments or the ferromagnetic moments are dominant. In the latter case, one can associate a nonzero CP$^1$ charge equal to half the CP$^2$ skyrmion charge and argue that the topological Hall effect of electrons should exist due to their coupling to the ferromagnetic part of the CP$^2$ texture.</description>

      <title>Topical review: the nature of the ground state and possibility of a quantum spin liquid in 1T metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compounds 1T-TaX2 (X = S, Se) and 1T-NbSe2 have been considered as potential hosts of a quantum spin liquid phase. This is based on the widely held view that the Mott-Hubbard mechanism drives the insulating behaviour of its charge density wave ground state, resulting in localized spins, interacting antiferromagnetically, on a geometrically frustrated lattice. However this assumes layer-wise independent behaviour. A growing body of evidence shows not only that inter-layer interactions are very significant in 1T-TaS2, but also that they mediate some of its most interesting functional properties. Here we offer a perspective from the point of view of scanning tunnelling microscopy that helps to visualize the microscopic degrees of freedom of inter-layer interactions in bulk 1T-TaS2, and the associated impact on the local density-of-states, including the occurrence of multiple distinct insulating phases. We consider to what extent the bulk of 1T-TaS2, and its surface terminations can be considered as Mott insulating and whether, or where, quantum spin liquid behaviour might persist. To better understand the bulk behaviour we also draw insights from measurements on isolated monolayers of 1T-TaX2 and 1T-NbSe2, where the confounding complications of inter-layer interactions are absent. We highlight some outstanding questions raised by a comprehensive evaluation of the experimental results, and finally suggest future experiments that could address them.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the dynamics of the light-induced phase transition in VO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) is central in the study of ultrafast photoinduced insulator-to-metal phase transitions in strongly correlated materials, and a primary candidate for next-generation light-driven devices. However, the physical mechanism underlying its phase transition remains unresolved. Here, we use single-cycle light transients to perform phase-resolved ultrafast spectroscopy on VO$_2$ crystals. Our experiments reveal two processes: a structural transformation from the insulating monoclinic M1-VO$_2$ phase to the excited metallic rutile R*-VO$_2$ phase, followed by electron thermalization and relaxation dynamics intrinsic to the newly formed excited metallic phase.</description>

      <title>Emergent Composite Particles from the Universal Exact Identities in Quantum Many-Body Systems with Generic Bilinear Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental challenge in quantum many-body physics is to understand the universal properties of strongly correlated systems. In this work, we establish a universal and exact identity from the Dyson-Schwinger equations within the Keldysh-Schwinger field theory for systems with generic bilinear interactions. Our derivation demonstrates the emergence of composite particles as "elementary excitations", whose Green's functions definitively determine the original single-particle Green's function. This universal relation uniquely identifies the composite particles governing correlations and rigorously connects their spectra to the observable single-particle spectrum. Thus, our exact identity reveals a new pathway toward a paradigm for understanding many-body correlated systems.</description>

      <title>The promise of high-resolution valence band RIXS at the actinide M$_{4,5}$-edges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the electronic structure of actinide materials is crucial for both fundamental research and nuclear applications. The partially filled 5f shells exhibit complex behavior due to strong correlations and ligand hybridization, requiring advanced spectroscopic techniques. Here, we report on the development and application of high-resolution valence-band resonant inelastic x-ray spectroscopy (VB-RIXS) experiments at the uranium M$_{4,5}$ edges (3551 and 3725\,eV). We present data of UO$_2$, a well-established model actinide compound. VB-RIXS is particularly well suited for probing the 5f-shell electronic structure, as it probes, in contrast to core-to-core RIXS, excitations without leaving a high-energy core hole in the final state. In VB-RIXS, we achieve energy resolutions of 50\,meV (M$_5$) and 90\,meV (M$_4$), enabling the resolution of multiplet excitations and crystal-field effects, as well as charge-transfer and fluorescence-like features with unprecedented clarity. As such, high resolution VB-RIXS offers direct insights into both low-energy, near ground-state properties and high-energy hybridization and covalency effects. Our results demonstrate the power of VB-RIXS as a versatile and powerful tool for probing the strongly correlated electronic structure of actinide materials, providing essential input for quantitative modeling and the validation of theoretical concepts.</description>

      <title>Optimal local basis truncation of lattice quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to optimally reduce the local Hilbert basis of lattice quantum many-body (QMB) Hamiltonians. The basis truncation exploits the most relevant eigenvalues of the estimated single-site reduced density matrix (RDM). It is accurate and numerically stable across different model phases, even close to quantum phase transitions. We apply this procedure to different models, such as the Sine-Gordon model, the $\varphi^{4}$ theory, and lattice gauge theories, namely Abelian $\mathrm{U}(1)$ and non-Abelian $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, in one and two spatial dimensions. Our results reduce state-of-the-art estimates of computational resources for classical and quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Asymmetry for Higher and Noninvertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is an observable in quantum systems, constructed using quantum-information methods, suited to detecting symmetry breaking in states -- possibly out of equilibrium -- relative to a subsystem. In this paper we define the asymmetry for generalized finite symmetries, including higher-form and noninvertible ones. To this end, we introduce a "symmetrizer" of (reduced) density matrices with respect to the $C^*$-algebra of symmetry operators acting on the subsystem Hilbert space. We study in detail applications to (1+1)-dimensional theories: First, we analyze spontaneous symmetry breaking of noninvertible symmetries, confirming that distinct vacua can exhibit different physical properties. Second, we compute the asymmetry of certain excited states in conformal field theories (including the Ising CFT), when the subsystem is either the full circle or an interval therein. The relevant symmetry algebras to consider are the fusion, tube, and strip algebras. Finally, we comment on the case that the symmetry algebra is a (weak) Hopf algebra.</description>

      <title>Berry Trashcan With Short Range Attraction:Exact $p_x+i p_y$ Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the presence of analytic $p_x + i p_y$ superconducting ground states in the Berry Trashcan -- a minimal model of rhombohedral graphene valid for $n \ge 4$ layers -- under short-range attractive interactions. We demonstrate that the model, whose dispersion consists of a flat bottom surrounded by steep walls of prohibitive kinetic energy, serves as a building block to understand superconductivity in the moir\'e-free limit. We find that the ground-state chirality has a ``ferromagnetic'' coupling to that of the uniform Berry curvature of the model, and compare the analytically obtained binding energies, excitation spectra and off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) with numerical exact diagonalization results. We show that the analytic structure of this model is that of a restricted spectrum generating algebra (RSGA), initially developed for quantum scars, and build a variety of other exact (but contrived) models with exact chiral superconductivity based on a method developed in Ref.[1]. However, under short range attraction, we show that the Berry Trashcan is the optimal and only realistic point in the class of GMP-like algebras to host a chiral superconductor state. A toy model in 1D and its related physics is also investigated. Our results reveal that chiral superconductivity is natural under attractive interactions in the Berry trashcan model of rhombohedral graphene in displacement field, although we make no claim about the origin of the attraction.</description>

      <title>Observation of mirror-odd and mirror-even spin texture in ultra-thin epitaxially-strained RuO2 films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, rutile RuO$_2$ has attracted renewed interest due to expectations of prominent altermagnetic spin-splitting. However, accumulating experimental evidence suggests that in its bulk and thick-film forms, RuO$_2$ does not display any form of magnetic ordering. Despite this, the spin structure of RuO$_2$ remains largely unexplored in the ultra-thin limit, where substrate-imposed epitaxial strain can be substantial. Here, we employ spin-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, supported by ab-initio calculations, to reveal the electronic structure of 2.7~nm-thick epitaxial RuO$_2$ heterostructures. We observe an unconventional spin texture characterized by the coexistence of mirror-even and mirror-odd momentum-dependent components. A comprehensive symmetry analysis rules out nonmagnetic origins of this spin texture. These findings suggest an emergent non-relativistic spin structure enabled by epitaxial strain in the ultra-thin limit, marking a distinct departure from the behavior of relaxed or bulk RuO$_2$. Our work opens new perspectives for exploring symmetry-breaking mechanisms and spin textures in oxide heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable chiral spin mode in WSe2/WS2 moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between many-body and spin-orbit effects (SOC) can lead to novel phenomena in solids. Chiral spin modes (CSM) are collective spin excitations that arise from such interplay and connect states with opposite chirality, which, however, have been rarely observed. Here, we report a gate-tunable CSM that occurs between conduction SOC-split minibands in near-0{\deg}-twisted WSe2/WS2 bilayers. This mode manifests as a sharp resonance with giant Raman efficiency in the pseudovector-symmetry channel of the Raman spectra. By varying fillings, the CSM transitions from chiral spin exciton to excitonic polaron. The spin-flip nature is directly confirmed by the Zeeman effect. Moreover, the filling dependence compellingly evidences a charge-transfer insulator at filling of one. Our results demonstrate transition-metal-dichalcogenides moir\'e superlattices as a fertile platform for exploring exotic low-lying collective excitations.</description>

      <title>Error stabilized logical qubits in qudit generalizations of the monitored Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitored dynamics in quantum circuits provide tunable platforms for the realization of novel non-equilibrium phases. Motivated by recent advances in monitored Kitaev circuits, we investigate the monitored dynamics of the qudit ($d=4$) generalizations of the Kitaev model on the honeycomb and square lattices. In the absence of additional perturbations, the measurement-only dynamics of these models map onto multi-flavor loop models and display either critical or area-law entanglement scaling. Magnetic field terms couple different flavors and when measured with sufficiently large probability, they enhance the stability of the area-law phase that hosts the logical qubits. In a circuit picture, these terms correspond to single-qubit measurements and can be interpreted as errors. We also examine the impact of two-qubit measurements that commute with the plaquette operator, which induce effective non-quadratic interactions between Majorana fermions. These interactions can drive a transition to a volume-law-entangled phase and, for sufficiently strong coupling, stabilize a distinct area-law phase with an additional logical qubit for the square lattice model. Our results reveal a rich interplay between quantum spin liquids and monitored circuit dynamics, highlighting new mechanisms for engineering and controlling entanglement phases in multi-flavor Majorana systems.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality effect on exceptional fermionic superfluidity with spin-dependent asymmetric hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems host exceptional points (EPs), where eigenstates and eigenvalues coalesce, leading to unconventional many-body phenomena absent in Hermitian systems. While NH fermionic systems with complex interactions exhibit superfluid (SF) breakdown with EPs, spin-dependent asymmetric hopping can stabilize a NH superfluid (NH-SF) that coexists with EPs. In this work, we investigate the quasi-one-dimensional NH attractive Fermi-Hubbard model by using NH BCS theory. We demonstrate that, when the system is regarded as weakly-coupled chains, the exceptional SF phase becomes unstable and metastable (exceptional) SF state appears between the stable SF and normal states. In the one-dimensional limit, the exceptional SF disappear entirely and EPs only appear on the phase boundary between the normal and SF states. These results reveal how dimensional crossover governs the stability of the exceptional SF, providing the insights into the interplay between dimensionality and dissipation, with potential relevance for experimental implications in ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy and its Transition in the Coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement and quantum magic are two distinct fundamental resources that enable quantum systems to exhibit complex phenomena beyond the capabilities of classical computer simulations. While quantum entanglement has been extensively used to characterize both equilibrium and dynamical phases, the study of quantum magic, typically quantified by the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE), remains largely limited to numerical simulations of moderate system sizes. In this Letter, we establish a general framework for analyzing the SRE in solvable Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models in the large-$N$ limit, which enables the application of the saddle-point approximation. Applying this method to the Maldacena-Qi coupled SYK model, we identify a series of first-order transitions of the SRE as the temperature is tuned. In particular, we uncover an intrinsic transition of the SRE that cannot be detected through thermodynamic quantities. We also discuss the theoretical understanding of the SRE in both the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. Our results pave the way for studying the SRE in strongly correlated fermionic systems in the thermodynamic limit and suggest a new class of transitions for which the SRE serves as an order parameter.</description>

      <title>Design, synthesis, and physical properties of the intergrowth compound Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rational combination of existing magnetic topological compounds presents a promising route for designing new topological materials. We report the synthesis and comprehensive characterization of the layered quaternary intergrowth compound Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$, which combines structural units of two known magnetic topological materials, EuCuAs and EuZn$_2$As$_2$. Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$ exhibits an antiferromagnetic ground state with successive magnetic transitions: quasi-two-dimensional ordering at $T_\mathrm{M} = 29.3$\,K, long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_\mathrm{N} = 19$\,K, and spin-reorientation at $T_\mathrm{SR} = 16.3$\,K. The stepwise magnetic transitions manifest as plateau-like anomalies in the heat capacity. These transitions originate from multiple superexchange pathways and periodic variation of interplane Eu-Eu distances in the intergrowth structure. Charge transport shows a pronounced resistivity increase above $T_\mathrm{N}$ followed by minimal change below the ordering temperature. Magnetic fields rapidly suppress this resistivity rise, yielding significant negative magnetoresistance. Remarkably, Eu$_2$CuZn$_2$As$_3$ inherits the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect characteristic of its parent compounds. Energy evaluations of collinear spin configurations reveal a lowest-energy state with ferromagnetic coupling between Eu planes in EuCuAs units while maintaining antiferromagnetic coupling within EuZn$_2$As$_2$ units. The corresponding electronic structure displays potentially topologically nontrivial features. Our work demonstrates the efficacy of structural hybridization for discovering novel magnetic topological materials and establishes a general strategy for materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Breaking of Time-Reversal Symmetry and Onsager Reciprocity in Chiral Molecule Interfacd with an Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular closed shell structures are known to form spin-singlet configurations, resulting from the spin-exchange associated with electron-electron interactions. While the vanishing total spin-moment is an immanent property of the spin-singlet, the vanishing local moments is a result of fluctuations between degenerate spin-configurations. Here, it is demonstrated that the spin-configuration of a chiral molecule is enantiospecifically locked when coupled to an electron reservoir. The coupling opens up the molecular closed shell structure, which broadens the energy levels. Together with the molecular spin-orbit coupling, this dissipative coupling generates an effective spin-splitting of the molecular energy levels and facilitates stabilization of a chirality determined spin-configuration. Simultaneously, the charge molecular charge distribution is shown to depend linearly on the magnetization of the reservoir such that no linear response regime is established with respect to the external magnetization. Accordingly, the Onsager reciprocity theorem does not apply to a chiral molecule attached to a reservoir, hence, providing a theoretical foundation for the chirality induced spin selectivity effect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we undertake the problem of formally introducing a notion of quantum many-body scarring in open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad equation. To this goal, we rely on the commutant-algebra framework for the description of strong symmetries to introduce the unconventional strong-symmetry structure leading to the existence of anomalous stationary states, which we dub open-system quantum many-body scars (OSQMBS), besides a typical infinite-temperature state. We provide several benchmarks of the theoretical predictions on the stationary-state manifold and on convergence to stationarity, as well as describe the time-evolution of off-diagonal coherences among the Hilbert space symmetry sectors identified by OSQMBS and their orthogonal complement. Moreover, we investigate the existence of asymptotic OSQMBS (AOSQMBS), the latter being states that, despite converging to the typical infinite-temperature state in the large-time limit, display anomalously-large relaxation time scales, which we thoroughly describe by means of the behavior of their fidelity as a function of time through proper scaling Ansaetze.</description>

      <title>Tuning Magnetic and Electronic Properties of Double Perovskite La$_2$CoIr$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$O$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The La$_2$CoIr$_{1-x}$Ti$_x$O$_6$ double perovskite series serves as an effective platform for investigating the evolution of magnetic and electronic properties as a function of chemical pressure (doping) or hydrostatic pressure due to the interplay between the electrons correlation and spin-orbit coupling. In this study, the substitution of nonmagnetic Ti$^{4+}$ at the magnetic Ir$^{4+}$-site leads to a systematic decrease in unit cell volume keeping the monoclinic symmetry throughout, reflecting the effect of chemical pressure along with a gradual suppression of magnetic interactions. The parent compound ($x =$ 0) exhibits a ferromagnetic-like state with a Curie temperature of 92 K, which continuously evolves into an antiferromagnetic ground state upon full Ti substitution ($x =$ 1) with a Neel temperature of 14.6 K. Isothermal magnetization measurements reveal a hysteresis behavior with step-like feature at zero field, indicative of a noncollinear magnetic ordering. Additionally, the enhancement of magnetization under hydrostatic pressure on La$_2$CoIrO$_6$ suggests the presence of piezomagnetic behavior. Thermal expansion measurements on La$_2$CoIrO$_6$ highlight a coupling between spin and lattice degrees of freedom. The pressure dependence of the transition temperature in the zero-pressure limit, calculated using Ehrenfest's relation, shows good agreement with magnetization data under applied pressure.First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations preformed for $x =$ 0, 0.5 and 1, further reveal that strong SOC associated with Ir plays a decisive role in shaping the electronic band structure, with the insulating gap progressively widening as Ti content increases from 0.28 eV ($x =$ 0), 0.44 eV ($x =$ 0.5), and 1.01 eV ($x =$ 1). The magnetic moment decreased more than 50\% for $x =$ 0.5, showing the decrease in magnetic exchange pathways.</description>

      <title>The Many Faces of Non-invertible Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between algebraic and categorical notions of non-invertible symmetries. In particular, a fusion categorical symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ is shown to induce an algebraic symmetry encoded in a weak Hopf algebra $H$ which is Tannaka-Krein dual to $\mathcal{C}$ in the sense that $\mathcal{C} = \text{Rep}(H^*)$. The latter duality is not unique, and consequently the algebraic symmetry acts on an extended system relative to the categorical one. We present an approach to analyzing the symmetry breaking patterns of weak Hopf algebraic non-invertible symmetries. The central ingredient is a certain conditional expectation, which serves as the analog of a group averaging map for a non-invertible symmetry. The index of this conditional expectation emerges as a quantum information theoretic quantity that determines the extent to which the underlying symmetry can be broken. Ambiguities which ensue from the non-uniqueness of the categorical reconstruction lead to distinct properties of symmetry breaking compared to the invertible case. Finally, we exemplify our approach through topological and conformal quantum field theories in which non-invertible symmetries are naturally interpreted as defect operators and boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Thermal field theory correlators in the large-$N$ limit and the spectral duality relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Ref.~\cite{Grozdanov:2024wgo}, we derived a spectral duality relation applicable to the spectra of 3$d$ conformal field theories (CFTs) and their holographically dual 4$d$ black holes. In this work, we further elaborate on the properties of this duality relation and argue that the same relation can be applied to certain pairs of thermal correlator spectra in large-$N$ quantum field theories in any number of spacetime dimensions, provided the correlators are meromorphic functions with only simple poles and satisfy the thermal product formula. We discuss a rich set of properties that such retarded two-point functions must exhibit. We then show that the spectral duality relation and its implications apply to pairs of correlators in double-trace deformed CFTs and, more generally, to correlators in theories related by the Legendre transform. We illustrate, through several examples, how the spectrum of one correlator can be reconstructed from that of its dual correlation function. Notably, this includes cases relating the thermal spectra of scalar primary operators at ultraviolet and infrared fixed points, as well as current operators in a CFT$_3$ and its particle-vortex dual.</description>

Abstract: Understanding doped Mott insulators is a fundamental goal in condensed matter physics, with relevance to cuprate superconductors and other quantum materials. The doped Hubbard model minimally describes such systems, and has explicated some of their complex behavior. However, many open questions remain concerning the anomalous metallic states which emerge at low temperatures and intermediate doping and which, in cuprates, give rise to high-temperature superconductivity upon cooling. Here we observe a crossover between a normal metal and a pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model by performing thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements in a cold atom quantum simulator, leveraging a recent several-fold reduction in experimentally achievable temperatures. Measurements of the compressibility show a maximum versus doping that develops upon cooling, signaling an inflection point in the equation of state. We track this maximum versus interaction strength, revealing a line of thermodynamic anomalies in the phase diagram that separates an underdoped from an overdoped metal at large interactions. Lattice modulation spectroscopy shows a loss of spectral weight at low energies in the underdoped regime which is non-uniform in the Brillouin zone, indicating the formation of a pseudogap. We use this signal to establish a pseudogap phase diagram as a function of interactions and doping. Our results experimentally demonstrate the existence of a pseudogapped metal in the Hubbard model, partially characterize the pseudogap regime, and suggest a link between the pseudogap and charge order which can be probed in future work. Furthermore, this work demonstrates the utility of quantum simulation in addressing frontier problems in correlated electron physics.</description>

      <title>The influence of phonon symmetry and electronic structure on the electron-phonon coupling momentum dependence in cuprates</title>

Abstract: The experimental determination of the magnitude and momentum dependence of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is an outstanding problem in condensed matter physics. The intensity of phonon peaks in Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) spectra can be related to the underlying EPC strength under significant approximations whose validity deserves careful verification. We measured the Cu L$_3$ RIXS phonon intensity as function of incident photon energy and of momentum transfer in several layered cuprates. For CaCuO$_2$, La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_{4+\delta}$, and \ch{YBa_2Cu_3O_{6}}, using a generally accepted theoretical model, we estimate quantitatively the EPC for the bond-stretching mode along the high-symmetry directions ($\zeta$,0) and ($\zeta$,$\zeta$), and as a function of the azimuthal angle $\varphi$ at fixed $q_\parallel$. We compare our results with theoretical predictions and we find that the $\mathbf{q}_\parallel$-dependence of the phonon RIXS intensity can be largely ascribed to the phonon symmetry. However, a more satisfactory prediction of the experimental results requires an accurate description of the electronic structure close to the Fermi level. Our extensive investigation indicates that Cu L$_3$ RIXS can be reliably used to determine the momentum dependence of EPC for the bond-stretching modes of cuprates. Moreover, the large experimental basis provided in this article can serve as stringent test for advanced theoretical predictions on the EPC.</description>

      <title>Emergent quasi-particles of spin-1 trimer chain</title>

Abstract: The recent experimental realization of emergent quasi-particles, such as spinons, doublons, and quartons, in a spin-$1/2$ trimer chain has spurred new interest in low dimensional magnetic systems. In this study, we investigate the dynamical properties of the isotropic spin-$1$ trimer chain with intra and inter-trimer antiferromagnetic exchange couplings, ($J &gt;0$ and $J' &gt;0$), respectively, unveiling various quasi-particles: magnons, singletons, triplons, pentons, and heptons. For weak inter-trimer exchange coupling $J'/J \ll 1$, it behaves as an effective spin-$1$ chain with valence bond solid (VBS) ground state. Employing density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) techniques, we compute the dynamic structure factor (DSF) which reveals a gapped magnon band alongside weakly dispersive singleton, excited triplon, and penton excitations. The evolution of these excitations with inter-trimer coupling $J'$ is also examined, providing insight into the underlying excitation mechanisms. For spin-$1$ chain, these exotic quasi-particles eventually reduce to conventional magnon excitations as $J'/J \rightarrow 1$. Our results shed light on the rich and complex excitation spectrum of spin-$1$ trimer chains and offer unique perspectives on the dynamics in quantum spin systems.</description>

      <title>Universality of the topological phase transition in the interacting Haldane model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Haldane model is a standard tight-binding model describing electrons hopping on a hexagonal lattice subject to a transverse, dipolar magnetic field. We consider its interacting version for values of the interaction strength that are small compared to the bandwidth. We study the critical case at the transition between the trivial and the `topological' insulating phases, and we rigorously establish that the transverse conductivity on the dressed critical line is quantized at a half-integer multiple of $e^2/h$: this is the average of the integer values of the Hall conductivity in the insulating phases on either side of the dressed critical line. Together with previous results, this fully characterizes the nature of the phase transition between different Hall plateaus and proves its universality with respect to many-body interactions. The proof is based on a combination of constructive renormalization group methods and exact lattice Ward identities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In strong magnetic fields beyond 100 T, the significant Zeeman energy competes with the lattice interactions, where a considerable magnetostriction is expected. However, the microscopic observation of the magnetostriction above 100 T has been hindered due to the short pulse duration of $\mu$-seconds and the coil's destruction. Here, we report the observation of the giant and anisotropic magnetostriction of $\sim 1$ % at 110 T in the spin-controlled crystal, $\beta$-O$_{2}$, by combining the single-shot diffraction of x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) and the newly developed portable 100 T generator (PINK-02). The very soft and anisotropic response of $\beta$-O$_{2}$ should originate in the competing van der Waals force and exchange interaction, and also the frustration of spin and lattice on the triangular network. The XFEL experiment above 100 T using PINK-02 enables microscopic investigations on materials' properties at high magnetic fields, providing insights into how spins contribute to the stability of crystal structures.</description>

      <title>Universal non-equilibrium dynamics of pure states and density-dependent thermalization in Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics of unentangled and entangled pure states in interacting quantum systems is crucial for harnessing quantum information and to understand quantum thermalization. We develop a general Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) field theory for non-equilibrium dynamics of pure states of fermions. We apply our formalism to study the time evolution of initial density inhomogeneity and multi-point correlations of pure states in the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. We demonstrate a remarkable universality in the dynamics of pure states in the SYK model. We show that dynamics of almost all pure states in a fixed particle number sector is solely determined by a set of universal large-$N$ Kadanoff-Baym equations. Moreover, irrespective of the initial state the site- and disorder-averaged Green's function thermalizes instantaneously, whereas local and non-local Green's functions have finite thermalization rate. We provide understanding of our numerical and analytical large-$N$ results through random-matrix theory (RMT) analysis. Furthermore, we show that the thermalization of an initial pure product state in the non-interacting SYK$_2$ model is independent of fermion filling and an initial density inhomogeneity decays with weak but long lived oscillations due to dephasing. In contrast, the interacting SYK$_{q\geq 4}$ model thermalizes slower than the non-interacting model and exhibits filling-dependent monotonic relaxation of initial inhomogeneity. For evolution of entangled pure states, we show that the initial entanglement is encoded in the non-local and/or multi-point quantum correlations that relax as the system thermalizes.</description>

      <title>Pair binding and Hund's rule breaking in high-symmetry fullerenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21455v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Highly-symmetric molecules often exhibit degenerate tight-binding states at the Fermi edge. This typically results in a magnetic ground state if small interactions are introduced in accordance with Hund's rule. In some cases, Hund's rule may be broken, which signals pair binding and goes hand-in-hand with an attractive pair-binding energy. We investigate pair binding and Hund's rule breaking for the Hubbard model on high-symmetry fullerenes C$_{20}$, C$_{28}$, C$_{40}$, and C$_{60}$ by using large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations. We exploit the SU(2) spin symmetry, the U(1) charge symmetry, and optionally the Z(N) spatial rotation symmetry of the problem. For C$_{20}$, our results agree well with available exact-diagonalization data, but our approach is numerically much cheaper. We find a Mott transition at $U_c\sim2.2t$, which is much smaller than the previously reported value of $U_c\sim4.1t$ that was extrapolated from a few datapoints. We compute the pair-binding energy for arbitrary values of $U$ and observe that it remains overall repulsive. For larger fullerenes, we are not able to evaluate the pair binding energy with sufficient precision, but we can still investigate Hund's rule breaking. For C$_{28}$, we find that Hund's rule is fulfilled with a magnetic spin-2 ground state that transitions to a spin-1 state at $U_{c,1}\sim5.4t$ before the eventual Mott transition to a spin singlet takes place at $U_{c,2}\sim 11.6t$. For C$_{40}$, Hund's rule is broken in the singlet ground state, but is restored if the system is doped with one electron. Hund's rule is also broken for C$_{60}$, and the doping with two or three electrons results in a minimum-spin state. Our results support an electronic mechanism of superconductivity for C$_{60}$ lattices. We speculate that the high geometric frustration of small fullerenes is detrimental to pair binding.</description>

      <title>Thermal SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the cuprate pseudogap: reconciling Fermi arcs and hole pockets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05336v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cuprate pseudogap phase displays Fermi arc spectral weight in photoemission, while recent magnetotransport observations yield evidence for the existence of hole pockets of fractional area $p/8$, where $p$ is the doping density. We reconcile these observations by a Monte Carlo study of a SU(2) lattice gauge theory of the background spin liquid of a fractionalized Fermi liquid of hole pockets. At the higher temperatures of the pseudogap, the inevitable finite-doping sign problem can be evaded by including only thermal fluctuations of the SU(2) gauge field and a charge $e$ Higgs boson, while the fermionic critical Dirac spinons and electrons are treated exactly. Our study also describes the onset of $d$-wave superconductivity by expulsion of vortices with flux $h/(2e)$, each with charge-order halos. We predict that quantum oscillations of hole pockets of area $p/8$ should be observable in clean under-hole-doped cuprates in regimes with a positive Hall co-efficient and without charge order, in contrast to existing quantum oscillation observations of electron pockets induced by charge density wave order.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CeRhSn is a valence fluctuating heavy-fermion metal with a twisted Ce-kagome lattice, displaying zero-field quantum criticality, previously associated with geometrical frustration. The partial substitution of Rh by Pd in CeRh$_{1-x}$Pd$_x$Sn enlarges the unit-cell volume, suppresses valence fluctuations, decreases the Kondo temperature and stabilizes a possible long-range antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordered ground state with $T_N=0.8$ K at $x=0.5$. Previous thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements for $x=0.1$ suggested a quantum critical spin liquid. We report low-temperature dilatometry and magnetization measurements on CeRh$_{0.9}$Pd$_{0.1}$Sn and compare with published low-$T$ specific heat data. The absence of a Gr\"uneisen parameter divergence excludes a conventional quantum criticality scenario. Instead, the weak power-law divergences signal non-Fermi liquid (NFL) behavior, according to a disorder-driven quantum Griffiths phase scenario. At low temperatures, a negative thermal expansion is found in fields above approximately 0.5 T and the NFL scaling breaks down, probably due to the polarization of AFM correlations.</description>

Abstract: Quasiparticle interference imaging (QPI) provides a route to characterize electronic structure from real space images acquired using scanning tunneling microscopy. It emerges due to scattering of electrons at defects in the material. The QPI patterns encode details of the $k$-space electronic structure and its spin and orbital texture. Recovering this information from a measurement of QPI is non-trivial, requiring modelling not only of the dominant scattering vectors, but also the overlap of the wave functions with the tip of the microscope. While, in principle, it is possible to model QPI from density functional theory (DFT) calculations, for many quantum materials it is more desirable to model the QPI from a tight-binding model, where inaccuracies of the DFT calculation can be corrected. Here, we introduce an efficient code to simulate quasiparticle interference from tight-binding models using the continuum Green's function method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological frustration arises when boundary conditions impose geometric frustration in a quantum system, creating delocalized defects in the ground states and profoundly altering the low-energy properties. While previous studies have been concerned with one-dimensional systems, showing that the ground state structure can be described in terms of quasiparticle excitations, the two-dimensional setting remains unexplored. We address this gap by studying a three-legged antiferromagnetic quantum Ising ladder on a torus using tensor network methods, where topological frustration is induced by an odd number of spins along both spatial directions. Our results reveal the first instance in which topological frustration shifts the position of the quantum critical point. By studying the entanglement structure, we find that the ground state can be characterized as hosting three delocalized quasiparticles. This work builds the quasiparticle picture of topological frustration toward higher dimensions and more complex systems than those considered so far.</description>

Abstract: We study the classical dipole-octupole pyrochlore spin systems in an external magnetic field along the $[111]$ direction. We identify an intermediate fragmented spin liquid phase that precedes full spin saturation, characterized by the coexistence of three phenomena: U(1) spin liquid on the Kagome planes, spontaneous $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry breaking, and partial spin polarization from explicit symmetry breaking. We show that even without dipolar interactions, the dipolar components can form a spin liquid driven by the octupolar spin liquid. The physics manifests itself experimentally as shadow pinch points: low-intensity pinch points underlying the strong Bragg peaks. We discuss how these discoveries are directly relevant to various experiments on dipole-octupole pyrochlore materials, including neutron scattering, magnetization, and magnetostriction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-magnon problem in the $k=-\pi/2$ sector of a \emph{finite-size} spin-1/2 chain with ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction $(J_1&gt;0)$ and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction $(J_2&lt;0)$ and anisotropy parameters $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ is solved exactly by combining a set of exact two-magnon Bloch states and a plane-wave ansatz. Two types of two-magnon bound states (BSs), i.e., the NN and NNN exchange BSs, are revealed. We establish a phase diagram in the $J_1/(|J_2|\Delta_2)$-$\Delta_1$ plane where regions supporting different types of BSs are analytically identified. It is found that no BSs exist (the two types of BSs coexist) when both $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$ are small (large) enough. Our results for the isotropic case $\Delta_1=\Delta_2=1$ are consistent with an early work [Ono I, Mikado S and Oguchi T 1971 \emph{J. Phys. Soc. Japan} \textbf{30} 358].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems often exhibit behavior distinct from static systems. In single-particle, static systems, any amount of disorder generically localizes all eigenstates in one dimension. In contrast, we show that in topologically nontrivial, single-particle Floquet loop drives with chiral symmetry in one dimension, a localization-delocalization transition occurs as the time $t$ is varied within the driving period ($0 \le t \le \td$). We find that the time-dependent localization length $\lloc(t)$ diverges with a universal exponent as $t$ approaches the midpoint of the drive: $\lloc(t) \sim (t - \td/2)^{-\nu}$ with $\nu=2$. We provide analytical and numerical evidence for the universality of this exponent within the AIII symmetry class.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{N}=2$ SYK models with dynamical bosons and fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08414v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of SYK models with $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry, described by $N$ fermions in chiral Fermi multiplets, as well as $\alpha N$ first-order bosons in chiral multiplets. The interactions are characterized by two integers $(p,q)$. We focus on the large $N$ and low energy limit of these models. Despite the presence of dynamical bosons, we find conformal behavior akin to the standard SYK model. We use $\mathcal{I}$-extremization of a Witten index to study the supersymmetric solutions. In particular, we find an exact expression for the entropy, which matches the numerical solutions to the Schwinger-Dyson equations. We further solve the model both in the large $p$ and large $p,q$ limits. Numerically, we verify our analytical results and obtain estimates for the Schwarzian coupling in the near zero-temperature limit. We also study the low-lying spectrum of operators to determine the parameter ranges where the Schwarzian mode dominates the IR dynamics. Lastly, we study out-of-time-ordered correlators to show that the model is maximally chaotic.</description>

      <title>Cooper-pair splitters as circuit elements for realizing topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in materials and fabrication of superconducting devices allows the exploration of novel quantum effects in synthetic superconducting systems beyond conventional Josephson junction arrays. As an example, we introduce a new circuit element, the Y-splitter, a superconducting loop with three leads and three Josephson junctions, smaller or comparable in size to the superconducting coherence length of the material. By tuning magnetic flux through an array of Y-splitters, Cooper-pair transport can be made to interfere destructively, while spatially separated split Cooper pairs propagate coherently. We consider an array of Y-splitters connected in a two-dimensional star [Archimedean (3,$12^2$)] geometry, deformable into the kagome lattice, and find a rich phase diagram that includes topological superconducting phases with Chern numbers $\pm 2$. Experimental realization appears feasible.</description>

      <title>Opposite-Mirror-Parity Scattering as the Origin of Superconductivity in Strained Bilayer Nickelates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the electronic structure and doping-dependent instabilities of strained La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films using first-principles and functional renormalization group methods. We demonstrate that ordering tendencies are governed by Fermi surface scattering between electrons of opposite mirror parity. Under moderate hole doping, when the $d_{z^2}$ bonding band becomes incipient or crosses the Fermi level, robust $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductivity emerges from cooperative interlayer pairing reinforced by two competing spin-density-wave fluctuations. Compressive strain favors superconductivity in NiO$_2$ bilayers slightly away from the interface, whereas tensile strain induces pair-breaking nesting that suppresses pairing. Our results establish a unified microscopic scenario for superconductivity in pressurized bulk and strained thin-film nickelates, providing new insights into high-T$_c$ pairing in correlated quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protected topological wire in a topological vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological phases host gapless modes at their boundary with a featureless environment of the same dimension or a trivial vacuum. In this study, we explore their behavior in a higher-dimensional environment, which itself is non-trivial - a topological vacuum. In particular, we embed a one-dimensional topological wire within a two-dimensional Chern insulator, allowing the zero-dimensional edge modes of the wire to interplay with the surrounding chiral boundary states created by the environment. In contrast to a trivial vacuum, we show depending on the nature of low energy modes, the topology of the environment selectively influences the topological phase transitions of the wire. Interestingly, such selectivity leads to scenarios where the environment trivializes the wire and even induces topological character in an otherwise trivial phase - an example of `proximity-induced topology'. Using both numerical and analytical approaches, we establish the general framework of such embedding and uncover the role of symmetries in shaping the fate of low-energy theories. Our findings will provide a deeper understanding of heterostructural topological systems, paving the way for their experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>Condensates, crystals, and renormalons in the Gross-Neveu model at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the $O(2N)$ symmetric Gross-Neveu model at finite density in the presence of a $U(1)$ chemical potential $h$ for a generic number $a \leq N-2$ of fermion fields. By combining perturbative quantum field theory, semiclassical large $N$, and Bethe ansatz techniques, we show that at finite $N$ two new dynamically generated scales $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ appear in the theory, governing the mass gap of neutral and charged fermions, respectively. Above a certain threshold value for $h$, $a$-fermion bound states condense and form an inhomogeneous configuration, which at infinite $N$ is a crystal spontaneously breaking translations. At large $h$, this crystal has mean $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and spatial oscillations of amplitude $2\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$. The two scales also control the nonperturbative corrections to the free energy, resolving a puzzle concerning fractional-power renormalons and predicting new ones.</description>

      <title>Walking on Archimedean Lattices: Insights from Bloch Band Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Returning walks on a lattice are sequences of moves that start at a given lattice site and return to the same site after $n$ steps. Determining the total number of returning walks of a given length $n$ is a typical graph-theoretical problem with connections to lattice models in statistical and condensed matter physics. We derive analytical expressions for the returning walk numbers on the eleven two-dimensional Archimedean lattices by developing a connection to the theory of Bloch energy bands. We benchmark our results through an alternative method that relies on computing the moments of adjacency matrices of large graphs, whose construction we explain explicitly. As condensed matter physics applications, we use our formulas to compute the density of states of tight-binding models on the Archimedean lattices and analytically determine the asymptotics of the return probability. While the Archimedean lattices provide a sufficiently rich structure and are chosen here for concreteness, our techniques can be generalized straightforwardly to other two- or higher-dimensional Euclidean lattices.</description>

      <title>Anyonic analogue of optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anyonic interferometry is a direct probe of fractional statistics. We propose an interferometry geometry that parallels an optical Mach-Zehnder interferometer and offers several advantages over existing interferometry schemes. In contrast to the currently studied electronic Mach-Zehnder interferometer, our setup has no drain inside the device so that the trapped topological charge is time-independent. In contrast to electronic Fabry-P\'erot interferometry, anyons cannot go around the device more than once. Thus, the interference signal has a straightforward interpretation in terms of anyonic statistical phases. The proposed geometry suppresses the undesirable effects of bulk-edge coupling. Moreover, the setup allows for simple exact solutions for the electric current and noise for an arbitrary quasiparticle tunneling strength in a broad range of conditions. The structure of the solutions is similar to that for non-interacting electrons but reflects fractional charge and statistics. We present results for electric current and noise in Jain states and address thermal interferometry at zero voltage bias.</description>

      <title>Defect Anomalies, a Spin-Flux Duality, and Boson-Kondo Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the infrared phases of certain line defects in 2+1d quantum field theories are determined by anomalies, including anomalies in the space of defect coupling constants, together with a symmetry-refined corollary of the $g$-theorem. As an example, we prove that the spin-$1/2$ impurities in the 2+1d critical $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ models (known respectively as the Halon and Boson-Kondo defects) flow to non-trivial conformal line operators in the IR, and we supply evidence that the same extends to all spin $s$. We also argue that, under particle/vortex duality, the Halon impurity is exchanged with the $\pi$-flux vortex line leading to spin-flux duality, a proposal which we test with a detailed matching of symmetries, anomalies, and phases. Finally, we write down quantum lattice Hamiltonians which can be used to test our predictions, and give an argument on the lattice in favor of spin-flux duality.</description>
