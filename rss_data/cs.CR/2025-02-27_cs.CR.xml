      <title>Deep Learning-based Dual Watermarking for Image Copyright Protection and Authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in digital technologies make it easy to modify the content of digital images. Hence, ensuring digital images integrity and authenticity is necessary to protect them against various attacks that manipulate them. We present a Deep Learning (DL) based dual invisible watermarking technique for performing source authentication, content authentication, and protecting digital content copyright of images sent over the internet. Beyond securing images, the proposed technique demonstrates robustness to content-preserving image manipulations. It is also impossible to imitate or overwrite watermarks because the cryptographic hash of the image and the dominant features of the image in the form of perceptual hash are used as watermarks. We highlighted the need for source authentication to safeguard image integrity and authenticity, along with identifying similar content for copyright protection. After exhaustive testing, we obtained a high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM), which implies there is a minute change in the original image after embedding our watermarks. Our trained model achieves high watermark extraction accuracy and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep learning-based dual watermarking technique proposed in the literature.</description>

      <title>TurboFuzzLLM: Turbocharging Mutation-based Fuzzing for Effectively Jailbreaking Large Language Models in Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jailbreaking large-language models (LLMs) involves testing their robustness against adversarial prompts and evaluating their ability to withstand prompt attacks that could elicit unauthorized or malicious responses. In this paper, we present TurboFuzzLLM, a mutation-based fuzzing technique for efficiently finding a collection of effective jailbreaking templates that, when combined with harmful questions, can lead a target LLM to produce harmful responses through black-box access via user prompts. We describe the limitations of directly applying existing template-based attacking techniques in practice, and present functional and efficiency-focused upgrades we added to mutation-based fuzzing to generate effective jailbreaking templates automatically. TurboFuzzLLM achieves $\geq$ 95\% attack success rates (ASR) on public datasets for leading LLMs (including GPT-4o \&amp; GPT-4 Turbo), shows impressive generalizability to unseen harmful questions, and helps in improving model defenses to prompt attacks.</description>

      <title>REFINE: Inversion-Free Backdoor Defense via Model Reprogramming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Backdoor attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a significant security threat, allowing adversaries to implant hidden malicious behaviors during the model training phase. Pre-processing-based defense, which is one of the most important defense paradigms, typically focuses on input transformations or backdoor trigger inversion (BTI) to deactivate or eliminate embedded backdoor triggers during the inference process. However, these methods suffer from inherent limitations: transformation-based defenses often fail to balance model utility and defense performance, while BTI-based defenses struggle to accurately reconstruct trigger patterns without prior knowledge. In this paper, we propose REFINE, an inversion-free backdoor defense method based on model reprogramming. REFINE consists of two key components: \textbf{(1)} an input transformation module that disrupts both benign and backdoor patterns, generating new benign features; and \textbf{(2)} an output remapping module that redefines the model's output domain to guide the input transformations effectively. By further integrating supervised contrastive loss, REFINE enhances the defense capabilities while maintaining model utility. Extensive experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our REFINE and its resistance to potential adaptive attacks.</description>

      <title>Protecting Users From Themselves: Safeguarding Contextual Privacy in Interactions with Conversational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational agents are increasingly woven into individuals' personal lives, yet users often underestimate the privacy risks involved. The moment users share information with these agents (e.g., LLMs), their private information becomes vulnerable to exposure. In this paper, we characterize the notion of contextual privacy for user interactions with LLMs. It aims to minimize privacy risks by ensuring that users (sender) disclose only information that is both relevant and necessary for achieving their intended goals when interacting with LLMs (untrusted receivers). Through a formative design user study, we observe how even "privacy-conscious" users inadvertently reveal sensitive information through indirect disclosures. Based on insights from this study, we propose a locally-deployable framework that operates between users and LLMs, and identifies and reformulates out-of-context information in user prompts. Our evaluation using examples from ShareGPT shows that lightweight models can effectively implement this framework, achieving strong gains in contextual privacy while preserving the user's intended interaction goals through different approaches to classify information relevant to the intended goals.</description>

      <title>ELBA-Bench: An Efficient Learning Backdoor Attacks Benchmark for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative large language models are crucial in natural language processing, but they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where subtle triggers compromise their behavior. Although backdoor attacks against LLMs are constantly emerging, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of sufficient coverage of attack, metric system integrity, backdoor attack alignment. And existing pre-trained backdoor attacks are idealized in practice due to resource access constraints. Therefore we establish $\textit{ELBA-Bench}$, a comprehensive and unified framework that allows attackers to inject backdoor through parameter efficient fine-tuning ($\textit{e.g.,}$ LoRA) or without fine-tuning techniques ($\textit{e.g.,}$ In-context-learning). $\textit{ELBA-Bench}$ provides over 1300 experiments encompassing the implementations of 12 attack methods, 18 datasets, and 12 LLMs. Extensive experiments provide new invaluable findings into the strengths and limitations of various attack strategies. For instance, PEFT attack consistently outperform without fine-tuning approaches in classification tasks while showing strong cross-dataset generalization with optimized triggers boosting robustness; Task-relevant backdoor optimization techniques or attack prompts along with clean and adversarial demonstrations can enhance backdoor attack success while preserving model performance on clean samples. Additionally, we introduce a universal toolbox designed for standardized backdoor attack research, with the goal of propelling further progress in this vital area.</description>

      <title>CipherFace: A Fully Homomorphic Encryption-Driven Framework for Secure Cloud-Based Facial Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Facial recognition systems rely on embeddings to represent facial images and determine identity by verifying if the distance between embeddings is below a pre-tuned threshold. While embeddings are not reversible to original images, they still contain sensitive information, making their security critical. Traditional encryption methods like AES are limited in securely utilizing cloud computational power for distance calculations. Homomorphic Encryption, allowing calculations on encrypted data, offers a robust alternative. This paper introduces CipherFace, a homomorphic encryption-driven framework for secure cloud-based facial recognition, which we have open-sourced at http://github.com/serengil/cipherface. By leveraging FHE, CipherFace ensures the privacy of embeddings while utilizing the cloud for efficient distance computation. Furthermore, we propose a novel encrypted distance computation method for both Euclidean and Cosine distances, addressing key challenges in performing secure similarity calculations on encrypted data. We also conducted experiments with different facial recognition models, various embedding sizes, and cryptosystem configurations, demonstrating the scalability and effectiveness of CipherFace in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent Framework for Automated Vulnerability Detection and Repair in Solidity and Move Smart Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of the blockchain ecosystem and the increasing value locked in smart contracts necessitate robust security measures. While languages like Solidity and Move aim to improve smart contract security, vulnerabilities persist. This paper presents Smartify, a novel multi-agent framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically detect and repair vulnerabilities in Solidity and Move smart contracts. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on vast pre-training datasets, Smartify employs a team of specialized agents working on different specially fine-tuned LLMs to analyze code based on underlying programming concepts and language-specific security principles. We evaluated Smartify on a dataset for Solidity and a curated dataset for Move, demonstrating its effectiveness in fixing a wide range of vulnerabilities. Our results show that Smartify (Gemma2+codegemma) achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing LLMs and enhancing general-purpose models' capabilities, such as Llama 3.1. Notably, Smartify can incorporate language-specific knowledge, such as the nuances of Move, without requiring massive language-specific pre-training datasets. This work offers a detailed analysis of various LLMs' performance on smart contract repair, highlighting the strengths of our multi-agent approach and providing a blueprint for developing more secure and reliable decentralized applications in the growing blockchain landscape. We also provide a detailed recipe for extending this to other similar use cases.</description>

      <title>RewardDS: Privacy-Preserving Fine-Tuning for Large Language Models via Reward Driven Data Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of large language models (LLMs) has attracted many individuals to fine-tune them for domain-specific tasks by uploading their data. However, in sensitive areas like healthcare and finance, privacy concerns often arise. One promising solution is to sample synthetic data with Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees to replace private data. However, these synthetic data contain significant flawed data, which are considered as noise. Existing solutions typically rely on naive filtering by comparing ROUGE-L scores or embedding similarities, which are ineffective in addressing the noise. To address this issue, we propose RewardDS, a novel privacy-preserving framework that fine-tunes a reward proxy model and uses reward signals to guide the synthetic data generation. Our RewardDS introduces two key modules, Reward Guided Filtering and Self-Optimizing Refinement, to both filter and refine the synthetic data, effectively mitigating the noise. Extensive experiments across medical, financial, and code generation domains demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Swallowing the Poison Pills: Insights from Vulnerability Disparity Among LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) exhibit critical vulnerabilities to poison pill attacks: localized data poisoning that alters specific factual knowledge while preserving overall model utility. We systematically demonstrate these attacks exploit inherent architectural properties of LLMs, achieving 54.6% increased retrieval inaccuracy on long-tail knowledge versus dominant topics and up to 25.5% increase retrieval inaccuracy on compressed models versus original architectures. Through controlled mutations (e.g., temporal/spatial/entity alterations) and, our method induces localized memorization deterioration with negligible impact on models' performance on regular standard benchmarks (e.g., &lt;2% performance drop on MMLU/GPQA), leading to potential detection evasion. Our findings suggest: (1) Disproportionate vulnerability in long-tail knowledge may result from reduced parameter redundancy; (2) Model compression may increase attack surfaces, with pruned/distilled models requiring 30% fewer poison samples for equivalent damage; (3) Associative memory enables both spread of collateral damage to related concepts and amplification of damage from simultaneous attack, particularly for dominant topics. These findings raise concerns over current scaling paradigms since attack costs are lowering while defense complexity is rising. Our work establishes poison pills as both a security threat and diagnostic tool, revealing critical security-efficiency trade-offs in language model compression that challenges prevailing safety assumptions.</description>

      <title>Class-Conditional Neural Polarizer: A Lightweight and Effective Backdoor Defense by Purifying Poisoned Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the vulnerability of deep neural networks to backdoor attacks, where models are manipulated to rely on embedded triggers within poisoned samples, despite the presence of both benign and trigger information. While several defense methods have been proposed, they often struggle to balance backdoor mitigation with maintaining benign performance.In this work, inspired by the concept of optical polarizer-which allows light waves of specific polarizations to pass while filtering others-we propose a lightweight backdoor defense approach, NPD. This method integrates a neural polarizer (NP) as an intermediate layer within the compromised model, implemented as a lightweight linear transformation optimized via bi-level optimization. The learnable NP filters trigger information from poisoned samples while preserving benign content. Despite its effectiveness, we identify through empirical studies that NPD's performance degrades when the target labels (required for purification) are inaccurately estimated. To address this limitation while harnessing the potential of targeted adversarial mitigation, we propose class-conditional neural polarizer-based defense (CNPD). The key innovation is a fusion module that integrates the backdoored model's predicted label with the features to be purified. This architecture inherently mimics targeted adversarial defense mechanisms without requiring label estimation used in NPD. We propose three implementations of CNPD: the first is r-CNPD, which trains a replicated NP layer for each class and, during inference, selects the appropriate NP layer for defense based on the predicted class from the backdoored model. To efficiently handle a large number of classes, two variants are designed: e-CNPD, which embeds class information as additional features, and a-CNPD, which directs network attention using class information.</description>

      <title>GOD model: Privacy Preserved AI School for Personal Assistant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Personal AI assistants (e.g., Apple Intelligence, Meta AI) offer proactive recommendations that simplify everyday tasks, but their reliance on sensitive user data raises concerns about privacy and trust. To address these challenges, we introduce the Guardian of Data (GOD), a secure, privacy-preserving framework for training and evaluating AI assistants directly on-device. Unlike traditional benchmarks, the GOD model measures how well assistants can anticipate user needs-such as suggesting gifts-while protecting user data and autonomy. Functioning like an AI school, it addresses the cold start problem by simulating user queries and employing a curriculum-based approach to refine the performance of each assistant. Running within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), it safeguards user data while applying reinforcement and imitation learning to refine AI recommendations. A token-based incentive system encourages users to share data securely, creating a data flywheel that drives continuous improvement. By integrating privacy, personalization, and trust, the GOD model provides a scalable, responsible path for advancing personal AI assistants. For community collaboration, part of the framework is open-sourced at https://github.com/PIN-AI/God-Model.</description>

Abstract: We introduce ARACNE, a fully autonomous LLM-based pentesting agent tailored for SSH services that can execute commands on real Linux shell systems. Introduces a new agent architecture with multi-LLM model support. Experiments show that ARACNE can reach a 60\% success rate against the autonomous defender ShelLM and a 57.58\% success rate against the Over The Wire Bandit CTF challenges, improving over the state-of-the-art. When winning, the average number of actions taken by the agent to accomplish the goals was less than 5. The results show that the use of multi-LLM is a promising approach to increase accuracy in the actions.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Zero-Knowledge Proof Based Verifiable Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As machine learning technologies advance rapidly across various domains, concerns over data privacy and model security have grown significantly. These challenges are particularly pronounced when models are trained and deployed on cloud platforms or third-party servers due to the computational resource limitations of users' end devices. In response, zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology has emerged as a promising solution, enabling effective validation of model performance and authenticity in both training and inference processes without disclosing sensitive data. Thus, ZKP ensures the verifiability and security of machine learning models, making it a valuable tool for privacy-preserving AI. Although some research has explored the verifiable machine learning solutions that exploit ZKP, a comprehensive survey and summary of these efforts remain absent. This survey paper aims to bridge this gap by reviewing and analyzing all the existing Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (ZKML) research from June 2017 to December 2024. We begin by introducing the concept of ZKML and outlining its ZKP algorithmic setups under three key categories: verifiable training, verifiable inference, and verifiable testing. Next, we provide a comprehensive categorization of existing ZKML research within these categories and analyze the works in detail. Furthermore, we explore the implementation challenges faced in this field and discuss the improvement works to address these obstacles. Additionally, we highlight several commercial applications of ZKML technology. Finally, we propose promising directions for future advancements in this domain.</description>

      <title>PII-Bench: Evaluating Query-Aware Privacy Protection Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised significant privacy concerns regarding the exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) in user prompts. To address this challenge, we propose a query-unrelated PII masking strategy and introduce PII-Bench, the first comprehensive evaluation framework for assessing privacy protection systems. PII-Bench comprises 2,842 test samples across 55 fine-grained PII categories, featuring diverse scenarios from single-subject descriptions to complex multi-party interactions. Each sample is carefully crafted with a user query, context description, and standard answer indicating query-relevant PII. Our empirical evaluation reveals that while current models perform adequately in basic PII detection, they show significant limitations in determining PII query relevance. Even state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with this task, particularly in handling complex multi-subject scenarios, indicating substantial room for improvement in achieving intelligent PII masking.</description>

      <title>Steganography Beyond Space-Time With Chain of Multimodal AI Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Steganography is the art and science of covert writing, with a broad range of applications interwoven within the realm of cybersecurity. As artificial intelligence continues to evolve, its ability to synthesise realistic content emerges as a threat in the hands of cybercriminals who seek to manipulate and misrepresent the truth. Such synthetic content introduces a non-trivial risk of overwriting the subtle changes made for the purpose of steganography. When the signals in both the spatial and temporal domains are vulnerable to unforeseen overwriting, it calls for reflection on what can remain invariant after all. This study proposes a paradigm in steganography for audiovisual media, where messages are concealed beyond both spatial and temporal domains. A chain of multimodal agents is developed to deconstruct audiovisual content into a cover text, embed a message within the linguistic domain, and then reconstruct the audiovisual content through synchronising both aural and visual modalities with the resultant stego text. The message is encoded by biasing the word sampling process of a language generation model and decoded by analysing the probability distribution of word choices. The accuracy of message transmission is evaluated under both zero-bit and multi-bit capacity settings. Fidelity is assessed through both biometric and semantic similarities, capturing the identities of the recorded face and voice, as well as the core ideas conveyed through the media. Secrecy is examined through statistical comparisons between cover and stego texts. Robustness is tested across various scenarios, including audiovisual compression, face-swapping, voice-cloning and their combinations.</description>

      <title>Toward Breaking Watermarks in Distortion-free Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, LLM watermarking has emerged as an attractive safeguard against AI-generated content, with promising applications in many real-world domains. However, there are growing concerns that the current LLM watermarking schemes are vulnerable to expert adversaries wishing to reverse-engineer the watermarking mechanisms. Prior work in "breaking" or "stealing" LLM watermarks mainly focuses on the distribution-modifying algorithm of Kirchenbauer et al. (2023), which perturbs the logit vector before sampling. In this work, we focus on reverse-engineering the other prominent LLM watermarking scheme, distortion-free watermarking (Kuditipudi et al. 2024), which preserves the underlying token distribution by using a hidden watermarking key sequence. We demonstrate that, even under a more sophisticated watermarking scheme, it is possible to "compromise" the LLM and carry out a "spoofing" attack. Specifically, we propose a mixed integer linear programming framework that accurately estimates the secret key used for watermarking using only a few samples of the watermarked dataset. Our initial findings challenge the current theoretical claims on the robustness and usability of existing LLM watermarking techniques.</description>

      <title>IID-Based QPP-RNG: A Random Number Generator Utilizing Random Permutation Sorting Driven by System Jitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present IID-Based QPP-RNG, a groundbreaking random number generator that achieves truly uniform, independent, and identically distributed (IID) randomness by integrating Quantum Permutation Pads (QPP) with system jitter-derived entropy. Unlike conventional RNGs that rely directly on raw timing variations, IID-Based QPP-RNG uses system jitter solely to generate ephemeral QPP pads and derives its final 8-bit outputs from permutation counts -- without the post-processing module. This design leverages the factorial complexity of random permutation-based sorting to systematically accumulate entropy from dynamic hardware interactions, ensuring non-deterministic outputs even when starting from fixed seeds.
  Our implementation employs a dynamic seed evolution protocol that continuously refreshes the internal state using unpredictable system jitter, decoupling the deterministic QPP sequence from the initial seed. Rigorous cross-platform validation on macOS (x86 and ARM) and Windows (x86) confirms that the generator produces uniformly distributed 8-bit outputs. Evaluations compliant with NIST SP 800-90B demonstrate exceptional statistical quality, with a Shannon entropy of 7.9999 bits per byte and a min-entropy of 7.18 bits per byte.
  IID-Based QPP-RNG represents a significant advancement in random number generation by bridging algorithmic complexity with system-level entropy, offering a scalable, software-only, post-quantum-secure solution for cryptographic applications in environments lacking dedicated hardware entropy sources.</description>

      <title>Marking Code Without Breaking It: Code Watermarking for Detecting LLM-Generated Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code watermarking identifies AI-generated code by embedding patterns into the code during generation. Effective watermarking requires meeting two key conditions: the watermark should be reliably detectable, and the code should retain its original functionality. However, existing methods often modify tokens that are critical for program logic, such as keywords in conditional expressions or operators in arithmetic computations. These modifications can cause syntax errors or functional failures, limiting the practical use of watermarking. We present STONE, a method that preserves functional integrity by selectively inserting watermarks only into non-syntax tokens. By excluding tokens essential for code execution, STONE minimizes the risk of functional degradation.
  In addition, we introduce CWEM, a comprehensive evaluation metric that evaluates watermarking techniques based on correctness, detectability, and naturalness. While correctness and detectability have been widely used, naturalness remains underexplored despite its importance. Unnatural patterns can reveal the presence of a watermark, making it easier for adversaries to remove. We evaluate STONE using CWEM and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art approach. The results show that STONE achieves an average improvement of 7.69% in CWEM across Python, C++, and Java. Our code is available in https://github.com/inistory/STONE-watermarking/.</description>

      <title>Towards Label-Only Membership Inference Attack against Pre-trained Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) aim to predict whether a data sample belongs to the model's training set or not. Although prior research has extensively explored MIAs in Large Language Models (LLMs), they typically require accessing to complete output logits (\ie, \textit{logits-based attacks}), which are usually not available in practice. In this paper, we study the vulnerability of pre-trained LLMs to MIAs in the \textit{label-only setting}, where the adversary can only access generated tokens (text). We first reveal that existing label-only MIAs have minor effects in attacking pre-trained LLMs, although they are highly effective in inferring fine-tuning datasets used for personalized LLMs. We find that their failure stems from two main reasons, including better generalization and overly coarse perturbation. Specifically, due to the extensive pre-training corpora and exposing each sample only a few times, LLMs exhibit minimal robustness differences between members and non-members. This makes token-level perturbations too coarse to capture such differences.
  To alleviate these problems, we propose \textbf{PETAL}: a label-only membership inference attack based on \textbf{PE}r-\textbf{T}oken sem\textbf{A}ntic simi\textbf{L}arity. Specifically, PETAL leverages token-level semantic similarity to approximate output probabilities and subsequently calculate the perplexity. It finally exposes membership based on the common assumption that members are `better' memorized and have smaller perplexity. We conduct extensive experiments on the WikiMIA benchmark and the more challenging MIMIR benchmark. Empirically, our PETAL performs better than the extensions of existing label-only attacks against personalized LLMs and even on par with other advanced logit-based attacks across all metrics on five prevalent open-source LLMs.</description>

      <title>Switching multiplicative watermark design against covert attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active techniques have been introduced to give better detectability performance for cyber-attack diagnosis in cyber-physical systems (CPS). In this paper, switching multiplicative watermarking is considered, whereby we propose an optimal design strategy to define switching filter parameters. Optimality is evaluated exploiting the so-called output-to-output gain of the closed loop system, including some supposed attack dynamics. A worst-case scenario of a matched covert attack is assumed, presuming that an attacker with full knowledge of the closed-loop system injects a stealthy attack of bounded energy. Our algorithm, given watermark filter parameters at some time instant, provides optimal next-step parameters. Analysis of the algorithm is given, demonstrating its features, and demonstrating that through initialization of certain parameters outside of the algorithm, the parameters of the multiplicative watermarking can be randomized. Simulation shows how, by adopting our method for parameter design, the attacker's impact on performance diminishes.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Membership Inference Attacks in heterogeneous-data setups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among all privacy attacks against Machine Learning (ML), membership inference attacks (MIA) attracted the most attention. In these attacks, the attacker is given an ML model and a data point, and they must infer whether the data point was used for training. The attacker also has an auxiliary dataset to tune their inference algorithm.
  Attack papers commonly simulate setups in which the attacker's and the target's datasets are sampled from the same distribution. This setting is convenient to perform experiments, but it rarely holds in practice. ML literature commonly starts with similar simplifying assumptions (i.e., "i.i.d." datasets), and later generalizes the results to support heterogeneous data distributions. Similarly, our work makes a first step in the generalization of the MIA evaluation to heterogeneous data.
  First, we design a metric to measure the heterogeneity between any pair of tabular data distributions. This metric provides a continuous scale to analyze the phenomenon. Second, we compare two methodologies to simulate a data heterogeneity between the target and the attacker. These setups provide opposite performances: 90% attack accuracy vs. 50% (i.e., random guessing). Our results show that the MIA accuracy depends on the experimental setup; and even if research on MIA considers heterogeneous data setups, we have no standardized baseline of how to simulate it. The lack of such a baseline for MIA experiments poses a significant challenge to risk assessments in real-world machine learning scenarios.</description>

      <title>Beyond Surface-Level Patterns: An Essence-Driven Defense Framework Against Jailbreak Attacks in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Aligned Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to refuse harmful requests, they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. Unfortunately, existing methods often focus on surface-level patterns, overlooking the deeper attack essences. As a result, defenses fail when attack prompts change, even though the underlying "attack essence" remains the same. To address this issue, we introduce EDDF, an \textbf{E}ssence-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{D}efense \textbf{F}ramework Against Jailbreak Attacks in LLMs. EDDF is a plug-and-play input-filtering method and operates in two stages: 1) offline essence database construction, and 2) online adversarial query detection. The key idea behind EDDF is to extract the "attack essence" from a diverse set of known attack instances and store it in an offline vector database. Experimental results demonstrate that EDDF significantly outperforms existing methods by reducing the Attack Success Rate by at least 20\%, underscoring its superior robustness against jailbreak attacks.</description>

      <title>Towards Privacy-Preserving Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection in Energy Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy communities consist of decentralized energy production, storage, consumption, and distribution and are gaining traction in modern power systems. However, these communities may increase the vulnerability of the grid to cyber threats. We propose an anomaly-based intrusion detection system to enhance the security of energy communities. The system leverages deep autoencoders to detect deviations from normal operational patterns in order to identify anomalies induced by malicious activities and attacks. Operational data for training and evaluation are derived from a Simulink model of an energy community. The results show that the autoencoder-based intrusion detection system achieves good detection performance across multiple attack scenarios. We also demonstrate potential for real-world application of the system by training a federated model that enables distributed intrusion detection while preserving data privacy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Webshell is a type of backdoor, and web applications are widely exposed to webshell injection attacks. Therefore, it is important to study webshell detection techniques. In this study, we propose a webshell detection method. We first convert PHP source code to opcodes and then extract Opcode Double-Tuples (ODTs). Next, we combine CodeBert and FastText models for feature representation and classification. To address the challenge that deep learning methods have difficulty detecting long webshell files, we introduce a sliding window attention mechanism. This approach effectively captures malicious behavior within long files. Experimental results show that our method reaches high accuracy in webshell detection, solving the problem of traditional methods that struggle to address new webshell variants and anti-detection techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, Cursor AI, and Codeium AI into software development has revolutionized the coding landscape, offering significant productivity gains, automation, and enhanced debugging capabilities. These tools have proven invaluable for generating code snippets, refactoring existing code, and providing real-time support to developers. However, their widespread adoption also presents notable challenges, particularly in terms of security vulnerabilities, code quality, and ethical concerns. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the benefits and risks associated with AI-powered coding tools, drawing on user feedback, security analyses, and practical use cases. We explore the potential for these tools to replicate insecure coding practices, introduce biases, and generate incorrect or non-sensical code (hallucinations). In addition, we discuss the risks of data leaks, intellectual property violations and the need for robust security measures to mitigate these threats. By comparing the features and performance of these tools, we aim to guide developers in making informed decisions about their use, ensuring that the benefits of AI-assisted coding are maximized while minimizing associated risks.</description>

      <title>Target Defense with Multiple Defenders and an Agile Attacker via Residual Policy Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The target defense problem involves intercepting an attacker before it reaches a designated target region using one or more defenders. This letter focuses on a particularly challenging scenario in which the attacker is more agile than the defenders, significantly increasing the difficulty of effective interception. To address this challenge, we propose a novel residual policy framework that integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) with the force-based Boids model. In this framework, the Boids model serves as a baseline policy, while DRL learns a residual policy to refine and optimize the defenders' actions. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms traditional interception policies, whether learned via vanilla DRL or fine-tuned from force-based methods. Moreover, the learned policy exhibits strong scalability and adaptability, effectively handling scenarios with varying numbers of defenders and attackers with different agility levels.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Iterative Screening Rules for Linear Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear $L_1$-regularized models have remained one of the simplest and most effective tools in data science. Over the past decade, screening rules have risen in popularity as a way to eliminate features when producing the sparse regression weights of $L_1$ models. However, despite the increasing need of privacy-preserving models for data analysis, to the best of our knowledge, no differentially private screening rule exists. In this paper, we develop the first private screening rule for linear regression. We initially find that this screening rule is too strong: it screens too many coefficients as a result of the private screening step. However, a weakened implementation of private screening reduces overscreening and improves performance.</description>

      <title>H-FLTN: A Privacy-Preserving Hierarchical Framework for Electric Vehicle Spatio-Temporal Charge Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) poses critical challenges for energy providers, particularly in predicting charging time (temporal prediction), ensuring user privacy, and managing resources efficiently in mobility-driven networks. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Federated Learning Transformer Network (H-FLTN) framework to address these challenges. H-FLTN employs a three-tier hierarchical architecture comprising EVs, community Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS), and the Energy Provider Data Centre (EPDC) to enable accurate spatio-temporal predictions of EV charging needs while preserving privacy. Temporal prediction is enhanced using Transformer-based learning, capturing complex dependencies in charging behavior. Privacy is ensured through Secure Aggregation, Additive Secret Sharing, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing with Augmentation, which allow only secret shares of model weights to be exchanged while securing all transmissions. To improve training efficiency and resource management, H-FLTN integrates Dynamic Client Capping Mechanism (DCCM) and Client Rotation Management (CRM), ensuring that training remains both computationally and temporally efficient as the number of participating EVs increases. DCCM optimises client participation by limiting excessive computational loads, while CRM balances training contributions across epochs, preventing imbalanced participation. Our simulation results based on large-scale empirical vehicle mobility data reveal that DCCM and CRM reduce the training time complexity with increasing EVs from linear to constant. Its integration into real-world smart city infrastructure enhances energy demand forecasting, resource allocation, and grid stability, ensuring reliability and sustainability in future mobility ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Federated Learning With Time-Adaptive Privacy Spending</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) with differential privacy (DP) provides a framework for collaborative machine learning, enabling clients to train a shared model while adhering to strict privacy constraints. The framework allows each client to have an individual privacy guarantee, e.g., by adding different amounts of noise to each client's model updates. One underlying assumption is that all clients spend their privacy budgets uniformly over time (learning rounds). However, it has been shown in the literature that learning in early rounds typically focuses on more coarse-grained features that can be learned at lower signal-to-noise ratios while later rounds learn fine-grained features that benefit from higher signal-to-noise ratios. Building on this intuition, we propose a time-adaptive DP-FL framework that expends the privacy budget non-uniformly across both time and clients. Our framework enables each client to save privacy budget in early rounds so as to be able to spend more in later rounds when additional accuracy is beneficial in learning more fine-grained features. We theoretically prove utility improvements in the case that clients with stricter privacy budgets spend budgets unevenly across rounds, compared to clients with more relaxed budgets, who have sufficient budgets to distribute their spend more evenly. Our practical experiments on standard benchmark datasets support our theoretical results and show that, in practice, our algorithms improve the privacy-utility trade-offs compared to baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Universal Stickers: Universal Perturbation Attacks on Traffic Sign using Stickers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks on deep learning models have proliferated in recent years. In many cases, a different adversarial perturbation is required to be added to each image to cause the deep learning model to misclassify it. This is ineffective as each image has to be modified in a different way. Meanwhile, research on universal perturbations focuses on designing a single perturbation that can be applied to all images in a data set, and cause a deep learning model to misclassify the images. This work advances the field of universal perturbations by exploring universal perturbations in the context of traffic signs and autonomous vehicle systems. This work introduces a novel method for generating universal perturbations that visually look like simple black and white stickers, and using them to cause incorrect street sign predictions. Unlike traditional adversarial perturbations, the adversarial universal stickers are designed to be applicable to any street sign: same sticker, or stickers, can be applied in same location to any street sign and cause it to be misclassified. Further, to enable safe experimentation with adversarial images and street signs, this work presents a virtual setting that leverages Street View images of street signs, rather than the need to physically modify street signs, to test the attacks. The experiments in the virtual setting demonstrate that these stickers can consistently mislead deep learning models used commonly in street sign recognition, and achieve high attack success rates on dataset of US traffic signs. The findings highlight the practical security risks posed by simple stickers applied to traffic signs, and the ease with which adversaries can generate adversarial universal stickers that can be applied to many street signs.</description>

      <title>A Sample-Level Evaluation and Generative Framework for Model Inversion Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model Inversion (MI) attacks, which reconstruct the training dataset of neural networks, pose significant privacy concerns in machine learning. Recent MI attacks have managed to reconstruct realistic label-level private data, such as the general appearance of a target person from all training images labeled on him. Beyond label-level privacy, in this paper we show sample-level privacy, the private information of a single target sample, is also important but under-explored in the MI literature due to the limitations of existing evaluation metrics. To address this gap, this study introduces a novel metric tailored for training-sample analysis, namely, the Diversity and Distance Composite Score (DDCS), which evaluates the reconstruction fidelity of each training sample by encompassing various MI attack attributes. This, in turn, enhances the precision of sample-level privacy assessments.
  Leveraging DDCS as a new evaluative lens, we observe that many training samples remain resilient against even the most advanced MI attack. As such, we further propose a transfer learning framework that augments the generative capabilities of MI attackers through the integration of entropy loss and natural gradient descent. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of our framework on improving state-of-the-art MI attacks over various metrics including DDCS, coverage and FID. Finally, we demonstrate that DDCS can also be useful for MI defense, by identifying samples susceptible to MI attacks in an unsupervised manner.</description>

      <title>XSS Adversarial Attacks Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Replication and Extension Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-site scripting (XSS) poses a significant threat to web application security. While Deep Learning (DL) has shown remarkable success in detecting XSS attacks, it remains vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to the discontinuous nature of its input-output mapping. These adversarial attacks employ mutation-based strategies for different components of XSS attack vectors, allowing adversarial agents to iteratively select mutations to evade detection. Our work replicates a state-of-the-art XSS adversarial attack, highlighting threats to validity in the reference work and extending it toward a more effective evaluation strategy. Moreover, we introduce an XSS Oracle to mitigate these threats. The experimental results show that our approach achieves an escape rate above 96% when the threats to validity of the replicated technique are addressed.</description>

      <title>Shh, don't say that! Domain Certification in LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often deployed to perform constrained tasks, with narrow domains. For example, customer support bots can be built on top of LLMs, relying on their broad language understanding and capabilities to enhance performance. However, these LLMs are adversarially susceptible, potentially generating outputs outside the intended domain. To formalize, assess, and mitigate this risk, we introduce domain certification; a guarantee that accurately characterizes the out-of-domain behavior of language models. We then propose a simple yet effective approach, which we call VALID that provides adversarial bounds as a certificate. Finally, we evaluate our method across a diverse set of datasets, demonstrating that it yields meaningful certificates, which bound the probability of out-of-domain samples tightly with minimum penalty to refusal behavior.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Wireless Users' Locations via Modulation Classification-based Passive Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The broadcast nature of the wireless medium and openness of wireless standards, e.g., 3GPP releases 16-20, invite adversaries to launch various active and passive attacks on cellular and other wireless networks. This work identifies one such loose end of wireless standards and presents a novel passive attack method enabling an eavesdropper (Eve) to localize a line of sight wireless user (Bob) who is communicating with a base station or WiFi access point (Alice). The proposed attack involves two phases. In the first phase, Eve performs modulation classification by intercepting the downlink channel between Alice and Bob. This enables Eve to utilize the publicly available modulation and coding scheme (MCS) tables to do pesudo-ranging, i.e., the Eve determines the ring within which Bob is located, which drastically reduces the search space. In the second phase, Eve sniffs the uplink channel, and employs multiple strategies to further refine Bob's location within the ring. Towards the end, we present our thoughts on how this attack can be extended to non-line-of-sight scenarios, and how this attack could act as a scaffolding to construct a malicious digital twin map.</description>

      <title>SynGhost: Invisible and Universal Task-agnostic Backdoor Attack via Syntactic Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18945v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although pre-training achieves remarkable performance, it suffers from task-agnostic backdoor attacks due to vulnerabilities in data and training mechanisms. These attacks can transfer backdoors to various downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce $\mathtt{maxEntropy}$, an entropy-based poisoning filter that mitigates such risks. To overcome the limitations of manual target setting and explicit triggers, we propose $\mathtt{SynGhost}$, an invisible and universal task-agnostic backdoor attack via syntactic transfer, further exposing vulnerabilities in pre-trained language models (PLMs). Specifically, $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ injects multiple syntactic backdoors into the pre-training space through corpus poisoning, while preserving the PLM's pre-training capabilities. Second, $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ adaptively selects optimal targets based on contrastive learning, creating a uniform distribution in the pre-training space. To identify syntactic differences, we also introduce an awareness module to minimize interference between backdoors. Experiments show that $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ poses significant threats and can transfer to various downstream tasks. Furthermore, $\mathtt{SynGhost}$ resists defenses based on perplexity, fine-pruning, and $\mathtt{maxEntropy}$. The code is available at https://github.com/Zhou-CyberSecurity-AI/SynGhost.</description>

      <title>Great, Now Write an Article About That: The Crescendo Multi-Turn LLM Jailbreak Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have risen significantly in popularity and are increasingly being adopted across multiple applications. These LLMs are heavily aligned to resist engaging in illegal or unethical topics as a means to avoid contributing to responsible AI harms. However, a recent line of attacks, known as jailbreaks, seek to overcome this alignment. Intuitively, jailbreak attacks aim to narrow the gap between what the model can do and what it is willing to do. In this paper, we introduce a novel jailbreak attack called Crescendo. Unlike existing jailbreak methods, Crescendo is a simple multi-turn jailbreak that interacts with the model in a seemingly benign manner. It begins with a general prompt or question about the task at hand and then gradually escalates the dialogue by referencing the model's replies progressively leading to a successful jailbreak. We evaluate Crescendo on various public systems, including ChatGPT, Gemini Pro, Gemini-Ultra, LlaMA-2 70b and LlaMA-3 70b Chat, and Anthropic Chat. Our results demonstrate the strong efficacy of Crescendo, with it achieving high attack success rates across all evaluated models and tasks. Furthermore, we present Crescendomation, a tool that automates the Crescendo attack and demonstrate its efficacy against state-of-the-art models through our evaluations. Crescendomation surpasses other state-of-the-art jailbreaking techniques on the AdvBench subset dataset, achieving 29-61% higher performance on GPT-4 and 49-71% on Gemini-Pro. Finally, we also demonstrate Crescendo's ability to jailbreak multimodal models.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Release of Israel's National Registry of Live Births</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00267v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In February 2024, Israel's Ministry of Health released microdata of live births in Israel in 2014. The dataset is based on Israel's National Registry of Live Births and offers substantial value in multiple areas, such as scientific research and policy-making, while providing pure differential privacy guarantee with $\varepsilon = 9.98$ for 2014's mothers and newborns. The release was co-designed by the authors along with stakeholders from both inside and outside the Ministry of Health. This paper presents the methodology used to obtain that release, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first of its kind in the world. The design process has been challenging and required flexibility and open-mindedness on all sides involved, along with substantial technical innovation. In particular, we introduce new concepts regarding the desiderata from dataset releases in a microdata format, as well as a way to bundle together multiple quantitative desiderata for a differentially private release using the private selection algorithm of Liu and Talwar (STOC 2019). We hope that the experiences reported here will be useful to future differentially private releases.</description>

Abstract: Despite blockchain data being publicly available, practical challenges and high costs often hinder its effective use by researchers, thus limiting data-driven research and exploration in the blockchain space. This is especially true when it comes to Layer-2 (L2) ecosystems, and ZKsync, in particular. To address these issues, we have curated a dataset from 1 year of activity extracted from a ZKsync Era archive node and made it freely available to external parties. We provide details on this dataset and how it was created, showcase a few example analyses that can be performed with it, and discuss some future research directions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Android Malware Detection: The Influence of ChatGPT on Decision-centric Task</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the rise of large language models, such as ChatGPT, non-decisional models have been applied to various tasks. Moreover, ChatGPT has drawn attention to the traditional decision-centric task of Android malware detection. Despite effective detection methods proposed by scholars, they face low interpretability issues. Specifically, while these methods excel in classifying applications as benign or malicious and can detect malicious behavior, they often fail to provide detailed explanations for the decisions they make. This challenge raises concerns about the reliability of existing detection schemes and questions their true ability to understand complex data. In this study, we investigate the influence of the non-decisional model, ChatGPT, on the traditional decision-centric task of Android malware detection. We choose three state-of-the-art solutions, Drebin, XMAL, and MaMaDroid, conduct a series of experiments on publicly available datasets, and carry out a comprehensive comparison and analysis. Our findings indicate that these decision-driven solutions primarily rely on statistical patterns within datasets to make decisions, rather than genuinely understanding the underlying data. In contrast, ChatGPT, as a non-decisional model, excels in providing comprehensive analysis reports, substantially enhancing interpretability. Furthermore, we conduct surveys among experienced developers. The result highlights developers' preference for ChatGPT, as it offers in-depth insights and enhances efficiency and understanding of challenges. Meanwhile, these studies and analyses offer profound insights, presenting developers with a novel perspective on Android malware detection--enhancing the reliability of detection results from a non-decisional perspective.</description>

      <title>Time Traveling to Defend Against Adversarial Example Attacks in Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adversarial example attacks have emerged as a critical threat to machine learning. Adversarial attacks in image classification abuse various, minor modifications to the image that confuse the image classification neural network -- while the image still remains recognizable to humans. One important domain where the attacks have been applied is in the automotive setting with traffic sign classification. Researchers have demonstrated that adding stickers, shining light, or adding shadows are all different means to make machine learning inference algorithms mis-classify the traffic signs. This can cause potentially dangerous situations as a stop sign is recognized as a speed limit sign causing vehicles to ignore it and potentially leading to accidents. To address these attacks, this work focuses on enhancing defenses against such adversarial attacks. This work shifts the advantage to the user by introducing the idea of leveraging historical images and majority voting. While the attacker modifies a traffic sign that is currently being processed by the victim's machine learning inference, the victim can gain advantage by examining past images of the same traffic sign. This work introduces the notion of ''time traveling'' and uses historical Street View images accessible to anybody to perform inference on different, past versions of the same traffic sign. In the evaluation, the proposed defense has 100% effectiveness against latest adversarial example attack on traffic sign classification algorithm.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the recent remarkable advancement of large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing interest in utilizing them in the domains with highly sensitive data that lies outside their training data. For this purpose, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is particularly effective -- it assists LLMs by directly providing relevant information from the external knowledge sources. However, without extra privacy safeguards, RAG outputs risk leaking sensitive information from the external data source. In this work, we explore RAG under differential privacy (DP), a formal guarantee of data privacy. The main challenge with differentially private RAG is how to generate long accurate answers within a moderate privacy budget. We address this by proposing an algorithm that smartly spends privacy budget only for the tokens that require the sensitive information and uses the non-private LLM for other tokens. Our extensive empirical evaluations reveal that our algorithm outperforms the non-RAG baseline under a reasonable privacy budget of $\epsilon\approx 10$ across different models and datasets.</description>

Abstract: As AI usage becomes more ubiquitous, AI incident reporting is both practiced increasingly in industry and mandated by regulatory requirements. At the same time, it is established that AI systems are exploited in practice by a growing number of security threats. Yet, organizations and practitioners lack necessary guidance in describing AI security incidents. In this position paper, we argue that specific taxonomies are required to describe and report security incidents of AI systems. In other words, existing frameworks for either non-AI security or generic AI safety incident reporting are insufficient to capture the specific properties of AI security. To demonstrate our position, we offer an AI security incident taxonomy and highlight relevant properties, such as machine readability and integration with existing frameworks. We have derived this proposal from interviews with experts, aiming for standardized reporting of AI security incidents, which meets the requirements of affected stakeholder groups. We hope that this taxonomy sparks discussions and eventually allows the sharing of AI security incidents across organizations, enabling more secure AI.</description>

      <title>SoK: The Design Paradigm of Safe and Secure Defaults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In security engineering, including software security engineering, there is a well-known design paradigm telling to prefer safe and secure defaults. The paper presents a systematization of knowledge (SoK) of this paradigm by the means of a systematic mapping study and a scoping review of relevant literature. According to the mapping and review, the paradigm has been extensively discussed, used, and developed further since the late 1990s. Partially driven by the insecurity of the Internet of things, the volume of publications has accelerated from the circa mid-2010s onward. The publications reviewed indicate that the paradigm has been adopted in numerous different contexts. It has also been expanded with security design principles not originally considered when the paradigm was initiated in the mid-1970s. Among the newer principles are an "off by default" principle, various overriding and fallback principles, as well as those related to the zero trust model. The review also indicates problems developers and others have faced with the paradigm.</description>

      <title>Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned.
  Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment.
  In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger.
  It's important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.</description>

      <title>Permute-and-Flip: An optimally stable and watermarkable decoder for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new decoding method called Permute-and-Flip (PF) decoder. It enjoys stability properties similar to the standard sampling decoder, but is provably up to 2x better in its quality-stability tradeoff than sampling and never worse than any other decoder. We also design a cryptographic watermarking scheme analogous to Aaronson (2023)'s Gumbel watermark, but naturally tailored for PF decoder. The watermarking scheme does not change the distribution to sample, while allowing arbitrarily low false positive rate and high recall whenever the generated text has high entropy. Our experiments show that the PF decoder (and its watermarked counterpart) significantly outperform(s) naive sampling (and its Gumbel watermarked counterpart) in terms of perplexity, while retaining the same stability (and detectability), hence making it a promising new approach for LLM decoding.

      <title>Prompting Techniques for Secure Code Generation: A Systematic Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining momentum in software development with prompt-driven programming enabling developers to create code from natural language (NL) instructions. However, studies have questioned their ability to produce secure code and, thereby, the quality of prompt-generated software. Alongside, various prompting techniques that carefully tailor prompts have emerged to elicit optimal responses from LLMs. Still, the interplay between such prompting strategies and secure code generation remains under-explored and calls for further investigations. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigate the impact of different prompting techniques on the security of code generated from NL instructions by LLMs. METHOD: First we perform a systematic literature review to identify the existing prompting techniques that can be used for code generation tasks. A subset of these techniques are evaluated on GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models for secure code generation. For this, we used an existing dataset consisting of 150 NL security-relevant code-generation prompts. RESULTS: Our work (i) classifies potential prompting techniques for code generation (ii) adapts and evaluates a subset of the identified techniques for secure code generation tasks and (iii) observes a reduction in security weaknesses across the tested LLMs, especially after using an existing technique called Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI), contributing valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on LLM-generated code security.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Batch Size for Privately Finding Second-Order Stationary Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is a gap between finding a first-order stationary point (FOSP) and a second-order stationary point (SOSP) under differential privacy constraints, and it remains unclear whether privately finding an SOSP is more challenging than finding an FOSP. Specifically, Ganesh et al. (2023) claimed that an $\alpha$-SOSP can be found with $\alpha=O(\frac{1}{n^{1/3}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\epsilon})^{3/7})$, where $n$ is the dataset size, $d$ is the dimension, and $\epsilon$ is the differential privacy parameter. However, a recent analysis revealed an issue in their saddle point escape procedure, leading to weaker guarantees. Building on the SpiderBoost algorithm framework, we propose a new approach that uses adaptive batch sizes and incorporates the binary tree mechanism. Our method not only corrects this issue but also improves the results for privately finding an SOSP, achieving $\alpha=O(\frac{1}{n^{1/3}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\epsilon})^{1/2})$.
  This improved bound matches the state-of-the-art for finding a FOSP, suggesting that privately finding an SOSP may be achievable at no additional cost.</description>

      <title>Fall Leaf Adversarial Attack on Traffic Sign Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial input image perturbation attacks have emerged as a significant threat to machine learning algorithms, particularly in image classification setting. These attacks involve subtle perturbations to input images that cause neural networks to misclassify the input images, even though the images remain easily recognizable to humans. One critical area where adversarial attacks have been demonstrated is in automotive systems where traffic sign classification and recognition is critical, and where misclassified images can cause autonomous systems to take wrong actions. This work presents a new class of adversarial attacks. Unlike existing work that has focused on adversarial perturbations that leverage human-made artifacts to cause the perturbations, such as adding stickers, paint, or shining flashlights at traffic signs, this work leverages nature-made artifacts: tree leaves. By leveraging nature-made artifacts, the new class of attacks has plausible deniability: a fall leaf stuck to a street sign could come from a near-by tree, rather than be placed there by an malicious human attacker. To evaluate the new class of the adversarial input image perturbation attacks, this work analyses how fall leaves can cause misclassification in street signs. The work evaluates various leaves from different species of trees, and considers various parameters such as size, color due to tree leaf type, and rotation. The work demonstrates high success rate for misclassification. The work also explores the correlation between successful attacks and how they affect the edge detection, which is critical in many image classification algorithms.</description>
