      <title>An uniform lower bound for classical Kloosterman sums and an application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an elementary uniform lower bound for the classical Kloosterman sum $S(a,b;c)$ under the condition of its non-vanishing and $(ab,c)=1$, with $c$ being an odd integer. We then apply this lower bound for Kloosterman sums to derive an explicit lower bound in the Petersson's trace formula, subject to a pertinent condition. Consequently, we achieve a modified version of a theorem by Jung and Sardari, wherein the parameters $k$ and $N$ are permitted to vary independently.</description>

      <title>P-adic Poissonian Pair Correlations via the Monna Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the existence of sequences in the p-adic integers with Poissonian pair correlations has already been shown, no explicit examples had been found so far. In this note we discuss how to transfer real sequences with Poissonian pair correlations to the p-adic setting by making use of the Monna map.</description>

      <title>Mean Values of the auxiliary function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathop{\mathcal R}(s)$ be the function related to $\zeta(s)$ found by Siegel in the papers of Riemann. In this paper we obtain the main terms of the mean values \[\frac{1}{T}\int_0^T |\mathop{\mathcal R}(\sigma+it)|^2\Bigl(\frac{t}{2\pi}\Bigr)^\sigma\,dt, \quad\text{and}\quad \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T |\mathop{\mathcal R}(\sigma+it)|^2\,dt.\] Giving complete proofs of some result of the paper of Siegel about the Riemann Nachlass. Siegel follows Riemann to obtain these mean values. We have followed a more standard path, and explain the difficulties we encountered in understanding Siegel's reasoning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the distribution of the digital reverses of prime numbers, which we call the "reversed primes". We prove the infinitude of reversed primes in any arithmetic progression satisfying straightforward necessary conditions provided the base is sufficiently large. We indeed prove an effective Siegel--Walfisz type result for reversed primes, which has a larger admissible level of modulus than the classical case.</description>

      <title>AGZT-Lectures on formal multiple zeta values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formal multiple zeta values allow to study multiple zeta values by algebraic methods in a way that the open question about their transcendence is circumvented. In this note we show that Hoffman's basis conjecture for formal multiple zeta values is implied by the free odd generation conjecture for the double shuffle Lie algebra. We use the concept of a post-Lie structure for a convenient approach to the multiplication on the double shuffle group. From this, we get a coaction on the algebra of formal multiple zeta values. This in turn allows us to follow the proof of Brown's celebrated and unconditional theorem for the same result in the context of motivic multiple zeta values. We need the free odd generation conjecture twice: at first it gives a formula for the graded dimensions and secondly it is a key to derive a lift of the Zagier formula to the formal context.</description>

      <title>Euler factors of equivariant $L$--functions of Drinfeld modules and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{FGHP}, the first author and his collaborators proved an equivariant Tamagawa number formula for the special value at $s=0$ of a Goss--type $L$--function, equivariant with respect to a Galois group $G$, and associated to a Drinfeld module defined on $\Bbb F_q[t]$ and over a finite, integral extension of $\Bbb F_q[t]$. The formula in question was proved provided that the values at $0$ of the Euler factors of the equivariant $L$--function in question satisfy certain identities involving Fitting ideals of certain $G$--cohomologically trivial, finite $\Bbb F_q[t][G]$--modules associated to the Drinfeld module. In \cite{FGHP}, we prove these identities in the particular case of the Carlitz module. In this paper, we develop general techniques and prove the identities in question for arbitrary Drinfeld modules. Further, we indicate how these techniques can be extended to the more general case of higher dimensional abelian $t$--modules, which is relevant in the context of the proof of the equivariant Tamagawa number formula for abelian $t$--modules given by N. Green and the first author in \cite{Green-Popescu}. This paper is based on a lecture given by the first author at ICMAT Madrid in May 2023 and builds upon results obtained by the second author in his PhD thesis \cite{Ramachandran-thesis}.</description>

      <title>Can the quadratrix truly square the circle?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratrix received its name from the circle quadrature, squaring the circle, but it only solves it if completed by taking a limit, as pointed out already in antiquity. We ask if it can square the circle without limits and restrict its use accordingly, to converting ratios of angles and segments into each other. The problem is then translated into algebra by analogy to straightedge and compass constructions, and leads to an open question in transcendental number theory. In particular, Lindemann's impossibility result no longer suffices, and the answer depends on whether $\pi$ belongs to the analog of Ritt's exponential-logarithmic field with an algebraic base. We then derive that it does not from the well-known Schanuel conjecture. Thus, the quadratrix so restricted cannot square the circle after all.</description>

      <title>On unsolvable equations of prime degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kronecker observed that either all roots or only one root of a solvable irreducible equation of odd prime degree with integer coefficients are real. This gives a possibility to construct specific examples of equations not solvable by radicals. A relatively elementary proof without using the full power of Galois theory is due to Weber. We give a rather short proof of Kronecker's theorem with a slightly different argument from Weber's. Several modern presentations of Weber's proof contain inaccuracies, which can be traced back to an error in the original proof. We discuss this error and how it can be corrected.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Shimura lift of a Hekce eigenform multiplied by a theta series is the square of the form. We extend this result by generalizing the product to the Rankin-Cohen brackets. We prove that the Shimura lift of the Rankin-Cohen bracket of an eigenform and a theta series is given by the Rankin-Cohen bracket of the eigenform and itself.</description>

      <title>Eichler-Selberg relations for singular moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Eichler-Selberg trace formula expresses the trace of Hecke operators on spaces of cusp forms as weighted sums of Hurwitz-Kronecker class numbers. We extend this formula to a natural class of relations for traces of singular moduli, where one views class numbers as traces of the constant function $j_0(\tau)=1$. More generally, we consider the singular moduli for the Hecke system of modular functions \[ j_m(\tau) := mT_m \left(j(\tau)-744\right). \] For each $\nu\geq 0$ and $m\geq 1$, we obtain an Eichler-Selberg relation. For $\nu=0$ and $m\in \{1, 2\},$ these relations are Kaneko's celebrated singular moduli formulas for the coefficients of $j(\tau).$ For each $\nu\geq 1$ and $m\geq 1,$ we obtain a new Eichler-Selberg trace formula for the Hecke action on the space of weight $2\nu+2$ cusp forms, where the traces of $j_m(\tau)$ singular moduli replace Hurwitz-Kronecker class numbers. These formulas involve a new term that is assembled from values of symmetrized shifted convolution $L$-functions.</description>

      <title>Isolated and parameterized points on curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a self-contained introduction to isolated points on curves and their counterpoint, parameterized points, that situates these concepts within the study of the arithmetic of curves. In particular, we show how natural geometric constructions of infinitely many degree $d$ points on curves motivate the definitions of $\mathbb{P}^1$- and AV-parameterized points and explain how a result of Faltings implies that there are only finitely many isolated points on any curve. We use parameterized points to deduce properties of the density degree set and review how the minimum density degree relates to the gonality. The paper includes several examples that illustrate the possible behaviors of degree $d$ points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite extension $F$ of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and $n \geq 1$, let $D$ be the division algebra over $F$ of invariant $1/n$ and let $G^0$ be the subgroup of $\text{GL}_n(F)$ of elements with norm $1$ determinant. We show that the action of $D^\times$ on the Drinfeld tower induces an equivalence of categories from finite dimensional smooth representations of $D^\times$ to $G^0$-finite $\text{GL}_n(F)$-equivariant vector bundles with connection on $\Omega$, the $(n-1)$-dimensional Drinfeld symmetric space.</description>

      <title>An extension of Gauss's arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) to three variables iteration scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauss's arithmetic-geometric mean (AGM) which is described by two variables iteration $(a_n, b_n)\rightarrow (a_{n+1}, b_{n+1})$ by $a_{n+1}=(a_n+b_n)/2,\ b_{n+1}=\sqrt{a_nb_n}$. We extend it to three variables iteration $(a_n, b_n, c_n)\rightarrow (a_{n+1}, b_{n+1}, c_{n+1})$ which reduces to Gauss's AGM when $c_0=0$. Our iteration starting from $a_0&gt;b_0&gt;c_0&gt;0$ with further restriction $a_0&gt;b_0+c_0$ converges to $a_\infty=b_\infty=M(a_0, b_0, c_0)$ and $c_\infty=0$. The limit $M(a_0, b_0, c_0)$ is expressed by Appell's hyper-geometric function $F_1(1/2, \{1/2, 1/2\}, 1; \kappa, \lambda)$ of two variables $(\kappa, \lambda)$ which are determined by $(a_0, b_0, c_0)$. A relation between two hyper-geometric functions (Gauss's and Appell's) is found as a by-product.</description>

      <title>Achirality of Sol 3-Manifolds, Stevenhagen Conjecture and Shimizu's L-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A closed orientable manifold is {\em achiral} if it admits an orientation reversing homeomorphism. A commensurable class of closed manifolds is achiral if it contains an achiral element, or equivalently, each manifold in $\CM$ has an achiral finite cover.
  Each commensurable class containing non-orientable elements must be achiral.
  It is natural to wonder how many
  commensurable classes are achiral and how many achiral classes have non-orientable elements.
  We study this problem for Sol 3-manifolds. Each commensurable class $\CM$ of Sol 3-manifold has a complete topological invariant $D_{\CM}$, the discriminant of $\CM$. Our main result is:
  (1) Among all commensurable classes of Sol 3-manifolds, there are infinitely many achiral classes; however ordered by discriminants, the density of achiral commensurable classes is 0.
  (2) Among all achiral commensurable classes of Sol 3-manifolds, ordered by discriminants, the density of classes containing non-orientable elements is $1-\rho$,
  where $$\rho:=\prod_{j=1}^\infty \left(1+2^{-j}\right)^{-1} = 0.41942\cdots.$$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we prove that for all primes $p\not=2,3$, the Ramanujan vector field has an invariant algebraic curve and then we give a moduli space interpretation of this curve in terms of Cartier operator acting on the de Rham cohomology of elliptic curves. The main ingredients of our study are due to Serre, Swinnerton-Dyer and Katz in 1973. We aim to generalize this for the theory of Calabi-Yau modular forms, which includes the generating function of genus $g$ Gromov-Witten invariants. The integrality of $q$-expansions of such modular forms is still a main conjecture which has been only established for special Calabi-Yau varieties, for instance those whose periods are hypergeometric functions. For this the main tools are Dwork's theorem. We present an alternative project which aims to prove such integralities using modular vector fields and Gauss-Manin connection in positive characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $P,Q$ be standard parabolic subgroups of a $p$-adic reductive group $G$. We study the smooth dual of the filtration on a parabolically induced module arising from the geometric lemma associated to the cosets $P\setminus G/Q$. We prove that the dual filtration coincides with the filtration associated to the cosets $P\setminus G/Q^-$ via the Bernstein-Casselman canonical pairing from the second adjointness of parabolic induction. This result generalizes a result of Bezrukavnikov-Kazhdan on the explicit description in the second adjointness. Along the way, we also study some group theoretic results.</description>

      <title>On Ginzburg-Kaplan gamma factors and Bessel-Speh functions for finite general linear groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a new construction of tensor product gamma factors for a pair of irreducible representations of $\operatorname{GL}_c\left(\mathbb{F}_q\right)$ and $\operatorname{GL}_k\left(\mathbb{F}_q\right)$. This construction is a finite field analog of a construction of doubling type due to Kaplan in the local field case and due to Ginzburg in the global case, and it only assumes that one of the representations in question is generic. We use this construction to establish a relation between special values of Bessel functions attached to Speh representations and exotic matrix Kloosterman sums. Using this relation, we establish various identities, including the multiplicativity identity of exotic matrix Kloosterman sums.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a natural birational invariant for varieties over finite fields and show that its vanishing on projective space is equivalent to the Tate conjecture, the Beilinson conjecture, and the Grothendieck--Serre semi-simplicity conjecture for all smooth projective varieties over finite fields. We further show that the Tate, Beilinson, and 1-semi-simplicity conjecture in half of the degrees implies those conjectures in all degrees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1501.04519v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $L$ be a number field and let $E/L$ be an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$ of an imaginary quadratic field $K$. We use class field theory and results of Skorobogatov and Zarhin to compute the transcendental part of the Brauer group of the abelian surface $E\times E$. The results for the odd order torsion also apply to the Brauer group of the K3 surface $\textrm{Kum}(E\times E)$. We describe explicitly the elliptic curves $E/\mathbb{Q}$ with complex multiplication by $\mathcal{O}_K$ such that the Brauer group of $E\times E$ contains a transcendental element of odd order. We show that such an element gives rise to a Brauer-Manin obstruction to weak approximation on $\textrm{Kum}(E\times E)$, while there is no obstruction coming from the algebraic part of the Brauer group.</description>

      <title>Schertz style class invariants for higher degree CM fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:1610.04505v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Special values of Siegel modular functions for $\operatorname{Sp} (\mathbb{Z})$ generate class fields of CM fields. They also yield abelian varieties with a known endomorphism ring. Smaller alternative values of modular functions that lie in the same class fields (class invariants) thus help to speed up the computation of those mathematical objects.
  We show that modular functions for the subgroup $\Gamma^0 (N)\subseteq \operatorname{Sp}(\mathbb{Z})$ yield class invariants under some splitting conditions on $N$, generalising results due to Schertz from classical modular functions to Siegel modular functions. We show how to obtain all Galois conjugates of a class invariant by evaluating the same modular function in CM period matrices derived from an \emph{$N$-system}. Such a system consists of quadratic polynomials with coefficients in the real-quadratic subfield satisfying certain congruence conditions modulo $N$. We also examine conditions under which the minimal polynomial of a class invariant is real.
  Examples show that we may obtain class invariants that are much smaller than in previous constructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.01874v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first author and Bump defined Schubert Eisenstein series by restricting the summation in a degenerate Eisenstein series to a particular Schubert variety. In the case of $\mathrm{GL}_3$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ they proved that these Schubert Eisenstein series have meromorphic continuations in all parameters and conjectured the same is true in general. We revisit their conjecture and relate it to the program of Braverman, Kazhdan, Lafforgue, Ng\^o, and Sakellaridis aimed at establishing generalizations of the Poisson summation formula. We prove the Poisson summation formula for certain schemes closely related to Schubert varieties and use it to refine and establish the conjecture of the first author and Bump in many cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.08205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the moments of the trace of Frobenius of elliptic curves if the trace is restricted to a fixed arithmetic progression. We determine the asymptotic behavior for the ratio of the $(2k+1)$-th moment to the zeroeth moment as the size of the finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^r}$ goes to infinity. These results follow from similar asymptotic formulas relating sums and moments of Hurwitz class numbers where the sums are restricted to certain arithmetic progressions. As an application, we prove that the distribution of the trace of Frobenius in arithmetic progressions is equidistributed with respect to the Sato--Tate measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Narayana's sequence is a ternary recurrent sequence defined by the recurrence relation $\mathcal{N}_n=\mathcal{N}_{n-1}+\mathcal{N}_{n-3}$ with initial terms $\mathcal{N}_0=0$ and $\mathcal{N}_1=\mathcal{N}_2=\mathcal{N}_3=1$. Let $\rho\geqslant2$ be a positive integer. In this study, it is proved that the $n$th Narayana's number $ \mathcal{N}_n$ which is concatenations of three repdigits in base $\rho$ satisfies $n&lt;5.6\cdot 10^{48}\cdot \log^7\rho$. Moreover, it is shown that the largest Narayana's number which is concatenations of three repdigits in base $\rho$ with $1 \leqslant \rho \leqslant 10$ is $58425=\mathcal{N}_{31}=\overline{3332200}_5=\overline{332223}_7.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the integral canonical model $\mathscr{S}_{\mathsf{K}^p}$ of a Shimura variety $\mathrm{Sh}_{\mathsf{K}_0\mathsf{K}^p}(\mathbf{G},\mathbf{X})$ of abelian type at hyperspecial level $K_0=\mathcal{G}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$, we construct a prismatic $F$-gauge model for the `universal' $\mathcal{G}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$-local system on $\mathrm{Sh}_{\mathsf{K}_0\mathsf{K}^p}(\mathbf{G},\mathbf{X})$. We use this to obtain new $p$-adic information about these Shimura varieties, notably an abelian-type analogue of the Serre--Tate theorem (realizing an expectation of Drinfeld in the abelian-type case) and a prismatic characterization of these models. To do this, we make several advances in integral $p$-adic Hodge theory, notably the development of an integral analogue of the functor $D_{\mathrm{crys}}$.</description>

Abstract: We construct Rankin-Cohen type differential operators on Hermitian modular forms of signature $(n,n)$. The bilinear differential operators given here specialize to the original Rankin-Cohen operators in the case $n=1$, and more generally satisfy some analogous properties, including uniqueness. Our approach builds on previous work by Eholzer-Ibukiyama in the case of Siegel modular forms, together with results of Kashiwara-Vergne on the representation theory of unitary groups.</description>

Abstract: In 1797, Pfaff gave a simple proof of a ${}_3F_2$ hypergeometric series summation formula which was much later reproved by Andrews in 1996. In the same paper, Andrews also proved other well-known hypergeometric identities using Pfaff's method. In this paper, we prove a number of terminating $q$-hypergeometric series-product identities using Pfaff's method thereby providing a detailed account of its wide applicability.</description>

      <title>Moduli of hybrid curves I: Variations of canonical measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2007.07130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The present paper is the first in a series devoted to the study of asymptotic geometry of Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces.
  We introduce the moduli space of hybrid curves as a new compactification of the moduli space of curves, refining the one obtained by Deligne and Mumford. This is the moduli space for multiscale geometric objects which mix complex and higher rank tropical and non-Archimedean geometries, reflecting both discrete and continuous features.
  We define canonical measures on hybrid curves which combine and generalize Arakelov-Bergman measures on Riemann surfaces and Zhang measures on metric graphs.
  We then show that the universal family of canonically measured hybrid curves over this moduli space varies continuously. This provides a precise link between the non-Archimedean Zhang measure and variations of Arakelov-Bergman measures in families of Riemann surfaces, answering a question which has been open since the pioneering work of Zhang on admissible pairing in the nineties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A dominant rational self-map on a projective variety is called $p$-cohomologically hyperbolic if the $p$-th dynamical degree is strictly larger than other dynamical degrees. For such a map defined over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$, we study lower bounds of the arithmetic degrees, existence of points with Zariski dense orbit, and finiteness of preperiodic points. In particular, we prove that, if $f$ is an $1$-cohomologically hyperbolic map on a smooth projective variety, then (1) the arithmetic degree of a $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-point with generic $f$-orbit is equal to the first dynamical degree of $f$; and (2) there are $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-points with generic $f$-orbit. Applying our theorem to the recently constructed rational map with transcendental dynamical degree, we confirm that the arithmetic degree can be transcendental.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the twofold semidirect product of two skew left braces, in which both the additive and multiplicative groups are semidirect products of the corresponding groups of the given skew left braces. We consider an odd prime $p$ and an integer $n$ satisfying $p\nmid n$, $p\nmid|\mathrm{Aut}(E)|$ for every group $E$ of order $n$ and such that each group of order $np$ has a unique $p$-Sylow subgroup. Under these conditions, we prove that any skew left brace of size $np$ is either a twofold semidirect product of the trivial brace of size $p$ and a skew brace of size $n$ or a companion skew brace of that one. We develop an algorithm to obtain all skew braces of size $np$ from the braces of size $n$ and provide a formula to count them. We use this result to describe all braces of size $12p$ for $p\geq 7$, which proves a conjecture of V.G. Bardakov, M.V. Neshchadim and M.K. Yadav.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13213v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $q$ be an odd power of a prime $p$, and $S \subset \mathbb{F}_q^*$ such that $S=-S$ and $S/S \neq \mathbb{F}_q^*$. We show that the clique number of the Cayley graph $\operatorname{Cay}(\mathbb{F}_q^+,S)$ is at most $\sqrt{|S/S|}+\sqrt{q/p}$, improving the best-known $\sqrt{q}$ upper bound for many families of such graphs substantially. Such a new bound is strongest for cyclotomic graphs and in particular, it implies the first nontrivial upper bound on the clique number of all generalized Paley graphs of non-square order, extending the work of Hanson and Pertidis. Moreover, our new bound is asymptotically sharp for an infinite family of generalized Paley graphs, and we further discover the first nontrivial family among them for which the clique number can be exactly determined. We also obtain a new lower bound on the number of directions determined by a large Cartesian product in the affine Galois plane $AG(2,q)$, which is sharp for infinite families.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures on p-adic Lie groups: the p-adic quaternion algebra and the Haar integral on the p-adic rotation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a general expression of the Haar measure $-$ that is, the essentially unique translation-invariant measure $-$ on a $p$-adic Lie group. We then argue that this measure can be regarded as the measure naturally induced by the invariant volume form on the group, as it happens for a standard Lie group over the reals. As an important application, we next consider the problem of determining the Haar measure on the $p$-adic special orthogonal groups in dimension two, three and four (for every prime number $p$). In particular, the Haar measure on $\mathrm{SO}(2,\mathbb{Q}_p)$ is obtained by a direct application of our general formula. As for $\mathrm{SO}(3,\mathbb{Q}_p)$ and $\mathrm{SO}(4,\mathbb{Q}_p)$, instead, we show that Haar integrals on these two groups can conveniently be lifted to Haar integrals on certain $p$-adic Lie groups from which the special orthogonal groups are obtained as quotients. This construction involves a suitable quaternion algebra over the field $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and is reminiscent of the quaternionic realization of the real rotation groups. Our results should pave the way to the development of harmonic analysis on the $p$-adic special orthogonal groups, with potential applications in $p$-adic quantum mechanics and in the recently proposed $p$-adic quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic products of binomial and multinomial coefficients revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we consider asymptotic products of binomial and multinomial coefficients and determine their asymptotic constants and formulas. Among them, special cases are the central binomial coefficients, the related Catalan numbers, and binomial coefficients in a row of Pascal's triangle. For the latter case, we show that it can also be derived from a limiting case of products of binomial coefficients over the rows. The asymptotic constants are expressed by known constants, for example, the Glaisher-Kinkelin constant. In addition, the constants lie in certain intervals that we determine precisely. Subsequently, we revisit a related result of Hirschhorn and clarify the given numerical constant by showing the exact expression.</description>

      <title>On the $v$-Picard group of Stein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the image of the Hodge-Tate logarithm map (in any cohomological degree), defined by Heuer, in the case of smooth Stein varieties. Heuer, motivated by the computations for the affine space of any dimension, raised the question whether this image is always equal to the group of closed differential forms. We show that it indeed always contains such forms but the quotient can be non-trivial: it contains a slightly mysterious $Z_p$-module that maps, via the Bloch-Kato exponential map, to integral classes in the pro-\'etale cohomology. This quotient is already non-trivial for open unit discs of dimension strictly greater than $1$.</description>

      <title>Characterising the Haar measure on the $p$-adic rotation groups via inverse limits of measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the Haar measure on the compact $p$-adic special orthogonal groups of rotations $\mathrm{SO}(d)_p$ in dimension $d=2,3$, by exploiting the machinery of inverse limits of measure spaces, for every prime $p&gt;2$. We characterise $\mathrm{SO}(d)_p$ as inverse limits of finite groups, of which we provide parametrisations and orders, together with an equivalent description through a multivariable Hensel lifting. Supplying these finite groups with their normalised counting measures, we get an inverse family of Haar measure spaces for each $\mathrm{SO}(d)_p$. Finally, we constructively prove the existence of the so-called inverse limit measure of these inverse families, which is explicitly computable, and prove that it gives the Haar measure on $\mathrm{SO}(d)_p$. Our results pave the way towards the study of the irreducible projective unitary representations of the $p$-adic rotation groups, with potential applications to the recently proposed $p$-adic quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>Extension of Bressoud's generalization of Borwein's conjecture and some exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we conjecture an extension to Bressoud's 1996 generalization of Borwein's famous 1990 conjecture. We then state a few infinite hierarchies of non-negative $q$-series identities which are interesting examples of our proposed conjecture and Bressoud's generalized conjecture. Finally, using certain positivity-preserving transformations for $q$-binomial coefficients, we prove the non-negativity of the infinite families.</description>

      <title>On the enhanced Shahidi conjecture and global applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, applying the intersection theory of local Arthur packets, for symplectic and split odd special orthogonal groups G_n, we give the first complete proof of the enhanced Shahidi conjecture on generic representations in local Arthur packets. We also classify unramified representations of Arthur type for G_n, and show that they lie in exactly one local Arthur packet, which is anti-generic. Then, we discuss the global applications of these results.</description>

      <title>Topological Applications of p-Adic Divergence and Gradient Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: $p$-Adic divergence and gradient operators are constructed giving rise to $p$-adic vertex Laplacian operators used by Z\'u\~niga in order to study Turing patterns on graphs, as well as their edge Laplacian counterparts. It is shown that the Euler characteristic of a finite graph can be expressed via traces of certain heat kernels associated with these new operators. This result is applied to the extraction of topological information from Mumford curves via heat kernels.</description>
