      <title>Real-time edge dynamics of non-Hermitian lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic forms of the Green's function at the open edges of general non-Hermitian band systems in all dimensions in the long-time limit, using a modified saddle-point approximation and the analytic continuation of the momentum. The edge dynamics is determined by the "dominant saddle point", a complex momentum, which, contrary to previous conjectures, may lie outside the generalized Brillouin zone. From this result, we obtain the effective edge Hamiltonians that evidently, as demonstrated by extensive numerical simulations, characterize the dynamics on the edges, and can be probed in real-time experiments or spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of angular momentum transfer among crystal lattice modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrete rotational symmetry of crystals leads to the conservation of quantized angular momentum in solids. While the exchange of energy and linear momentum between lattice vibrations (phonons) via anharmonic coupling is a cornerstone of solid-state physics, conservation and transfer of angular momentum within the lattice remains a postulate. Recently, phonon angular momentum, often in the form of chiral phonons, has been linked to giant magnetic fields, thermal Hall conductivity, dynamical multiferroicity, ultrafast demagnetization, or magnetic switching. However, the inherent process of phonon to phonon angular momentum transfer, fundamentally required to reach any magnetization equilibrium and imperative for all spin relaxation phenomena in solids, remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate the coherent transfer of angular momentum from one lattice mode to another by establishing helical nonlinear phononics. We directly observe rotational phonon-phonon Umklapp scattering dictated by pseudo angular momentum conservation and the threefold rotational symmetry of the topological insulator bismuth selenide. We identify nonlinear phonon-phonon coupling as an angular momentum transfer channel, confirmed by our ab-initio calculations. Besides bearing universal implications for angular momentum dissipation abundant in nature, our work actively reverses the natural flow, leading to the nonlinear upconversion of lattice angular momentum. We thus open the field of helical and chiral nonlinear phononics, representing a selective handle for ultrafast control of spins, topology and chiral quasi-particles.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of Special-Unitary Operations in Classical Mechanics by Non-Adiabatic Evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Artificial classical wave systems such as wave crystals and metamaterials have demonstrated promising capabilities in simulating a wide range of quantum mechanical phenomena. Yet some gaps between quantum and classical worlds are generally considered fundamental and difficult to bridge. Dynamics obeying special unitary groups, e.g., electronic spins described by SU(2), color symmetries of fundamental particles described by SU(3), are such examples. In this work, we present the experimental realization of universal SU(2) and SU(3) dynamic operations in classical mechanical oscillator systems with temporally modulated coupling terms. Our approach relies on the sequential execution of non-adiabatic holonomic evolutions, which are typically used in constructing quantum-logic gates. The method is swift and purely geometric and can be extended to realize more sophisticated dynamic operations. Our results open a new way for studying and simulating quantum phenomena in classical systems.</description>
