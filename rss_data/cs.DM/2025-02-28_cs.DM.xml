      <title>On Piecewise Affine Reachability with Bellman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A piecewise affine map is one of the simplest mathematical objects exhibiting complex dynamics. The reachability problem of piecewise affine maps is given as follows: Given two vectors $\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{t} \in \mathbb{Q}^d$ and a piecewise affine map $f$, is there $n\in \mathbb{N}$ such that $f^{n}(\mathbf{s}) = \mathbf{t}$? Koiran, Cosnard, and Garzon show that the reachability problem of piecewise affine maps is undecidable even in dimension 2.
  Most of the recent progress has been focused on decision procedures for one-dimensional piecewise affine maps, where the reachability problem has been shown to be decidable for some subclasses. However, the general undecidability discouraged research into positive results in arbitrary dimension.
  In this work, we consider a rich subclass of piecewise affine maps defined by Bellman operators of Markov decision processes (MDPs). We then investigate the restriction of the piecewise affine reachability problem to that with Bellman operators and, in particular, its decidability in any dimension. As one of our primary contributions, we establish the decidability of reachability for two-dimensional Bellman operators, in contrast to the negative result known for general piecewise affine maps.</description>

      <title>Computational Complexity of Covering Colored Mixed Multigraphs with Simple Degree Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of graph covers (also referred to as locally bijective homomorphisms) plays an important role in topological graph theory and has found its computer science applications in models of local computation. For a fixed target graph $H$, the {\sc $H$-Cover} problem asks if an input graph $G$ allows a graph covering projection onto $H$. Despite the fact that the quest for characterizing the computational complexity of {\sc $H$-Cover} had been started more than 30 years ago, only a handful of general results have been known so far.
  In this paper, we present a complete characterization of the computational complexity of covering coloured graphs for the case that every equivalence class in the degree partition of the target graph has at most two vertices. We prove this result in a very general form. Following the lines of current development of topological graph theory, we study graphs in the most relaxed sense of the definition. In particular, we consider graphs that are mixed (they may have both directed and undirected edges), may have multiple edges, loops, and semi-edges. We show that a strong P/NP-complete dichotomy holds true in the sense that for each such fixed target graph $H$, the {\sc $H$-Cover} problem is either polynomial-time solvable for arbitrary inputs, or NP-complete even for simple input graphs.</description>

      <title>Solving Maker-Breaker Games on 5-uniform hypergraphs is PSPACE-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X, \mathcal{F})$ be a hypergraph. The Maker-Breaker game on $(X, \mathcal{F})$ is a combinatorial game between two players, Maker and Breaker. Beginning with Maker, the players take turns claiming vertices from $X$ that have not yet been claimed. Maker wins if she manages to claim all vertices of some hyperedge $F \in \mathcal{F}$. Breaker wins if he claims at least one vertex in every hyperedge.
  M. L. Rahman and Thomas Watson proved in 2021 that, even when only Maker-Breaker games on 6-uniform hypergraphs are considered, the decision problem of determining which player has a winning strategy is PSPACE-complete. They also showed that the problem is NL-hard when considering hypergraphs of rank 5.
  In this paper, we improve the latter result by showing that deciding who wins Maker-Breaker games on 5-uniform hypergraphs is still a PSPACE-complete problem. We achieve this by polynomial transformation from the problem of solving the generalized geography game on bipartite digraphs with vertex degrees 3 or less, which is known to be PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>Independent transversal blow-up of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In an $r$-partite graph, an independent transversal of size $s$ (ITS) consists of $s$ vertices from each part forming an independent set. Motivated by a question from Bollob\'as, Erd\H{o}s, and Szemer\'edi (1975), Di Braccio and Illingworth (2024) inquired about the minimum degree needed to ensure an $n \times \cdots \times n$ $r$-partite graph contains $K_r(s)$, a complete $r$-partite graph with $s$ vertices in each part. We reformulate this as finding the smallest $n$ such that any $n \times \cdots \times n$ $r$-partite graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ has an ITS. For any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we prove the existence of a $\gamma&gt;0$ ensuring that if $G$ is a multipartite graph partitioned as $(V_1, V_2, \ldots, V_r)$, where the average degree of each part $V_i$ is at most $D$, the maximum degree of any vertex to any part $V_i$ is at most $\gamma D$, and the size of each part $V_i$ is at least $(s + \varepsilon)D$, then $G$ possesses an ITS. The constraint $(s + \varepsilon)D$ on the part size is tight. This extends results of Loh and Sudakov (2007), Glock and Sudakov (2022), and Kang and Kelly (2022). We also show that any $n \times \cdots \times n$ $r$-partite graph with minimum degree at least $\left(r-1-\frac{1}{2s^2}\right)n$ contains $K_r(s)$ and provide a relative Tur\'an-type result. Additionally, this paper explores counting ITSs in multipartite graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An upward (resp.~downward) digitally convex word is a binary word that best approximates from below (resp.~from above) an upward (resp.~downward) convex curve in the plane. We study these words from the combinatorial point of view, formalizing their geometrical properties and highlighting connections with Christoffel words and finite Sturmian words. In particular, we study from the combinatorial perspective the operations of inflation and deflation on digitally convex words.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Machine Learning: Learning as computing an algebraic decomposition of a task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistics and Optimization are foundational to modern Machine Learning. Here, we propose an alternative foundation based on Abstract Algebra, with mathematics that facilitates the analysis of learning. In this approach, the goal of the task and the data are encoded as axioms of an algebra, and a model is obtained where only these axioms and their logical consequences hold. Although this is not a generalizing model, we show that selecting specific subsets of its breakdown into algebraic atoms obtained via subdirect decomposition gives a model that generalizes. We validate this new learning principle on standard datasets such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, and medical images, achieving performance comparable to optimized multilayer perceptrons. Beyond data-driven tasks, the new learning principle extends to formal problems, such as finding Hamiltonian cycles from their specifications and without relying on search. This algebraic foundation offers a fresh perspective on machine intelligence, featuring direct learning from training data without the need for validation dataset, scaling through model additivity, and asymptotic convergence to the underlying rule in the data.</description>

      <title>On coarse tree decompositions and coarse balanced separators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that there is a linear dependence between the treewidth of a graph and its balanced separator number: the smallest integer $k$ such that for every weighing of the vertices, the graph admits a balanced separator of size at most $k$. We investigate whether this connection can be lifted to the setting of coarse graph theory, where both the bags of the considered tree decompositions and the considered separators should be coverable by a bounded number of bounded-radius balls.
  As the first result, we prove that if an $n$-vertex graph $G$ admits balanced separators coverable by $k$ balls of radius $r$, then $G$ also admits tree decompositions ${\cal T}_1$ and ${\cal T}_2$ such that:
  - in ${\cal T}_1$, every bag can be covered by $O(k\log n)$ balls of radius $r$; and
  - in ${\cal T}_2$, every bag can be covered by $O(k^2\log k)$ balls of radius $r(\log k+\log\log n+O(1))$.
  As the second result, we show that if we additionally assume that $G$ has doubling dimension at most $m$, then the functional equivalence between the existence of small balanced separators and of tree decompositions of small width can be fully lifted to the coarse setting. Precisely, we prove that for a positive integer $r$ and a graph $G$ of doubling dimension at most $m$, the following conditions are equivalent, with constants $k_1,k_2,k_3,k_4,\Delta_3,\Delta_4$ depending on each other and on $m$:
  - $G$ admits balanced separators consisting of $k_1$ balls of radius $r$;
  - $G$ has a tree decomposition with bags coverable by $k_2$ balls of radius $r$;
  - $G$ has a tree-partition of maximum degree $\leq \Delta_3$ with bags coverable by $k_3$ balls of radius $r$;
  - $G$ is quasi-isometric to a graph of maximum degree $\leq \Delta_4$ and tree-partition width $\leq k_4$.</description>

      <title>Computing Hamiltonian Paths with Partial Order Restrictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When solving the Hamiltonian path problem it seems natural to be given additional precedence constraints for the order in which the vertices are visited. For example one could decide whether a Hamiltonian path exists for a fixed starting point, or that some vertices are visited before another vertex. We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path that observes all precedence constraints given in a partial order on the vertex set. We show that this problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete even if restricted to complete bipartite graphs and posets of height 2. In contrast, for posets of width $k$ there is a known $\mathcal{O}(k^2 n^k)$ algorithm for arbitrary graphs with $n$ vertices. We show that it is unlikely that the running time of this algorithm can be improved significantly, i.e., there is no $f(k) n^{o(k)}$ time algorithm under the assumption of the Exponential Time Hypothesis. Furthermore, for the class of outerplanar graphs, we give an $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ algorithm for arbitrary posets.</description>

      <title>Coloring bridge-free antiprismatic graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coloring problem is a well-research topic and its complexity is known for several classes of graphs. However, the question of its complexity remains open for the class of antiprismatic graphs, which are the complement of prismatic graphs and one of the four remaining cases highlighted by Lozin and Malishev. In this article we focus on the equivalent question of the complexity of the clique cover problem in prismatic graphs.
  A graph $G$ is prismatic if for every triangle $T$ of $G$, every vertex of $G$ not in $T$ has a unique neighbor in $T$. A graph is co-bridge-free if it has no $C_4+2K_1$ as induced subgraph. We give a polynomial time algorithm that solves the clique cover problem in co-bridge-free prismatic graphs. It relies on the structural description given by Chudnovsky and Seymour, and on later work of Preissmann, Robin and Trotignon.
  We show that co-bridge-free prismatic graphs have a bounded number of disjoint triangles and that implies that the algorithm presented by Preissmann et al. applies.</description>

      <title>Variable degeneracy on toroidal graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:1907.07141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DP-coloring was introduced by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle as a generalization of list coloring and signed coloring. A new coloring, strictly $f$-degenerate transversal, is a further generalization of DP-coloring and $L$-forested-coloring. In this paper, we present some structural results on planar and toroidal graphs with forbidden configurations, and establish some sufficient conditions for the existence of strictly $f$-degenerate transversal based on these structural results. Consequently, (i) every toroidal graph without subgraphs isomorphic to the configurations in Fig.2 is DP-$4$-colorable, and has list vertex arboricity at most $2$, (ii) every toroidal graph without $4$-cycles is DP-$4$-colorable, and has list vertex arboricity at most $2$, (iii) every planar graph without subgraphs isomorphic to the configurations in Fig.3 is DP-$4$-colorable, and has list vertex arboricity at most $2$. These results improve upon previous results on DP-$4$-coloring [Discrete Math. 341~(7) (2018) 1983--1986; Bull. Malays. Math. Sci. Soc. 43~(3) (2020) 2271--2285] and (list) vertex arboricity [Discrete Math. 333 (2014) 101--105; Int. J. Math. Stat. 16~(1) (2015) 97--105; Iranian Math. Soc. 42~(5) (2016) 1293--1303].</description>

      <title>Instability of backoff protocols with arbitrary arrival rates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.17144v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contention resolution, multiple processors are trying to coordinate to send discrete messages through a shared channel with limited communication. If two processors send at the same time, the messages collide and are not transmitted successfully. Queue-free backoff protocols are an important special case - for example, Google Drive and AWS instruct their users to implement binary exponential backoff to handle busy periods. It is a long-standing conjecture of Aldous (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 1987) that no stable backoff protocols exist for any positive arrival rate of processors. This foundational question remains open; instability is only known in general when the arrival rate of processors is at least 0.42 (Goldberg et al. SICOMP 2004). We prove Aldous' conjecture for all backoff protocols outside of a tightly-constrained special case using a new domination technique to get around the main difficulty, which is the strong dependencies between messages.</description>

      <title>Reachability in Restricted Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The popularity of molecular computation has given rise to several models of abstraction, one of the more recent ones being Chemical Reaction Networks (CRNs). These are equivalent to other popular computational models, such as Vector Addition Systems and Petri-Nets, and restricted versions are equivalent to Population Protocols. This paper continues the work on core \emph{reachability} questions related to Chemical Reaction Networks; given two configurations, can one reach the other according to the system's rules? With no restrictions, reachability was recently shown to be Ackermann-complete, which resolved a decades-old problem.
  In this work, we fully characterize monotone reachability problems based on various restrictions such as the allowed rule size, the number of rules that may create a species ($k$-source), the number of rules that may consume a species ($k$-consuming), the volume, and whether the rules have an acyclic production order (\emph{feed-forward}). We show PSPACE-completeness of reachability with only bimolecular reactions in two-source and two-consuming rules. This proves hardness of reachability in a restricted form of Population Protocols. This is accomplished using new techniques within the motion planning framework.
  We give several important results for feed-forward CRNs, where rules are single-source or single-consuming. We show that reachability is solvable in polynomial time as long as the system does not contain special \emph{void} or \emph{autogenesis} rules. We then fully characterize all systems of this type and show that with void/autogenesis rules, or more than one source and one consuming, the problems become NP-complete. Finally, we show several interesting special cases of CRNs based on these restrictions or slight relaxations and note future significant open questions related to this taxonomy.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics on words and generating Dirichlet series of automatic sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13524v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating series are crucial in enumerative combinatorics, analytic combinatorics, and combinatorics on words. Though it might seem at first view that generating Dirichlet series are less used in these fields than ordinary and exponential generating series, there are many notable papers where they play a fundamental role, as can be seen in particular in the work of Flajolet and several of his co-authors. In this paper, we study Dirichlet series of integers with missing digits or blocks of digits in some integer base $b$; i.e., where the summation ranges over the integers whose expansions form some language strictly included in the set of all words over the alphabet $\{0, 1, \dots, b-1\}$ that do not begin with a $0$. We show how to unify and extend results proved by Nathanson in 2021 and by K\"ohler and Spilker in 2009. En route, we encounter several sequences from Sloane's On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences, as well as some famous $b$-automatic sequences or $b$-regular sequences. We also consider a specific sequence that is not $b$-regular.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be a field, and consider the hypercube $\{ 0, 1 \}^{n}$ in $\mathbb{F}^{n}$. Sziklai and Weiner (Journal of Combinatorial Theory, Series A 2022) showed that if a polynomial $P ( X_{1}, \dots, X_{n} ) \in \mathbb{F}[ X_{1}, \dots, X_{n}]$ vanishes on every point of the hypercube $\{0,1\}^{n}$ except those with at most $r$ many ones then the degree of the polynomial will be at least $n-r$. This is a generalization of Alon and F\"uredi's fundamental result (European Journal of Combinatorics 1993) about polynomials vanishing on every point of the hypercube except at the origin (point with all zero coordinates). Sziklai and Weiner proved their interesting result using M\"{o}bius inversion formula and the Zeilberger method for proving binomial equalities. In this short note, we show that a stronger version of Sziklai and Weiner's result can be derived directly from Alon and F\"{u}redi's result.</description>
