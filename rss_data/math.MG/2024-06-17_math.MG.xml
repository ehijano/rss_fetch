      <title>Steiner symmetrization on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce a generalization of Steiner symmetrization in Euclidean space for spherical space, which is the dual of the Steiner symmetrization in hyperbolic space introduced by Peyerimhoff (J. London Math. Soc. (2) 66: 753-768, 2002). We show that this symmetrization preserves volume in every dimension, and convexity in the spherical plane, but not in dimensions $n &gt; 2$. In addition, we investigate the monotonicity properties of the perimeter and diameter of a set under this process, and find conditions under which the image of a spherically convex disk under a suitable sequence of Steiner symmetrizations converges to a spherical cap. We apply our results to prove a spherical analogue of a theorem of Sas, and to confirm a conjecture of Besau and Werner (Adv. Math. 301: 867-901, 2016) for centrally symmetric spherically convex disks.</description>

      <title>The Honeycomb Conjecture in normed planes and an alpha-convex variant of a theorem of Dowker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Honeycomb Conjecture states that among tilings with unit area cells in the Euclidean plane, the average perimeter of a cell is minimal for a regular hexagonal tiling. This conjecture was proved by L. Fejes T\'oth for convex tilings, and by Hales for not necessarily convex tilings. In this paper we investigate the same question for tilings of a given normed plane, and show that among normal, convex tilings in a normed plane, the average squared perimeter of a cell is minimal for a tiling whose cells are translates of a centrally symmetric hexagon. We also show that the question whether the same statement is true for the average perimeter of a cell is closely related to an $\alpha$-convex variant of a theorem of Dowker on the area of polygons circumscribed about a convex disk. Exploring this connection we find families of norms in which the average perimeter of a cell of a tiling is minimal for a hexagonal tiling, and prove some additonal related results. Finally, we apply our method to give a partial answer to a problem of Steinhaus about the isoperimetric ratios of cells of certain tilings in the Euclidean plane, appeared in an open problem book of Croft, Falconer and Guy.</description>

      <title>A Conditional Upper Bound for the Moving Sofa Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moving sofa problem asks for the connected shape with the largest area $\mu_{\text{max}}$ that can move around the right-angled corner of a hallway $L$ with unit width. The best bounds currently known on $\mu_{\max}$ are summarized as $2.2195\ldots \leq \mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$. The lower bound $2.2195\ldots \leq \mu_{\max}$ comes from Gerver's sofa $S_G$ of area $\mu_G := 2.2195\ldots$. The upper bound $\mu_{\max} \leq 2.37$ was proved by Kallus and Romik using extensive computer assistance. It is conjectured that the equality $\mu_{\max} = \mu_G$ holds at the lower bound.
  We develop a new approach to the moving sofa problem by approximating it as an infinite-dimensional convex quadratic optimization problem. The problem is then explicitly solved using a calculus of variation based on the Brunn-Minkowski theory. Consequently, we prove that any moving sofa satisfying a property named the injectivity condition has an area of at most $1 + \pi^2/8 = 2.2337\dots$. The new conditional bound does not rely on any computer assistance, yet it is much closer to the lower bound $2.2195\ldots$ of Gerver than the computer-assisted upper bound $2.37$ of Kallus and Romik. Gerver's sofa $S_G$, the conjectured optimum, satisfies the injectivity condition in particular.</description>

      <title>Magnitude homology equivalence of Euclidean sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnitude homology is an $\mathbf{R}^+$-graded homology theory of metric spaces that captures information on the complexity of geodesics. Here we address the question: when are two metric spaces magnitude homology equivalent, in the sense that there exist back-and-forth maps inducing mutually inverse maps in homology? We give a concrete geometric necessary and sufficient condition in the case of closed Euclidean sets. Along the way, we introduce the convex-geometric concepts of inner boundary and core, and prove a strengthening for closed convex sets of the classical theorem of Carath\'eodory.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Metric Spaces and Stochastic Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic embeddings of finite metric spaces into graph-theoretic trees have proven to be a vital tool for constructing approximation algorithms in theoretical computer science. In the present work, we build out some of the basic theory of stochastic embeddings in the infinite setting with an aim towards applications to Lipschitz free space theory. We prove that proper metric spaces stochastically embedding into $\mathbb{R}$-trees have Lipschitz free spaces isomorphic to $L^1$-spaces. We then undergo a systematic study of stochastic embeddability of Gromov hyperbolic metric spaces into $\mathbb{R}$-trees by way of stochastic embeddability of their boundaries into ultrametric spaces. The following are obtained as our main results: (1) Every snowflake of a compact, finite Nagata-dimensional metric space stochastically embeds into an ultrametric space and has Lipschitz free space isomorphic to $\ell^1$. (2) The Lipschitz free space over hyperbolic $n$-space is isomorphic to the Lipschitz free space over Euclidean $n$-space. (3) Every infinite, finitely generated hyperbolic group stochastically embeds into an $\mathbb{R}$-tree, has Lipschitz free space isomorphic to $\ell^1$, and admits a proper, uniformly Lipschitz affine action on $\ell^1$.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy simplicial sets and their application to geometric data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we expand upon the concepts introduced in \cite{Spivak09} about the relationship between the category $\mathbf{UM}$ of uber metric spaces and the category $\mathbf{sFuz}$ of fuzzy simplicial sets. We show that fuzzy simplicial sets can be regarded as natural combinatorial generalizations of metric relations. Furthermore, we take inspiration from UMAP to apply the theory to dimension reduction (manifold learning) and data visualization, while refining some of their constructions to put the corresponding theory on a more solid footing. A generalization of the adjunction between $\mathbf{UM}$ and $\mathbf{sFuz}$ will allow us to view the adjunctions used in both publications as special cases. Moreover, we derive an explicit description of colimits in $\mathbf{UM}$ and the realization functor $\text{Re}:\mathbf{sFuz}\to\mathbf{UM}$, as well as rigorous definitions of functors that make it possible to recursively merge sets of fuzzy simplicial sets. We show that $\mathbf{UM}$ and the category of extended-pseudo metric spaces $\mathbf{EPMet}$ can be embedded into $\mathbf{sFuz}$ and provide a description of the adjunctions between the category of truncated fuzzy simplicial sets and $\mathbf{sFuz}$, which we relate to persistent homology. Combining those constructions, we can show a surprising connection between the well-known dimension reduction methods UMAP and Isomap and derive an alternative algorithm, which we call IsUMap, that combines some of the strengths of both methods. We compare it with UMAP and Isomap and provide explanations for observed differences.</description>

      <title>Barycenters and a law of large numbers in Gromov hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.00193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate barycenters of probability measures on Gromov hyperbolic spaces, toward development of convex optimization in this class of metric spaces. We establish a contraction property (the Wasserstein distance between probability measures provides an upper bound of the distance between their barycenters), a deterministic approximation of barycenters of uniform distributions on finite points, and a kind of law of large numbers. These generalize the corresponding results on CAT(0)-spaces, up to additional terms depending on the hyperbolicity constant.</description>

      <title>Bottlenecking in graphs and a coarse Menger-type theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We expand upon the notion of bottlenecking introduced in our earlier work, characterizing a spectrum of graphs and showing that this naturally extends to a concept of coarse bottlenecking. We examine how bottlenecking differs from other notions of connectedness. We show how the notion of bottlenecking provides a different approach to coarsening measures of connectedness than the Coarse Menger Conjecture proposed independently by Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu as well as Albrechtsen, Huynh, Jacobs, Knappe, and Wollan, which was recently disproved by a counterexample. We give a proof of a coarse Menger-type theorem for the class of coarsely bottlenecked graphs, and provide a conjecture that would extend this to all graphs.</description>

      <title>Bounding Shortest Closed Geodesics with Diameter on compact 2-dimensional Orbifolds Homeomorphic to $S^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Length bounded sweepouts give a way to bound the length of the shortest closed geodesic of a closed manifold. In this paper, we generalized to the case of compact 2-dimensional orbifolds homeomorphic to $S^2$ as well as compact 2-dimensional orbifolds with finite orbifold fundamental groups. We proved an inequality for the length of the shortest closed orbifold geodesic in terms of the diameter.</description>
