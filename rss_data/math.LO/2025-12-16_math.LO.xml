      <title>Procountable groups are not classifiable by countable structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the relation of topological isomorphism on procountable groups is not classifiable by countable structures, in the sense of descriptive set theory. In fact, the equivalence relation $\ell_\infty$ that expresses that two sequences of reals have bounded difference is Borel reducible to it. This marks progress on an open problem of [15], to determine the exact complexity of isomorphism among all non-archimedean Polish groups.</description>

      <title>Permutations, substitutions and finite axiomatizability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algebras of relations form an algebraic framework for the study of logical systems, extending the correspondence between Boolean algebras and propositional logic. Tarski's representable cylindric algebras $RCA_{\alpha}$, and Halmos' representable polyadic algebras $RPA_{\alpha}$ both provide algebraic counterparts to first-order logic. In this paper, we show that the usual finite set of polyadic axioms axiomatize $RPA_{\alpha}$ over $RDf_{\alpha}$, the diagonal-free subreducts of elements in $RCA_{\alpha}$. In short: $RPA_{\alpha} = PA_{\alpha} + RDf_{\alpha}$.</description>

      <title>Automorphism groups of non-Archimedean groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Aut(G)$ denote the group of (bi-)continuous automorphisms %and $\Out(G)$ the outer automorphism group of a non-Archimedean Polish group~$G$. We show that for any such $G$ with an invariant countable basis of open subgroups, the group $\Aut(G)$ carries a unique Polish topology that makes its natural action on $G$ continuous. Furthermore, for any class of groups allowing a Borel assignment of such bases, there is a functorial duality to a class of countable groupoids with a meet operation, extending
  work of the authors with Tent (Coarse groups, and the isomorphism problem for oligomorphic
  groups, Journal of Mathematical Logic, 2021). This provides an alternative description of the topology of $\Aut(G)$. The results hold for instance for the class of locally Roelcke precompact non-Archimedean groups, which contains most classes studied previously. We further provide a model-theoretic proof that the outer automorphism group $\Out(G)$ of an oligomorphic group $G$ is locally compact, a result due to Paolini and the first author (arXiv:2410.02248).</description>

      <title>A note on the Ketonen order and Lipschitz reducibility between ultrafilters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his study of the Ultrapower Axiom (UA), Goldberg revealed a connection between UA and the determinacy of certain games that witness Lipschitz reducibility between ultrafilters. In particular, he analyzed the relationship between the Ketonen and Lipschitz orders - two natural extensions of the Mitchell order from normal measures to arbitrary $\sigma$-complete ultrafilters - and proved that the Lipschitz order extends the Ketonen order. He further observed that under UA the two orders coincide. Goldberg asked if it's consistent that the orders differ from each other. We show that the answer is positive. In fact, even the Weak Ultrapower Axiom does not imply that the Ketonen and Lipschitz orders coincide.</description>

      <title>Non-Compact Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-compact proofs are a class of reasoning that is used in mathematics but overlooked in the analysis of (un)provability of consistency. We focus on proofs of arithmetical statements (*) "for any natural number n, F(n)." A proof of (*) is called compact if all proofs of F(n)'s for n=0,1,2,... fit into some finitely axiomatized fragment of Peano Arithmetic PA. An example of non-compact reasoning is given by the standard proof of Mostowski's 1952 reflexivity theorem: PA proves the consistency of its finite fragments. It turns out that G\"odel's second incompleteness theorem prohibits compact proofs and does not rule out non-compact proofs of PA-consistency formalizable in PA. This explains how the recent proof of PA-consistency in PA works. It essentially formalizes in PA the explicit version of Mostowski's proof, which is not in the scope of G\"odel's theorem.</description>

      <title>Whitehead's problem and condensed mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09122v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the better-known independence results in general mathematics is Shelah's solution to Whitehead's problem of whether $\mathrm{Ext}^1(A,\mathbb{Z})=0$ implies that an abelian group $A$ is free. The point of departure for the present work is Clausen and Scholze's proof that, in contrast, one natural interpretation of Whitehead's problem within their recently-developed framework of condensed mathematics has an affirmative answer in $\mathsf{ZFC}$. We record two alternative proofs of this result, as well as several original variations on it, both for their intrinsic interest and as a springboard for a broader study of the relations between condensed mathematics and set theoretic forcing. We show more particularly how the condensation $\underline{X}$ of any locally compact Hausdorff space $X$ may be viewed as an organized presentation of the forcing names for the points of canonical interpretations of $X$ in all possible set-forcing extensions of the universe, and we argue our main result by way of this fact. We show also that when interpreted within the category of light condensed abelian groups, Whitehead's problem is again independent of the $\mathsf{ZFC}$ axioms. In fact we show that it is consistent that Whitehead's problem has a negative solution within the category of $\kappa$-condensed abelian groups for every uncountable cardinal $\kappa$, but that this scenario, in turn, is inconsistent with the existence of a strongly compact cardinal.</description>

      <title>On Descent and germs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new proof of descent for stably dominated types in any theory, dropping the hypothesis of the existence of global invariant extensions. Additionally, we give a much simpler proof of descent for stably dominated types in $\ACVF$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that any stable set in an $\NIP$ theory has the bounded stabilizing property. This result is subsequently used to correct Proposition 6.7 from the book on stable domination and independence in $\ACVF$.</description>

      <title>Elementary properties of free lattices II: Decidability of the universal theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09128v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue our work on the model theory of free lattices, solving two of the main open problems from our first paper on the subject. Our main result is that the universal (existential) theory of infinite free lattices is decidable. Our second main result is a proof that finitely generated free lattices are positively distinguishable, as for each $n \geq 1$ there is a positive $\exists \forall$-sentence true in $\mathbf{F}_n$ and false in $\mathbf{F}_{n+1}$. Finally, we show that free lattices are first-order rigid in the class of finitely generated projective lattices, and that a projective lattice has the same existential (universal) theory of an infinite free lattice if and only if it has breadth $&gt; 4$ (i.e., a single existential sentence is sufficient).</description>

      <title>Adversarial Barrier in Uniform Class Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08149v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a strong structural obstruction to Uniform Separation in constructive arithmetic. The mechanism is independent of semantic content; it emerges whenever two distinct evaluator predicates are sustained in parallel and inference remains uniformly representable in an extension of HA. Under these conditions, any putative Uniform Class Separation principle becomes a distinguished instance of a fixed point construction. The resulting limitation is stricter in scope than classical separation barriers (Baker; Rudich; Aaronson et al.) insofar as it constrains the logical form of uniform separation within HA, rather than limiting particular relativizing, naturalizing, or algebrizing techniques.</description>
