      <title>Maximizing UAV Cellular Connectivity with Reinforcement Learning for BVLoS Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based approach for path planning of cellular connected unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating beyond visual line of sight (BVLoS). The objective is to minimize travel distance while maximizing the quality of cellular link connectivity by considering real world aerial coverage constraints and employing an empirical aerial channel model. The proposed solution employs RL techniques to train an agent, using the quality of communication links between the UAV and base stations (BSs) as the reward function. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in training the agent and generating feasible UAV path plans. The proposed approach addresses the challenges due to limitations in UAV cellular communications, highlighting the need for investigations and considerations in this area. The RL algorithm efficiently identifies optimal paths, ensuring maximum connectivity with ground BSs to ensure safe and reliable BVLoS flight operation. Moreover, the solution can be deployed as an offline path planning module that can be integrated into future ground control systems (GCS) for UAV operations, enhancing their capabilities and safety. The method holds potential for complex long range UAV applications, advancing the technology in the field of cellular connected UAV path planning.</description>

      <title>Real World Robotic Exploration using Deep Neural Networks Trained in Photorealistic Reconstructed Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, an existing deep neural network approach for determining a robot's pose from visual information (RGB images) is modified, improving its localization performance without impacting its ease of training. Explicitly, the network's loss function is extended in a manner which intuitively combines the positional and rotational error in order to increase robustness to perceptual aliasing. An improvement in the localization accuracy for indoor scenes is observed: with decreases of up to 9.64% and 2.99% in the median positional and rotational error respectively, when compared to the unmodified network.
  Additionally, photogrammetry data is used to produce a pose-labelled dataset which allows the above model to be trained on a local environment, resulting in localization accuracies of 0.11m &amp; 0.89 degrees. This trained model forms the basis of a navigation algorithm, which is tested in real-time on a TurtleBot (a wheeled robotic device). As such, this work introduces a full pipeline for creating a robust navigational algorithm for any given real world indoor scene; the only requirement being a collection of images from the scene, which can be captured in as little as 330 seconds of</description>

      <title>Label-Efficient Grasp Joint Prediction with Point-JEPA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether 3D self-supervised pretraining with a Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (Point-JEPA) enables label-efficient grasp joint-angle prediction. Using point clouds tokenized from meshes and a ShapeNet-pretrained Point-JEPA encoder, we train a lightweight multi-hypothesis head with winner-takes-all and evaluate by top-logit selection. On DLR-Hand II with object-level splits, Point-JEPA reduces RMSE by up to 26% in low-label regimes and reaches parity with full supervision. These results suggest JEPA-style pretraining is a practical approach for data-efficient grasp learning.</description>

      <title>Using role-play and Hierarchical Task Analysis for designing human-robot interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the use of two methods we believe warrant more use than they currently have in the field of human-robot interaction: role-play and Hierarchical Task Analysis. Some of its potential is showcased through our use of them in an ongoing research project which entails developing a robot application meant to assist at a community pharmacy. The two methods have provided us with several advantages. The role-playing provided a controlled and adjustable environment for understanding the customers' needs where pharmacists could act as models for the robot's behavior; and the Hierarchical Task Analysis ensured the behavior displayed was modelled correctly and aided development through facilitating co-design. Future research could focus on developing task analysis methods especially suited for social robot interaction.</description>

      <title>ASTREA: Introducing Agentic Intelligence for Orbital Thermal Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents ASTREA, the first agentic system deployed on flight-heritage hardware (TRL 9) for autonomous spacecraft operations. Using thermal control as a representative use case, we integrate a resource-constrained Large Language Model (LLM) agent with a reinforcement learning controller in an asynchronous architecture tailored for space-qualified platforms. Ground experiments show that LLM-guided supervision improves thermal stability and reduces violations, confirming the feasibility of combining semantic reasoning with adaptive control under hardware constraints. However, on-orbit validation aboard the International Space Station (ISS) reveals performance degradation caused by inference latency mismatched with the rapid thermal cycles characteristic of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. These results highlight both the opportunities and current limitations of agentic LLM-based systems in real flight environments, providing practical design guidelines for future space autonomy.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Target Detection with AUVs: A Dual-Timescale Hierarchical MARDL Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) have shown great potential for cooperative detection and reconnaissance. However, collaborative AUV communications introduce risks of exposure. In adversarial environments, achieving efficient collaboration while ensuring covert operations becomes a key challenge for underwater cooperative missions. In this paper, we propose a novel dual time-scale Hierarchical Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (H-MAPPO) framework. The high-level component determines the individuals participating in the task based on a central AUV, while the low-level component reduces exposure probabilities through power and trajectory control by the participating AUVs. Simulation results show that the proposed framework achieves rapid convergence, outperforms benchmark algorithms in terms of performance, and maximizes long-term cooperative efficiency while ensuring covert operations.</description>

      <title>VEGA: Electric Vehicle Navigation Agent via Physics-Informed Neural Operator and Proximal Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demands for software-defined vehicles (SDV) are rising and electric vehicles (EVs) are increasingly being equipped with powerful computers. This enables onboard AI systems to optimize charge-aware path optimization customized to reflect vehicle's current condition and environment. We present VEGA, a charge-aware EV navigation agent that plans over a charger-annotated road graph using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with budgeted A* teacher-student guidance under state-of-charge (SoC) feasibility. VEGA consists of two modules. First, a physics-informed neural operator (PINO), trained on real vehicle speed and battery-power logs, uses recent vehicle speed logs to estimate aerodynamic drag, rolling resistance, mass, motor and regenerative-braking efficiencies, and auxiliary load by learning a vehicle-custom dynamics. Second, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent uses these dynamics to optimize a path with optimal charging stops and dwell times under SoC constraints. VEGA requires no additional sensors and uses only vehicle speed signals. It may serve as a virtual sensor for power and efficiency to potentially reduce EV cost. In evaluation on long routes like San Francisco to New York, VEGA's stops, dwell times, SoC management, and total travel time closely track Tesla Trip Planner while being slightly more conservative, presumably due to real vehicle conditions such as vehicle parameter drift due to deterioration. Although trained only in U.S. regions, VEGA was able to compute optimal charge-aware paths in France and Japan, demonstrating generalizability. It achieves practical integration of physics-informed learning and RL for EV eco-routing.</description>

      <title>A Convex Formulation of Compliant Contact between Filaments and Rigid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a computational framework for simulating filaments interacting with rigid bodies through contact. Filaments are challenging to simulate due to their codimensionality, i.e., they are one-dimensional structures embedded in three-dimensional space. Existing methods often assume that filaments remain permanently attached to rigid bodies. Our framework unifies discrete elastic rod (DER) modeling, a pressure field patch contact model, and a convex contact formulation to accurately simulate frictional interactions between slender filaments and rigid bodies - capabilities not previously achievable. Owing to the convex formulation of contact, each time step can be solved to global optimality, guaranteeing complementarity between contact velocity and impulse. We validate the framework by assessing the accuracy of frictional forces and comparing its physical fidelity against baseline methods. Finally, we demonstrate its applicability in both soft robotics, such as a stochastic filament-based gripper, and deformable object manipulation, such as shoelace tying, providing a versatile simulator for systems involving complex filament-filament and filament-rigid body interactions.</description>

      <title>Trajectory Tracking with Reachability-Guided Quadratic Programming and Freeze-Resume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many robotic systems must follow planned paths yet pause safely and resume when people or objects intervene. We present an output-space method for systems whose tracked output can be feedback-linearized to a double integrator (e.g., manipulators). The approach has two parts. Offline, we perform a pre-run reachability check to verify that the motion plan respects speed and acceleration magnitude limits. Online, we apply a quadratic program to track the motion plan under the same limits. We use a one-step reachability test to bound the maximum disturbance the system is capable of rejecting. When the state coincides with the reference path we recover perfect tracking in the deterministic case, and we correct errors using a KKT-inspired weight. We demonstrate that safety stops and unplanned deviations are handled efficiently, and the system returns to the motion plan without replanning. We demonstrate our system's improved performance over pure pursuit in simulation.</description>

      <title>Embracing Bulky Objects with Humanoid Robots: Whole-Body Manipulation with Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole-body manipulation (WBM) for humanoid robots presents a promising approach for executing embracing tasks involving bulky objects, where traditional grasping relying on end-effectors only remains limited in such scenarios due to inherent stability and payload constraints. This paper introduces a reinforcement learning framework that integrates a pre-trained human motion prior with a neural signed distance field (NSDF) representation to achieve robust whole-body embracing. Our method leverages a teacher-student architecture to distill large-scale human motion data, generating kinematically natural and physically feasible whole-body motion patterns. This facilitates coordinated control across the arms and torso, enabling stable multi-contact interactions that enhance the robustness in manipulation and also the load capacity. The embedded NSDF further provides accurate and continuous geometric perception, improving contact awareness throughout long-horizon tasks. We thoroughly evaluate the approach through comprehensive simulations and real-world experiments. The results demonstrate improved adaptability to diverse shapes and sizes of objects and also successful sim-to-real transfer. These indicate that the proposed framework offers an effective and practical solution for multi-contact and long-horizon WBM tasks of humanoid robots.</description>

      <title>Semantic 3D Reconstructions with SLAM for Central Airway Obstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central airway obstruction (CAO) is a life-threatening condition with increasing incidence, caused by tumors in and outside of the airway. Traditional treatment methods such as bronchoscopy and electrocautery can be used to remove the tumor completely; however, these methods carry a high risk of complications. Recent advances allow robotic interventions with lesser risk. The combination of robot interventions with scene understanding and mapping also opens up the possibilities for automation. We present a novel pipeline that enables real-time, semantically informed 3D reconstructions of the central airway using monocular endoscopic video.
  Our approach combines DROID-SLAM with a segmentation model trained to identify obstructive tissues. The SLAM module reconstructs the 3D geometry of the airway in real time, while the segmentation masks guide the annotation of obstruction regions within the reconstructed point cloud. To validate our pipeline, we evaluate the reconstruction quality using ex vivo models.
  Qualitative and quantitative results show high similarity between ground truth CT scans and the 3D reconstructions (0.62 mm Chamfer distance). By integrating segmentation directly into the SLAM workflow, our system produces annotated 3D maps that highlight clinically relevant regions in real time. High-speed capabilities of the pipeline allows quicker reconstructions compared to previous work, reflecting the surgical scene more accurately.
  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate semantic segmentation with real-time monocular SLAM for endoscopic CAO scenarios. Our framework is modular and can generalize to other anatomies or procedures with minimal changes, offering a promising step toward autonomous robotic interventions.</description>

      <title>Using Visual Language Models to Control Bionic Hands: Assessment of Object Perception and Grasp Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the potential of utilizing Vision Language Models (VLMs) to improve the perceptual capabilities of semi-autonomous prosthetic hands. We introduce a unified benchmark for end-to-end perception and grasp inference, evaluating a single VLM to perform tasks that traditionally require complex pipelines with separate modules for object detection, pose estimation, and grasp planning. To establish the feasibility and current limitations of this approach, we benchmark eight contemporary VLMs on their ability to perform a unified task essential for bionic grasping. From a single static image, they should (1) identify common objects and their key properties (name, shape, orientation, and dimensions), and (2) infer appropriate grasp parameters (grasp type, wrist rotation, hand aperture, and number of fingers). A corresponding prompt requesting a structured JSON output was employed with a dataset of 34 snapshots of common objects. Key performance metrics, including accuracy for categorical attributes (e.g., object name, shape) and errors in numerical estimates (e.g., dimensions, hand aperture), along with latency and cost, were analyzed. The results demonstrated that most models exhibited high performance in object identification and shape recognition, while accuracy in estimating dimensions and inferring optimal grasp parameters, particularly hand rotation and aperture, varied more significantly. This work highlights the current capabilities and limitations of VLMs as advanced perceptual modules for semi-autonomous control of bionic limbs, demonstrating their potential for effective prosthetic applications.</description>

      <title>Dense-Jump Flow Matching with Non-Uniform Time Scheduling for Robotic Policies: Mitigating Multi-Step Inference Degradation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow matching has emerged as a competitive framework for learning high-quality generative policies in robotics; however, we find that generalisation arises and saturates early along the flow trajectory, in accordance with recent findings in the literature. We further observe that increasing the number of Euler integration steps during inference counter-intuitively and universally degrades policy performance. We attribute this to (i) additional, uniformly spaced integration steps oversample the late-time region, thereby constraining actions towards the training trajectories and reducing generalisation; and (ii) the learned velocity field becoming non-Lipschitz as integration time approaches 1, causing instability. To address these issues, we propose a novel policy that utilises non-uniform time scheduling (e.g., U-shaped) during training, which emphasises both early and late temporal stages to regularise policy training, and a dense-jump integration schedule at inference, which uses a single-step integration to replace the multi-step integration beyond a jump point, to avoid unstable areas around 1. Essentially, our policy is an efficient one-step learner that still pushes forward performance through multi-step integration, yielding up to 23.7% performance gains over state-of-the-art baselines across diverse robotic tasks.</description>

      <title>TreeIRL: Safe Urban Driving with Tree Search and Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TreeIRL, a novel planner for autonomous driving that combines Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to achieve state-of-the-art performance in simulation and in real-world driving. The core idea is to use MCTS to find a promising set of safe candidate trajectories and a deep IRL scoring function to select the most human-like among them. We evaluate TreeIRL against both classical and state-of-the-art planners in large-scale simulations and on 500+ miles of real-world autonomous driving in the Las Vegas metropolitan area. Test scenarios include dense urban traffic, adaptive cruise control, cut-ins, and traffic lights. TreeIRL achieves the best overall performance, striking a balance between safety, progress, comfort, and human-likeness. To our knowledge, our work is the first demonstration of MCTS-based planning on public roads and underscores the importance of evaluating planners across a diverse set of metrics and in real-world environments. TreeIRL is highly extensible and could be further improved with reinforcement learning and imitation learning, providing a framework for exploring different combinations of classical and learning-based approaches to solve the planning bottleneck in autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Object Pose Estimation through Dexterous Touch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust object pose estimation is essential for manipulation and interaction tasks in robotics, particularly in scenarios where visual data is limited or sensitive to lighting, occlusions, and appearances. Tactile sensors often offer limited and local contact information, making it challenging to reconstruct the pose from partial data. Our approach uses sensorimotor exploration to actively control a robot hand to interact with the object. We train with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to explore and collect tactile data. The collected 3D point clouds are used to iteratively refine the object's shape and pose. In our setup, one hand holds the object steady while the other performs active exploration. We show that our method can actively explore an object's surface to identify critical pose features without prior knowledge of the object's geometry.

      <title>Leg-Arm Coordinated Operation for Curtain Wall Installation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the acceleration of urbanization, the number of high-rise buildings and large public facilities is increasing, making curtain walls an essential component of modern architecture with widespread applications. Traditional curtain wall installation methods face challenges such as variable on-site terrain, high labor intensity, low construction efficiency, and significant safety risks. Large panels often require multiple workers to complete installation. To address these issues, based on a hexapod curtain wall installation robot, we design a hierarchical optimization-based whole-body control framework for coordinated arm-leg planning tailored to three key tasks: wall installation, ceiling installation, and floor laying. This framework integrates the motion of the hexapod legs with the operation of the folding arm and the serial-parallel manipulator. We conduct experiments on the hexapod curtain wall installation robot to validate the proposed control method, demonstrating its capability in performing curtain wall installation tasks. Our results confirm the effectiveness of the hierarchical optimization-based arm-leg coordination framework for the hexapod robot, laying the foundation for its further application in complex construction site environments.</description>

      <title>Barometer-Aided Attitude Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and robust attitude estimation is a central challenge for autonomous vehicles operating in GNSS-denied or highly dynamic environments. In such cases, Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) alone are insufficient for reliable tilt estimation due to the ambiguity between gravitational and inertial accelerations. While auxiliary velocity sensors, such as GNSS, Pitot tubes, Doppler radar, or visual odometry, are often used, they can be unavailable, intermittent, or costly. This work introduces a barometer-aided attitude estimation architecture that leverages barometric altitude measurements to infer vertical velocity and attitude within a nonlinear observer on SO(3). The design cascades a deterministic Riccati observer with a complementary filter, ensuring Almost Global Asymptotic Stability (AGAS) under a uniform observability condition while maintaining geometric consistency. The analysis highlights barometer-aided estimation as a lightweight and effective complementary modality.</description>

      <title>DREAM: Domain-aware Reasoning for Efficient Autonomous Underwater Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ocean is warming and acidifying, increasing the risk of mass mortality events for temperature-sensitive shellfish such as oysters. This motivates the development of long-term monitoring systems. However, human labor is costly and long-duration underwater work is highly hazardous, thus favoring robotic solutions as a safer and more efficient option. To enable underwater robots to make real-time, environment-aware decisions without human intervention, we must equip them with an intelligent "brain." This highlights the need for persistent,wide-area, and low-cost benthic monitoring. To this end, we present DREAM, a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided autonomy framework for long-term underwater exploration and habitat monitoring. The results show that our framework is highly efficient in finding and exploring target objects (e.g., oysters, shipwrecks) without prior location information. In the oyster-monitoring task, our framework takes 31.5% less time than the previous baseline with the same amount of oysters. Compared to the vanilla VLM, it uses 23% fewer steps while covering 8.88% more oysters. In shipwreck scenes, our framework successfully explores and maps the wreck without collisions, requiring 27.5% fewer steps than the vanilla model and achieving 100% coverage, while the vanilla model achieves 60.23% average coverage in our shipwreck environments.</description>

      <title>SPAR: Scalable LLM-based PDDL Domain Generation for Aerial Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of automatic domain generation for the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) using Large Language Models (LLMs), with a particular focus on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tasks. Although PDDL is a widely adopted standard in robotic planning, manually designing domains for diverse applications such as surveillance, delivery, and inspection is labor-intensive and error-prone, which hinders adoption and real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we propose SPAR, a framework that leverages the generative capabilities of LLMs to automatically produce valid, diverse, and semantically accurate PDDL domains from natural language input. To this end, we first introduce a systematically formulated and validated UAV planning dataset, consisting of ground-truth PDDL domains and associated problems, each paired with detailed domain and action descriptions. Building on this dataset, we design a prompting framework that generates high-quality PDDL domains from language input. The generated domains are evaluated through syntax validation, executability, feasibility, and interpretability. Overall, this work demonstrates that LLMs can substantially accelerate the creation of complex planning domains, providing a reproducible dataset and evaluation pipeline that enables application experts without prior experience to leverage it for practical tasks and advance future research in aerial robotics and automated planning.</description>

      <title>HGACNet: Hierarchical Graph Attention Network for Cross-Modal Point Cloud Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud completion is essential for robotic perception, object reconstruction and supporting downstream tasks like grasp planning, obstacle avoidance, and manipulation. However, incomplete geometry caused by self-occlusion and sensor limitations can significantly degrade downstream reasoning and interaction. To address these challenges, we propose HGACNet, a novel framework that reconstructs complete point clouds of individual objects by hierarchically encoding 3D geometric features and fusing them with image-guided priors from a single-view RGB image. At the core of our approach, the Hierarchical Graph Attention (HGA) encoder adaptively selects critical local points through graph attention-based downsampling and progressively refines hierarchical geometric features to better capture structural continuity and spatial relationships. To strengthen cross-modal interaction, we further design a Multi-Scale Cross-Modal Fusion (MSCF) module that performs attention-based feature alignment between hierarchical geometric features and structured visual representations, enabling fine-grained semantic guidance for completion. In addition, we proposed the contrastive loss (C-Loss) to explicitly align the feature distributions across modalities, improving completion fidelity under modality discrepancy. Finally, extensive experiments conducted on both the ShapeNet-ViPC benchmark and the YCB-Complete dataset confirm the effectiveness of HGACNet, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance as well as strong applicability in real-world robotic manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>EZREAL: Enhancing Zero-Shot Outdoor Robot Navigation toward Distant Targets under Varying Visibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-shot object navigation (ZSON) in large-scale outdoor environments faces many challenges; we specifically address a coupled one: long-range targets that reduce to tiny projections and intermittent visibility due to partial or complete occlusion. We present a unified, lightweight closed-loop system built on an aligned multi-scale image tile hierarchy. Through hierarchical target-saliency fusion, it summarizes localized semantic contrast into a stable coarse-layer regional saliency that provides the target direction and indicates target visibility. This regional saliency supports visibility-aware heading maintenance through keyframe memory, saliency-weighted fusion of historical headings, and active search during temporary invisibility. The system avoids whole-image rescaling, enables deterministic bottom-up aggregation, supports zero-shot navigation, and runs efficiently on a mobile robot. Across simulation and real-world outdoor trials, the system detects semantic targets beyond 150m, maintains a correct heading through visibility changes with 82.6% probability, and improves overall task success by 17.5% compared with the SOTA methods, demonstrating robust ZSON toward distant and intermittently observable targets.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Insertion of Flexible Cables in Industrial Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The industrial insertion of flexible flat cables (FFCs) into receptacles presents a significant challenge owing to the need for submillimeter precision when handling the deformable cables. In manufacturing processes, FFC insertion with robotic manipulators often requires laborious human-guided trajectory generation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a solution to automate this task without modeling complex properties of FFCs, the nondeterminism caused by the deformability of FFCs requires significant efforts and time on training. Moreover, training directly in a real environment is dangerous as industrial robots move fast and possess no safety measure. We propose an RL algorithm for FFC insertion that leverages a foundation model-based real-to-sim approach to reduce the training time and eliminate the risk of physical damages to robots and surroundings. Training is done entirely in simulation, allowing for random exploration without the risk of physical damages. Sim-to-real transfer is achieved through semantic segmentation masks which leave only those visual features relevant to the insertion tasks such as the geometric and spatial information of the cables and receptacles. To enhance generality, we use a foundation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). To eleminate human intervention, we employ a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to automate the initial prompting of SAM2 to find segmentation masks. In the experiments, our method exhibits zero-shot capabilities, which enable direct deployments to real environments without fine-tuning.</description>

      <title>FSR-VLN: Fast and Slow Reasoning for Vision-Language Navigation with Hierarchical Multi-modal Scene Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual-Language Navigation (VLN) is a fundamental challenge in robotic systems, with broad applications for the deployment of embodied agents in real-world environments. Despite recent advances, existing approaches are limited in long-range spatial reasoning, often exhibiting low success rates and high inference latency, particularly in long-range navigation tasks. To address these limitations, we propose FSR-VLN, a vision-language navigation system that combines a Hierarchical Multi-modal Scene Graph (HMSG) with Fast-to-Slow Navigation Reasoning (FSR). The HMSG provides a multi-modal map representation supporting progressive retrieval, from coarse room-level localization to fine-grained goal view and object identification. Building on HMSG, FSR first performs fast matching to efficiently select candidate rooms, views, and objects, then applies VLM-driven refinement for final goal selection. We evaluated FSR-VLN across four comprehensive indoor datasets collected by humanoid robots, utilizing 87 instructions that encompass a diverse range of object categories. FSR-VLN achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all datasets, measured by the retrieval success rate (RSR), while reducing the response time by 82% compared to VLM-based methods on tour videos by activating slow reasoning only when fast intuition fails. Furthermore, we integrate FSR-VLN with speech interaction, planning, and control modules on a Unitree-G1 humanoid robot, enabling natural language interaction and real-time navigation.</description>

      <title>Motion Adaptation Across Users and Tasks for Exoskeletons via Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable exoskeletons can augment human strength and reduce muscle fatigue during specific tasks. However, developing personalized and task-generalizable assistance algorithms remains a critical challenge. To address this, a meta-imitation learning approach is proposed. This approach leverages a task-specific neural network to predict human elbow joint movements, enabling effective assistance while enhancing generalization to new scenarios. To accelerate data collection, full-body keypoint motions are extracted from publicly available RGB video and motion-capture datasets across multiple tasks, and subsequently retargeted in simulation. Elbow flexion trajectories generated in simulation are then used to train the task-specific neural network within the model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) framework, which allows the network to rapidly adapt to novel tasks and unseen users with only a few gradient updates. The adapted network outputs personalized references tracked by a gravity-compensated PD controller to ensure stable assistance. Experimental results demonstrate that the exoskeleton significantly reduces both muscle activation and metabolic cost for new users performing untrained tasks, compared to performing without exoskeleton assistance. These findings suggest that the proposed framework effectively improves task generalization and user adaptability for wearable exoskeleton systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable progress in legged locomotion control, it often suffers from performance degradation in out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions and discrepancies between the simulation and the real environments. Instead of mainly relying on domain randomization (DR) to best cover the real environments and thereby close the sim-to-real gap and enhance robustness, this work proposes an emerging decoupled framework that acquires fast online adaptation ability and mitigates the sim-to-real problems in unfamiliar environments by isolating stance-leg control and swing-leg control. Various simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate its effectiveness against horizontal force disturbances, uneven terrains, heavy and biased payloads, and sim-to-real gap.</description>

      <title>CDFlow: Generative Gradient Flows for Configuration Space Distance Fields via Neural ODEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) are a fundamental representation in robot motion planning. Their configuration-space counterpart, the Configuration Space Distance Field (CDF), directly encodes distances in joint space, offering a unified representation for optimization and control. However, existing CDF formulations face two major challenges in high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robots: (1) they effectively return only a single nearest collision configuration, neglecting the multi-modal nature of minimal-distance collision configurations and leading to gradient ambiguity; and (2) they rely on sparse sampling of the collision boundary, which often fails to identify the true closest configurations, producing oversmoothed approximations and geometric distortion in high-dimensional spaces. We propose CDFlow, a novel framework that addresses these limitations by learning a continuous flow in configuration space via Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs). We redefine the problem from finding a single nearest point to modeling the distribution of minimal-distance collision configurations. We also introduce an adaptive refinement sampling strategy to generate high-fidelity training data for this distribution. The resulting Neural ODE implicitly models this multi-modal distribution and produces a smooth, consistent gradient field-derived as the expected direction towards the distribution-that mitigates gradient ambiguity and preserves sharp geometric features. Extensive experiments on high-DoF motion planning tasks demonstrate that CDFlow significantly improves planning efficiency, trajectory quality, and robustness compared to existing CDF-based methods, enabling more robust and efficient planning for collision-aware robots in complex environments.</description>

      <title>Dual-Actor Fine-Tuning of VLA Models: A Talk-and-Tweak Human-in-the-Loop Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models demonstrate strong generalization in robotic manipulation but face challenges in complex, real-world tasks. While supervised fine-tuning with demonstrations is constrained by data quality, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative. We propose a human-in-the-loop dual-actor fine-tuning framework grounded in RL. The framework integrates a primary actor for robust multi-task performance with a refinement actor for latent-space adaptation. Beyond standard physical interventions, we introduce a lightweight talk-and-tweak scheme that converts human corrections into semantically grounded language commands, thereby generating a new dataset for policy learning. In real-world multi-task experiments, our approach achieves 100% success across three tasks within 101 minutes of online fine-tuning. For long-horizon tasks, it sustains a 50% success rate over 12 consecutive operations. Furthermore, the framework scales effectively to multi-robot training, achieving up to a 2 times improvement in efficiency when using dual robots.

      <title>Behavior Foundation Model for Humanoid Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole-body control (WBC) of humanoid robots has witnessed remarkable progress in skill versatility, enabling a wide range of applications such as locomotion, teleoperation, and motion tracking. Despite these achievements, existing WBC frameworks remain largely task-specific, relying heavily on labor-intensive reward engineering and demonstrating limited generalization across tasks and skills. These limitations hinder their response to arbitrary control modes and restrict their deployment in complex, real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we revisit existing WBC systems and identify a shared objective across diverse tasks: the generation of appropriate behaviors that guide the robot toward desired goal states. Building on this insight, we propose the Behavior Foundation Model (BFM), a generative model pretrained on large-scale behavioral datasets to capture broad, reusable behavioral knowledge for humanoid robots. BFM integrates a masked online distillation framework with a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to model behavioral distributions, thereby enabling flexible operation across diverse control modes and efficient acquisition of novel behaviors without retraining from scratch. Extensive experiments in both simulation and on a physical humanoid platform demonstrate that BFM generalizes robustly across diverse WBC tasks while rapidly adapting to new behaviors. These results establish BFM as a promising step toward a foundation model for general-purpose humanoid control.</description>

      <title>Shell-Type Soft Jig for Holding Objects during Disassembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study addresses a flexible holding tool for robotic disassembly. We propose a shell-type soft jig that securely and universally holds objects, mitigating the risk of component damage and adapting to diverse shapes while enabling soft fixation that is robust to recognition, planning, and control errors. The balloon-based holding mechanism ensures proper alignment and stable holding performance, thereby reducing the need for dedicated jig design, highly accurate perception, precise grasping, and finely tuned trajectory planning that are typically required with conventional fixtures.

      <title>Soft Regrasping Tool Inspired by Jamming Gripper</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regrasping on fixtures is a promising approach to reduce pose uncertainty in robotic assembly, but conventional rigid fixtures lack adaptability and require dedicated designs for each part. To overcome this limitation, we propose a soft jig inspired by the jamming transition phenomenon, which can be continuously deformed to accommodate diverse object geometries. By pressing a triangular-pyramid-shaped tool into the membrane and evacuating the enclosed air, a stable cavity is formed as a placement space. We further optimize the stamping depth to balance placement stability and gripper accessibility. In soft-jig-based regrasping, the key challenge lies in optimizing the cavity size to achieve precise dropping; once the part is reliably placed, subsequent grasping can be performed with reduced uncertainty. Accordingly, we conducted drop experiments on ten mechanical parts of varying shapes, which achieved placement success rates exceeding 80% for most objects and above 90% for cylindrical ones, while failures were mainly caused by geometric constraints and membrane properties. These results demonstrate that the proposed jig enables general-purpose, accurate, and repeatable regrasping, while also clarifying its current limitations and future potential as a practical alternative to rigid fixtures in assembly automation.</description>

      <title>Agile in the Face of Delay: Asynchronous End-to-End Learning for Real-World Aerial Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust autonomous navigation for Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (AAVs) in complex environments is a critical capability. However, modern end-to-end navigation faces a key challenge: the high-frequency control loop needed for agile flight conflicts with low-frequency perception streams, which are limited by sensor update rates and significant computational cost. This mismatch forces conventional synchronous models into undesirably low control rates. To resolve this, we propose an asynchronous reinforcement learning framework that decouples perception and control, enabling a high-frequency policy to act on the latest IMU state for immediate reactivity, while incorporating perception features asynchronously. To manage the resulting data staleness, we introduce a theoretically-grounded Temporal Encoding Module (TEM) that explicitly conditions the policy on perception delays, a strategy complemented by a two-stage curriculum to ensure stable and efficient training. Validated in extensive simulations, our method was successfully deployed in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on an onboard NUC, where it sustains a 100~Hz control rate and demonstrates robust, agile navigation in cluttered real-world environments. Our source code will be released for community reference.</description>

      <title>How Fly Neural Perception Mechanisms Enhance Visuomotor Control of Micro Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anyone who has tried to swat a fly has likely been frustrated by its remarkable agility.This ability stems from its visual neural perception system, particularly the collision-selective neurons within its small brain.For autonomous robots operating in complex and unfamiliar environments, achieving similar agility is highly desirable but often constrained by the trade-off between computational cost and performance.In this context, insect-inspired intelligence offers a parsimonious route to low-power, computationally efficient frameworks.In this paper, we propose an attention-driven visuomotor control strategy inspired by a specific class of fly visual projection neurons-the lobula plate/lobula column type-2 (LPLC2)-and their associated escape behaviors.To our knowledge, this represents the first embodiment of an LPLC2 neural model in the embedded vision of a physical mobile robot, enabling collision perception and reactive evasion.The model was simplified and optimized at 70KB in memory to suit the computational constraints of a vision-based micro robot, the Colias, while preserving key neural perception mechanisms.We further incorporated multi-attention mechanisms to emulate the distributed nature of LPLC2 responses, allowing the robot to detect and react to approaching targets both rapidly and selectively.We systematically evaluated the proposed method against a state-of-the-art locust-inspired collision detection model.Results showed that the fly-inspired visuomotor model achieved comparable robustness, at success rate of 96.1% in collision detection while producing more adaptive and elegant evasive maneuvers.Beyond demonstrating an effective collision-avoidance strategy, this work highlights the potential of fly-inspired neural models for advancing research into collective behaviors in insect intelligence.</description>

      <title>UltraHiT: A Hierarchical Transformer Architecture for Generalizable Internal Carotid Artery Robotic Ultrasonography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carotid ultrasound is crucial for the assessment of cerebrovascular health, particularly the internal carotid artery (ICA). While previous research has explored automating carotid ultrasound, none has tackled the challenging ICA. This is primarily due to its deep location, tortuous course, and significant individual variations, which greatly increase scanning complexity. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Transformer-based decision architecture, namely UltraHiT, that integrates high-level variation assessment with low-level action decision. Our motivation stems from conceptualizing individual vascular structures as morphological variations derived from a standard vascular model. The high-level module identifies variation and switches between two low-level modules: an adaptive corrector for variations, or a standard executor for normal cases. Specifically, both the high-level module and the adaptive corrector are implemented as causal transformers that generate predictions based on the historical scanning sequence. To ensure generalizability, we collected the first large-scale ICA scanning dataset comprising 164 trajectories and 72K samples from 28 subjects of both genders. Based on the above innovations, our approach achieves a 95% success rate in locating the ICA on unseen individuals, outperforming baselines and demonstrating its effectiveness. Our code will be released after acceptance.</description>

      <title>Track Any Motions under Any Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A foundational humanoid motion tracker is expected to be able to track diverse, highly dynamic, and contact-rich motions. More importantly, it needs to operate stably in real-world scenarios against various dynamics disturbances, including terrains, external forces, and physical property changes for general practical use. To achieve this goal, we propose Any2Track (Track Any motions under Any disturbances), a two-stage RL framework to track various motions under multiple disturbances in the real world. Any2Track reformulates dynamics adaptability as an additional capability on top of basic action execution and consists of two key components: AnyTracker and AnyAdapter. AnyTracker is a general motion tracker with a series of careful designs to track various motions within a single policy. AnyAdapter is a history-informed adaptation module that endows the tracker with online dynamics adaptability to overcome the sim2real gap and multiple real-world disturbances. We deploy Any2Track on Unitree G1 hardware and achieve a successful sim2real transfer in a zero-shot manner. Any2Track performs exceptionally well in tracking various motions under multiple real-world disturbances.</description>

      <title>Pre-Manipulation Alignment Prediction with Parallel Deep State-Space and Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of predicting the future success of open-vocabulary object manipulation tasks. Conventional approaches typically determine success or failure after the action has been carried out. However, they make it difficult to prevent potential hazards and rely on failures to trigger replanning, thereby reducing the efficiency of object manipulation sequences. To overcome these challenges, we propose a model, which predicts the alignment between a pre-manipulation egocentric image with the planned trajectory and a given natural language instruction. We introduce a Multi-Level Trajectory Fusion module, which employs a state-of-the-art deep state-space model and a transformer encoder in parallel to capture multi-level time-series self-correlation within the end effector trajectory. Our experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperformed existing methods, including foundation models.</description>

      <title>InterKey: Cross-modal Intersection Keypoints for Global Localization on OpenStreetMap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliable global localization is critical for autonomous vehicles, especially in environments where GNSS is degraded or unavailable, such as urban canyons and tunnels. Although high-definition (HD) maps provide accurate priors, the cost of data collection, map construction, and maintenance limits scalability. OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers a free and globally available alternative, but its coarse abstraction poses challenges for matching with sensor data. We propose InterKey, a cross-modal framework that leverages road intersections as distinctive landmarks for global localization. Our method constructs compact binary descriptors by jointly encoding road and building imprints from point clouds and OSM. To bridge modality gaps, we introduce discrepancy mitigation, orientation determination, and area-equalized sampling strategies, enabling robust cross-modal matching. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate that InterKey achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming recent baselines by a large margin. The framework generalizes to sensors that can produce dense structural point clouds, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for robust vehicle localization.</description>

      <title>Using Petri Nets for Context-Adaptive Robot Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In human-robot interaction, robots must communicate in a natural and transparent manner to foster trust, which requires adapting their communication to the context. In this paper, we propose using Petri nets (PNs) to model contextual information for adaptive robot explanations. PNs provide a formal, graphical method for representing concurrent actions, causal dependencies, and system states, making them suitable for analyzing dynamic interactions between humans and robots. We demonstrate this approach through a scenario involving a robot that provides explanations based on contextual cues such as user attention and presence. Model analysis confirms key properties, including deadlock-freeness, context-sensitive reachability, boundedness, and liveness, showing the robustness and flexibility of PNs for designing and verifying context-adaptive explanations in human-robot interactions.</description>

      <title>Repulsive Trajectory Modification and Conflict Resolution for Efficient Multi-Manipulator Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an efficient motion planning method designed to efficiently find collision-free trajectories for multiple manipulators. While multi-manipulator systems offer significant advantages, coordinating their motions is computationally challenging owing to the high dimensionality of their composite configuration space. Conflict-Based Search (CBS) addresses this by decoupling motion planning, but suffers from subsequent conflicts incurred by resolving existing conflicts, leading to an exponentially growing constraint tree of CBS. Our proposed method is based on repulsive trajectory modification within the two-level structure of CBS. Unlike conventional CBS variants, the low-level planner applies a gradient descent approach using an Artificial Potential Field. This field generates repulsive forces that guide the trajectory of the conflicting manipulator away from those of other robots. As a result, subsequent conflicts are less likely to occur. Additionally, we develop a strategy that, under a specific condition, directly attempts to find a conflict-free solution in a single step without growing the constraint tree. Through extensive tests including physical robot experiments, we demonstrate that our method consistently reduces the number of expanded nodes in the constraint tree, achieves a higher success rate, and finds a solution faster compared to Enhanced CBS and other state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce PhysicalAgent, an agentic framework for robotic manipulation that integrates iterative reasoning, diffusion-based video generation, and closed-loop execution. Given a textual instruction, our method generates short video demonstrations of candidate trajectories, executes them on the robot, and iteratively re-plans in response to failures. This approach enables robust recovery from execution errors. We evaluate PhysicalAgent across multiple perceptual modalities (egocentric, third-person, and simulated) and robotic embodiments (bimanual UR3, Unitree G1 humanoid, simulated GR1), comparing against state-of-the-art task-specific baselines. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches, achieving up to 83% success on human-familiar tasks. Physical trials reveal that first-attempt success is limited (20-30%), yet iterative correction increases overall success to 80% across platforms. These results highlight the potential of video-based generative reasoning for general-purpose robotic manipulation and underscore the importance of iterative execution for recovering from initial failures. Our framework paves the way for scalable, adaptable, and robust robot control.</description>

      <title>MAP: End-to-End Autonomous Driving with Map-Assisted Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, end-to-end autonomous driving has attracted increasing attention for its ability to jointly model perception, prediction, and planning within a unified framework. However, most existing approaches underutilize the online mapping module, leaving its potential to enhance trajectory planning largely untapped. This paper proposes MAP (Map-Assisted Planning), a novel map-assisted end-to-end trajectory planning framework. MAP explicitly integrates segmentation-based map features and the current ego status through a Plan-enhancing Online Mapping module, an Ego-status-guided Planning module, and a Weight Adapter based on current ego status. Experiments conducted on the DAIR-V2X-seq-SPD dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 16.6% reduction in L2 displacement error, a 56.2% reduction in off-road rate, and a 44.5% improvement in overall score compared to the UniV2X baseline, even without post-processing. Furthermore, it achieves top ranking in Track 2 of the End-to-End Autonomous Driving through V2X Cooperation Challenge of MEIS Workshop @CVPR2025, outperforming the second-best model by 39.5% in terms of overall score. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly leveraging semantic map features in planning and suggest new directions for improving structure design in end-to-end autonomous driving systems.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used in automated inspection, delivery, and navigation tasks that require reliable autonomy. This project develops a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to enable a single UAV to autonomously navigate between predefined points without manual intervention. The drone learns navigation policies through trial-and-error interaction, using a custom reward function that encourages goal-reaching efficiency while penalizing collisions and unsafe behavior. The control system integrates ROS with a Gym-compatible training environment, enabling flexible deployment and testing. After training, the learned policy is deployed on a real UAV platform and evaluated under practical conditions. Results show that the UAV can successfully perform autonomous navigation with minimal human oversight, demonstrating the viability of RL-based control for point-to-point drone operations in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Facial Features on the Perceived Trustworthiness of a Social Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trust and the perception of trustworthiness play an important role in decision-making and our behaviour towards others, and this is true not only of human-human interactions but also of human-robot interactions. While significant advances have been made in recent years in the field of social robotics, there is still some way to go before we fully understand the factors that influence human trust in robots. This paper presents the results of a study into the first impressions created by a social robot's facial features, based on the hypothesis that a `babyface' engenders trust. By manipulating the back-projected face of a Furhat robot, the study confirms that eye shape and size have a significant impact on the perception of trustworthiness. The work thus contributes to an understanding of the design choices that need to be made when developing social robots so as to optimise the effectiveness of human-robot interaction.</description>

      <title>SHaRe-RL: Structured, Interactive Reinforcement Learning for Contact-Rich Industrial Assembly Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-mix low-volume (HMLV) industrial assembly, common in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), requires the same precision, safety, and reliability as high-volume automation while remaining flexible to product variation and environmental uncertainty. Current robotic systems struggle to meet these demands. Manual programming is brittle and costly to adapt, while learning-based methods suffer from poor sample efficiency and unsafe exploration in contact-rich tasks. To address this, we present SHaRe-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that leverages multiple sources of prior knowledge. By (i) structuring skills into manipulation primitives, (ii) incorporating human demonstrations and online corrections, and (iii) bounding interaction forces with per-axis compliance, SHaRe-RL enables efficient and safe online learning for long-horizon, contact-rich industrial assembly tasks. Experiments on the insertion of industrial Harting connector modules with 0.2-0.4 mm clearance demonstrate that SHaRe-RL achieves reliable performance within practical time budgets. Our results show that process expertise, without requiring robotics or RL knowledge, can meaningfully contribute to learning, enabling safer, more robust, and more economically viable deployment of RL for industrial assembly.</description>

      <title>SEG-Parking: Towards Safe, Efficient, and Generalizable Autonomous Parking via End-to-End Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous parking is a critical component for achieving safe and efficient urban autonomous driving. However, unstructured environments and dynamic interactions pose significant challenges to autonomous parking tasks. To address this problem, we propose SEG-Parking, a novel end-to-end offline reinforcement learning (RL) framework to achieve interaction-aware autonomous parking. Notably, a specialized parking dataset is constructed for parking scenarios, which include those without interference from the opposite vehicle (OV) and complex ones involving interactions with the OV. Based on this dataset, a goal-conditioned state encoder is pretrained to map the fused perception information into the latent space. Then, an offline RL policy is optimized with a conservative regularizer that penalizes out-of-distribution actions. Extensive closed-loop experiments are conducted in the high-fidelity CARLA simulator. Comparative results demonstrate the superior performance of our framework with the highest success rate and robust generalization to out-of-distribution parking scenarios. The related dataset and source code will be made publicly available after the paper is accepted.</description>

      <title>MetricNet: Recovering Metric Scale in Generative Navigation Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative navigation policies have made rapid progress in improving end-to-end learned navigation. Despite their promising results, this paradigm has two structural problems. First, the sampled trajectories exist in an abstract, unscaled space without metric grounding. Second, the control strategy discards the full path, instead moving directly towards a single waypoint. This leads to short-sighted and unsafe actions, moving the robot towards obstacles that a complete and correctly scaled path would circumvent. To address these issues, we propose MetricNet, an effective add-on for generative navigation that predicts the metric distance between waypoints, grounding policy outputs in real-world coordinates. We evaluate our method in simulation with a new benchmarking framework and show that executing MetricNet-scaled waypoints significantly improves both navigation and exploration performance. Beyond simulation, we further validate our approach in real-world experiments. Finally, we propose MetricNav, which integrates MetricNet into a navigation policy to guide the robot away from obstacles while still moving towards the goal.</description>

      <title>BIM Informed Visual SLAM for Construction Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a key tool for monitoring construction sites, where aligning the evolving as-built state with the as-planned design enables early error detection and reduces costly rework. LiDAR-based SLAM achieves high geometric precision, but its sensors are typically large and power-demanding, limiting their use on portable platforms. Visual SLAM offers a practical alternative with lightweight cameras already embedded in most mobile devices. however, visually mapping construction environments remains challenging: repetitive layouts, occlusions, and incomplete or low-texture structures often cause drift in the trajectory map. To mitigate this, we propose an RGB-D SLAM system that incorporates the Building Information Model (BIM) as structural prior knowledge. Instead of relying solely on visual cues, our system continuously establishes correspondences between detected wall and their BIM counterparts, which are then introduced as constraints in the back-end optimization. The proposed method operates in real time and has been validated on real construction sites, reducing trajectory error by an average of 23.71% and map RMSE by 7.14% compared to visual SLAM baselines. These results demonstrate that BIM constraints enable reliable alignment of the digital plan with the as-built scene, even under partially constructed conditions.</description>

      <title>Flexible and Foldable: Workspace Analysis and Object Manipulation Using a Soft, Interconnected, Origami-Inspired Actuator Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object manipulation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, where systems must balance trade-offs among manipulation capabilities, system complexity, and throughput. Distributed manipulator systems (DMS) use the coordinated motion of actuator arrays to perform complex object manipulation tasks, seeing widespread exploration within the literature and in industry. However, existing DMS designs typically rely on high actuator densities and impose constraints on object-to-actuator scale ratios, limiting their adaptability. We present a novel DMS design utilizing an array of 3-DoF, origami-inspired robotic tiles interconnected by a compliant surface layer. Unlike conventional DMS, our approach enables manipulation not only at the actuator end effectors but also across a flexible surface connecting all actuators; creating a continuous, controllable manipulation surface. We analyse the combined workspace of such a system, derive simple motion primitives, and demonstrate its capabilities to translate simple geometric objects across an array of tiles. By leveraging the inter-tile connective material, our approach significantly reduces actuator density, increasing the area over which an object can be manipulated by x1.84 without an increase in the number of actuators. This design offers a lower cost and complexity alternative to traditional high-density arrays, and introduces new opportunities for manipulation strategies that leverage the flexibility of the interconnected surface.</description>

      <title>Whole-body Motion Control of an Omnidirectional Wheel-Legged Mobile Manipulator via Contact-Aware Dynamic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wheel-legged robots with integrated manipulators hold great promise for mobile manipulation in logistics, industrial automation, and human-robot collaboration. However, unified control of such systems remains challenging due to the redundancy in degrees of freedom, complex wheel-ground contact dynamics, and the need for seamless coordination between locomotion and manipulation. In this work, we present the design and whole-body motion control of an omnidirectional wheel-legged quadrupedal robot equipped with a dexterous manipulator. The proposed platform incorporates independently actuated steering modules and hub-driven wheels, enabling agile omnidirectional locomotion with high maneuverability in structured environments. To address the challenges of contact-rich interaction, we develop a contact-aware whole-body dynamic optimization framework that integrates point-contact modeling for manipulation with line-contact modeling for wheel-ground interactions. A warm-start strategy is introduced to accelerate online optimization, ensuring real-time feasibility for high-dimensional control. Furthermore, a unified kinematic model tailored for the robot's 4WIS-4WID actuation scheme eliminates the need for mode switching across different locomotion strategies, improving control consistency and robustness. Simulation and experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, demonstrating agile terrain traversal, high-speed omnidirectional mobility, and precise manipulation under diverse scenarios, underscoring the system's potential for factory automation, urban logistics, and service robotics in semi-structured environments.</description>

      <title>TransforMARS: Fault-Tolerant Self-Reconfiguration for Arbitrarily Shaped Modular Aerial Robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular Aerial Robot Systems (MARS) consist of multiple drone modules that are physically bound together to form a single structure for flight. Exploiting structural redundancy, MARS can be reconfigured into different formations to mitigate unit or rotor failures and maintain stable flight. Prior work on MARS self-reconfiguration has solely focused on maximizing controllability margins to tolerate a single rotor or unit fault for rectangular-shaped MARS. We propose TransforMARS, a general fault-tolerant reconfiguration framework that transforms arbitrarily shaped MARS under multiple rotor and unit faults while ensuring continuous in-air stability. Specifically, we develop algorithms to first identify and construct minimum controllable assemblies containing faulty units. We then plan feasible disassembly-assembly sequences to transport MARS units or subassemblies to form target configuration. Our approach enables more flexible and practical feasible reconfiguration. We validate TransforMARS in challenging arbitrarily shaped MARS configurations, demonstrating substantial improvements over prior works in both the capacity of handling diverse configurations and the number of faults tolerated.

      <title>Prompt2Auto: From Motion Prompt to Automated Control via Geometry-Invariant One-Shot Gaussian Process Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from demonstration allows robots to acquire complex skills from human demonstrations, but conventional approaches often require large datasets and fail to generalize across coordinate transformations. In this paper, we propose Prompt2Auto, a geometry-invariant one-shot Gaussian process (GeoGP) learning framework that enables robots to perform human-guided automated control from a single motion prompt. A dataset-construction strategy based on coordinate transformations is introduced that enforces invariance to translation, rotation, and scaling, while supporting multi-step predictions. Moreover, GeoGP is robust to variations in the user's motion prompt and supports multi-skill autonomy. We validate the proposed approach through numerical simulations with the designed user graphical interface and two real-world robotic experiments, which demonstrate that the proposed method is effective, generalizes across tasks, and significantly reduces the demonstration burden.

      <title>Language Conditioning Improves Accuracy of Aircraft Goal Prediction in Untowered Airspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous aircraft must safely operate in untowered airspace, where coordination relies on voice-based communication among human pilots. Safe operation requires an aircraft to predict the intent, and corresponding goal location, of other aircraft. This paper introduces a multimodal framework for aircraft goal prediction that integrates natural language understanding with spatial reasoning to improve autonomous decision-making in such environments. We leverage automatic speech recognition and large language models to transcribe and interpret pilot radio calls, identify aircraft, and extract discrete intent labels. These intent labels are fused with observed trajectories to condition a temporal convolutional network and Gaussian mixture model for probabilistic goal prediction. Our method significantly reduces goal prediction error compared to baselines that rely solely on motion history, demonstrating that language-conditioned prediction increases prediction accuracy. Experiments on a real-world dataset from an untowered airport validate the approach and highlight its potential to enable socially aware, language-conditioned robotic motion planning.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Consistent Control of Task-Based and Kinematic RCM Constraints for Surgical Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic-assisted minimally invasive surgery (RAMIS) requires precise enforcement of the remote center of motion (RCM) constraint to ensure safe tool manipulation through a trocar. Achieving this constraint under dynamic and interactive conditions remains challenging, as existing control methods either lack robustness at the torque level or do not guarantee consistent RCM constraint satisfaction. This paper proposes a constraint-consistent torque controller that treats the RCM as a rheonomic holonomic constraint and embeds it into a projection-based inverse-dynamics framework. The method unifies task-level and kinematic formulations, enabling accurate tool-tip tracking while maintaining smooth and efficient torque behavior. The controller is validated both in simulation and on a RAMIS training platform, and is benchmarked against state-of-the-art approaches. Results show improved RCM constraint satisfaction, reduced required torque, and robust performance by improving joint torque smoothness through the consistency formulation under clinically relevant scenarios, including spiral trajectories, variable insertion depths, moving trocars, and human interaction. These findings demonstrate the potential of constraint-consistent torque control to enhance safety and reliability in surgical robotics.

      <title>FlightDiffusion: Revolutionising Autonomous Drone Training with Diffusion Models Generating FPV Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FlightDiffusion, a diffusion-model-based framework for training autonomous drones from first-person view (FPV) video. Our model generates realistic video sequences from a single frame, enriched with corresponding action spaces to enable reasoning-driven navigation in dynamic environments. Beyond direct policy learning, FlightDiffusion leverages its generative capabilities to synthesize diverse FPV trajectories and state-action pairs, facilitating the creation of large-scale training datasets without the high cost of real-world data collection. Our evaluation demonstrates that the generated trajectories are physically plausible and executable, with a mean position error of 0.25 m (RMSE 0.28 m) and a mean orientation error of 0.19 rad (RMSE 0.24 rad). This approach enables improved policy learning and dataset scalability, leading to superior performance in downstream navigation tasks. Results in simulated environments highlight enhanced robustness, smoother trajectory planning, and adaptability to unseen conditions. An ANOVA revealed no statistically significant difference between performance in simulation and reality (F(1, 16) = 0.394, p = 0.541), with success rates of M = 0.628 (SD = 0.162) and M = 0.617 (SD = 0.177), respectively, indicating strong sim-to-real transfer. The generated datasets provide a valuable resource for future UAV research. This work introduces diffusion-based reasoning as a promising paradigm for unifying navigation, action generation, and data synthesis in aerial robotics.</description>

      <title>GeoAware-VLA: Implicit Geometry Aware Vision-Language-Action Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often fail to generalize to novel camera viewpoints, a limitation stemming from their difficulty in inferring robust 3D geometry from 2D images. We introduce GeoAware-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that enhances viewpoint invariance by integrating strong geometric priors into the vision backbone. Instead of training a visual encoder or relying on explicit 3D data, we leverage a frozen, pretrained geometric vision model as a feature extractor. A trainable projection layer then adapts these geometrically-rich features for the policy decoder, relieving it of the burden of learning 3D consistency from scratch. Through extensive evaluations on LIBERO benchmark subsets, we show GeoAware-VLA achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot generalization to novel camera poses, boosting success rates by over 2x in simulation. Crucially, these benefits translate to the physical world; our model shows a significant performance gain on a real robot, especially when evaluated from unseen camera angles. Our approach proves effective across both continuous and discrete action spaces, highlighting that robust geometric grounding is a key component for creating more generalizable robotic agents.</description>

      <title>CrazyMARL: Decentralized Direct Motor Control Policies for Cooperative Aerial Transport of Cable-Suspended Payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative transportation of cable-suspended payloads by teams of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has the potential to enhance payload capacity, adapt to different payload shapes, and provide built-in compliance, making it attractive for applications ranging from disaster relief to precision logistics. However, multi-UAV coordination under disturbances, nonlinear payload dynamics, and slack--taut cable modes remains a challenging control problem. To our knowledge, no prior work has addressed these cable mode transitions in the multi-UAV context, instead relying on simplifying rigid-link assumptions. We propose CrazyMARL, a decentralized Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for multi-UAV cable-suspended payload transport. Simulation results demonstrate that the learned policies can outperform classical decentralized controllers in terms of disturbance rejection and tracking precision, achieving an 80% recovery rate from harsh conditions compared to 44% for the baseline method. We also achieve successful zero-shot sim-to-real transfer and demonstrate that our policies are highly robust under harsh conditions, including wind, random external disturbances, and transitions between slack and taut cable dynamics. This work paves the way for autonomous, resilient UAV teams capable of executing complex payload missions in unstructured environments.</description>

      <title>Energy Efficient Multi Robot Package Delivery under Capacity-Constraints via Voronoi-Constrained Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of delivering multiple packages from a single pickup depot to distinct goal locations using a homogeneous fleet of robots with limited carrying capacity. We propose VCST-RCP, a Voronoi-Constrained Steiner Tree Relay Coordination Planning framework that constructs sparse relay trunks using Steiner tree optimization and then synthesizes robot-level pickup, relay, and delivery schedules. This framework reframes relays from incidental byproducts into central elements of coordination, offering a contrast with traditional delivery methods that rely on direct source-to-destination transport. Extensive experiments show consistent improvements of up to 34% compared to conventional baselines, underscoring the benefits of incorporating relays into the delivery process. These improvements translate directly to enhanced energy efficiency in multi-robot delivery under capacity constraints, providing a scalable framework for real-world logistics.</description>

      <title>SeqVLA: Sequential Task Execution for Long-Horizon Manipulation with Completion-Aware Vision-Language-Action Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-horizon robotic manipulation tasks require executing multiple interdependent subtasks in strict sequence, where errors in detecting subtask completion can cascade into downstream failures. Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models such as $\pi_0$ excel at continuous low-level control but lack an internal signal for identifying when a subtask has finished, making them brittle in sequential settings. We propose SeqVLA, a completion-aware extension of $\pi_0$ that augments the base architecture with a lightweight detection head perceiving whether the current subtask is complete. This dual-head design enables SeqVLA not only to generate manipulation actions but also to autonomously trigger transitions between subtasks. We investigate four finetuning strategies that vary in how the action and detection heads are optimized (joint vs. sequential finetuning) and how pretrained knowledge is preserved (full finetuning vs. frozen backbone). Experiments are performed on two multi-stage tasks: salad packing with seven distinct subtasks and candy packing with four distinct subtasks. Results show that SeqVLA significantly outperforms the baseline $\pi_0$ and other strong baselines in overall success rate. In particular, joint finetuning with an unfrozen backbone yields the most decisive and statistically reliable completion predictions, eliminating sequence-related failures and enabling robust long-horizon execution. Our results highlight the importance of coupling action generation with subtask-aware detection for scalable sequential manipulation.</description>

      <title>CLAW: A Vision-Language-Action Framework for Weight-Aware Robotic Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models have recently emerged as a promising paradigm for robotic control, enabling end-to-end policies that ground natural language instructions into visuomotor actions. However, current VLAs often struggle to satisfy precise task constraints, such as stopping based on numeric thresholds, since their observation-to-action mappings are implicitly shaped by training data and lack explicit mechanisms for condition monitoring. In this work, we propose CLAW (CLIP-Language-Action for Weight), a framework that decouples condition evaluation from action generation. CLAW leverages a fine-tuned CLIP model as a lightweight prompt generator, which continuously monitors the digital readout of a scale and produces discrete directives based on task-specific weight thresholds. These prompts are then consumed by $\pi_0$, a flow-based VLA policy, which integrates the prompts with multi-view camera observations to produce continuous robot actions. This design enables CLAW to combine symbolic weight reasoning with high-frequency visuomotor control. We validate CLAW on three experimental setups: single-object grasping and mixed-object tasks requiring dual-arm manipulation. Across all conditions, CLAW reliably executes weight-aware behaviors and outperforms both raw-$\pi_0$ and fine-tuned $\pi_0$ models. We have uploaded the videos as supplementary materials.</description>

      <title>StableTracker: Learning to Stably Track Target via Differentiable Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: FPV object tracking methods heavily rely on handcraft modular designs, resulting in hardware overload and cumulative error, which seriously degrades the tracking performance, especially for rapidly accelerating or decelerating targets. To address these challenges, we present \textbf{StableTracker}, a learning-based control policy that enables quadrotors to robustly follow the moving target from arbitrary perspectives. The policy is trained using backpropagation-through-time via differentiable simulation, allowing the quadrotor to maintain the target at the center of the visual field in both horizontal and vertical directions, while keeping a fixed relative distance, thereby functioning as an autonomous aerial camera. We compare StableTracker against both state-of-the-art traditional algorithms and learning baselines. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our policy achieves superior accuracy, stability and generalization across varying safe distances, trajectories, and target velocities. Furthermore, a real-world experiment on a quadrotor with an onboard computer validated practicality of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>MIMIC-D: Multi-modal Imitation for MultI-agent Coordination with Decentralized Diffusion Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As robots become more integrated in society, their ability to coordinate with other robots and humans on multi-modal tasks (those with multiple valid solutions) is crucial. We propose to learn such behaviors from expert demonstrations via imitation learning (IL). However, when expert demonstrations are multi-modal, standard IL approaches can struggle to capture the diverse strategies, hindering effective coordination. Diffusion models are known to be effective at handling complex multi-modal trajectory distributions in single-agent systems. Diffusion models have also excelled in multi-agent scenarios where multi-modality is more common and crucial to learning coordinated behaviors. Typically, diffusion-based approaches require a centralized planner or explicit communication among agents, but this assumption can fail in real-world scenarios where robots must operate independently or with agents like humans that they cannot directly communicate with. Therefore, we propose MIMIC-D, a Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution (CTDE) paradigm for multi-modal multi-agent imitation learning using diffusion policies. Agents are trained jointly with full information, but execute policies using only local information to achieve implicit coordination. We demonstrate in both simulation and hardware experiments that our method recovers multi-modal coordination behavior among agents in a variety of tasks and environments, while improving upon state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>\textsc{Gen2Real}: Towards Demo-Free Dexterous Manipulation by Harnessing Generated Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dexterous manipulation remains a challenging robotics problem, largely due to the difficulty of collecting extensive human demonstrations for learning. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{Gen2Real}, which replaces costly human demos with one generated video and drives robot skill from it: it combines demonstration generation that leverages video generation with pose and depth estimation to yield hand-object trajectories, trajectory optimization that uses Physics-aware Interaction Optimization Model (PIOM) to impose physics consistency, and demonstration learning that retargets human motions to a robot hand and stabilizes control with an anchor-based residual Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy. Using only generated videos, the learned policy achieves a 77.3\% success rate on grasping tasks in simulation and demonstrates coherent executions on a real robot. We also conduct ablation studies to validate the contribution of each component and demonstrate the ability to directly specify tasks using natural language, highlighting the flexibility and robustness of \textsc{Gen2Real} in generalizing grasping skills from imagined videos to real-world execution.</description>

      <title>MCGS-SLAM: A Multi-Camera SLAM Framework Using Gaussian Splatting for High-Fidelity Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progress in dense SLAM has primarily targeted monocular setups, often at the expense of robustness and geometric coverage. We present MCGS-SLAM, the first purely RGB-based multi-camera SLAM system built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Unlike prior methods relying on sparse maps or inertial data, MCGS-SLAM fuses dense RGB inputs from multiple viewpoints into a unified, continuously optimized Gaussian map. A multi-camera bundle adjustment (MCBA) jointly refines poses and depths via dense photometric and geometric residuals, while a scale consistency module enforces metric alignment across views using low-rank priors. The system supports RGB input and maintains real-time performance at large scale. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that MCGS-SLAM consistently yields accurate trajectories and photorealistic reconstructions, usually outperforming monocular baselines. Notably, the wide field of view from multi-camera input enables reconstruction of side-view regions that monocular setups miss, critical for safe autonomous operation. These results highlight the promise of multi-camera Gaussian Splatting SLAM for high-fidelity mapping in robotics and autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>GLIDE: A Coordinated Aerial-Ground Framework for Search and Rescue in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cooperative aerial-ground search-and-rescue (SAR) framework that pairs two unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to achieve rapid victim localization and obstacle-aware navigation in unknown environments. We dub this framework Guided Long-horizon Integrated Drone Escort (GLIDE), highlighting the UGV's reliance on UAV guidance for long-horizon planning. In our framework, a goal-searching UAV executes real-time onboard victim detection and georeferencing to nominate goals for the ground platform, while a terrain-scouting UAV flies ahead of the UGV's planned route to provide mid-level traversability updates. The UGV fuses aerial cues with local sensing to perform time-efficient A* planning and continuous replanning as information arrives. Additionally, we present a hardware demonstration (using a GEM e6 golf cart as the UGV and two X500 UAVs) to evaluate end-to-end SAR mission performance and include simulation ablations to assess the planning stack in isolation from detection. Empirical results demonstrate that explicit role separation across UAVs, coupled with terrain scouting and guided planning, improves reach time and navigation safety in time-critical SAR missions.</description>

      <title>Multi-robot Multi-source Localization in Complex Flows with Physics-Preserving Environment Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source localization in a complex flow poses a significant challenge for multi-robot teams tasked with localizing the source of chemical leaks or tracking the dispersion of an oil spill. The flow dynamics can be time-varying and chaotic, resulting in sporadic and intermittent sensor readings, and complex environmental geometries further complicate a team's ability to model and predict the dispersion. To accurately account for the physical processes that drive the dispersion dynamics, robots must have access to computationally intensive numerical models, which can be difficult when onboard computation is limited. We present a distributed mobile sensing framework for source localization in which each robot carries a machine-learned, finite element model of its environment to guide information-based sampling. The models are used to evaluate an approximate mutual information criterion to drive an infotaxis control strategy, which selects sensing regions that are expected to maximize informativeness for the source localization objective. Our approach achieves faster error reduction compared to baseline sensing strategies and results in more accurate source localization compared to baseline machine learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI-Enhanced Supervisory Control for High-Precision Spacecraft Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use artificial intelligence (AI) and supervisory adaptive control systems to plan and optimize the mission of precise spacecraft formation. Machine learning and robust control enhance the efficiency of spacecraft precision formation of the Virtual Telescope for X-ray Observation (VTXO) space mission. VTXO is a precise formation of two separate spacecraft making a virtual telescope with a one-kilometer focal length. One spacecraft carries the lens and the other spacecraft holds the camera to observe high-energy space objects in the X-ray domain with 55 milli-arcsecond angular resolution accuracy. Timed automata for supervisory control, Monte Carlo simulations for stability and robustness evaluation, and integration of deep neural networks for optimal estimation of mission parameters, satisfy the high precision mission criteria. We integrate deep neural networks with a constrained, non-convex dynamic optimization pipeline to predict optimal mission parameters, ensuring precision mission criteria are met. AI framework provides explainability by predicting the resulting energy consumption and mission error for a given set of mission parameters. It allows for transparent, justifiable, and real-time trade-offs, a capability not present in traditional adaptive controllers. The results show reductions in energy consumption and improved mission accuracy, demonstrating the capability of the system to address dynamic uncertainties and disturbances.</description>

      <title>Agentic UAVs: LLM-Driven Autonomy with Integrated Tool-Calling and Cognitive Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in defense, surveillance, and disaster response, yet most systems remain confined to SAE Level 2--3 autonomy. Their reliance on rule-based control and narrow AI restricts adaptability in dynamic, uncertain missions. Existing UAV frameworks lack context-aware reasoning, autonomous decision-making, and ecosystem-level integration; critically, none leverage Large Language Model (LLM) agents with tool-calling for real-time knowledge access. This paper introduces the Agentic UAVs framework, a five-layer architecture (Perception, Reasoning, Action, Integration, Learning) that augments UAVs with LLM-driven reasoning, database querying, and third-party system interaction. A ROS2 and Gazebo-based prototype integrates YOLOv11 object detection with GPT-4 reasoning and local Gemma-3 deployment. In simulated search-and-rescue scenarios, agentic UAVs achieved higher detection confidence (0.79 vs. 0.72), improved person detection rates (91% vs. 75%), and markedly increased action recommendation (92% vs. 4.5%). These results confirm that modest computational overhead enables qualitatively new levels of autonomy and ecosystem integration.</description>

      <title>MapAnything: Universal Feed-Forward Metric 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce MapAnything, a unified transformer-based feed-forward model that ingests one or more images along with optional geometric inputs such as camera intrinsics, poses, depth, or partial reconstructions, and then directly regresses the metric 3D scene geometry and cameras. MapAnything leverages a factored representation of multi-view scene geometry, i.e., a collection of depth maps, local ray maps, camera poses, and a metric scale factor that effectively upgrades local reconstructions into a globally consistent metric frame. Standardizing the supervision and training across diverse datasets, along with flexible input augmentation, enables MapAnything to address a broad range of 3D vision tasks in a single feed-forward pass, including uncalibrated structure-from-motion, calibrated multi-view stereo, monocular depth estimation, camera localization, depth completion, and more. We provide extensive experimental analyses and model ablations demonstrating that MapAnything outperforms or matches specialist feed-forward models while offering more efficient joint training behavior, thus paving the way toward a universal 3D reconstruction backbone.</description>

      <title>Multi-Attacker Single-Defender Target Defense in Conical Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a variant of the target defense problem in a planar conical environment where a single defender is tasked to capture a sequence of incoming attackers. The attackers' objective is to breach the target boundary without being captured by the defender. As soon as the current attacker breaches the target or gets captured by the defender, the next attacker appears at the boundary of the environment and moves radially toward the target with maximum speed. Therefore, the defender's final location at the end of the current game becomes its initial location for the next game. The attackers pick strategies that are advantageous for the current as well as for future engagements between the defender and the remaining attackers. The attackers have their own sensors with limited range, using which they can perfectly detect if the defender is within their sensing range. We derive equilibrium strategies for all the players to optimize the capture percentage using the notions of capture distribution. Finally, the theoretical results are verified through numerical examples using Monte Carlo type random trials of experiments.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Aware: Adaptive Multi-Mode Out-of-Distribution Detection for Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction is central to the safe and seamless operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In deployment, however, prediction models inevitably face distribution shifts between training data and real-world conditions, where rare or underrepresented traffic scenarios induce out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. While most prior OOD detection research in AVs has concentrated on computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation, trajectory-level OOD detection remains largely underexplored. A recent study formulated this problem as a quickest change detection (QCD) task, providing formal guarantees on the trade-off between detection delay and false alarms [1]. Building on this foundation, we propose a new framework that introduces adaptive mechanisms to achieve robust detection in complex driving environments. Empirical analysis across multiple real-world datasets reveals that prediction errors -- even on in-distribution samples -- exhibit mode-dependent distributions that evolve over time with dataset-specific dynamics. By explicitly modeling these error modes, our method achieves substantial improvements in both detection delay and false alarm rates. Comprehensive experiments on established trajectory prediction benchmarks show that our framework significantly outperforms prior UQ- and vision-based OOD approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical path toward reliable, driving-aware autonomy.</description>

      <title>A Generalization of CLAP from 3D Localization to Image Processing, A Connection With RANSAC &amp; Hough Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In previous work, we introduced a 2D localization algorithm called CLAP, Clustering to Localize Across $n$ Possibilities, which was used during our championship win in RoboCup 2024, an international autonomous humanoid soccer competition. CLAP is particularly recognized for its robustness against outliers, where clustering is employed to suppress noise and mitigate against erroneous feature matches. This clustering-based strategy provides an alternative to traditional outlier rejection schemes such as RANSAC, in which candidates are validated by reprojection error across all data points. In this paper, CLAP is extended to a more general framework beyond 2D localization, specifically to 3D localization and image stitching. We also show how CLAP, RANSAC, and Hough transforms are related. The generalization of CLAP is widely applicable to many different fields and can be a useful tool to deal with noise and uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Conformal Temporal Logic Planning using Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10092v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses planning problems for mobile robots. We consider missions that require accomplishing multiple high-level sub-tasks, expressed in natural language (NL), in a temporal and logical order. To formally define the mission, we treat these sub-tasks as atomic predicates in a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula. We refer to this task specification framework as LTL-NL. Our goal is to design plans, defined as sequences of robot actions, accomplishing LTL-NL tasks. This action planning problem cannot be solved directly by existing LTL planners because of the NL nature of atomic predicates. To address it, we propose HERACLEs, a hierarchical neuro-symbolic planner that relies on a novel integration of (i) existing symbolic planners generating high-level task plans determining the order at which the NL sub-tasks should be accomplished; (ii) pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to design sequences of robot actions based on these task plans; and (iii) conformal prediction acting as a formal interface between (i) and (ii) and managing uncertainties due to LLM imperfections. We show, both theoretically and empirically, that HERACLEs can achieve user-defined mission success rates. Finally, we provide comparative experiments demonstrating that HERACLEs outperforms LLM-based planners that require the mission to be defined solely using NL. Additionally, we present examples demonstrating that our approach enhances user-friendliness compared to conventional symbolic approaches.</description>

      <title>Learning Multimodal Attention for Manipulating Deformable Objects with Changing States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To support humans in their daily lives, robots are required to autonomously learn, adapt to objects and environments, and perform the appropriate actions. We tackled on the task of cooking scrambled eggs using real ingredients, in which the robot needs to perceive the states of the egg and adjust stirring movement in real time, while the egg is heated and the state changes continuously. In previous works, handling changing objects was found to be challenging because sensory information includes dynamical, both important or noisy information, and the modality which should be focused on changes every time, making it difficult to realize both perception and motion generation in real time. We propose a predictive recurrent neural network with an attention mechanism that can weigh the sensor input, distinguishing how important and reliable each modality is, that realize quick and efficient perception and motion generation. The model is trained with learning from the demonstration, and allows the robot to acquire human-like skills. We validated the proposed technique using the robot, Dry-AIREC, and with our learning model, it could perform cooking eggs with unknown ingredients. The robot could change the method of stirring and direction depending on the status of the egg, as in the beginning it stirs in the whole pot, then subsequently, after the egg started being heated, it starts flipping and splitting motion targeting specific areas, although we did not explicitly indicate them.</description>

      <title>Video-Language Critic: Transferable Reward Functions for Language-Conditioned Robotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Natural language is often the easiest and most convenient modality for humans to specify tasks for robots. However, learning to ground language to behavior typically requires impractical amounts of diverse, language-annotated demonstrations collected on each target robot. In this work, we aim to separate the problem of what to accomplish from how to accomplish it, as the former can benefit from substantial amounts of external observation-only data, and only the latter depends on a specific robot embodiment. To this end, we propose Video-Language Critic, a reward model that can be trained on readily available cross-embodiment data using contrastive learning and a temporal ranking objective, and use it to score behavior traces from a separate actor. When trained on Open X-Embodiment data, our reward model enables 2x more sample-efficient policy training on Meta-World tasks than a sparse reward only, despite a significant domain gap. Using in-domain data but in a challenging task generalization setting on Meta-World, we further demonstrate more sample-efficient training than is possible with prior language-conditioned reward models that are either trained with binary classification, use static images, or do not leverage the temporal information present in video data.</description>

      <title>Brain Inspired Probabilistic Occupancy Grid Mapping with Vector Symbolic Architectures</title>

Abstract: Real-time robotic systems require advanced perception, computation, and action capability. However, the main bottleneck in current autonomous systems is the trade-off between computational capability, energy efficiency and model determinism. World modeling, a key objective of many robotic systems, commonly uses occupancy grid mapping (OGM) as the first step towards building an end-to-end robotic system with perception, planning, autonomous maneuvering, and decision making capabilities. OGM divides the environment into discrete cells and assigns probability values to attributes such as occupancy and traversability. Existing methods fall into two categories: traditional methods and neural methods. Traditional methods rely on dense statistical calculations, while neural methods employ deep learning for probabilistic information processing. In this study, we propose a vector symbolic architecture-based OGM system (VSA-OGM) that retains the interpretability and stability of traditional methods with the improved computational efficiency of neural methods. Our approach, validated across multiple datasets, achieves similar accuracy to covariant traditional methods while reducing latency by approximately 45x and memory by 400x. Compared to invariant traditional methods, we see similar accuracy values while reducing latency by 5.5x. Moreover, we achieve up to 6x latency reductions compared to neural methods while eliminating the need for domain-specific model training. This work demonstrates the potential of vector symbolic architectures as a practical foundation for real-time probabilistic mapping in autonomous systems operating under strict computational and latency constraints.</description>

      <title>FlowAct: A Proactive Multimodal Human-robot Interaction System with Continuous Flow of Perception and Modular Action Sub-systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15864v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of autonomous systems in the context of human-robot interaction systems necessitates a synergy between the continuous perception of the environment and the potential actions to navigate or interact within it. We present Flowact, a proactive multimodal human-robot interaction architecture, working as an asynchronous endless loop of robot sensors into actuators and organized by two controllers, the Environment State Tracking (EST) and the Action Planner. The EST continuously collects and publishes a representation of the operative environment, ensuring a steady flow of perceptual data. This persistent perceptual flow is pivotal for our advanced Action Planner which orchestrates a collection of modular action subsystems, such as movement and speaking modules, governing their initiation or cessation based on the evolving environmental narrative. The EST employs a fusion of diverse sensory modalities to build a rich, real-time representation of the environment that is distributed to the Action Planner. This planner uses a decision-making framework to dynamically coordinate action modules, allowing them to respond proactively and coherently to changes in the environment. Through a series of real-world experiments, we exhibit the efficacy of the system in maintaining a continuous perception-action loop, substantially enhancing the responsiveness and adaptability of autonomous pro-active agents. The modular architecture of the action subsystems facilitates easy extensibility and adaptability to a broad spectrum of tasks and scenarios.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical LLMs In-the-loop Optimization for Real-time Multi-Robot Target Tracking under Unknown Hazards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time multi-robot coordination in hazardous and adversarial environments requires fast, reliable adaptation to dynamic threats. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong high-level reasoning capabilities, the lack of safety guarantees limits their direct use in critical decision-making. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical optimization framework that integrates LLMs into the decision loop for multi-robot target tracking in dynamic and hazardous environments. Rather than generating control actions directly, LLMs are used to generate task configuration and adjust parameters in a bi-level task allocation and planning problem. We formulate multi-robot coordination for tracking tasks as a bi-level optimization problem, with LLMs to reason about potential hazards in the environment and the status of the robot team and modify both the inner and outer levels of the optimization. This hierarchical approach enables real-time adjustments to the robots' behavior. Additionally, a human supervisor can offer broad guidance and assessments to address unexpected dangers, model mismatches, and performance issues arising from local minima. We validate our proposed framework in both simulation and real-world experiments with comprehensive evaluations, demonstrating its effectiveness and showcasing its capability for safe LLM integration for multi-robot systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Active Perception for Learning Simultaneous Viewpoint Selection and Manipulation with Diffusion Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation tasks often rely on static cameras for perception, which can limit flexibility, particularly in scenarios like robotic surgery and cluttered environments where mounting static cameras is impractical. Ideally, robots could jointly learn a policy for dynamic viewpoint and manipulation. However, dynamic viewpoint control requires additional degrees of freedom and intricate coordination with manipulation, which results in more challenging policy learning than single-arm manipulation. To address this complexity, we propose an integrated learning framework that combines diffusion policy with a novel look-at inverse kinematics solver for active perception. Our framework helps better coordinating between perception and manipulation. It automatically optimizes camera orientation for viewpoint selection, while allowing the policy to focus on essential manipulation and positioning decisions. We demonstrate that our integrated approach achieves superior performance and learning efficiency compared to directly applying diffusion policies to configuration space or end-effector space with various rotation representations. Further analysis suggests that these performance differences are driven by inherent variations in the high-frequency components across different state-action spaces.</description>

      <title>AUTO-IceNav: A Local Navigation Strategy for Autonomous Surface Ships in Broken Ice Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ice conditions often require ships to reduce speed and deviate from their main course to avoid damage to the ship. In addition, broken ice fields are becoming the dominant ice conditions encountered in the Arctic, where the effects of collisions with ice are highly dependent on where contact occurs and on the particular features of the ice floes. In this paper, we present AUTO-IceNav, a framework for the autonomous navigation of ships operating in ice floe fields. Trajectories are computed in a receding-horizon manner, where we frequently replan given updated ice field data. During a planning step, we assume a nominal speed that is safe with respect to the current ice conditions, and compute a reference path. We formulate a novel cost function that minimizes the kinetic energy loss of the ship from ship-ice collisions and incorporate this cost as part of our lattice-based path planner. The solution computed by the lattice planning stage is then used as an initial guess in our proposed optimization-based improvement step, producing a locally optimal path. Extensive experiments were conducted both in simulation and in a physical testbed to validate our approach.</description>

      <title>ORCA: An Open-Source, Reliable, Cost-Effective, Anthropomorphic Robotic Hand for Uninterrupted Dexterous Task Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: General-purpose robots should possess human-like dexterity and agility to perform tasks with the same versatility as us. A human-like form factor further enables the use of vast datasets of human-hand interactions. However, the primary bottleneck in dexterous manipulation lies not only in software but arguably even more in hardware. Robotic hands that approach human capabilities are often prohibitively expensive, bulky, or require enterprise-level maintenance, limiting their accessibility for broader research and practical applications. What if the research community could get started with reliable dexterous hands within a day? We present the open-source ORCA hand, a reliable and anthropomorphic 17-DoF tendon-driven robotic hand with integrated tactile sensors, fully assembled in less than eight hours and built for a material cost below 2,000 CHF. We showcase ORCA's key design features such as popping joints, auto-calibration, and tensioning systems that significantly reduce complexity while increasing reliability, accuracy, and robustness. We benchmark the ORCA hand across a variety of tasks, ranging from teleoperation and imitation learning to zero-shot sim-to-real reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we demonstrate its durability, withstanding more than 10,000 continuous operation cycles - equivalent to approximately 20 hours - without hardware failure, the only constraint being the duration of the experiment itself.

      <title>Humanoid Agent via Embodied Chain-of-Action Reasoning with Multimodal Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Loco-Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Humanoid loco-manipulation, which integrates whole-body locomotion with dexterous manipulation, remains a fundamental challenge in robotics. Beyond whole-body coordination and balance, a central difficulty lies in understanding human instructions and translating them into coherent sequences of embodied actions. Recent advances in foundation models provide transferable multimodal representations and reasoning capabilities, yet existing efforts remain largely restricted to either locomotion or manipulation in isolation, with limited applicability to humanoid settings. In this paper, we propose Humanoid-COA, the first humanoid agent framework that integrates foundation model reasoning with an Embodied Chain-of-Action (CoA) mechanism for zero-shot loco-manipulation. Within the perception--reasoning--action paradigm, our key contribution lies in the reasoning stage, where the proposed CoA mechanism decomposes high-level human instructions into structured sequences of locomotion and manipulation primitives through affordance analysis, spatial inference, and whole-body action reasoning. Extensive experiments on two humanoid robots, Unitree H1-2 and G1, in both an open test area and an apartment environment, demonstrate that our framework substantially outperforms prior baselines across manipulation, locomotion, and loco-manipulation tasks, achieving robust generalization to long-horizon and unstructured scenarios.

      <title>PRISM-DP: Spatial Pose-based Observations for Diffusion-Policies via Segmentation, Mesh Generation, and Pose Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion policies generate robot motions by learning to denoise action-space trajectories conditioned on observations. These observations are commonly streams of RGB images, whose high dimensionality includes substantial task-irrelevant information, requiring large models to extract relevant patterns. In contrast, using structured observations like the spatial poses of key objects enables training more compact policies with fewer parameters. However, obtaining accurate object poses in open-set, real-world environments remains challenging, as 6D pose estimation and tracking methods often depend on markers placed on objects beforehand or pre-scanned object meshes that require manual reconstruction. We propose PRISM-DP, an approach that leverages segmentation, mesh generation, and pose tracking models to enable compact diffusion policy learning directly from the spatial poses of task-relevant objects. Crucially, by using a mesh generation model, PRISM-DP eliminates the need for manual mesh creation, improving scalability in open-set environments. Experiments in simulation and the real world show that PRISM-DP outperforms high-dimensional image-based policies and achieves performance comparable to policies trained with ground-truth state information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent interaction with the real world requires robotic agents to jointly reason over high-level plans and low-level controls. Task and motion planning (TAMP) addresses this by combining symbolic planning and continuous trajectory generation. Recently, foundation model approaches to TAMP have presented impressive results, including fast planning times and the execution of natural language instructions. Yet, the optimal interface between high-level planning and low-level motion generation remains an open question: prior approaches are limited by either too much abstraction (e.g., chaining simplified skill primitives) or a lack thereof (e.g., direct joint angle prediction). Our method introduces a novel technique employing a form of meta-optimization to address these issues by: (i) using program search over trajectory optimization problems as an interface between a foundation model and robot control, and (ii) leveraging a zero-order method to optimize numerical parameters in the foundation model output. Results on challenging object manipulation and drawing tasks confirm that our proposed method improves over prior TAMP approaches.</description>

      <title>Search-TTA: A Multimodal Test-Time Adaptation Framework for Visual Search in the Wild</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11350v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To perform outdoor autonomous visual navigation and search, a robot may leverage satellite imagery as a prior map. This can help inform high-level search and exploration strategies, even when such images lack sufficient resolution to allow for visual recognition of targets. However, there are limited training datasets of satellite images with annotated targets that are not directly visible. Furthermore, approaches which leverage large Vision Language Models (VLMs) for generalization may yield inaccurate outputs due to hallucination, leading to inefficient search. To address these challenges, we introduce Search-TTA, a multimodal test-time adaptation framework with a flexible plug-and-play interface compatible with various input modalities (e.g. image, text, sound) and planning methods. First, we pretrain a satellite image encoder to align with CLIP's visual encoder to output probability distributions of target presence used for visual search. Second, our framework dynamically refines CLIP's predictions during search using a test-time adaptation mechanism. Through a novel feedback loop inspired by Spatial Poisson Point Processes, uncertainty-weighted gradient updates are used to correct potentially inaccurate predictions and improve search performance. To train and evaluate Search-TTA, we curate AVS-Bench, a visual search dataset based on internet-scale ecological data that contains up to 380k training and 8k validation images (in- and out-domain). We find that Search-TTA improves planner performance by up to 30.0%, particularly in cases with poor initial CLIP predictions due to limited training data. It also performs comparably with significantly larger VLMs, and achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen modalities. Finally, we deploy Search-TTA on a real UAV via hardware-in-the-loop testing, by simulating its operation within a large-scale simulation that provides onboard sensing.</description>

      <title>Efficient Tactile Perception with Soft Electrical Impedance Tomography and Pre-trained Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tactile sensing is fundamental to robotic systems, enabling interactions through physical contact in multiple tasks. Despite its importance, achieving high-resolution, large-area tactile sensing remains challenging. Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) has emerged as a promising approach for large-area, distributed tactile sensing with minimal electrode requirements which can lend itself to addressing complex contact problems in robotics. However, existing EIT-based tactile reconstruction methods often suffer from high computational costs or depend on extensive annotated simulation datasets, hindering its viability in real-world settings. To address this shortcoming, here we propose a Pre-trained Transformer for EIT-based Tactile Reconstruction (PTET), a learning-based framework that bridges the simulation-to-reality gap by leveraging self-supervised pretraining on simulation data and fine-tuning with limited real-world data. In simulations, PTET requires 99.44 percent fewer annotated samples than equivalent state-of-the-art approaches (2,500 vs. 450,000 samples) while achieving reconstruction performance improvements of up to 43.57 percent under identical data conditions. Fine-tuning with real-world data further enables PTET to overcome discrepancies between simulated and experimental datasets, achieving superior reconstruction and detail recovery in practical scenarios. The improved reconstruction accuracy, data efficiency, and robustness in real-world tasks establish it as a scalable and practical solution for tactile sensing systems in robotics, especially for object handling and adaptive grasping under varying pressure conditions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Diffusion Policies with Projective Geometric Algebra for Efficient Robot Manipulation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion policies are a powerful paradigm for robot learning, but their training is often inefficient. A key reason is that networks must relearn fundamental spatial concepts, such as translations and rotations, from scratch for every new task. To alleviate this redundancy, we propose embedding geometric inductive biases directly into the network architecture using Projective Geometric Algebra (PGA). PGA provides a unified algebraic framework for representing geometric primitives and transformations, allowing neural networks to reason about spatial structure more effectively. In this paper, we introduce hPGA-DP, a novel hybrid diffusion policy that capitalizes on these benefits. Our architecture leverages the Projective Geometric Algebra Transformer (P-GATr) as a state encoder and action decoder, while employing established U-Net or Transformer-based modules for the core denoising process. Through extensive experiments and ablation studies in both simulated and real-world environments, we demonstrate that hPGA-DP significantly improves task performance and training efficiency. Notably, our hybrid approach achieves substantially faster convergence compared to both standard diffusion policies and architectures that rely solely on P-GATr.</description>

      <title>Fluidically Innervated Lattices Make Versatile and Durable Tactile Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tactile sensing plays a fundamental role in enabling robots to navigate dynamic and unstructured environments, particularly in applications such as delicate object manipulation, surface exploration, and human-robot interaction. In this paper, we introduce a passive soft robotic fingertip with integrated tactile sensing, fabricated using a 3D-printed elastomer lattice with embedded air channels. This sensorization approach, termed fluidic innervation, transforms the lattice into a tactile sensor by detecting pressure changes within sealed air channels, providing a simple yet robust solution to tactile sensing in robotics. Unlike conventional methods that rely on complex materials or designs, fluidic innervation offers a simple, scalable, single-material fabrication process. We characterize the sensors' response, develop a geometric model to estimate tip displacement, and train a neural network to accurately predict contact location and contact force. Additionally, we integrate the fingertip with an admittance controller to emulate spring-like behavior, demonstrate its capability for environment exploration through tactile feedback, and validate its durability under high impact and cyclic loading conditions. This tactile sensing technique offers advantages in terms of simplicity, adaptability, and durability and opens up new opportunities for versatile robotic manipulation.</description>

Abstract: Air-land bimodal vehicles provide a promising solution for navigating complex environments by combining the flexibility of aerial locomotion with the energy efficiency of ground mobility. However, planning dynamically feasible, smooth, collision-free, and energy-efficient trajectories remains challenging due to two key factors: 1) unknown dynamic disturbances in both aerial and terrestrial domains, and 2) the inherent complexity of managing bimodal dynamics with distinct constraint characteristics. This paper proposes a disturbance-aware motion-planning framework that addresses this challenge through real-time disturbance estimation and adaptive trajectory generation. The framework comprises two key components: 1) a disturbance-adaptive safety boundary adjustment mechanism that dynamically determines the feasible region of dynamic constraints for both air and land modes based on estimated disturbances via a disturbance observer, and 2) a constraint-adaptive bimodal motion planner that integrates disturbance-aware path searching to guide trajectories toward regions with reduced disturbances and B-spline-based trajectory optimization to refine trajectories within the established feasible constraint boundaries. Experimental validation on a self-developed air-land bimodal vehicle demonstrates substantial performance improvements across three representative disturbance scenarios, achieving an average 33.9% reduction in trajectory tracking error while still maintaining superior time-energy trade-offs compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Nominal Evaluation Of Automatic Multi-Sections Control Potential In Comparison To A Simpler One- Or Two-Sections Alternative With Predictive Spray Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automatic Section Control (ASC) is a long-standing trend for spraying in agriculture. It promises to minimise spray overlap areas. The core idea is to (i) switch off spray nozzles on areas that have already been sprayed, and (ii) to dynamically adjust nozzle flow rates along the boom bar that holds the spray nozzles when velocities of boom sections vary during turn maneuvers. ASC is not possible without sensors for accurate positioning data. Spraying and the movement of modern wide boom bars are highly dynamic processes. In addition, many uncertainty factors have an effect such as cross wind drift, nozzle clogging in open-field conditions, etc. In view of this complexity, the natural question arises if a simpler alternative exist. Therefore, ASC is compared to a proposed simpler one- or two-sections alternative that uses predictive spray switching. The comparison is provided under nominal conditions. Agricultural spraying is intrinsically linked to area coverage path planning and spray switching logic. Combinations of two area coverage path planning and switching logics as well as 3 sections-setups are compared. The three sections-setups differ by controlling 48 sections, 2 sections or controlling all nozzles uniformly with the same control signal as one single section. Methods are evaluated on 10 diverse real-world field examples, including non-convex field contours, freeform mainfield lanes and multiple obstacle areas. An economic cost analysis is provided to compare the methods. A preferred method is suggested that (i) minimises area coverage pathlength, (ii) offers intermediate overlap, (iii) is suitable for manual driving by following a pre-planned predictive spray switching logic for an area coverage path plan, and (iv) and in contrast to ASC can be implemented sensor-free and at low cost. Surprisingly strong economic arguments are found to not recommend ASC for small farms.</description>

      <title>GWM: Towards Scalable Gaussian World Models for Robotic Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the inefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model (GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling potential of 3D world model.</description>

      <title>Mining the Long Tail: A Comparative Study of Data-Centric Criticality Metrics for Robust Offline Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising paradigm for training autonomous vehicle (AV) planning policies from large-scale, real-world driving logs. However, the extreme data imbalance in these logs, where mundane scenarios vastly outnumber rare "long-tail" events, leads to brittle and unsafe policies when using standard uniform data sampling. In this work, we address this challenge through a systematic, large-scale comparative study of data curation strategies designed to focus the learning process on information-rich samples. We investigate six distinct criticality weighting schemes which are categorized into three families: heuristic-based, uncertainty-based, and behavior-based. These are evaluated at two temporal scales, the individual timestep and the complete scenario. We train seven goal-conditioned Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) agents with a state-of-the-art, attention-based architecture and evaluate them in the high-fidelity Waymax simulator. Our results demonstrate that all data curation methods significantly outperform the baseline. Notably, data-driven curation using model uncertainty as a signal achieves the most significant safety improvements, reducing the collision rate by nearly three-fold (from 16.0% to 5.5%). Furthermore, we identify a clear trade-off where timestep-level weighting excels at reactive safety while scenario-level weighting improves long-horizon planning. Our work provides a comprehensive framework for data curation in Offline RL and underscores that intelligent, non-uniform sampling is a critical component for building safe and reliable autonomous agents.</description>

      <title>One-Step Model Predictive Path Integral for Manipulator Motion Planning Using Configuration Space Distance Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motion planning for robotic manipulators is a fundamental problem in robotics. Classical optimization-based methods typically rely on the gradients of signed distance fields (SDFs) to impose collision-avoidance constraints. However, these methods are susceptible to local minima and may fail when the SDF gradients vanish. Recently, Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDFs) have been introduced, which directly model distances in the robot's configuration space. Unlike workspace SDFs, CDFs are differentiable almost everywhere and thus provide reliable gradient information. On the other hand, gradient-free approaches such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control leverage long-horizon rollouts to achieve collision avoidance. While effective, these methods are computationally expensive due to the large number of trajectory samples, repeated collision checks, and the difficulty of designing cost functions with heterogeneous physical units. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates CDFs with MPPI to enable direct navigation in the robot's configuration space. Leveraging CDF gradients, we unify the MPPI cost in joint-space and reduce the horizon to one step, substantially cutting computation while preserving collision avoidance in practice. We demonstrate that our approach achieves nearly 100% success rates in 2D environments and consistently high success rates in challenging 7-DOF Franka manipulator simulations with complex obstacles. Furthermore, our method attains control frequencies exceeding 750 Hz, substantially outperforming both optimization-based and standard MPPI baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CDF-MPPI framework for high-dimensional motion planning.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Reactive Grasping via Task-Space Velocity Fields and Joint-Space Quadratic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a fast and reactive grasping framework that combines task-space velocity fields with joint-space Quadratic Program (QP) in a hierarchical structure. Reactive, collision-free global motion planning is particularly challenging for high-DoF systems, as simultaneous increases in state dimensionality and planning horizon trigger a combinatorial explosion of the search space, making real-time planning intractable. To address this, we plan globally in a lower-dimensional task space, such as fingertip positions, and track locally in the full joint space while enforcing all constraints. This approach is realized by constructing velocity fields in multiple task-space coordinates (or, in some cases, a subset of joint coordinates) and solving a weighted joint-space QP to compute joint velocities that track these fields with appropriately assigned priorities. Through simulation experiments and real-world tests using the recent pose-tracking algorithm FoundationPose, we verify that our method enables high-DoF arm-hand systems to perform real-time, collision-free reaching motions while adapting to dynamic environments and external disturbances.</description>

      <title>Robust Docking Maneuvers for Autonomous Trolley Collection: An Optimization-Based Visual Servoing Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Service robots have demonstrated significant potential for autonomous trolley collection and redistribution in public spaces like airports or warehouses to improve efficiency and reduce cost. Usually, a fully autonomous system for the collection and transportation of multiple trolleys is based on a Leader-Follower formation of mobile manipulators, where reliable docking maneuvers of the mobile base are essential to align trolleys into organized queues. However, developing a vision-based robotic docking system faces significant challenges: high precision requirements, environmental disturbances, and inherent robot constraints. To address these challenges, we propose an optimization-based Visual Servoing scheme that incorporates active infrared markers for robust feature extraction across diverse lighting conditions. This framework explicitly models nonholonomic kinematics and visibility constraints within the Hybrid Visual Servoing problem, augmented with an observer for disturbance rejection to ensure precise and stable docking. Experimental results across diverse environments demonstrate the robustness of this system, with quantitative evaluations confirming high docking accuracy.</description>

      <title>Occupancy-aware Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Valet Parking in Uncertain Dynamic Environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous Valet Parking (AVP) requires planning under partial observability, where parking spot availability evolves as dynamic agents enter and exit spots. Existing approaches either rely only on instantaneous spot availability or make static assumptions, thereby limiting foresight and adaptability. We propose an approach that estimates probability of future spot occupancy by distinguishing initially vacant and occupied spots while leveraging nearby dynamic agent motion. We propose a probabilistic estimator that integrates partial, noisy observations from a limited Field-of-View, with the evolving uncertainty of unobserved spots. Coupled with the estimator, we design a strategy planner that balances goal-directed parking maneuvers with exploratory navigation based on information gain, and incorporates wait-and-go behaviors at promising spots. Through randomized simulations emulating large parking lots, we demonstrate that our framework significantly improves parking efficiency and trajectory smoothness over existing approaches, while maintaining safety margins.</description>

      <title>DECAMP: Towards Scene-Consistent Multi-Agent Motion Prediction with Disentangled Context-Aware Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a critical component of autonomous driving, essential for ensuring both safety and efficiency on the road. However, traditional approaches often struggle with the scarcity of labeled data and exhibit suboptimal performance in multi-agent prediction scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a disentangled context-aware pre-training framework for multi-agent motion prediction, named DECAMP. Unlike existing methods that entangle representation learning with pretext tasks, our framework decouples behavior pattern learning from latent feature reconstruction, prioritizing interpretable dynamics and thereby enhancing scene representation for downstream prediction. Additionally, our framework incorporates context-aware representation learning alongside collaborative spatial-motion pretext tasks, which enables joint optimization of structural and intentional reasoning while capturing the underlying dynamic intentions. Our experiments on the Argoverse 2 benchmark showcase the superior performance of our method, and the results attained underscore its effectiveness in multi-agent motion forecasting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first context autoencoder framework for multi-agent motion forecasting in autonomous driving. The code and models will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Generalization in Vision-Language-Action Models by Preserving Pretrained Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models finetuned from vision-language models (VLMs) hold the promise of leveraging rich pretrained representations to build generalist robots across diverse tasks and environments. However, direct fine-tuning on robot data often disrupts these representations and limits generalization. We present a framework that better preserves pretrained features while adapting them for robot manipulation. Our approach introduces three components: (i) a dual-encoder design with one frozen vision encoder to retain pretrained features and another trainable for task adaptation, (ii) a string-based action tokenizer that casts continuous actions into character sequences aligned with the model's pretraining domain, and (iii) a co-training strategy that combines robot demonstrations with vision-language datasets emphasizing spatial reasoning and affordances. Evaluations in simulation and on real robots show that our method improves robustness to visual perturbations, generalization to novel instructions and environments, and overall task success compared to baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action models show potential to generalize across embodiments but struggle to quickly align with a new robot's action space when high-quality demonstrations are scarce, especially for bipedal humanoids. We present TrajBooster, a cross-embodiment framework that leverages abundant wheeled-humanoid data to boost bipedal VLA. Our key idea is to use end-effector trajectories as a morphology-agnostic interface. TrajBooster (i) extracts 6D dual-arm end-effector trajectories from real-world wheeled humanoids, (ii) retargets them in simulation to Unitree G1 with a whole-body controller trained via a heuristic-enhanced harmonized online DAgger to lift low-dimensional trajectory references into feasible high-dimensional whole-body actions, and (iii) forms heterogeneous triplets that couple source vision/language with target humanoid-compatible actions to post-pre-train a VLA, followed by only 10 minutes of teleoperation data collection on the target humanoid domain. Deployed on Unitree G1, our policy achieves beyond-tabletop household tasks, enabling squatting, cross-height manipulation, and coordinated whole-body motion with markedly improved robustness and generalization. Results show that TrajBooster allows existing wheeled-humanoid data to efficiently strengthen bipedal humanoid VLA performance, reducing reliance on costly same-embodiment data while enhancing action space understanding and zero-shot skill transfer capabilities.

      <description>arXiv:2509.12129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Navigation is a fundamental capability in embodied AI, representing the intelligence required to perceive and interact within physical environments following language instructions. Despite significant progress in large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), which exhibit remarkable zero-shot performance on general vision-language tasks, their generalization ability in embodied navigation remains largely confined to narrow task settings and embodiment-specific architectures. In this work, we introduce a cross-embodiment and cross-task Navigation Foundation Model (NavFoM), trained on eight million navigation samples that encompass quadrupeds, drones, wheeled robots, and vehicles, and spanning diverse tasks such as vision-and-language navigation, object searching, target tracking, and autonomous driving. NavFoM employs a unified architecture that processes multimodal navigation inputs from varying camera configurations and navigation horizons. To accommodate diverse camera setups and temporal horizons, NavFoM incorporates identifier tokens that embed camera view information of embodiments and the temporal context of tasks. Furthermore, to meet the demands of real-world deployment, NavFoM controls all observation tokens using a dynamically adjusted sampling strategy under a limited token length budget. Extensive evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across multiple navigation tasks and embodiments without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. Additional real-world experiments further confirm the strong generalization capability and practical applicability of our approach.</description>

      <title>NavMoE: Hybrid Model- and Learning-based Traversability Estimation for Local Navigation via Mixture of Experts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores traversability estimation for robot navigation. A key bottleneck in traversability estimation lies in efficiently achieving reliable and robust predictions while accurately encoding both geometric and semantic information across diverse environments. We introduce Navigation via Mixture of Experts (NAVMOE), a hierarchical and modular approach for traversability estimation and local navigation. NAVMOE combines multiple specialized models for specific terrain types, each of which can be either a classical model-based or a learning-based approach that predicts traversability for specific terrain types. NAVMOE dynamically weights the contributions of different models based on the input environment through a gating network. Overall, our approach offers three advantages: First, NAVMOE enables traversability estimation to adaptively leverage specialized approaches for different terrains, which enhances generalization across diverse and unseen environments. Second, our approach significantly improves efficiency with negligible cost of solution quality by introducing a training-free lazy gating mechanism, which is designed to minimize the number of activated experts during inference. Third, our approach uses a two-stage training strategy that enables the training for the gating networks within the hybrid MoE method that contains nondifferentiable modules. Extensive experiments show that NAVMOE delivers a better efficiency and performance balance than any individual expert or full ensemble across different domains, improving cross-domain generalization and reducing average computational cost by 81.2% via lazy gating, with less than a 2% loss in path quality.</description>

Abstract: Safe and scalable deployment of end-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving requires extensive and diverse data, particularly safety-critical events. Existing data are mostly generated from simulators with a significant sim-to-real gap or collected from on-road testing that is costly and unsafe. This paper presents TeraSim-World, an automated pipeline that synthesizes realistic and geographically diverse safety-critical data for E2E autonomous driving at anywhere in the world. Starting from an arbitrary location, TeraSim-World retrieves real-world maps and traffic demand from geospatial data sources. Then, it simulates agent behaviors from naturalistic driving datasets, and orchestrates diverse adversities to create corner cases. Informed by street views of the same location, it achieves photorealistic, geographically grounded sensor rendering via the frontier video generation model Cosmos-Drive. By bridging agent and sensor simulations, TeraSim-World provides a scalable and critical data synthesis framework for training and evaluation of E2E autonomous driving systems.

Abstract: Small animals and robots must often rapidly traverse large bump-like obstacles when moving through complex 3-D terrains, during which, in addition to leg-ground contact, their body inevitably comes into physical contact with the obstacles. However, we know little about the performance limits of large bump traversal and how body-terrain interaction affects traversal. To address these, we challenged the discoid cockroach and an open-loop six-legged robot to dynamically run into a large bump of varying height to discover the maximal traversal performance, and studied how locomotor modes and traversal performance are affected by body-terrain interaction. Remarkably, during rapid running, both the animal and the robot were capable of dynamically traversing a bump much higher than its hip height (up to 4 times the hip height for the animal and 3 times for the robot, respectively) at traversal speeds typical of running, with decreasing traversal probability with increasing bump height. A stability analysis using a novel locomotion energy landscape model explained why traversal was more likely when the animal or robot approached the bump with a low initial body yaw and a high initial body pitch, and why deflection was more likely otherwise. Inspired by these principles, we demonstrated a novel control strategy of active body pitching that increased the robot maximal traversable bump height by 75%. Our study is a major step in establishing the framework of locomotion energy landscapes to understand locomotion in complex 3-D terrains.</description>

      <title>Embodied Image Captioning: Self-supervised Learning Agents for Spatially Coherent Image Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a self-supervised method to improve an agent's abilities in describing arbitrary objects while actively exploring a generic environment. This is a challenging problem, as current models struggle to obtain coherent image captions due to different camera viewpoints and clutter. We propose a three-phase framework to fine-tune existing captioning models that enhances caption accuracy and consistency across views via a consensus mechanism. First, an agent explores the environment, collecting noisy image-caption pairs. Then, a consistent pseudo-caption for each object instance is distilled via consensus using a large language model. Finally, these pseudo-captions are used to fine-tune an off-the-shelf captioning model, with the addition of contrastive learning. We analyse the performance of the combination of captioning models, exploration policies, pseudo-labeling methods, and fine-tuning strategies, on our manually labeled test set. Results show that a policy can be trained to mine samples with higher disagreement compared to classical baselines. Our pseudo-captioning method, in combination with all policies, has a higher semantic similarity compared to other existing methods, and fine-tuning improves caption accuracy and consistency by a significant margin.
