      <title>Regularization of ML models for Earth systems by using longer model timesteps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regularization is a technique to improve generalization of machine learning (ML) models. A common form of regularization in the ML literature is to train on data where similar inputs map to different outputs. This improves generalization by preventing ML models from becoming overconfident in their predictions. This paper shows how using longer timesteps when modelling chaotic Earth systems naturally leads to more of this regularization. We show this in two domains. We explain how using longer model timesteps can improve results and demonstrate that increased regularization is one of the causes. We explain why longer model timesteps lead to improved regularization in these systems and present a procedure to pick the model timestep. We also carry out a benchmarking exercise on ORAS5 ocean reanalysis data to show that a longer model timestep (28 days) than is typically used gives realistic simulations. We suggest that there will be many opportunities to use this type of regularization in Earth system problems because the Earth system is chaotic and the regularization is so easy to implement.</description>

      <title>KGMM: A K-means Clustering Approach to Gaussian Mixture Modeling for Score Function Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18054v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid method for accurately estimating the score function -- the gradient of the logarithm of a system's steady-state probability density function -- using Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) in conjunction with a bisecting K-means clustering step. Our approach, which we call KGMM, offers a systematic way to combine statistical density estimation with a neural-network-based interpolation of the score, leveraging the strengths of both. We demonstrate its ability to accurately reconstruct the long-time statistical properties of several paradigmatic systems, including lower-dimensional potential systems and chaotic Lorenz-type models. Numerical experiments show that KGMM yields robust estimates of the score function, even for small values of the covariance amplitude in the GMM, where the standard GMM methods tend to fail because of noise amplification. These accurate estimates allow us to build effective stochastic reduced-order models that reproduce the invariant measures of the target dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the Topological Nature of the Butterfly Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-integrability in the sense of dynamical systems, also known as dynamical chaos, is a strongly nonlinear qualitative phenomenon. Its most promising theoretical descriptions are likely to emerge from non-perturbative approaches, with symmetry-based methods being particularly reliable. One such symmetry-based framework is supersymmetric theory of stochastic dynamics (STS). STS reformulates a general form stochastic (partial) differential equations (SDE) as a cohomological topological field theory (TFT) and identifies the order associated with the spontaneous breakdown of the corresponding topological supersymmetry (TS) as the stochastic generalization of chaos. The Faddeev-Popov ghosts of STS act as a systematic bookkeeping tool for the dynamic differentials from the definition of the butterfly effect (BE): the infinitely long dynamical memory unique to chaos. Accordingly, the effective field theory (EFT) of the TS breaking is essentially a field theory of the BE in the long-wavelength limit. Building on this perspective, here we demonstrate that one way to build such EFTs is the background field method with the external $\mathfrak{gl}(1|1)$ supergauge field coupled to N=2 supercurrents of STS, the fermion number conservation, and translations in time. By the Goldstone theorem, the resulting EFTs are conformal field theories (CFTs) and the operator product expansion provides an explanation for 1/f noise -- the experimental signature of chaos in the form of dynamical power-law correlations. Moreover, the generating functional of the background field possesses its own TS, revealing the topological nature of the BE. Particularly, when the Anti-de Sitter(AdS)/CFT correspondence is an acceptable approximation, the holographic dual of EFT is a cohomological TFT on AdS in which the associated TS and the isometry of the basespace underlie the BE and 1/f noise, respectively.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected synchronization in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a graph, we say that two nodes are topologically equivalent if their sets of first neighbors, excluding the two nodes, coincide. We prove that nonlinearly coupled oscillators located on a group of topologically equivalent nodes can get easily synchronized when the group forms a fully connected subgraph (or combinations of these), regardless of the status of all the other oscillators. More generally, any change occurring in the inner part of the remainder of the graph will not alter the synchronization status of the group. Typically, the group can synchronize when $k^{(\mathrm{OUT})}\leq k^{(\mathrm{IN})}$, $k^{(\mathrm{IN})}$ and $k^{(\mathrm{OUT})}$ being the common internal and outgoing degree of each node in the group, respectively. Simulations confirm our analysis and suggest that groups of topologically equivalent nodes play the role of independent pacemakers.</description>

      <title>A degenerate Takens--Bogdanov bifurcation in a normal form of Lorenz's equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider an unfolding of a normal form of the Lorenz system near a triple-zero singularity. We are interested in the analysis of double-zero bifurcations emerging from that singularity. Their local study provide partial results that are extended by means of numerical continuation methods. Specifically, a curve of heteroclinic connections is detected. It has a degenerate point from which infinitely many homoclinic connections emerge. In this way, we can partially understand the dynamics near the triple-zero singularity.</description>

      <title>Spectral Analysis and Invariant Measure in Studies of the Dynamics of the Hemostasis of a Blood Vessel</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A mathematical model of atherosclerosis of a blood vessel is advanced with regard for the entry of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) into blood. For the first time, the influence of cytokines on the inflammation of a blood vessel at the formation of atherosclerotic plaques is taken into account. With the help of the expansion in a Fourier series and the calculation of an invariant measure, the scenario of the appearance of strange attractors depending on a change in the parameter of the dissipation of cholesterol is studied. The conclusion is made about the interconnection of the dynamics of the metabolic process in a blood vascular system and its physical state.</description>

      <title>Basin entropy and the impact of the escape positioning in an open area-preserving map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main properties of a dynamical system can be analyzed by examining the corresponding basins, either attraction basins in dissipative systems or escape basins in open Hamiltonian systems and area-preserving maps. In the latter case, the selection of the openings is crucial, as the way exits are chosen can directly influence the results. This study explores the impact of different opening choices on the escape basins by employing a model of particles transported along field lines in tokamaks with reversed shear. We quantitatively evaluate these phenomena using the concept of basin entropy across various system configurations. Our findings reveal that the positioning of the exits significantly affects the complexity and behavior of the escape basins, with remarkable abrupt changes in basin entropy linked to the choice of exits.</description>

      <title>Exponential mixing of all orders for Arnol'd cat map lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08521v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the recently introduced classical Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories, which are chaotic, are exponentially mixing to all orders. Their mixing times are well-defined and are expressed in terms of the Lyapunov exponents, more precisely by the combination that defines the inverse of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy of these systems. We prove by an explicit recursive construction of correlation functions, that these exhibit $l-$fold mixing for any $l= 3,4,5,\ldots$. This computation is relevant for Rokhlin's conjecture, which states that 2-fold mixing induces $l-$fold mixing for any $l&gt;2$. Our results show that 2-fold exponential mixing, while being necessary for any $l-$fold mixing to hold it is nevertheless not sufficient for Arnol'd cat map lattice field theories.</description>

      <title>Self-trapping phenomenon, multistability and chaos in open anisotropic Dicke dimer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate semiclassical dynamics of a coupled atom-photon interacting system described by a dimer of anisotropic Dicke model in the presence of photon loss, exhibiting a rich variety of non-linear dynamics. Based on symmetries and dynamical classification, we characterize and chart out various dynamical phases in a phase diagram. A key feature of this system is the multistability of different dynamical states, particularly the coexistence of various superradiant phases as well as limit cycles. Remarkably, this dimer system manifests self-trapping phenomena, resulting in a photon population imbalance between the cavities. Such a self-trapped state arises from a saddle-node bifurcation, which can be understood from an equivalent Landau-Ginzburg description. Additionally, we identify a unique class of oscillatory dynamics self-trapped limit cycle, hosting self-trapping of photons. The absence of stable dynamical phases leads to the onset of chaos, which is diagnosed using the saturation value of the decorrelator dynamics. Moreover, the self-trapped states can coexist with chaotic attractor, which may have intriguing consequences in quantum dynamics. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.</description>

      <title>Singular Value Decomposition and Its Blind Spot for Quantum Chaos in Non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of chaos and complexity in non-Hermitian quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in their spectra. Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral statistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we show that SVD fails to reproduce conventional eigenvalue statistics in the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, as exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction.</description>
