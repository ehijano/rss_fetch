      <title>Degeneracies In a Weighted Sum of Two Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is an attempt to classify and quantify instances when a weighted sum of two squares of positive integers, $3n_{1}^2+n_{2}^2$, can be realized in more than one way. Our project was inspired by a particular study of two-dimensional quantum billiards [S. G. Jackson, H. Perrin, G. E. Astrakharchik, and M. Olshanii, SciPost Phys. Core 7, 062 (2024)] where the weighted sums of interest represents an energy level with the two integers being the billiard's quantum numbers; there, the 3-fold degeneracies seem to dominate the energy spectrum. Interestingly, contrary to the conventional paradigm, these degeneracies are not caused by some non-commuting symmetries of the system.</description>

      <title>On classical aspects of Bose-Einstein condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Berezin and Weyl quantizations are renown procedures for mapping classical, commutative Poisson algebras of observables to their non-commutative, quantum counterparts. The latter map is famous for its use on Weyl algebras, while the former is more appropriate for continuous functions decaying at infinity. In this work we define a variant of Berezin quantization map, which operates on classical Weyl algebras $\mathcal{W}(E,0)$ and constitutes a positive \textit{strict deformation quantization}. We use this map to compare classical and quantum thermal equilibrium states for a boson gas and to compute its rigorous classical limit.
  For this scope, we first define a purely algebraic notion of KMS states for the classical Weyl algebra and verify that in the finite volume setting there is only one possible KMS state, which can be interpreted as the Fourier transform of a Gibbs measure on some Hilbert space. Then, we show how the classical KMS states have thermodynamic limits which can manifest condensation in the zero mode, similarly to what happens in the standard Bose-Einstein condensation. Lastly, we prove that there exist sequences of quantum KMS states for the infinite volume Bose gas, that converge weakly$^*$ to classical KMS states. Moreover, since the different thermal phases are preserved by this limit, it is shown that a quantum condensate is mapped to a classical one.</description>

      <title>A new family of ladder operators for macroscopic systems, with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a series of recent scientific contributions the role of bosonic and fermionic ladder operators in a macroscopic realm has been investigated. Creation, annihilation and number operators have been used in very different contexts, all sharing the same common main feature, i.e. the relevance of {\em discrete changes} in the description of the system. The main problem when using this approach is that computations are easy for Hamiltonians which are quadratic in the ladder operators, but become very complicated, both at the analytical and at the numerical level, when the Hamiltonian is not quadratic. In this paper we propose a possible alternative approach, again based on some sort of ladder operators, but for which an analytic solution can often be deduced without particular difficulties. We describe our proposal with few applications, mostly related to different versions of a predator-prey model, and to love affairs (from a decision-making point of view).</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper obtains the matrix elements and characters of the discrete series unitary irreducible representations (UIRs) of the Sp$(4,\mathbb{R})$ group. With an isomorphic relationship to the two-fold covering of SO$_0(2,3)$ (Sp$(4,\mathbb{R}) \sim$ SO$_0(2,3)\times \mathbb{Z}_2$), this group holds particular importance as the kinematical/relativity group within the framework of ($1+3$-dimensional) anti-de Sitter spacetime.</description>

      <title>Universal enveloping algebras of weighted differential Poisson algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\lambda$-differential operators and modified $\lambda$-differential operators are generalizations of classical differential operators. This paper introduces the notions of $\lambda$-differential Poisson ($\lambda$-DP for short) algebras and modified $\lambda$-differential Poisson ($\lambda$-mDP for short) algebras as generalizations of differential Poisson algebras. The $\lambda$-DP algebra is proved to be closed under tensor product, and a $\lambda$-DP algebra structure is provided on the cohomology algebra of the $\lambda$-DP algebra. These conclusions are also applied to $\lambda$-mDP algebras and their modules. Finally, the universal enveloping algebras of $\lambda$-DP algebras are generalized by constructing a $\mathcal{P}$-triple. Three isomorphisms among opposite algebras, tensor algebras and the universal enveloping algebras of $\lambda$-DP algebras are obtained.</description>

      <title>Interactions of soliton and mean field in KdV equation with well type initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the KdV equation with well-type initial value, the interaction between the trial soliton and the mean field is studied. The well initial value will lead to the appearance of rarefaction wave and dispersion shock wave, and there will be a linear wave region after a long time. The interaction between trial soliton and mean field is described within the framework of Whitham modulation theory, and the trajectory of soliton is given. The predicted soliton amplitude and phase changes are numerically confirmed, verifying the correctness of the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Webs and multiwebs for the symplectic group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define $2n$-multiwebs on planar graphs and discuss their relation with $\mathrm{Sp}(2n)$-webs. On a planar graph with a symplectic local system we define a matrix whose Pfaffian is the sum of traces of $2n$-multiwebs. As application we generalize Kasteleyn's theorem from dimer covers to $2n$-multiweb covers of planar graphs with $U(n)$ gauge group.
  For $\mathrm{Sp}(4)$ we relate Kuperberg's ``tetravalent vertex'' to the determinant, and classify reduced $4$-webs on some simple surfaces: the annulus, torus, and pair of pants.
  We likewise define, for $\mathrm{Sp}(2n)$ and $q=1$, a $2n$-valent vertex corresponding to the determinant, and classify reduced $2n$-webs on an annulus.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we show that the Schrodinger equation in quantum mechanics is mathematically equivalent to the Euler-Bernoulli equation for vibrating beams and plates in elasticity theory, with dependent initial data. Remarks are made on potential applications of this equivalence for symplectic and quantum computing, the two-slit experiment using vibrating beams and plates, and the p-adic Euler-Bernoulli equation.</description>

      <title>Conformal covariance of connection probabilities in the 2D critical FK-Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study connection probabilities between vertices of the square lattice for the critical random-cluster (FK) model with cluster weight $2$, which is related to the critical Ising model. We consider the model on the plane and on domains conformally equivalent to the upper half-plane. We prove that, when appropriately rescaled, the connection probabilities between vertices in the domain or on the boundary have nontrivial limits, as the mesh size of the square lattice is sent to zero, and that those limits are conformally covariant. Because of the relation between the FK and Ising models, this provides an alternative proof of the conformal covariance of the Ising spin correlation functions. In an appendix, we also derive exact formulas for some Ising boundary spin correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Superspace invariants and correlators in 4-dimensional superconformal field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using polarization spinor methods in conjunction with the superspace formalism, we construct 3-point superconformal invariants that are used to determine the form of 3-point correlators of spinning superfield operators in $\mathcal{N}=1$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs) in 4-dimensions. We enumerate the structural form of various spinning 3-point correlators using these invariants and find additional constraints on their form when the operators are conserved supercurrents. For these purposes, we first construct the invariants and 3-point correlators in non-supersymmetric $4d$ CFTs which are then extended using superspace methods to $4d$ SCFTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we announce some results extending our recent work with A. Toufik on the free-fermion point q=i of the Haldane-Shastry chain to the case with an even number N of sites. The resulting long-range version of the Heisenberg XX chain may be viewed as a model of fermions with extended gl(1|1) symmetry. Unlike for odd N, the conserved charges are nilpotent and exhibit Jordan blocks.</description>

      <title>Schmidt Decomposition of Multipartite States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum states can be written in infinitely many ways depending on the choices of basis. Schmidt decomposition of a quantum state has a lot of properties useful in the study of entanglement. All bipartite states admit Schmidt decomposition, but this does not extend to multipartite systems. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Schmidt decompositions of multipartite states. Moreover, we provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the decomposition for a Schmidt decomposable multipartite state.</description>

      <title>Bethe Ansatz, Quantum Circuits, and the F-basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bethe Ansatz is a method for constructing exact eigenstates of quantum-integrable spin chains. Recently, deterministic quantum algorithms, referred to as "algebraic Bethe circuits", have been developed to prepare Bethe states for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. These circuits represent a unitary formulation of the standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz, expressed using matrix-product states that act on both the spin chain and an auxiliary space. In this work, we systematize these previous results, and show that algebraic Bethe circuits can be derived by a change of basis in the auxiliary space. The new basis, identical to the "F-basis" known from the theory of quantum-integrable models, generates the linear superpositions of plane waves that are characteristic of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. We explain this connection, highlighting that certain properties of the F-basis (namely, the exchange symmetry of the spins) are crucial for the construction of algebraic Bethe circuits. We demonstrate our approach by presenting new quantum circuits for the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ model.</description>

      <title>Dynamics near homoclinic orbits to a saddle in four-dimensional systems with a first integral and a discrete symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$-equivariant 4-dimensional system of ODEs with a smooth first integral $H$ and a saddle equilibrium state $O$. We assume that there exists a transverse homoclinic orbit $\Gamma$ to $O$ that approaches $O$ along the nonleading directions. Suppose $H(O) = c$. In \cite{Bakrani2022JDE}, the dynamics near $\Gamma$ in the level set $H^{-1}(c)$ was described. In particular, some criteria for the existence of the stable and unstable invariant manifolds of $\Gamma$ were given. In the current paper, we describe the dynamics near $\Gamma$ in the level set $H^{-1}(h)$ for $h\neq c$ close to $c$. We prove that when $h &lt; c$, there exists a unique saddle periodic orbit in each level set $H^{-1}(h)$, and the forward (resp. backward) orbit of any point off the stable (resp. unstable) invariant manifold of this periodic orbit leaves a small neighborhood of $\Gamma$. We further show that when $h &gt; c$, the forward and backward orbits of any point in $H^{-1}(h)$ near $\Gamma$ leave a small neighborhood of $\Gamma$. We also prove analogous results for the scenario where two transverse homoclinics to $O$ (homoclinic figure-eight) exist. The results of this paper, together with \cite{Bakrani2022JDE}, give a full description of the dynamics in a small open neighborhood of $\Gamma$ (and a small open neighborhood of a homoclinic figure-eight).</description>

      <title>Ensemble inequivalence and phase transitions in unlabeled networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discover a first-order phase transition in the canonical ensemble of random unlabeled networks with a prescribed average number of links. The transition is caused by the nonconcavity of microcanonical entropy. Above the critical point, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles are equivalent and have a well-behaved thermodynamic limit. Below the critical point, the ensemble equivalence is broken, and the canonical ensemble is a mixture of phases: empty networks and networks with logarithmic average degrees. As a consequence, networks with bounded average degrees do not survive in the thermodynamic limit, decaying into the empty phase. The celebrated percolation transition in labeled networks is thus absent in unlabeled networks. In view of these differences between labeled and unlabeled ensembles, the question of which one should be used as a null model of different real-world networks cannot be ignored.</description>

      <title>On the F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an theory for elastic prestrained films with varying thickness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the variational limiting theory of thin films, parallel to the F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an theory in the nonlinear elasticity, for films that have been prestrained and whose thickness is a general non-constant function. Using $\Gamma$-convergence, we extend the existing results to the variable thickness setting, calculate the associated Euler-Lagrange equations of the limiting energy, and analyze the convergence of equilibria. The resulting formulas display the interrelation between deformations of the geometric mid-surface and components of the growth tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a new version of the von K\'arm\'an energy and the corresponding Euler-Langrange equations, in the context of thin prestrained plates, under the condition of incompressibility relative to the given prestrain. Our derivation uses the theory of $\Gamma$-convergence in the calculus of variations, building on prior techniques in [Conti, Dolzmann (2009)] and [Lewicka, Mahadevan, Pakzad (2011)].</description>

      <title>The spectral concentration for damped waves on compact Anosov manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral distribution of damped waves on compact Anosov manifolds. Sj\"ostrand \cite{SJ1} proved that the imaginary parts of the majority of the eigenvalues concentrate near the average of the damping function, see also Anantharaman \cite{AN2}. In this paper, we prove that the most of eigenvalues actually lie in certain regions with imaginary parts that approaching the average logarithmically as the real parts tend to infinity. As an application, we show the concentration of non-trivial zeros of twisted Selberg zeta functions in a logarithmic region asymptotically close to $\Re s=\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <title>Yang-Lee zeros for real-space condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the electrostatic analogy, we derive an exact formula for the limiting Yang-Lee zero distribution in the random allocation model of general weights. This exhibits a real-space condensation phase transition, which is induced by a pressure change. The exact solution allows one to read off the scaling of the density of zeros at the critical point and the angle at which locus of zeros hits the critical point. Since the order of the phase transition and critical exponents can be tuned with a single parameter for several families of weights, the model provides a useful testing ground for verifying various relations between the distribution of zeros and the critical behavior, as well as for exploring the behavior of physical quantities in the mesoscopic regime, i.e., systems of large but finite size. The main result is that asymptotically the Yang-Lee zeros are images of a conformal mapping, given by the generating function for the weights, of uniformly distributed complex phases.</description>

Abstract: We classify covariant metrics (in the sense of Beggs and Majid) on a~class of quantum homogeneous spaces. In particular, our classification implies the existence of a~unique (up to scalar) quantum symmetric covariant metric on the Heckenberger--Kolb calculi for the quantized irreducible flag manifolds. Moreover, we prove the existence and uniqueness of Levi-Civita connection for any real covariant metric for the Heckenberger--Kolb calculi. This generalizes Matassa's result for the quantum projective spaces.</description>

      <title>A unifying framework for quantum simulation algorithms for time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in simulating time-dependent Hamiltonians using quantum algorithms, driven by diverse applications, such as quantum adiabatic computing. While techniques for simulating time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics are well-established, time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics is less explored and it is unclear how to systematically organize existing methods and to find new methods. Sambe-Howland's continuous clock elegantly transforms time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics into time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics, which means that by taking different discretizations, existing methods for time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics can be exploited for time-dependent dynamics. In this work, we systemically investigate how Sambe-Howland's clock can serve as a unifying framework for simulating time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics. Firstly, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by showcasing its compatibility with analog quantum computing and digital quantum computing. Secondly, for digital quantum computers, we illustrate how this framework, combined with time-independent methods (e.g., product formulas, multi-product formulas, qDrift, and LCU-Taylor), can facilitate the development of efficient algorithms for simulating time-dependent dynamics. This framework allows us to (a) resolve the problem of finding minimum-gate time-dependent product formulas; (b) establish a unified picture of both Suzuki's and Huyghebaert and De Raedt's approaches; (c) generalize Huyghebaert and De Raedt's first and second-order formula to arbitrary orders; (d) answer an unsolved question in establishing time-dependent multi-product formulas; (e) and recover continuous qDrift on the same footing as time-independent qDrift. Thirdly, we demonstrate the efficacy of our newly developed higher-order Huyghebaert and De Raedt's algorithm through digital adiabatic simulation.</description>

      <title>From $\lambda$-connections to $PSL_2(\mathbb{C})$-opers with apparent singularities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a Riemann surface of genus $&gt; 1$, we discuss how to construct opers with apparent singularities from $SL_2(\mathbb{C})$ $\lambda$-connections $(E, \nabla_\lambda)$ and sub-line bundles $L$ of $E$. This construction defines a rational map from a space which captures important data of triples $(E, L, \nabla_\lambda)$ to a space which parametrises the positions and residue parameters of the induced apparent singularities. We show that this is a Poisson map with respect to natural Poisson structures. The relations to wobbly bundles and Lagrangians in the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles and $\lambda$-connections are discussed.</description>

      <title>Information geometry of diffeomorphism groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of diffeomorphism groups and their applications to problems in analysis and geometry has a long history. In geometric hydrodynamics, pioneered by V.~Arnold in the 1960s, one considers an ideal fluid flow as the geodesic motion on the infinite-dimensional group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms of the fluid domain with respect to the metric defined by the kinetic energy. Similar considerations on the space of densities lead to a geometric description of optimal mass transport and the Kantorovich-Wasserstein metric. Likewise, information geometry associated with the Fisher-Rao metric and the Hellinger distance has an equally beautiful infinite-dimensional geometric description and can be regarded as a higher-order Sobolev analogue of optimal transportation. In this work we review various metrics on diffeomorphism groups relevant to this approach and introduce appropriate topology, smooth structures and dynamics on the corresponding infinite-dimensional manifolds. Our main goal is to demonstrate how, alongside topological hydrodynamics, Hamiltonian dynamics and optimal mass transport, information geometry with its elaborate toolbox has become yet another exciting field for applications of geometric analysis on diffeomorphism groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a solution to the v-representability problem for a non-relativistic quantum many-particle system on a ring domain in terms of Sobolev spaces and their duals. Any one-particle density that is square-integrable, has a square-integrable weak derivative, and is gapped away from zero can be realized from the solution of a many-particle Schr\"odinger equation, with or without interactions, by choosing a corresponding external potential. This potential can contain a distributional contribution but still gives rise to a self-adjoint Hamiltonian. Importantly, this allows for a well-defined Kohn-Sham procedure but, on the other hand, invalidates the usual proof of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem.</description>

Abstract: A novel theorem in $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant homotopy theory is stated, proven and applied to the topological classification of frustrated magnets in the presence of canonical time-reversal symmetry. This theorem generalises a result which had been key to the homotopical derivation of the renowned Bott-Kitaev periodic table for topological insulators and superconductors. We distinguish between three symmetry classes $\mathrm{AIII}$, $\mathrm{AIII/BDI}$, and $\mathrm{AIII/CII}$ depending on the existence and type of canonical time-reversal symmetry. For each of these classes, the relevant objects to classify are $\mathbb{Z}_2$-equivariant maps into a Stiefel manifold. The topological classification is illustrated through examples of frustrated spin models and is compared to the one of Roychowdhury and Lawler (RL).</description>

Abstract: We consider the density of states of structured Hermitian random matrices with a variance profile. As the dimension tends to infinity the associated eigenvalue density can develop a singularity at the origin. The severity of this singularity depends on the relative positions of the zero submatrices. We provide a classification of all possible singularities and determine the exponent in the density blow-up, which we label the singularity degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.14877v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider random matrix ensembles on the set of Hermitian matrices that are heavy tailed, in particular not all moments exist, and that are invariant under the conjugate action of the unitary group. The latter property entails that the eigenvectors are Haar distributed and, therefore, factorise from the eigenvalue statistics. We prove a classification for stable matrix ensembles of this kind of matrices represented in terms of matrices, their eigenvalues and their diagonal entries with the help of the classification of the multivariate stable distributions and the harmonic analysis on symmetric matrix spaces. Moreover, we identify sufficient and necessary conditions for their domains of attraction. To illustrate our findings we discuss for instance elliptical invariant random matrix ensembles and P\'olya ensembles, the latter playing a particular role in matrix convolutions. As a byproduct we generalise the derivative principle on the Hermitian matrices to general tempered distributions. This principle relates the joint probability density of the eigenvalues and the diagonal entries of the random matrix.</description>

Abstract: We consider an infinite harmonic chain of charged particles submitted to the action of a magnetic field of intensity $B$ and subject to the action of a stochastic noise conserving the energy. In arXiv:0809.0177 and arXiv:1402.2988 it has been proved that if $B=0$ the transport of energy is described by a $3/4$-fractional diffusion while it has been proved in arXiv:1808.01040 that if $B\ne 0$ it is described by a $5/6$-fractional diffusion. In arXiv:0809.0177 and in arXiv:1808.01040 the authors used a two step argument, i.e. they first proved that the kinetic limit of the Wigner distribution is the solution of a phonon Boltzmann equation and then proved that this solution converges to the solution of a fractional diffusion equation with exponent $3/4$ if $B = 0$ (see arXiv:0809.0177) and exponent $5/6$ if $B\ne 0$ (see arXiv:1808.01040). In this paper we quantify the intensity of the magnetic field required to switch from one macroscopic regime to the other one from the phonon Boltzmann equation. We also describe the transition mechanism to cross the two different phases.</description>

      <title>Basic curvature and the Atiyah cocycle in gauge theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated from target space covariant formulations of topological sigma models and from a graded-geometric approach to higher gauge theory, we study connections on Lie and Courant algebroids and on their description as differential graded (dg) manifolds. We revisit the notion of basic curvature for a connection on a Lie algebroid, which measures its compatibility with the Lie bracket and it appears in the BV-BRST differential of 2D gauge theories such as (twisted) Poisson and Dirac sigma models. We define a basic curvature tensor for connections on Courant algebroids and we show that in the description of a Courant algebroid as a QP2 manifold it appears naturally as part of the homological vector field together with the Gualtieri torsion of an induced generalised connection. Furthermore, we consider connections on dg manifolds and revisit the structure of gauge transformations in the graded-geometric approach to higher gauge theories from a manifestly covariant perspective. We argue that it is governed by the brackets of a Kapranov L$_{\infty}[1]$ algebra, whose binary bracket is given by the Atiyah cocycle that measures the compatibility of the connection with the homological vector field. We also revisit some aspects of the derived bracket construction and show how to extend it to connections and tensors.</description>

      <title>On the $\Delta_a$ invariants in non-perturbative complex Chern-Simons theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently a set of $q$-series invariants, labelled by $\operatorname{Spin}^c$ structures, for weakly negative definite plumbed $3$-manifolds called the $\widehat{Z}_a$ invariants were discovered by Gukov, Pei, Putrov and Vafa. The leading rational power of the $\widehat{Z}_a$ invariants are invariants themselves denoted by $\Delta_a$. In this paper we further analyze the structure of these $\Delta_a$ invariants. We review some of the foundations of the $\Delta_a$ invariants and analyze their structure for a subclass of integer homology spheres. In particular, we provide a complete description of the $\Delta_0$ invariants for Brieskorn spheres. Along the way we show that the $\Delta_a$ invariants are not homology cobordism invariants, thereby answering an open question in the literature.</description>

      <title>Augmented physics informed extreme learning machine to solve the biharmonic equations via Fourier expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13947v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address the sensitivity of parameters and limited precision for physics-informed extreme learning machines (PIELM) with common activation functions, such as sigmoid, tangent, and Gaussian, in solving high-order partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to scientific computation and engineering applications, this work develops a Fourier-induced PIELM (FPIELM) method. This approach aims to approximate solutions for a class of fourth-order biharmonic equations with two boundary conditions on both unitized and non-unitized domains. By carefully calculating the differential and boundary operators of the biharmonic equation on discretized collections, the solution for this high-order equation is reformulated as a linear least squares minimization problem. We further evaluate the FPIELM with varying hidden nodes and scaling factors for uniform distribution initialization, and then determine the optimal range for these two hyperparameters. Numerical experiments and comparative analyses demonstrate that the proposed FPIELM method is more stable, robust, precise, and efficient than other PIELM approaches in solving biharmonic equations across both regular and irregular domains.</description>

      <title>Geometric BV for twisted Courant sigma models and the BRST power finesse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study twisted Courant sigma models, a class of topological field theories arising from the coupling of 3D 0-/2-form BF theory and Chern-Simons theory and containing a 4-form Wess-Zumino term. They are examples of theories featuring a nonlinearly open gauge algebra, where products of field equations appear in the commutator of gauge transformations, and they are reducible gauge systems. We determine the solution to the master equation using a technique, the BRST power finesse, that combines aspects of the AKSZ construction (which applies to the untwisted model) and the general BV-BRST formalism. This allows for a geometric interpretation of the BV coefficients in the interaction terms of the master action in terms of an induced generalised connection on a 4-form twisted (pre-)Courant algebroid, its Gualtieri torsion and the basic curvature tensor. It also produces a frame independent formulation of the model. We show, moreover, that the gauge fixed action is the sum of the classical one and a BRST commutator, as expected from a Schwarz type topological field theory.</description>

      <title>A SymTFT for Continuous Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06128v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is a powerful tool for studying dynamics in QFT: it provides selection rules, constrains RG flows, and often simplifies analysis. Currently, our understanding is that the most general form of symmetry is described by categorical symmetries which can be realized via Symmetry TQFTs or ``SymTFTs." In this paper, we show how the framework of the SymTFT, which is understood for discrete symmetries (i.e. finite categorical symmetries), can be generalized to continuous symmetries. In addition to demonstrating how $U(1)$ global symmetries can be incorporated into the paradigm of the SymTFT, we apply our formalism to study cubic $U(1)$ anomalies in $4d$ QFTs, describe the $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$ non-invertible chiral symmetry in $4d$ theories, and conjecture the SymTFT for general continuous $G^{(0)}$ global symmetries.</description>

      <title>Integral identities and universal relations for solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05789v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any nonlinear field theory giving rise to static solutions with finite energy like, e.g., topological solitons, allows us to derive an infinite number of integral identities which any such solution has to obey. These integral identities can always be understood as being generated by field transformations and their related Noether currents. We also explain why all integral identities generated by coordinate transformations become trivial for Bogomolnyi-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) solitons, i.e., topological solitons which saturate a topological energy bound. Finally, we consider applications of these identities to a broad class of nonlinear scalar theories, including the Skyrme model. More concretely, we find nontrivial integral identities that can be seen as model-independent relations between certain physical properties of the solitons in such theories, and we comment on the possible connection between these new relations and those already found in the context of astrophysical compact objects. We also demonstrate the usefulness of said identities to estimate the precision of the numerical calculation of soliton observables.</description>

      <title>Channel-State duality with centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study extensions of the mappings arising in usual channel-state duality to the case of Hilbert spaces with a direct sum structure. This setting arises in representations of algebras with centers, which are commonly associated with constraints, and it has many physical applications from quantum many-body theory to holography and quantum gravity. We establish that there is a general relationship between non-separability of the state and the isometric properties of the induced channel. We also provide a generalisation of our approach to algebras of trace-class operators on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wavefunctions in JT supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine explicit expressions for the continuous two-sided gravitational wavefunctions in supersymmetric versions of JT gravity, focusing mainly on $\mathcal{N}=2$ JT supergravity. Our approach is based on representation theory of the associated supergroup, for which we determine the relevant mixed parabolic matrix elements that implement asymptotic AdS boundary conditions at the quantum level. We match our expressions with those found by solving the energy-eigenvalue equation of arXiv:2207.00408. We discuss gravitational applications by computing several amplitudes of interest, and address how our framework can be generalized further.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? Electromagnetic and Gravitational Mode Mixing in NSBH Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the possibility of electromagnetic fields leaving imprints on gravitational wave (GW) signals from Neutron Star-Black hole (NSBH) mergers, specifically in the context of extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs). Using black hole perturbation theory (BHPT) in the context of a minimally coupled Einstein-Maxwell system, we demonstrate that electromagnetic quasi normal modes(QNMs) can excite gravitational QNMs with frequencies that are linear or quadratic in the electromagnetic QNMs, at first level of mixing. Moreover, We then study the electromagnetism-gravity coupling by approximating the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli potentials with Dirac delta functions. In this example, we examine gravitational perturbations induced by the electromagnetic field of an ideal dipole radially free fall towards the blackhole, building on calculations from a companion paper [1]. Our results show that both linear and quadratic electromagnetic QNMs appear in gravitational perturbations. In addition, linear gravitational QNMs are also excited due to the electromagnetic source, with their amplitudes depending on the details of the electromagnetic and gravitational potentials, analogous to gravitational mode mixing analysis. Furthermore, at late stages, gravitational perturbations might exhibit polynomial tails induced by electromagnetic perturbations. This article sets the stage for future numerical investigations aimed at identifying such modes in various scenarios.</description>

      <title>More Nonlinearities? II. A Short Guide of First- and Second-Order Electromagnetic Perturbations in the Schwarzschild Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study second-order electromagnetic perturbations in the Schwarzschild background and derive the effective source terms for Regge-Wheeler equation which are quadratic in first-order gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations. In addition to the induced mixed quadratic modes, we find that linear gravitational modes are also excited, with amplitudes dependent on the electromagnetic potential. A toy model involving a Dirac delta function potential demonstrates mixing of linear gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations with frequencies \( \omega^{(1)} \) and \( \Omega^{(1)} \), resulting in the second-order QNM mixing in the electromagnetic field at \( \Omega^{(2)} =\Omega^{(1)} + \omega^{(1)} \). This complements prior work in [1] on the second-order gravitational perturbation mixing and highlights potential applications in multi-messenger astrophysics for systems observed by LIGO and upcoming LISA. We also study first-order perturbations due to a point charge and show it could be reduced to a one-dimensional path integral. Within the toy model, we investigate the first-order electromagnetic perturbation due to a radially free-falling single charge \( q \) and radial dipole moment \( p = q \eta \), employing semi-analytical and numerical methods. For the dipole case, we show that the QNM perturbation is excited with a nearly constant amplitude. Future work will focus on incorporating mixing in more realistic potentials and exploring numerical approach in the context of rotating spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Wiedemann-Franz Law and Thermoelectric Inequalities: Effective ZT and Single-leg Efficiency Overestimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a thermoelectric inequality in thermoelectric conversion between the material figure of merit (ZT) and the module effective ZT using the Constant Seebeck-coefficient Approximation combining with the Wiedemann-Franz law. In a P-N leg-pair module, the effective ZT lies between the individual ZT values of the P- and N-legs. In a single-leg module, however, the effective ZT is less than approximately one-third of the leg's ZT. This reduction results from the need for an external wire to complete the circuit, introducing additional thermal and electrical losses. Multi-dimensional numerical analysis shows that, although structural optimization can mitigate these losses, the system efficiency remains limited to below half of the ideal single-leg material efficiency. Our findings explain the single-leg efficiency overestimation and highlight the importance of optimizing the P-N leg-pair module structure. They also underscore the need for thermoelectric leg-compatibility, particularly with respect to Seebeck coefficients.</description>
