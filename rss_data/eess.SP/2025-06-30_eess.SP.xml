      <title>Unsupervised Learning-Based Joint Resource Allocation and Beamforming Design for RIS-Assisted MISO-OFDMA Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are key enablers for 6G wireless systems. This paper studies downlink transmission in an RIS-assisted MISO-OFDMA system, addressing resource allocation challenges. A two-stage unsupervised learning-based framework is proposed to jointly design RIS phase shifts, BS beamforming, and resource block (RB) allocation. The framework includes BeamNet, which predicts RIS phase shifts from CSI, and AllocationNet, which allocates RBs using equivalent CSI derived from BeamNet outputs. Active beamforming is implemented via maximum ratio transmission and water-filling. To handle discrete constraints while ensuring differentiability, quantization and the Gumbel-softmax trick are adopted. A customized loss and phased training enhance performance under QoS constraints. Simulations show the method achieves 99.93% of the sum rate of the SCA baseline with only 0.036% of its runtime, and it remains robust across varying channel and user conditions.</description>

      <title>Microelectrode Signal Dynamics as Biomarkers of Subthalamic Nucleus Entry on Deep Brain Stimulation: A Nonlinear Feature Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate intraoperative localization of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is essential for the efficacy of Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) in patients with Parkinson's disease. While microelectrode recordings (MERs) provide rich electrophysiological information during DBS electrode implantation, current localization practices often rely on subjective interpretation of signal features. In this study, we propose a quantitative framework that leverages nonlinear dynamics and entropy-based metrics to classify neural activity recorded inside versus outside the STN. MER data from three patients were preprocessed using a robust artifact correction pipeline, segmented, and labelled based on surgical annotations. A comprehensive set of recurrence quantification analysis, nonlinear, and entropy features were extracted from each segment. Multiple supervised classifiers were trained on every combination of feature domains using stratified 10-fold cross-validation, followed by statistical comparison using paired Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Holm-Bonferroni correction. The combination of entropy and nonlinear features yielded the highest discriminative power, and the Extra Trees classifier emerged as the best model with a cross-validated F1-score of 0.902+/-0.027 and ROC AUC of 0.887+/-0.055. Final evaluation on a 20% hold-out test set confirmed robust generalization (F1= 0.922, ROC AUC = 0.941). These results highlight the potential of nonlinear and entropy signal descriptors in supporting real-time, data-driven decision-making during DBS surgeries</description>

      <title>Data Normalization Strategies for EEG Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normalization is a critical yet often overlooked component in the preprocessing pipeline for EEG deep learning applications. The rise of large-scale pretraining paradigms such as self-supervised learning (SSL) introduces a new set of tasks whose nature is substantially different from supervised training common in EEG deep learning applications. This raises new questions about optimal normalization strategies for the applicable task. In this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of normalization granularity (recording vs. window level) and scope (cross-channel vs. within-channel) on both supervised (age and gender prediction) and self-supervised (Contrastive Predictive Coding) tasks. Using high-density resting-state EEG from 2,836 subjects in the Healthy Brain Network dataset, we show that optimal normalization strategies differ significantly between training paradigms. Window-level within-channel normalization yields the best performance in supervised tasks, while minimal or cross-channel normalization at the window level is more effective for SSL. These results underscore the necessity of task-specific normalization choices and challenge the assumption that a universal normalization strategy can generalize across learning settings. Our findings provide practical insights for developing robust EEG deep learning pipelines as the field shifts toward large-scale, foundation model training.</description>

      <title>WISVA: Generative AI for 5G Network Optimization in Smart Warehouses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next decade will usher in a profound transformation of wireless communication, driven by the ever-increasing demand for data-intensive applications and the rapid adoption of emerging technologies. To fully unlock the potential of 5G and beyond, substantial advancements are required in signal processing techniques, innovative network architectures, and efficient spectrum utilization strategies. These advancements facilitate seamless integration of emerging technologies, driving industrial digital transformation and connectivity. This paper introduces a novel Variational Autoencoder (VAE)-based framework, Wireless Infrastructure for Smart Warehouses using VAE (WISVA), designed for accurate indoor radio propagation modeling in automated Industry 4.0 environments such as warehouses and factory floors operating within 5G wireless bands. The research delves into the meticulous creation of training data tensors, capturing complex electromagnetic (EM) wave behaviors influenced by diverse obstacles, and outlines the architecture and training methodology of the proposed VAE model. The model's robustness and adaptability are showcased through its ability to predict signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) heatmaps across various scenarios, including denoising tasks, validation datasets, extrapolation to unseen configurations, and previously unencountered warehouse layouts. Compelling reconstruction error heatmaps are presented, highlighting the superior accuracy of WISVA compared to traditional autoencoder models. The paper also analyzes the model's performance in handling complex smart warehouse environments, demonstrating its potential as a key enabler for optimizing wireless infrastructure in Industry 4.0.</description>

      <title>A Complex UNet Approach for Non-Invasive Fetal ECG Extraction Using Single-Channel Dry Textile Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous, non-invasive pregnancy monitoring is crucial for minimising potential complications. The fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) represents a promising tool for assessing fetal health beyond clinical environments. Home-based monitoring necessitates the use of a minimal number of comfortable and durable electrodes, such as dry textile electrodes. However, this setup presents many challenges, including increased noise and motion artefacts, which complicate the accurate extraction of fECG signals. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a pioneering method for extracting fECG from single-channel recordings obtained using dry textile electrodes using AI techniques. We created a new dataset by simulating abdominal recordings, including noise closely resembling real-world characteristics of in-vivo recordings through dry textile electrodes, alongside mECG and fECG. To ensure the reliability of the extracted fECG, we propose an innovative pipeline based on a complex-valued denoising network, Complex UNet. Unlike previous approaches that focused solely on signal magnitude, our method processes both real and imaginary components of the spectrogram, addressing phase information and preventing incongruous predictions. We evaluated our novel pipeline against traditional, well-established approaches, on both simulated and real data in terms of fECG extraction and R-peak detection. The results showcase that our suggested method achieves new state-of-the-art results, enabling an accurate extraction of fECG morphology across all evaluated settings. This method is the first to effectively extract fECG signals from single-channel recordings using dry textile electrodes, making a significant advancement towards a fully non-invasive and self-administered fECG extraction solution.</description>

      <title>A Portable and Cost-Effective System for Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring and Environmental Impact Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Air pollution remains a major global issue that seriously impacts public health, environmental quality, and ultimately human health. To help monitor problem, we have created and constructed a low-cost, real-time, portable air quality monitoring system using cheap sensors. The system measures critical pollutants PM2.5, PM10, and carbon monoxide (CO), and environmental variables such as temperature and humidity. The system computes the Air Quality Index (AQI) and transmits the data via a Bluetooth connection. The data is relayed, in real time, to a mobile application. Because of its small size and low manufacturing cost the system readily lends itself to indoor and outdoor use and in urban and rural environments. In this paper we give an account of the system design, development, and validation, while demonstrating its accuracy and low-cost capabilities. We also consider its wider environmental, social, and regulatory implications with regards to; improving public awareness, being used for sustainability purposes and providing valuable information for informed decision making.</description>

      <title>Physics-Embedded Neural Networks for sEMG-based Continuous Motion Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately decoding human motion intentions from surface electromyography (sEMG) is essential for myoelectric control and has wide applications in rehabilitation robotics and assistive technologies. However, existing sEMG-based motion estimation methods often rely on subject-specific musculoskeletal (MSK) models that are difficult to calibrate, or purely data-driven models that lack physiological consistency. This paper introduces a novel Physics-Embedded Neural Network (PENN) that combines interpretable MSK forward-dynamics with data-driven residual learning, thereby preserving physiological consistency while achieving accurate motion estimation. The PENN employs a recursive temporal structure to propagate historical estimates and a lightweight convolutional neural network for residual correction, leading to robust and temporally coherent estimations. A two-phase training strategy is designed for PENN. Experimental evaluations on six healthy subjects show that PENN outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in both root mean square error (RMSE) and $R^2$ metrics.</description>

      <title>Heart rate and respiratory rate prediction from noisy real-world smartphone based on Deep Learning methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using mobile phone video of the fingertip as a data source for estimating vital signs such as heart rate (HR) and respiratory rate (RR) during daily life has long been suggested. While existing literature indicates that these estimates are accurate to within several beats or breaths per minute, the data used to draw these conclusions are typically collected in laboratory environments under careful experimental control, and yet the results are assumed to generalize to daily life. In an effort to test it, a team of researchers collected a large dataset of mobile phone video recordings made during daily life and annotated with ground truth HR and RR labels from N=111 participants. They found that traditional algorithm performance on the fingerprint videos is worse than previously reported (7 times and 13 times worse for RR and HR, respectively). Fortunately, recent advancements in deep learning, especially in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), offer a promising solution to improve this performance. This study proposes a new method for estimating HR and RR using a novel 3D deep CNN, demonstrating a reduced error in estimated HR by 68% and RR by 75%. These promising results suggest that regressor-based deep learning approaches should be used in estimating HR and RR.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Proactive Groundwater Management: Early Warning and Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Groundwater supports ecosystems, agriculture, and drinking water supplies worldwide, yet effective monitoring remains challenging due to sparse data, computational constraints, and delayed outputs from traditional approaches. We develop a machine learning pipeline that predicts groundwater level categories using climate data, hydro-meteorological records, and physiographic attributes processed through AutoGluon's automated ensemble framework. Our approach integrates geospatial preprocessing, domain-driven feature engineering, and automated model selection to overcome conventional monitoring limitations. Applied to a large-scale French dataset (n $&gt;$ 3,440,000 observations from 1,500+ wells), the model achieves weighted F\_1 scores of 0.927 on validation data and 0.67 on temporally distinct test data. Scenario-based evaluations demonstrate practical utility for early warning systems and water allocation decisions under changing climate conditions. The open-source implementation provides a scalable framework for integrating machine learning into national groundwater monitoring networks, enabling more responsive and data-driven water management strategies.</description>

      <title>Privacy-aware IoT Fall Detection Services For Aging in Place</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fall detection is critical to support the growing elderly population, projected to reach 2.1 billion by 2050. However, existing methods often face data scarcity challenges or compromise privacy. We propose a novel IoT-based Fall Detection as a Service (FDaaS) framework to assist the elderly in living independently and safely by accurately detecting falls. We design a service-oriented architecture that leverages Ultra-wideband (UWB) radar sensors as an IoT health-sensing service, ensuring privacy and minimal intrusion. We address the challenges of data scarcity by utilizing a Fall Detection Generative Pre-trained Transformer (FD-GPT) that uses augmentation techniques. We developed a protocol to collect a comprehensive dataset of the elderly daily activities and fall events. This resulted in a real dataset that carefully mimics the elderly's routine. We rigorously evaluate and compare various models using this dataset. Experimental results show our approach achieves 90.72% accuracy and 89.33% precision in distinguishing between fall events and regular activities of daily living.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient for MIMO-AFDM System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is a promising chirp-assisted multicarrier waveform for future high mobility communications. A significant challenge in MIMO-AFDM systems is the multi-user interference (MUI), which can be effectively addressed by employing precoding techniques. However, the complexity introduced by AFDM makes the precoding process computationally expensive and challenging. To overcome this issue, We combine AFDM channel sparse property and using Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method to iteratively process the precoding, thereby reducing the complexity of the precoding design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed sparsification approach, coupled with the PCG method, achieving quite precoding performance while significantly reducing computational complexity. This makes the application of AFDM more feasible and efficient for high-mobility communication scenarios, paving the way for its broader implementation in next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>SegmentAnyMuscle: A universal muscle segmentation model across different locations in MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantity and quality of muscles are increasingly recognized as important predictors of health outcomes. While MRI offers a valuable modality for such assessments, obtaining precise quantitative measurements of musculature remains challenging. This study aimed to develop a publicly available model for muscle segmentation in MRIs and demonstrate its applicability across various anatomical locations and imaging sequences. A total of 362 MRIs from 160 patients at a single tertiary center (Duke University Health System, 2016-2020) were included, with 316 MRIs from 114 patients used for model development. The model was tested on two separate sets: one with 28 MRIs representing common sequence types, achieving an average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 88.45%, and another with 18 MRIs featuring less frequent sequences and abnormalities such as muscular atrophy, hardware, and significant noise, achieving 86.21% DSC. These results demonstrate the feasibility of a fully automated deep learning algorithm for segmenting muscles on MRI across diverse settings. The public release of this model enables consistent, reproducible research into the relationship between musculature and health.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality Reduction on IoT Monitoring Data of Smart Building for Energy Consumption Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a major role today in smart building infrastructures, from simple smart-home applications, to more sophisticated industrial type installations. The vast amounts of data generated from relevant systems can be processed in different ways revealing important information. This is especially true in the era of edge computing, when advanced data analysis and decision-making is gradually moving to the edge of the network where devices are generally characterised by low computing resources. In this context, one of the emerging main challenges is related to maintaining data analysis accuracy even with less data that can be efficiently handled by low resource devices. The present work focuses on correlation analysis of data retrieved from a pilot IoT network installation monitoring a small smart office by means of environmental and energy consumption sensors. The research motivation was to find statistical correlation between the monitoring variables that will allow the use of machine learning (ML) prediction algorithms for energy consumption reducing input parameters. For this to happen, a series of hypothesis tests for the correlation of three different environmental variables with the energy consumption were carried out. A total of ninety tests were performed, thirty for each pair of variables. In these tests, p-values showed the existence of strong or semi-strong correlation with two environmental variables, and of a weak correlation with a third one. Using the proposed methodology, we manage without examining the entire data set to exclude weak correlated variables while keeping the same score of accuracy.</description>

      <title>Multi-Modal Beamforming with Model Compression and Modality Generation for V2X Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a cornerstone technology for predictive beamforming in 6G-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. However, existing ISAC paradigms rely solely on radio frequency (RF) signal, limiting sensing resolution and robustness in V2X environments with high mobility and multipath interference. Fortunately, the widespread deployment of diverse non-RF sensors such as cameras and LiDAR, along with the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and communication systems, offers new opportunities to improve the synergy between sensing and communication. Motivated by this, this work develops a novel and robust communication framework that leverages multi-modal sensing data and advanced AI technologies to assist beamforming in dynamic and realistic vehicular scenarios. Specifically, we propose a multi-modal learning framework for predictive beamforming that integrates modality-specific branches and employs hierarchical Transformer to capture cross-modal features. By exploiting the intrinsic correlation between multi-modal sensing data and beamforming decisions, this design enhances the accuracy and robustness of beamforming in dynamic V2X scenarios. To enable practical deployment on resource-constrained edge device (i.e., the roadside unit), we then develop a module-aware compression strategy that significantly reduces inference latency while preserving model performance. Furthermore, to address potential modality missing in real-world scenarios, we introduce a generative model that is able to reconstruct missing inputs from available observations, allowing the framework to operate reliably even under incomplete sensing conditions. Extensive simulation results conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme consistently outperforms existing baselines across various metrics.</description>

      <title>Continual Learning for Wireless Channel Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern 5G/6G deployments routinely face cross-configuration handovers--users traversing cells with different antenna layouts, carrier frequencies, and scattering statistics--which inflate channel-prediction NMSE by $37.5\%$ on average when models are naively fine-tuned. The proposed improvement frames this mismatch as a continual-learning problem and benchmarks three adaptation families: replay with loss-aware reservoirs, synaptic-importance regularization, and memory-free learning-without-forgetting. Across three representative 3GPP urban micro scenarios, the best replay and regularization schemes cut the high-SNR error floor by up to 2~dB ($\approx 35\%$), while even the lightweight distillation recovers up to $30\%$ improvement over baseline handover prediction schemes. These results show that targeted rehearsal and parameter anchoring are essential for handover-robust CSI prediction and suggest a clear migration path for embedding continual-learning hooks into current channel prediction efforts in 3GPP--NR and O-RAN.

      <title>Optical Waveguide-based Spider Web Enables Resilient Impact Detection and Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiders use their webs as multifunctional tools that enable capturing and localizing prey and more general environmental sensing through vibrations. Inspired by their biological function, we present a spider web-inspired optical waveguide system for resilient impulse detection and localization. The structure consists of six clear thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) waveguides arranged radially and interconnected by a spiral TPU thread, mimicking orb spider webs. Light transmission losses, induced by vibrations, are measured via coupled LEDs and photo-diodes, allowing real-time detection. We systematically characterize individual waveguides, analyzing key parameters such as tension, impulse position, and break angle to optimize vibrational response. The complete system is validated through controlled experiments, revealing a 5 ms propagation delay in vibration transfer between adjacent radii, enhancing localization capabilities. We demonstrate a robust impulse detection and localization algorithm leveraging time delay analysis, achieving reliable event identification even in cases of sensor failure. This study highlights the potential of bioinspired optical waveguide structures for adaptive sensing, with applications in soft robotics, structural monitoring, and environmental sensing.</description>

      <title>An Interpretable Transformer-Based Foundation Model for Cross-Procedural Skill Assessment Using Raw fNIRS Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective skill assessment in high-stakes procedural environments requires models that not only decode underlying cognitive and motor processes but also generalize across tasks, individuals, and experimental contexts. While prior work has demonstrated the potential of functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) for evaluating cognitive-motor performance, existing approaches are often task-specific, rely on extensive preprocessing, and lack robustness to new procedures or conditions. Here, we introduce an interpretable transformer-based foundation model trained on minimally processed fNIRS signals for cross-procedural skill assessment. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on data from laparoscopic surgical tasks and endotracheal intubation (ETI), the model achieves greater than 88% classification accuracy on all tasks, with Matthews Correlation Coefficient exceeding 0.91 on ETI. It generalizes to a novel emergency airway procedure--cricothyrotomy--using fewer than 30 labeled samples and a lightweight (less than 2k parameter) adapter module, attaining an AUC greater than 87%. Interpretability is achieved via a novel channel attention mechanism--developed specifically for fNIRS--that identifies functionally coherent prefrontal sub-networks validated through ablation studies. Temporal attention patterns align with task-critical phases and capture stress-induced changes in neural variability, offering insight into dynamic cognitive states.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot EEG-to-Gait Decoding via Phase-Aware Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate decoding of lower-limb motion from EEG signals is essential for advancing brain-computer interface (BCI) applications in movement intent recognition and control. However, challenges persist in achieving causal, phase-consistent predictions and in modeling both inter- and intra-subject variability. To address these issues, we propose NeuroDyGait, a domain-generalizable EEG-to-motion decoding framework that leverages structured contrastive representation learning and relational domain modeling. The proposed method employs relative contrastive learning to achieve semantic alignment between EEG and motion embeddings. Furthermore, a multi-cycle gait reconstruction objective is introduced to enforce temporal coherence and maintain biomechanical consistency. To promote inter-session generalization, during fine-tuning, a domain dynamic decoding mechanism adaptively assigns session-specific prediction heads and learns to mix their outputs based on inter-session relationships. NeuroDyGait enables zero-shot motion prediction for unseen individuals without requiring adaptation and achieves superior performance in cross-subject gait decoding on benchmark datasets. Additionally, it demonstrates strong phase-detection capabilities even without explicit phase supervision during training. These findings highlight the potential of relational domain learning in enabling scalable, target-free deployment of BCIs.</description>

      <title>Masked Autoencoders that Feel the Heart: Unveiling Simplicity Bias for ECG Analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diagnostic value of electrocardiogram (ECG) lies in its dynamic characteristics, ranging from rhythm fluctuations to subtle waveform deformations that evolve across time and frequency domains. However, supervised ECG models tend to overfit dominant and repetitive patterns, overlooking fine-grained but clinically critical cues, a phenomenon known as Simplicity Bias (SB), where models favor easily learnable signals over subtle but informative ones. In this work, we first empirically demonstrate the presence of SB in ECG analyses and its negative impact on diagnostic performance, while simultaneously discovering that self-supervised learning (SSL) can alleviate it, providing a promising direction for tackling the bias. Following the SSL paradigm, we propose a novel method comprising two key components: 1) Temporal-Frequency aware Filters to capture temporal-frequency features reflecting the dynamic characteristics of ECG signals, and 2) building on this, Multi-Grained Prototype Reconstruction for coarse and fine representation learning across dual domains, further mitigating SB. To advance SSL in ECG analyses, we curate a large-scale multi-site ECG dataset with 1.53 million recordings from over 300 clinical centers. Experiments on three downstream tasks across six ECG datasets demonstrate that our method effectively reduces SB and achieves state-of-the-art performance. Code and dataset will be released publicly.</description>

      <title>50 GHz Piezoelectric Acoustic Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents significant frequency scaling of acoustic filter technology to 50 GHz. This achievement is enabled by the P3F LiNbO3 multilayer stack, in which piezoelectric thin-films of alternating orientations are transferred in sequence, thereby allowing efficient exploitation of high-order modes with high quality factor (Q) and coupling coefficient (k2) in a thicker piezoelectric stack. The demonstrated filter is comprised of twelfth-order symmetric (S12) mode lateral-field-excited bulk acoustic wave resonators (XBARs), built on a 4-layer periodically poled piezoelectric (P3F) 128 Y-cut lithium niobate (LiNbO3) stack. The filter exhibits 3.3 dB insertion loss (IL) and a fractional bandwidth (FBW) of 2.9%. The miniature design, with a footprint of 0.36 mm2, makes it promising for future wireless front-end applications. These results represent the highest frequency acoustic filters reported to date, setting a new benchmark in piezoelectric filter technology. Upon further development, the platform could enable filters further into the FR2 range, essential for next-generation communication systems.</description>

      <title>Channel Knowledge Map-assisted Dual-domain Tracking and Predictive Beamforming for High-Mobility Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel channel knowledge map (CKM)-assisted dual-domain tracking and predictive beamforming scheme for high-mobility wireless networks. The central premise is that the CKM integrates both the coordinate and beam domains, thereby enabling tracking in one domain via treating the other domain's input as priors or measurements. In the coordinate domain (C-Domain), an extended Kalman filter (EKF) is employed to predict and track the state (i.e., location and velocity) of a moving communication receiver across time slots under both line-of-sight (LoS)-present and LoS-absent conditions, where the CKM provides a prior mapping from multipath channel parameters to potential target locations. In the beam domain (B-Domain), the updated location of the receiver is fed back to CKM to offer a priori information of angle of arrival (AoA) variations, which are incorporated to establish beam transition models for effective beam tracking, depending on the angular variation situation of each path. Then, we analyze the Cram\'er-Rao Bound (CRB) for AoA estimation for each path in the considered system and propose a jointly predictive beamforming and power allocation design to minimize AoA estimation errors, directly enhancing multipath beam tracking accuracy and indirectly improving target tracking performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves significant improvements in both target and beam tracking performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in AoA tracking of non-line-of-sight (NLoS) paths, highlighting the potential gain of CKM in facilitating both target and beam tracking in high-mobility communications.</description>

      <title>Sensing Security Oriented OFDM-ISAC Against Multi-Intercept Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, security has emerged as a critical aspect of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. While significant research has focused on secure communications, particularly in ensuring physical layer security, the issue of sensing security has received comparatively less attention. This paper addresses the sensing security problem in ISAC, particularly under the threat of multi-intercept adversaries. We consider a realistic scenario in which the sensing target is an advanced electronic reconnaissance aircraft capable of employing multiple signal interception techniques, such as power detection (PD) and cyclostationary analysis (CA). To evaluate sensing security under such sophisticated threats, we analyze two critical features of the transmitted signal: (i) power distribution and (ii) cyclic spectrum. Further, we introduce a novel ergodic cyclic spectrum metric which leverages the intrinsic mathematical structure of cyclostationary signals to more comprehensively characterize their behavior. Building on this analysis, we formulate a new ISAC design problem that explicitly considers sensing security, and we develop a low-complexity, efficient optimization approach to solve it. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed metric is both effective and insightful, and that our ISAC design significantly enhances sensing security performance in the presence of multi-intercept threats.</description>

      <title>Coexistence analysis of Wi-Fi 6E and 5G NR-U in the 6 GHz band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-increasing demand for broadband and IoT wireless connectivity has recently urged the regulators around the world to start opening the 6 GHz spectrum for unlicensed use. These bands will, for example, permit the use of additional 1.2 GHz in the US and 500 MHz in Europe for unlicensed radio access technologies (RATs) such as Wi-Fi and 5G New Radio Unlicensed (5G NR-U). To support QoS-sensitive applications with both technologies, fair and efficient coexistence approaches between the two RATs, as well as with incumbents already operating in the 6 GHz band, are crucial. In this paper, we study through extensive simulations the achievable mean downlink throughput of both Wi-Fi 6E APs and 5G NR-U gNBs when they are co-deployed in a dense residential scenario under high-interference conditions. We also explore how different parameter settings e.g., MAC frame aggregation, energy detection threshold and maximum channel occupancy time (MCOT) affect the coexistence. Our findings give important insights into how to tune the key parameters to design fair coexistence policies.</description>

      <title>Limited Feedback in RIS-Assisted Wireless Communications: Use Cases, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) is essential to unlock the potential of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) in wireless communication systems. Since massive RIS elements are typically implemented without baseband signal processing capabilities, limited CSI feedback is necessary when designing the reflection/refraction coefficients of the RIS. In this article, the unique RIS-assisted channel features, such as the RIS position-dependent channel fluctuation, the ultra-high dimensional sub-channel matrix, and the structured sparsity, are distilled from recent advances in limited feedback and used as guidelines for designing feedback schemes. We begin by illustrating the use cases and the corresponding challenges associated with RIS feedback. We then discuss how to leverage techniques such as channel customization, structured-sparsity, autoencoders, and others to reduce feedback overhead and complexity when devising feedback schemes. Finally, we identify potential research directions by considering the unresolved challenges, the new RIS architecture, and the integration with multi-modal information and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Radar Ambiguity Functions: Mathematical Formulation and Computational Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ambiguity function is fundamental to radar waveform design, characterizing range and Doppler resolution capabilities. However, its traditional formulation involves non-differentiable operations, preventing integration with gradient-based optimization methods and modern machine learning frameworks. This paper presents the first complete mathematical framework and computational implementation for differentiable radar ambiguity functions. Our approach addresses the fundamental technical challenges that have prevented the radar community from leveraging automatic differentiation: proper handling of complex-valued gradients using Wirtinger calculus, efficient computation through parallelized FFT operations, numerical stability throughout cascaded operations, and composability with arbitrary differentiable operations. We term this approach GRAF (Gradient-based Radar Ambiguity Functions), which reformulates the ambiguity function computation to maintain mathematical equivalence while enabling gradient flow through the entire pipeline. The resulting implementation provides a general-purpose differentiable ambiguity function compatible with modern automatic differentiation frameworks, enabling new research directions including neural network-based waveform generation with ambiguity constraints, end-to-end optimization of radar systems, and integration of classical radar theory with modern deep learning. We provide complete implementation details and demonstrate computational efficiency suitable for practical applications. This work establishes the mathematical and computational foundation for applying modern machine learning techniques to radar waveform design, bridging classical radar signal processing with automatic differentiation frameworks.</description>

      <title>Rate Maximization for Fluid Antenna System Assisted Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of rate maximization in a fluid antenna system (FAS) assisted
  semantic communication system. In the considered model, a base station (BS) with multiple static antennas employs semantic extraction techniques to compress the data ready to be sent to a user. The user equipped with a fluid antenna is located in the near field coverage region of the BS. Our aim is to jointly optimize the transmit beamforming and the semantic compression rate at the BS, as well as the selection of activated ports in FAS, to maximize the equivalent transmission ratio under a specific power budget. We design an alternating algorithm to solve the problem, where we obtain the optimal semantic compression ratio is in closed form at each step. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Zak-OFDM: Low Complexity Joint Equalization of OFDM Carriers in Doubly-Spread Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We communicate over wireless channels by first estimating and then equalizing the effective channel. In Zak-OTFS (orthogonal time frequency space) modulation the carrier waveform is a pulse in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, formally a quasi-periodic localized function with specific periods along delay and Doppler. When the channel delay spread is less than the delay period, and the channel Doppler spread is less than the Doppler period, the response to a single Zak-OTFS carrier provides an image of the scattering environment and can be used to predict the effective channel at all other carriers. This makes channel estimation straightforward, and there is no loss in spectral efficiency since it is possible to design data and pilot signals that are mutually unbiased. However, the naive approach to equalization has complexity ${\mathcal O}(M^3N^3)$ where $M$ and $N$ are respectively the number of delay and Doppler bins in an OTFS frame. We simplify equalization by transforming Zak-OTFS information symbols to CP-OFDM (cyclic prefix orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) modulation.
  Why not simply communicate with CP-OFDM? Inter-carrier interference (ICI) in CP-OFDM makes it is very challenging to acquire the complete frequency domain (FD) channel response between subcarriers in the presence of mobility and delay spread. We avoid this difficulty by estimating the effective channel in the DD domain from which we are able to reconstruct the complete FD channel response. We take advantage of CP-OFDM to design an ${\mathcal O}(M^2N^2)$ low-complexity method of jointly equalizing all subcarriers, where $MN$ is the number of subcarriers. Our approach removes the need for traditional pilots in CP-OFDM and reduces the need to vary carrier spacing with mobility.</description>

      <title>Belief Propagation-based Target Handover in Distributed Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed integrated sensing and communication (DISAC) systems are key enablers for 6G networks, offering the capability to jointly track multiple targets using spatially distributed base stations (BSs). A fundamental challenge in DISAC is the seamless and efficient handover of target tracks between BSs with partially overlapping fields of view, especially in dense and dynamic environments. In this paper, we propose a novel target handover framework based on belief propagation (BP) for multi-target tracking in DISAC systems. By representing the probabilistic data association and tracking problem through a factor graph, the proposed method enables efficient marginal inference with reduced computational complexity. Our framework introduces a principled handover criterion and message-passing strategy that minimizes inter-BS communication while maintaining tracking continuity and accuracy. We demonstrate that the proposed handover procedure achieves performance comparable to centralized processing, yet significantly reduces data exchange and processing overhead. Extensive simulations validate the robustness of the approach in urban tracking scenarios with closely spaced targets.</description>

      <title>Multi-Branch DNN and CRLB-Ratio-Weight Fusion for Enhanced DOA Sensing via a Massive H$^2$AD MIMO Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a green MIMO structure, massive H$^2$AD is viewed as a potential technology for the future 6G wireless network. For such a structure, it is a challenging task to design a low-complexity and high-performance fusion of target direction values sensed by different sub-array groups with fewer use of prior knowledge. To address this issue, a lightweight Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB)-ratio-weight fusion (WF) method is proposed, which approximates inverse CRLB of each subarray using antenna number reciprocals to eliminate real-time CRLB computation. This reduces complexity and prior knowledge dependence while preserving fusion performance. Moreover, a multi-branch deep neural network (MBDNN) is constructed to further enhance direction-of-arrival (DOA) sensing by leveraging candidate angles from multiple subarrays. The subarray-specific branch networks are integrated with a shared regression module to effectively eliminate pseudo-solutions and fuse true angles. Simulation results show that the proposed CRLB-ratio-WF method achieves DOA sensing performance comparable to CRLB-based methods, while significantly reducing the reliance on prior knowledge. More notably, the proposed MBDNN has superior performance in low-SNR ranges. At SNR $= -15$ dB, it achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in estimation accuracy compared to CRLB-ratio-WF method.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Solar Energy Production in the USA: Time-Series Analysis Using AI for Smart Energy Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the US rapidly moves towards cleaner energy sources, solar energy is fast becoming the pillar of its renewable energy mix. Even while solar energy is increasingly being used, its variability is a key hindrance to grid stability, storage efficiency, and system stability overall. Solar energy has emerged as one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources in the United States, adding noticeably to the country's energy mix. Retrospectively, the necessity of inserting the sun's energy into the grid without disrupting reliability and cost efficiencies highlights the necessity of good forecasting software and smart control systems. The dataset utilized for this research project comprised both hourly and daily solar energy production records collected from multiple utility-scale solar farms across diverse U.S. regions, including California, Texas, and Arizona. Training and evaluation of all models were performed with a time-based cross-validation scheme, namely, sliding window validation. Both the Random Forest and the XG-Boost models demonstrated noticeably greater and the same performance across each of the measures considered, with relatively high accuracy. The almost perfect and equal performance by the Random Forest and XG-Boost models also shows both models to have learned the patterns in the data very comprehensively, with high reliability in their predictions. By incorporating AI-powered time-series models like XG-Boost in grid management software, utility companies can dynamically modify storage cycles in real-time as well as dispatch and peak load planning, based on their predictions. AI-powered solar forecasting also has profound implications for renewable energy policy and planning, particularly as U.S. federal and state governments accelerate toward ambitious decarbonization goals.</description>

      <title>Integrated Polarimetric Sensing and Communication with Polarization-Reconfigurable Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization diversity offers a cost- and space-efficient solution to enhance the performance of integrated sensing and communication systems. Polarimetric sensing exploits the signal's polarity to extract details about the target such as shape, pose, and material composition. From a communication perspective, polarization diversity can enhance the reliability and throughput of communication channels. This paper proposes an integrated polarimetric sensing and communication (IPSAC) system that jointly conducts polarimetric sensing and communications. We study the use of single-port polarization-reconfigurable antennas to adapt to channel depolarization effects, without the need for separate RF chains for each polarization. We address the problem of optimizing waveforms and polarizations based on two sensing metrics. We first consider minimizing the mean square error (MSE) of the target depolarization parameter estimate, which is a critical task for various polarimetric radar applications such as rainfall forecasting, vegetation identification, and target classification. To address this nonconvex problem, we apply semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and majorization-minimization (MM) optimization techniques. Next, we consider a design that maximizes the target signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) leveraging prior knowledge of the target and clutter depolarization statistics to enhance the target detection performance. To tackle this problem, we modify the solution developed for MSE minimization subject to the same quality-of-service (QoS) constraints. Extensive simulations show that the proposed polarization reconfiguration method substantially improves the depolarization parameter MSE. Furthermore, the proposed method considerably boosts the target SINR due to polarization diversity, particularly in cluttered environments.</description>

      <title>All-Optical Inter-Satellite Relays with Intelligent Beam Control: Harnessing Liquid Lenses and Optical Hard Limiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations are emerging as a key enabler of next-generation communications, offering global coverage and significantly lower latency compared to traditional terrestrial networks and geostationary satellites. However, further latency reduction is essential for time-critical applications such as real-time sensing, autonomous systems, and interactive services. One critical bottleneck is the optical-to-electrical (O/E) and electrical-to-optical (E/O) conversions at intermediate nodes in multi-hop links, which introduce unwanted processing delays. To address this, we investigate an all-optical relay system based on Optical Hard Limiters (OHL), which operate purely in the optical domain to suppress noise and restore signal quality without requiring O/E conversions. First, we present a rigorous analysis of inter-satellite multi-relay communication under the OHL relaying architecture, comparing it against conventional Amplify-and-Forward (AF) and Decode-and-Forward (DF) schemes. Through this comparison, we highlight both the advantages and limitations of OHL relays, including their particular sensitivity to parameter choices such as the threshold setting and divergence angle at the transmitter. Recognizing that a LEO constellation is inherently time-varying - satellites move relative to one another, causing continuous changes in link distances and tracking errors - we propose a joint optimization strategy. This scheme adaptively tunes the OHL decision threshold and beam divergence in real time to maintain optimal performance, ultimately lowering error rates and latency. Extensive simulations in a large-scale LEO network demonstrate the viability of our method and offer insights into practical implementation for next-generation inter-satellite communication systems.</description>

      <title>General Signal Model and Capacity Limit for Rydberg Quantum Information System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic receivers represent a transformative approach to achieving high-sensitivity, broadband, and miniaturized radio frequency (RF) reception. However, existing static signal models for Rydberg atomic receivers rely on the steady-state assumption of atomic quantum states, which cannot fully describe the signal reception process of dynamic signals. To fill in this gap, in this paper, we present a general model to compute the dynamic signal response of Rydberg atomic receivers in closed form. Specifically, by applying small-signal perturbation techniques to the quantum master equation, we derive closed-form Laplace domain transfer functions that characterize the receiver's dynamic responses to time-varying signal fields. To gain more insights into the quantum-based RF-photocurrent conversion process, we further introduce the concept of quantum transconductance that describes the quantum system as an equivalent classical system. By applying quantum transconductance, we quantify the influence of in-band blackbody radiation (BBR) noise on the atomic receiver sensitivity. Extensive simulations for Rydberg atomic receivers validate the proposed signal model, and demonstrate the possibility of quantum receivers to outperform classical electronic receivers through the improvement of quantum transconductance.</description>

      <title>Automatic Phase Calibration for High-resolution mmWave Sensing via Ambient Radio Anchors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar systems with large array have pushed radar sensing into a new era, thanks to their high angular resolution. However, our long-term experiments indicate that array elements exhibit phase drift over time and require periodic phase calibration to maintain high-resolution, creating an obstacle for practical high-resolution mmWave sensing. Unfortunately, existing calibration methods are inadequate for periodic recalibration, either because they rely on artificial references or fail to provide sufficient precision. To address this challenge, we introduce AutoCalib, the first framework designed to automatically and accurately calibrate high-resolution mmWave radars by identifying Ambient Radio Anchors (ARAs)-naturally existing objects in ambient environments that offer stable phase references. AutoCalib achieves calibration by first generating spatial spectrum templates based on theoretical electromagnetic characteristics. It then employs a pattern-matching and scoring mechanism to accurately detect these anchors and select the optimal one for calibration. Extensive experiments across 11 environments demonstrate that AutoCalib capable of identifying ARAs that existing methods miss due to their focus on strong reflectors. AutoCalib's calibration performance approaches corner reflectors (74% phase error reduction) while outperforming existing methods by 83%. Beyond radar calibration, AutoCalib effectively supports other phase-dependent applications like handheld imaging, delivering 96% of corner reflector calibration performance without artificial references.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Sensing in Cell-free Massive MIMO ISAC Systems: Performance Optimization and Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), as a technology enabled seamless connection between communication and sensing, is regarded a core enabling technology for these applications. However, the accuracy of single-node sensing in ISAC system is limited, prompting the emergence of multi-node cooperative sensing. In multi-node cooperative sensing, the synchronization error limits the sensing accuracy, which can be mitigated by the architecture of cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (CF-mMIMO), since the multiple nodes are interconnected via optical fibers with high synchronization accuracy. However, the multi-node cooperative sensing in CF-mMIMO ISAC systems faces the following challenges: 1) The joint optimization of placement and resource allocation of distributed access points (APs) to improve the sensing performance in multi-target detection scenario is difficult; 2) The fusion of the sensing information from distributed APs with multi-view discrepancies is difficult. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a joint placement and antenna resource optimization scheme for distributed APs to minimize the sensing Cramr-Rao bound for targets' parameters within the area of interest. Then, a symbol-level fusion-based multi-dynamic target sensing (SL-MDTS) scheme is provided, effectively fusing sensing information from multiple APs. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the joint optimization scheme and the superiority of the SL-MDTS scheme. Compared to state-of-the-art grid-based symbol-level sensing information fusion schemes, the proposed SL-MDTS scheme improves the accuracy of localization and velocity estimation by 44 % and 41.4 %, respectively.</description>

      <title>Far-Field vs. Near-Field Propagation Channels: Key Differences and Impact on 6G XL-MIMO Performance Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is regarded as a promising technology for next-generation communication systems. However, this will expand the near-field (NF) range, rendering more users more likely to be located in the NF region. In this paper, we aim to answer two questions: What are the new characteristics of the NF channel? Is it necessary to develop new transciver techniques to maintain system performance within the NF region? To this end, we first review current NF channel models and analyze the differences between the existing 3GPP TR 38.901 channel model and the NF channel model, including the spherical wavefront and spatially non-stationarity. Then, we provide examples on how these differences affect the XL-MIMO system performance in terms of beamforming gain and achievable rate. Simulation results demonstrate that, when using far-field (FF) technique under the NF channel, the maximum normalized beam gain loss is less than 3 dB for most users in the NF region defined by Rayleigh distance. Moreover, the achievable rate loss of beam training is less than 3% compared to that realized by NF technique. Finally, we demonstrate the necessity of employing NF transceiver techniques based on simulation results.</description>

      <title>Mutli-Level Autoencoder: Deep Learning Based Channel Coding and Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we design a deep learning-based convolutional autoencoder for channel coding and modulation. The objective is to develop an adaptive scheme capable of operating at various signal-to-noise ratios (SNR)s without the need for re-training. Additionally, the proposed framework allows validation by testing all possible codes in the codebook, as opposed to previous AI-based encoder/decoder frameworks which relied on testing only a small subset of the available codes. This limitation in earlier methods often led to unreliable conclusions when generalized to larger codebooks. In contrast to previous methods, our multi-level encoding and decoding approach splits the message into blocks, where each encoder block processes a distinct group of $B$ bits. By doing so, the proposed scheme can exhaustively test $2^{B}$ possible codewords for each encoder/decoder level, constituting a layer of the overall scheme. The proposed model was compared to classical polar codes and TurboAE-MOD schemes, showing improved reliability with achieving comparable, or even superior results in some settings. Notably, the architecture can adapt to different SNRs by selectively removing one of the encoder/decoder layers without re-training, thus demonstrating flexibility and efficiency in practical wireless communication scenarios.</description>

      <title>Sensing for Free: Learn to Localize More Sources than Antennas without Pilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) represents a key paradigm for future wireless networks. However, existing approaches require waveform modifications, dedicated pilots, or overhead that complicates standards integration. We propose sensing for free - performing multi-source localization without pilots by reusing uplink data symbols, making sensing occur during transmission and directly compatible with 3GPP 5G NR and 6G specifications. With ever-increasing devices in dense 6G networks, this approach is particularly compelling when combined with sparse arrays, which can localize more sources than uniform arrays via an enlarged virtual array. Existing pilot-free multi-source localization algorithms first reconstruct an extended covariance matrix and apply subspace methods, incurring cubic complexity and limited to second-order statistics. Performance degrades under non-Gaussian data symbols and few snapshots, and higher-order statistics remain unexploited. We address these challenges with an attention-only transformer that directly processes raw signal snapshots for grid-less end-to-end direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. The model efficiently captures higher-order statistics while being permutation-invariant and adaptive to varying snapshot counts. Our algorithm greatly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-based benchmarks with over 30x reduction in parameters and runtime, and enjoys excellent generalization under practical mismatches. Applied to multi-user MIMO beam training, our algorithm can localize uplink DOAs of multiple users during data transmission. Through angular reciprocity, estimated uplink DOAs prune downlink beam sweeping candidates and improve throughput via sensing-assisted beam management. This work shows how reusing existing data transmission for sensing can enhance both multi-source localization and beam management in 3GPP efforts towards 6G.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Modulation Optimization with LMMSE Equalization for Reliability Enhancement in Underwater Acoustic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-reliable underwater acoustic (UWA) communications serve as one of the key enabling technologies for future space-air-ground-underwater integrated networks. However, the reliability of current UWA transmission is still insufficient since severe performance degradation occurs for conventional multicarrier systems in UWA channels with severe delay-scale spread. To solve this problem, we exploit learning-inspired approaches to optimize the modulation scheme under the assumption of linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) equalization, where the discrete representation of waveforms is adopted by utilizing Nyquist filters. The optimization problem is first transferred into maximizing the fairness of estimation mean square error (MSE) for each data symbol since the total MSE is invariant considering the property of orthogonal modulation. The Siamese architecture is then adopted to obtain consistent optimization results across various channel conditions, which avoids the overhead of online feedback, cooperation, and deployment of neural networks and guarantees generalization. The overall scheme including the loss function, neural network structure, and training process is also investigated in depth in this paper. The excellent performance and robustness of the proposed modulation scheme are verified by carrying out the bit error rate test over various UWA channels with severe delay-scale spread.</description>

      <title>A Fast and Accurate 3-D Reconstruction Algorithm for Near-Range Microwave Imaging with Handheld Synthetic Aperture Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of image reconstruction algorithms for near-range handheld synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems has gained increasing popularity due to the promising performance of portable millimeter-wave (MMW) imaging devices in various application fields. Time domain imaging algorithms including the backprojection algorithm (BPA) and the Kirchhoff migration algorithm (KMA) are widely adopted due to their direct applicability to arbitrary scan trajectories. However, they suffer from time complexity issues that hinder their practical application. Wavenumber domain algorithms greatly improve the computational efficiency but most of them are restricted to specific array topologies. Based on the factorization techniques as adopted in far-field synthetic aperture radar imaging, the time domain fast factorized backprojection algorithm for handheld synthetic aperture radar (HHFFBPA) is proposed. The local spectral properties of the radar images for handheld systems are analyzed and analytical spectrum compression techniques are derived to realize efficient sampling of the subimages. Validated through numerical simulations and experiments, HHFFBPA achieves fast and accurate 3-D imaging for handheld synthetic aperture radar systems with arbitrary trajectories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless channel propagation parameter estimation forms the foundation of channel sounding, estimation, modeling, and sensing. This paper introduces a Deep Learning approach for joint delay- and Doppler estimation from frequency and time samples of a radio channel transfer function.
  Our work estimates the two-dimensional path parameters from a channel impulse response containing an unknown number of paths. Compared to existing deep learning-based methods, the parameters are not estimated via classification but in a quasi-grid-free manner. We employ a deterministic preprocessing scheme that incorporates a multi-channel windowing to increase the estimator's robustness and enables the use of a CNN architecture. The proposed architecture then jointly estimates the number of paths along with the respective delay and Doppler-shift parameters of the paths. Hence, it jointly solves the model order selection and parameter estimation task. We also integrate the CNN into an existing maximum-likelihood estimator framework for efficient initialization of a gradient-based iteration, to provide more accurate estimates.
  In the analysis, we compare our approach to other methods in terms of estimate accuracy and model order error on synthetic data. Finally, we demonstrate its applicability to real-world measurement data from a anechoic bi-static RADAR emulation measurement.</description>

      <title>Wideband Coverage Enhancement for IRS-Aided Wireless Networks Based on Power Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By applying tunable phase shifts to incident waves via passive signal reflection, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) can offer significant performance improvement for wireless communication systems. To reap such performance gain, channel knowledge for IRS-cascaded links is generally required, which is practically challenging to acquire due to their high-dimensional and time-varying characteristics. Conventional pilot-based channel estimation incurs excessive overhead due to the large number of reflecting elements, thus undermining the IRS efficiency, especially for wideband systems with frequency-selective fading channels. To tackle this issue, we propose in this letter a power-measurement-based channel autocorrelation matrix estimation and coverage enhancement approach for IRS-aided orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Specifically, by estimating equivalent channel autocorrelation matrices of IRS-cascaded OFDM channels based on receive signal power and optimizing the IRS reflection vector based on them, the average coverage performance in the IRS-aided region is enhanced without the need for frequent reconfiguration of IRS reflection coefficients based on user instantaneous channels. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for improving the average channel gain over the coverage region.</description>

      <title>E-WAN: Efficient Communication in Energy Harvesting Low-Power Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-increasing number of distributed embedded systems in the context of the Internet of Things (IoT), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), and Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) rely on wireless communication to collect and exchange data. Nodes can employ single-hop communication which, despite its ease, may necessitate energy-intensive long-range communication to cover long distances. Conversely, multi-hop communication allows for more energy-efficient short-range communication since nodes can rely on other nodes to forward their data. Yet, this approach requires relay nodes to be available and continuous maintenance of a dynamically changing distributed state. At the same time, energy harvesting has the potential to outperform traditional battery-based systems by improving their lifetime, scalability with lower maintenance costs, and environmental impact. However, the limited and temporally and spatially variable harvested energy poses significant challenges for networking in energy harvesting networks, particularly considering the energy demands and characteristics of both multi-hop and single-hop communication. We propose E-WAN, a protocol for energy harvesting wide-area low-power networks that builds on the concept of \emph{virtual sub-networks} to enable resource-efficient multi-hop communication when possible and reliable however energy-intensive point-to-point communication otherwise. Nodes autonomously and dynamically move between the two and adjust to changing network states and resources based only on easily obtainable network state information. We illustrate E-WAN's advantages both in terms of efficiency and adaptability in various communication and harvesting scenarios. Furthermore, we demonstrate E-WAN operating in a realistic setting by deploying an energy harvesting network in a real-world indoor environment.</description>

      <title>Optimized Frequency-Diverse Movable Antenna Arrays for Directional Secrecy in Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable-antenna (MA) arrays are envisioned as a promising technique for enhancing secrecy performance in wireless communications by leveraging additional spatial degrees of freedom. However, when the eavesdropper is located in the same direction as the legitimate user, particularly in mmWave/THz bands where line-of-sight (LOS) propagation dominates, the secrecy performance of MA arrays becomes significantly limited, thus directionally insecure. To address this challenge, we employ a joint design that combines an MA array with a frequency-diverse array (FDA) at the transmitter to secure the transmission across both range and direction. Specifically, we derive closed-form expressions for the optimal antenna positions and frequency shifts, assuming small perturbations in both parameters from a linear frequency-diverse MA configuration. Furthermore, we compare the worst-case secrecy rate under this minor perturbation assumption with that obtained under a general constraint, where simulated annealing is employed to numerically determine the optimal parameters. Simulation results confirm that the proposed optimized frequency diverse MA approach significantly enhances secrecy performance in the presence of an eavesdropper aligned with the direction of the legitimate receiver.</description>

      <title>Pinching-Antenna Systems with In-Waveguide Attenuation: Performance Analysis and Algorithm Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems have emerged as a promising flexible-antenna architecture for next-generation wireless networks, enabling enhanced adaptability and user-centric connectivity through antenna repositioning along waveguides. However, existing studies often overlook in-waveguide signal attenuation and in the literature, there is no comprehensive analysis on whether and under what conditions such an assumption is justified. This paper addresses this gap by explicitly incorporating in-waveguide attenuation into both the system model and algorithm design, and studying its impact on the downlink user data rates. We begin with a single-user scenario and derive a closed-form expression for the globally optimal antenna placement, which reveals how the attenuation coefficient and the user-to-waveguide distance jointly affect the optimal antenna position. Based on this analytical solution, we further provide a theoretical analysis identifying the system conditions under which the in-waveguide attenuation has an insignificant impact on the user achievable rate. The study is then extended to the multi-user multiple-input multiple-output setting, where two efficient algorithms are developed, based on the weighted minimum mean square error method and the maximum ratio combining method, to jointly optimize beamforming and antenna placement. Simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed algorithms and demonstrate that pinching-antenna systems substantially outperform conventional fixed-antenna baselines, underscoring their potential for future flexible wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Post-processing of EEG-based Auditory Attention Decoding Decisions via Hidden Markov Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Auditory attention decoding (AAD) algorithms exploit brain signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG), to identify which speaker a listener is focusing on in a multi-speaker environment. While state-of-the-art AAD algorithms can identify the attended speaker on short time windows, their predictions are often too inaccurate for practical use. In this work, we propose augmenting AAD with a hidden Markov model (HMM) that models the temporal structure of attention. More specifically, the HMM relies on the fact that a subject is much less likely to switch attention than to keep attending the same speaker at any moment in time. We show how a HMM can significantly improve existing AAD algorithms in both causal (real-time) and non-causal (offline) settings. We further demonstrate that HMMs outperform existing postprocessing approaches in both accuracy and responsiveness, and explore how various factors such as window length, switching frequency, and AAD accuracy influence overall performance. The proposed method is computationally efficient, intuitive to use and applicable in both real-time and offline settings.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Discovery of Behavioral Primitives from Sensorimotor Dynamic Functional Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The movements of both animals and robots give rise to streams of high-dimensional motor and sensory information. Imagine the brain of a newborn or the controller of a baby humanoid robot trying to make sense of unprocessed sensorimotor time series. Here, we present a framework for studying the dynamic functional connectivity between the multimodal sensory signals of a robotic agent to uncover an underlying structure. Using instantaneous mutual information, we capture the time-varying functional connectivity (FC) between proprioceptive, tactile, and visual signals, revealing the sensorimotor relationships. Using an infinite relational model, we identified sensorimotor modules and their evolving connectivity. To further interpret these dynamic interactions, we employed non-negative matrix factorization, which decomposed the connectivity patterns into additive factors and their corresponding temporal coefficients. These factors can be considered the agent's motion primitives or movement synergies that the agent can use to make sense of its sensorimotor space and later for behavior selection. In the future, the method can be deployed in robot learning as well as in the analysis of human movement trajectories or brain signals.</description>

      <title>An Urban Multi-Operator QoE-Aware Dataset for Cellular Networks in Dense Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban cellular networks face complex performance challenges due to high infrastructure density, varied user mobility, and diverse service demands. While several datasets address network behaviour across different environments, there is a lack of datasets that captures user centric Quality of Experience (QoE), and diverse mobility patterns needed for efficient network planning and optimization solutions, which are important for QoE driven optimizations and mobility management. This study presents a curated dataset of 30,925 labelled records, collected using GNetTrack Pro within a 2 km2 dense urban area, spanning three major commercial network operators. The dataset captures key signal quality parameters (e.g., RSRP, RSRQ, SNR), across multiple real world mobility modes including pedestrian routes, canopy walkways, shuttle buses, and Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) routes. It also includes diverse network traffic scenarios including (1) FTP upload and download, (2) video streaming, and (3) HTTP browsing. A total of 132 physical cell sites were identified and validated through OpenCellID and on-site field inspections, illustrating the high cell density characteristic of 5G and emerging heterogeneous network deployment. The dataset is particularly suited for machine learning applications, such as handover optimization, signal quality prediction, and multi operator performance evaluation. Released in a structured CSV format with accompanying preprocessing and visualization scripts, this dataset offers a reproducible, application ready resource for researchers and practitioners working on urban cellular network planning and optimization.</description>

      <title>Integrated Multimodal Sensing and Communication: Challenges, Technologies, and Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution towards 6G networks requires the intelligent integration of communication and sensing capabilities to support diverse and complex applications, such as autonomous driving and immersive services. However, existing integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems predominantly rely on single-modal sensors as primary participants, which leads to a limited representation of environmental features and significant performance bottlenecks under the emerging requirements of 6G applications. This limitation motivates a paradigm shift from single-modal to multimodal ISAC. In this article, we first analyze the key challenges in realizing multimodal ISAC, including the fusion of heterogeneous multimodal data, the high communication overhead among distributed sensors, and the design of efficient and scalable system architectures. We then introduce several enabling technologies, such as large AI models, semantic communication, and multi-agent systems, that hold promise for addressing these challenges. To operationalize these technologies, we zoom into three architectural paradigms: fusion-based multimodal ISAC (F-MAC), interaction-based multimodal ISAC (I-MAC), and relay-based multimodal ISAC (R-MAC), each tailored to organize devices and modalities for efficient collaboration in different scenarios. Thereafter, a case study is presented based on the F-MAC scheme, demonstrating that the scheme achieves more comprehensive sensing and improves sensing accuracy by approximately 80% compared to conventional single-modal ISAC systems. Finally, we discuss several open issues to be addressed in the future.</description>

      <title>A Correlation-Based Design of RIS for Reduced Power Consumption and Simplified Control Circuitry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aiming at simplifying the hardware structure and reducing the energy consumption in wireless communication via reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), this paper introduces a novel RIS design founded on the correlation between the phase shift values of the surface elements. First, a correlation analysis is conducted, considering the azimuth angle of a target device within a coverage region spanning from $-80^{\circ}$ to $80^{\circ}$. The correlation is demonstrated for different deployment cases, creating the basis for the new RIS structure, termed Connected-RIS, where correlated elements are designed to share the same control signal. The fundamental performance of the proposed design is then analyzed in terms of control signals, power consumption, and communication system performance, comparing it to two RIS structures with full control: one with the same size as the proposed design, and the other employing the minimum number of elements necessary to satisfy the fair coverage criterion. The correlation-based RIS design enables three-dimensional passive beamforming and significantly reduces the number of required load impedances and control signals, thereby lowering the hardware cost and simplifying the control circuitry. It also achieves substantial power savings as compared to the baseline schemes, while maintaining sufficient gain for a fair radio coverage. For instance, numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed design reduces the power consumption by almost 86-92\% and the control signals by 83-98\% compared to operation with fully controlled RIS.</description>

      <title>Robust Tensor Completion via Gradient Tensor Nulclear L1-L2 Norm for Traffic Data Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, spatiotemporal traffic data frequently experiences dual degradation from missing values and noise caused by sensor malfunctions and communication failures. Therefore, effective data recovery methods are essential to ensure the reliability of downstream data-driven applications. while classical tensor completion methods have been widely adopted, they are incapable of modeling noise, making them unsuitable for complex scenarios involving simultaneous data missingness and noise interference. Existing Robust Tensor Completion (RTC) approaches offer potential solutions by separately modeling the actual tensor data and noise. However, their effectiveness is often constrained by the over-relaxation of convex rank surrogates and the suboptimal utilization of local consistency, leading to inadequate model accuracy. To address these limitations, we first introduce the tensor L1-L2 norm, a novel non-convex tensor rank surrogate that functions as an effective low-rank representation tool. Leveraging an advanced feature fusion strategy, we further develop the gradient tensor L1-L2 norm by incorporating the tensor L1-L2 norm in the gradient domain. By integrating the gradient tensor nuclear L1-L2 norm into the RTC framework, we propose the Robust Tensor Completion via Gradient Tensor Nuclear L1-L2 Norm (RTC-GTNLN) model, which not only fully exploits both global low-rankness and local consistency without trade-off parameter, but also effectively handles the dual degradation challenges of missing data and noise in traffic data. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the RTC-GTNLN model consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in complex recovery scenarios involving simultaneous missing values and noise.</description>

      <title>TriADA: Massively Parallel Trilinear Matrix-by-Tensor Multiply-Add Algorithm and Device Architecture for the Acceleration of 3D Discrete Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilinear transformations are key in high-performance computing (HPC) and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, where data is represented as tensors. However, their high computational and memory demands, which grow with dimensionality, often slow down critical tasks. Moreover, scaling computation by enlarging the number of parallel processing units substantially increases energy consumption, limiting widespread adoption, especially for sparse data, which is common in HPC and AI applications. This paper introduces the Trilinear Algorithm and isomorphic to algorithm Device Architecture (TriADA) to address these challenges with the following innovations: (1) a massively parallel, low-rank algorithm for computing a family of trilinear (3D) discrete orthogonal transformations (3D-DXTs), which is a special case of the more general 3-mode matrix-by-tensor multiplication (3D-GEMT); (2) a new outer-product-based GEMM kernel with decoupled streaming active memory, specially designed to accelerate 3D-GEMT operation; (3) an isomorphic to the proposed algorithm, fully distributed 3D network of mesh interconnected processing elements or cells with a coordinate-free, data-driven local processing activity, which is independent of problem size; (4) an elastic sparse outer-product (ESOP) method that avoids unnecessary computing and communication operations with zero-valued operands, thereby enhancing energy efficiency, computational accuracy, and stability. TriADA is capable of performing a variety of trilinear transformations with hypercubic arithmetic complexity in a linear number of time-steps. The massively parallel, scalable, and energy-efficient architecture of TriADA is ideal for accelerating multilinear tensor operations, which are the most demanding parts of AI and HPC workloads.</description>

      <title>Momentum-based Accelerated Algorithm for Distributed Optimization under Sector-Bound Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed optimization advances centralized machine learning methods by enabling parallel and decentralized learning processes over a network of computing nodes. This work provides an accelerated consensus-based distributed algorithm for locally non-convex optimization using the gradient-tracking technique. The proposed algorithm (i) improves the convergence rate by adding momentum towards the optimal state using the heavy-ball method, while (ii) addressing general sector-bound nonlinearities over the information-sharing network. The link nonlinearity includes any sign-preserving odd sector-bound mapping, for example, log-scale data quantization or clipping in practical applications. For admissible momentum and gradient-tracking parameters, using perturbation theory and eigen-spectrum analysis, we prove convergence even in the presence of sector-bound nonlinearity and for locally non-convex cost functions. Further, in contrast to most existing weight-stochastic algorithms, we adopt weight-balanced (WB) network design. This WB design and perturbation-based analysis allow to handle dynamic directed network of agents to address possible time-varying setups due to link failures or packet drops.</description>

Abstract: While deep learning excels in natural image and language processing, its application to high-dimensional data faces computational challenges due to the dimensionality curse. Current large-scale data tools focus on business-oriented descriptive statistics, lacking mathematical statistics support for advanced analysis. We propose a parallel computation architecture based on space completeness, decomposing high-dimensional data into dimension-independent structures for distributed processing. This framework enables seamless integration of data mining and parallel-optimized machine learning methods, supporting scientific computations across diverse data types like medical and natural images within a unified system.</description>

      <title>Flexible Intelligent Metasurface for Enhancing Multi-Target Wireless Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible intelligent metasurface (FIM) has emerged as a transformative technology to enhance wireless sensing by dynamically morphing its three-dimensional (3D) surface shape and electromagnetic response. Unlike conventional rigid arrays, an FIM consists of low-cost radiating elements that can independently adjust their positions and radiation characteristics, thereby allowing for real-time optimization of the sensing environment. This paper investigates the impact of FIM on wireless sensing performance. Specifically, we focus on the maximization of the cumulated power of the probing signals at the target locations under the per-antenna power constraint by jointly optimizing the transmit covariance matrix and the surface shape of the transmitting FIM. We propose a block coordinate descend (BCD) algorithm to find a locally optimal solution, by alternatively updating the FIM surface shape and the transmit covariance matrix, while keeping the other one fixed at each step. Furthermore, we analyze the computational complexity and convergence properties of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate that FIM enhances wireless sensing by providing a new design degree-of-freedom to coordinate the correlation between steering vectors at different angles. Numerical results demonstrate that FIM significantly improves wireless sensing performance under the considered multi-target scenario.</description>

      <title>CSBrain: A Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Brain Foundation Model for EEG Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and decoding brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG) signals is a fundamental challenge in neuroscience and AI, with applications in cognition, emotion recognition, diagnosis, and brain-computer interfaces. While recent EEG foundation models advance generalized decoding via unified architectures and large-scale pretraining, they adopt a scale-agnostic dense modeling paradigm inherited from NLP and vision. This design neglects a core property of neural activity: cross-scale spatiotemporal structure. EEG task patterns span a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, from short bursts to slow rhythms, and from localized cortical responses to distributed interactions. Ignoring this diversity leads to suboptimal representations and weak generalization. We propose CSBrain, a Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Brain foundation model for generalized EEG decoding. CSBrain introduces: (i) Cross-scale Spatiotemporal Tokenization (CST), which aggregates multi-scale features from localized temporal windows and anatomical brain regions into compact scale-aware tokens; and (ii) Structured Sparse Attention (SSA), which captures cross-window and cross-region dependencies, enhancing scale diversity while removing spurious correlations. CST and SSA are alternately stacked to progressively integrate multi-scale dependencies. Experiments on 11 EEG tasks across 16 datasets show that CSBrain consistently outperforms task-specific and foundation model baselines. These results establish cross-scale modeling as a key inductive bias and position CSBrain as a robust backbone for future brain-AI research.</description>

      <title>Nuisance parameters and elliptically symmetric distributions: a geometric approach to parametric and semiparametric efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elliptically symmetric distributions are a classic example of a semiparametric model where the location vector and the scatter matrix (or a parameterization of them) are the two finite-dimensional parameters of interest, while the density generator represents an \textit{infinite-dimensional nuisance} term. This basic representation of the elliptic model can be made more accurate, rich, and flexible by considering additional \textit{finite-dimensional nuisance} parameters. Our aim is therefore to investigate the deep and counter-intuitive links between statistical efficiency in estimating the parameters of interest in the presence of both finite and infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters. Unlike previous works that addressed this problem using Le Cam's asymptotic theory, our approach here is purely geometric: efficiency will be analyzed using tools such as projections and tangent spaces embedded in the relevant Hilbert space. This allows us to obtain original results also for the case where the location vector and the scatter matrix are parameterized by a finite-dimensional vector that can be partitioned in two sub-vectors: one containing the parameters of interest and the other containing the nuisance parameters. As an example, we illustrate how the obtained results can be applied to the well-known \virg{low-rank} parameterization. Furthermore, while the theoretical analysis will be developed for Real Elliptically Symmetric (RES) distributions, we show how to extend our results to the case of Circular and Non-Circular Complex Elliptically Symmetric (C-CES and NC-CES) distributions.</description>

      <title>Parallax QAMA: Novel Downlink Multiple Access for MISO Systems with Simple Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel downlink multiple access system with a multi-antenna transmitter and two single-antenna receivers, inspired by the underlying principles of hierarchical quadrature amplitude modulation (H-QAM) based multiple access (QAMA) and space-division multiple access (SDMA). In the proposed scheme, coded bits from two users are split and assigned to one shared symbol and two private symbols carried by different beams. Based on joint symbol mapping of H-QAM constellations and phase-aligned precoding at the transmitter, each receiver observes a different H-QAM constellation with Gray mapping, a unique parallax feature not shared by existing schemes. In addition to avoiding successive interference cancellation (SIC), each user independently demodulates its own bits on separate I and Q branches with calculations based on closed-form expressions. Hence the receiver complexity is on par with that of orthogonal multiple access (OMA), which is much lower than that in other competing alternatives such as non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA). We carry out system optimization and determine the achievable rate region. Numerical results show that the proposed system has a larger rate region relative to other benchmark schemes with receivers not using SIC, and even achieves a comparable rate region to those benchmark schemes with SIC receivers.</description>

      <title>Securing the Sky: Integrated Satellite-UAV Physical Layer Security for Low-Altitude Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) have garnered significant attention in the forthcoming 6G networks. In LAWNs, satellites with wide coverage and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with flexible mobility can complement each other to form integrated satellite-UAV networks, providing ubiquitous and high-speed connectivity for low-altitude operations. However, the higher line-of-sight probability in low-altitude airspace increases transmission security concerns. In this work, we present a collaborative beamforming-based physical layer security scheme for LAWNs. We introduce the fundamental aspects of integrated satellite-UAV networks, physical layer security, UAV swarms, and collaborative beamforming for LAWN applications. Following this, we highlight several opportunities for collaborative UAV swarm secure applications enabled by satellite networks, including achieving physical layer security in scenarios involving data dissemination, data relay, eavesdropper collusion, and imperfect eavesdropper information. Next, we detail two case studies: a secure relay system and a two-way aerial secure communication framework specifically designed for LAWN environments. Simulation results demonstrate that these physical layer security schemes are effective and beneficial for secure low-altitude wireless communications. A short practicality analysis shows that the proposed method is applicable to LAWN scenarios. Finally, we discuss current challenges and future research directions for enhancing security in LAWNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a fundamental technique for estimating the state of a quantum system from measured data and plays a crucial role in evaluating the performance of quantum devices. However, standard estimation methods become impractical due to the exponential growth of parameters in the state representation. In this work, we address this challenge by parameterizing the state using a low-rank block tensor train decomposition and demonstrate that our approach is both memory- and computationally efficient. This framework applies to a broad class of quantum states that can be well approximated by low-rank decompositions, including pure states, nearly pure states, and ground states of Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>How Long Can I Transmit? A Mobility Aware mmWave-based UAV Communication Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One primary focus of next generation wireless communication networks is the millimeterwave (mmWave) spectrum, typically considered in the 30 GHz to 300 GHz frequency range. Despite their promise of high data rates, mmWaves suffer from severe attenuation while passing through obstacles. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been proposed to offset this limitation on account of their additional degrees of freedom, which can be leveraged to provide line of sight (LoS) transmission paths. While some prior works have proposed analytical frameworks to compute the LoS probability for static ground users and a UAV, the same is lacking for mobile users on the ground. In this paper, we consider the popular Manhattan point line process (MPLP) to model an urban environment, within which a ground user moves with a known velocity for a small time interval along the roads. We derive an expression for the expected duration of LoS between a static UAV in the air and a mobile ground user, and validate the same through simulations. To demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed analysis, we propose a simple user association algorithm that greedily assigns the UAVs to users with the highest expected LoS time, and show that it outperforms the existing benchmark schemes that assign the users to the nearest UAVs with LoS without considering the user mobility.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS to Integrate Sensing the I/O Relation and Data Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Zak-OTFS input/output (I/O) relation is predictable and non-fading when the delay and Doppler periods are greater than the effective channel delay and Doppler spreads, a condition which we refer to as the crystallization condition. The filter taps can simply be read off from the response to a single Zak-OTFS point (impulse) pulsone waveform, and the I/O relation can be reconstructed for a sampled system that operates under finite duration and bandwidth constraints. Predictability opens up the possibility of a model-free mode of operation. The time-domain realization of a Zak-OTFS point pulsone is a pulse train modulated by a tone, hence the name, pulsone. The Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of a pulsone is about $15$ dB, and we describe a general method for constructing a spread pulsone for which the time-domain realization has a PAPR of about 6dB. We construct the spread pulsone by applying a type of discrete spreading filter to a Zak-OTFS point pulsone. The self-ambiguity function of the point pulsone is supported on the period lattice ${\Lambda}_{p}$, and by applying a discrete chirp filter, we obtain a spread pulsone with a self-ambiguity function that is supported on a rotated lattice ${\Lambda^*}$. We show that if the channel satisfies the crystallization conditions with respect to ${\Lambda^*}$ then the effective DD domain filter taps can simply be read off from the cross-ambiguity between the channel response to the spread pulsone and the transmitted spread pulsone. If, in addition, the channel satisfies the crystallization conditions with respect to the period lattice ${\Lambda}_{p}$, then in an OTFS frame consisting of a spread pilot pulsone and point data pulsones, after cancelling the received signal corresponding to the spread pulsone, we can recover the channel response to any data pulsone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11004v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a number of applications in signal processing, we study the following question. Given samples of a multidimensional signal of the form $$ f(\boldsymbol\ell)=\sum_{k=1}^K a_k\exp(-i\langle \boldsymbol\ell, \mathbf{w}_k\rangle), \quad \mathbf{w}_1,\cdots,\mathbf{w}_k\in\mathbb{R}^q, \ \boldsymbol\ell\in \mathbb{Z}^q, \ |\boldsymbol\ell| &lt;n, $$ determine the values of the number $K$ of components, and the parameters $a_k$ and $\mathbf{w}_k$'s. We note that the the number of samples of $f$ in the above equation is $(2n-1)^q$. We develop an algorithm to recuperate these quantities accurately using only a subsample of size $\mathcal{O}(qn)$ of this data. For this purpose, we use a novel localized kernel method to identify the parameters, including the number $K$ of signals. Our method is easy to implement, and is shown to be stable under a very low SNR range. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our resulting algorithm using 2 and 3 dimensional examples from the literature, and show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art techniques including Prony based, MUSIC and ESPRIT approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming 6G mobile communication standard will offer a revolutionary new feature: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) reuses mobile communication signals to realize multi-static radar for various applications including localization. Consequently, applied ISAC propagation research necessitates to evolve from classical monostatic radar cross section (RCS) measurement of static targets on to bistatic radar reflectivity characterization of dynamic objects. Here, we introduce our Bistatic Radar (BIRA) measurement facility for independent spherical positioning of two probes with sub-millimeter accuracy on a diameter of up to 7 m and with almost continuous frequency coverage from 0.7 up to 260 GHz. Currently, BIRA is the only bistatic measurement facility capable of unrestricted ISAC research: In addition to vector network analysis, it employs advanced wideband transceiver technology with an instantaneous bandwidth of up to 4 GHz. These transceivers grant BIRA the unique capability to characterize dynamic targets in both Doppler and range, while also significantly accelerating measurements on static objects. Additionally, the installation is capable of spherical near-field antenna measurements over these wide frequency ranges.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Joint Antenna Selection and Precoding Methods in Multi-user Massive MISO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a performance analysis of two distinct techniques for antenna selection and precoding in downlink multi-user massive multiple-input single-output systems with limited dynamic range power amplifiers. Both techniques are derived from the original formulation of the regularized-zero forcing precoder, designed as the solution to minimizing a regularized distortion. Based on this, the first technique, called the $\ell_1$-norm precoder, adopts an $\ell_1$-norm regularization term to encourage sparse solutions, thereby enabling antenna selection. The second technique, termed the thresholded $\ell_1$-norm precoder, involves post-processing the precoder solution obtained from the first method by applying an entry-wise thresholding operation. This work conducts a precise performance analysis to compare these two techniques. The analysis leverages the Gaussian min-max theorem which is effective for examining the asymptotic behavior of optimization problems without explicit solutions. While the analysis of the $\ell_1$-norm precoder follows the conventional Gaussian min-max theorem framework, understanding the thresholded $\ell_1$-norm precoder is more complex due to the non-linear behavior introduced by the thresholding operation. To address this complexity, we develop a novel Gaussian min-max theorem tailored to these scenarios. We provide precise asymptotic behavior analysis of the precoders, focusing on metrics such as received signal-to-noise and distortion ratio and bit error rate. Our analysis demonstrates that the thresholded $\ell_1$-norm precoder can offer superior performance when the threshold parameter is carefully selected. Simulations confirm that the asymptotic results are accurate for systems equipped with hundreds of antennas at the base station, serving dozens of user terminals.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Analysis of One-bit Quantized Box-Constrained Precoding in Large-Scale Multi-User Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the design of multi-antenna precoding strategies, considering hardware limitations such as low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs), which necessitate the quantization of transmitted signals. The typical approach starts with optimizing a precoder, followed by a quantization step to meet hardware requirements. This study analyzes the performance of a quantization scheme applied to the box-constrained regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoder in the asymptotic regime, where the number of antennas and users grows proportionally. The box constraint, initially designed to cope with low-dynamic range amplifiers, is used here to control quantization noise rather than for amplifier compatibility. A significant challenge in analyzing the quantized precoder is that the input to the quantization operation does not follow a Gaussian distribution, making traditional methods such as Bussgang's decomposition unsuitable. To overcome this, the paper extends the Gordon's inequality and introduces a novel Gaussian Min-Max Theorem to model the distribution of the channel-distorted precoded signal. The analysis derives the tight lower bound for the signal-to-distortion-plus-noise ratio (SDNR) and the bit error rate (BER), showing that optimal tuning of the amplitude constraint improves performance.</description>

Abstract: Multivariable parametric models are critical for designing, controlling, and optimizing the performance of engineered systems. The main aim of this paper is to develop a parametric identification strategy that delivers accurate and physically relevant models of multivariable systems using time-domain data. The introduced approach adopts an additive model structure, providing a parsimonious and interpretable representation of many physical systems, and applies a refined instrumental variable-based estimation algorithm. The developed identification method enables the estimation of multivariable parametric additive models in continuous time and is applicable to both open- and closed-loop systems. The performance of the estimator is demonstrated through numerical simulations and experimentally validated on a flexible beam system.</description>

      <title>ESC-MVQ: End-to-End Semantic Communication With Multi-Codebook Vector Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel end-to-end digital semantic communication framework based on multi-codebook vector quantization (VQ), referred to as ESC-MVQ. Unlike prior approaches that rely on end-to-end training with a specific power or modulation scheme, often under a particular channel condition, ESC-MVQ models a channel transfer function as parallel binary symmetric channels (BSCs) with trainable bit-flip probabilities. Building on this model, ESC-MVQ jointly trains multiple VQ codebooks and their associated bit-flip probabilities with a single encoder-decoder pair. To maximize inference performance when deploying ESC-MVQ in digital communication systems, we devise an optimal communication strategy that jointly optimizes codebook assignment, adaptive modulation, and power allocation. To this end, we develop an iterative algorithm that selects the most suitable VQ codebook for semantic features and flexibly allocates power and modulation schemes across the transmitted symbols. Simulation results demonstrate that ESC-MVQ, using a single encoder-decoder pair, outperforms existing digital semantic communication methods in both performance and memory efficiency, offering a scalable and adaptive solution for realizing digital semantic communication in diverse channel conditions.</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning-Based Supervised Transfer Learning Framework for DOA Estimation with Array Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In practical scenarios, processes such as sensor design, manufacturing, and installation will introduce certain errors. Furthermore, mutual interference occurs when the sensors receive signals. These defects in array systems are referred to as array imperfections, which can significantly degrade the performance of Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation. In this study, we propose a deep-learning based transfer learning approach, which effectively mitigates the degradation of deep-learning based DOA estimation performance caused by array imperfections.
  In the proposed approach, we highlight three major contributions. First, we propose a Vision Transformer (ViT) based method for DOA estimation, which achieves excellent performance in scenarios with low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) and limited snapshots. Second, we introduce a transfer learning framework that extends deep learning models from ideal simulation scenarios to complex real-world scenarios with array imperfections. By leveraging prior knowledge from ideal simulation data, the proposed transfer learning framework significantly improves deep learning-based DOA estimation performance in the presence of array imperfections, without the need for extensive real-world data. Finally, we incorporate visualization and evaluation metrics to assess the performance of DOA estimation algorithms, which allow for a more thorough evaluation of algorithms and further validate the proposed method.

      <title>Acousto-optic reconstruction of exterior sound field based on concentric circle sampling with circular harmonic expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acousto-optic sensing provides an alternative approach to traditional microphone arrays by shedding light on the interaction of light with an acoustic field. Sound field reconstruction is a fascinating and advanced technique used in acousto-optics sensing. Current challenges in sound-field reconstruction methods pertain to scenarios in which the sound source is located within the reconstruction area, known as the exterior problem. Existing reconstruction algorithms, primarily designed for interior scenarios, often exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to exterior cases. This paper introduces a novel technique for exterior sound-field reconstruction. The proposed method leverages concentric circle sampling and a two-dimensional exterior sound-field reconstruction approach based on circular harmonic extensions. To evaluate the efficacy of this approach, both numerical simulations and practical experiments are conducted. The results highlight the superior accuracy of the proposed method when compared to conventional reconstruction methods, all while utilizing a minimal amount of measured projection data.</description>

      <title>Drivetrain simulation using variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes variational autoencoders (VAEs) to predict a vehicle's jerk signals from torque demand in the context of limited real-world drivetrain datasets. We implement both unconditional and conditional VAEs, trained on experimental data from two variants of a fully electric SUV with differing torque and drivetrain configurations. The VAEs synthesize jerk signals that capture characteristics from multiple drivetrain scenarios by leveraging the learned latent space. A performance comparison with baseline physics-based and hybrid models confirms the effectiveness of the VAEs, without requiring detailed system parametrization. Unconditional VAEs generate realistic jerk signals without prior system knowledge, while conditional VAEs enable the generation of signals tailored to specific torque inputs. This approach reduces the dependence on costly and time-intensive real-world experiments and extensive manual modeling. The results support the integration of generative models such as VAEs into drivetrain simulation pipelines, both for data augmentation and for efficient exploration of complex operational scenarios, with the potential to streamline validation and accelerate vehicle development.</description>

      <title>Optimal Beamforming for Multi-Target Multi-User ISAC Exploiting Prior Information: How Many Sensing Beams Are Needed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a multi-target multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system where a multi-antenna base station (BS) communicates with multiple single-antenna users in the downlink and senses the unknown and random angle information of multiple targets based on their reflected echo signals at the BS receiver as well as their prior probability information. We focus on a general beamforming structure with both communication beams and dedicated sensing beams, whose design is highly non-trivial as more sensing beams provide more flexibility in sensing, but introduce extra interference to communication. To resolve this trade-off, we first characterize the periodic posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) as a lower bound of the mean-cyclic error (MCE) in multi-target sensing. Then, we optimize the beamforming to minimize the maximum periodic PCRB among all targets to ensure fairness, subject to individual communication rate constraints at multiple users. Despite the non-convexity of this problem, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution by leveraging semi-definite relaxation (SDR), and derive a general bound on the number of sensing beams needed. Moreover, we unveil specific structures of the optimal solution in various cases, where tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed are derived (e.g., no or at most one sensing beam is needed under stringent rate constraints or with homogeneous targets). Next, we study the beamforming optimization to minimize the sum periodic PCRB under user rate constraints. By applying SDR, we propose a general construction method for the optimal solution and its specific structures which yield lower computational complexities. We derive a general bound and various tighter bounds on the number of sensing beams needed. Numerical results validate our analysis and effectiveness of our proposed beamforming designs.</description>

      <title>Wi-Fi 6 Cross-Technology Interference Detection and Mitigation by OFDMA: an Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-Technology Interference (CTI) poses challenges for the performance and robustness of wireless networks. There are opportunities for better cooperation if the spectral occupation and technology of the interference can be detected. Namely, this information can help the Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) scheduler in IEEE 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6) to efficiently allocate resources to multiple users inthe frequency domain. This work shows that a single Channel State Information (CSI) snapshot, which is used for packet demodulation in the receiver, is enough to detect and classify the type of CTI on low-cost Wi-Fi 6 hardware. We show the classification accuracy of a small Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for different Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) with simulated data, as well as using a wired and over-the-air test with a professional wireless connectivity tester, while running the inference on the low-cost device. Furthermore, we use openwifi, a full-stack Wi-Fi transceiver running on software-defined radio (SDR) available in the w-iLab.t testbed, as Access Point (AP) to implement a CTI-aware multi-user OFDMA scheduler when the clients send CTI detection feedback to the AP. We show experimentally that it can fully mitigate the 35% throughput loss caused by CTI when the AP applies the appropriate scheduling.</description>

      <title>Efficient Channel Estimation for Rotatable Antenna-Enabled Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-fixed flexible antenna architectures, such as fluid antenna system (FAS), movable antenna (MA), and pinching antenna, have garnered significant interest in recent years. Among them, rotatable antenna (RA) is a promising antenna architecture that exploits additional spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enhance the communication performance. To fully obtain the performance gain provided by RAs, accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for adjusting the orientation/boresight of each antenna. In this letter, we propose an efficient channel estimation scheme for RA communication systems, where the base station (BS) can sequentially and adaptively adjust the orientations of RAs to enrich the environmental observations from diverse angular perspectives, thereby enhancing the channel estimation accuracy. The proposed scheme includes two main procedures that are conducted alternately during each channel training period. Specifically, the first procedure is to estimate the CSI with given RAs' orientations, involving the angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) information and path gains. Then, based on the estimated CSI, the second procedure adjusts the RAs' orientations to maximize the effective channel gain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimation method outperforms other benchmark schemes.</description>
