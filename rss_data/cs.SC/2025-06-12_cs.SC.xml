      <title>Gradient-Weighted, Data-Driven Normalization for Approximate Border Bases -- Concept and Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the concept and the computation of approximately vanishing ideals of a finite set of data points. By data points, we mean that the points contain some uncertainty, which is a key motivation for the approximate treatment. A careful review of the existing border basis concept for an exact treatment motivates a new adaptation of the border basis concept for an approximate treatment. In the study of approximately vanishing polynomials, the normalization of polynomials plays a vital role. So far, the most common normalization in computational commutative algebra uses the coefficient norm of a polynomial. Inspired by recent developments in machine learning, the present paper proposes and studies the use of gradient-weighted normalization. The gradient-weighted semi-norm evaluates the gradient of a polynomial at the data points. This data-driven nature of gradient-weighted normalization produces, on the one hand, better stability against perturbation and, on the other hand, very significantly, invariance of border bases with respect to scaling the data points. Neither property is achieved with coefficient normalization. In particular, we present an example of the lack of scaling invariance with respect to coefficient normalization, which can cause an approximate border basis computation to fail. This is extremely relevant because scaling of the point set is often recommended for preprocessing the data. Further, we use an existing algorithm with coefficient normalization to show that it is easily adapted to gradient-weighted normalization. The analysis of the adapted algorithm only requires tiny changes, and the time complexity remains the same. Finally, we present numerical experiments on three affine varieties to demonstrate the superior stability of our data-driven normalization over coefficient normalization. We obtain robustness to perturbations and invariance to scaling.</description>

      <title>Oracle-Based Multistep Strategy for Solving Polynomial Systems Over Finite Fields and Algebraic Cryptanalysis of the Aradi Cipher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multistep solving strategy consists in a divide-and-conquer approach: when a multivariate polynomial system is computationally infeasible to solve directly, one variable is assigned over the elements of the base finite field, and the procedure is recursively applied to the resulting simplified systems. In a previous work by the same authors (among others), this approach proved effective in the algebraic cryptanalysis of the Trivium cipher. In this paper, we present a new implementation of the corresponding algorithm based on a Depth-First Search strategy, along with a novel complexity analysis leveraging tree structures. We further introduce the notion of an "oracle function" as a general predictive tool for deciding whether the evaluation of a new variable is necessary to simplify the current polynomial system. This notion allows us to unify all previously proposed variants of the multistep strategy, including the classical hybrid approach, by appropriately selecting the oracle function. Finally, we apply the multistep solving strategy to the cryptanalysis of the low-latency block cipher Aradi, recently introduced by the NSA. We present the first full round algebraic attack, raising concerns about the cipher's actual security with respect to its key length.</description>

      <title>Certified algebraic curve projections by path tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a certified algorithm that takes a smooth algebraic curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and computes an isotopic approximation for a generic projection of the curve into $\mathbb{R}^2$. Our algorithm is designed for curves given implicitly by the zeros of $n-1$ polynomials, but it can be partially extended to parametrically defined curves. The main challenge in correctly computing the projection is to guarantee the topological correctness of crossings in the projection. Our approach combines certified path tracking and interval arithmetic in a two-step procedure: first, we construct an approximation to the curve in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and, second, we refine the approximation until the topological correctness of the projection can be guaranteed. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation illustrating the algorithm.</description>

      <title>AbstRaL: Augmenting LLMs' Reasoning by Reinforcing Abstract Thinking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), especially smaller ones, often lack robustness in their reasoning. I.e., they tend to experience performance drops when faced with distribution shifts, such as changes to numerical or nominal variables, or insertions of distracting clauses. A possible strategy to address this involves generating synthetic data to further "instantiate" reasoning problems on potential variations. In contrast, our approach focuses on "abstracting" reasoning problems. This not only helps counteract distribution shifts but also facilitates the connection to symbolic tools for deriving solutions. We find that this abstraction process is better acquired through reinforcement learning (RL) than just supervised fine-tuning, which often fails to produce faithful abstractions. Our method, AbstRaL -- which promotes abstract reasoning in LLMs using RL on granular abstraction data -- significantly mitigates performance degradation on recent GSM perturbation benchmarks.</description>
