      <title>Orbit recovery for spherical functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbit recovery is a central problem in both mathematics and applied sciences, with important applications to structural biology. This paper focuses on recovering generic orbits of functions on ${\mathbb R}^{n}$ and the sphere $S^{n-1}$ under the rotation action of $SO(n)$. Specifically, we demonstrate that invariants of degree three (called the bispectrum) suffice to recover generic orbits of functions in finite-dimensional approximations of $L^2({\mathbb R}^n)$ obtained by band-limiting the spherical component and discretizing the radial direction. In particular, our main result explicitly bounds the number of samples in the radial direction required for recovery from the degree three invariants. From an application perspective, the most important case is $SO(3)$, which arises in many scientific fields, and in particular, plays a central role in leading structural biology applications such as cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy. Our result for $SO(3)$ states that considering three spherical shells (i.e., samples in the radial direction) is sufficient to recover generic orbits, which verifies an implicit conjecture made in a paper of Bandeira et al. Our proof technique provides an explicit, computationally efficient algorithm to recover the signal by successively solving systems of linear equations. We implemented this algorithm and demonstrated its effectiveness on two protein structures.</description>

      <title>Full Vectorial Maxwell Equations with Continuous Angular Indices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a mathematical framework for solving Maxwell's equations in cylindrical and spherical geometries with continuous angular indices. We extend beyond standard discrete harmonic decomposition to a continuous spectral representation using generalized spectral integrals, capturing electromagnetic solutions that exhibit singular behavoiur yet yield finite-energy fields at the geometric center. For continuous angular indices $\ell, m \in \mathbb{R}$, we study existence and uniqueness of solutions in weighted Sobolev spaces $H^s_{\alpha(\ell,m)}(\Omega)$ following the framework established in ~\cite{adams2003, reed1975}, prove finite energy for $\ell &gt; -\frac{1}{2}$, and construct explicit spectral kernels via biorthogonal function systems. The framework encompasses both separable cylindrical modes with continuous azimuthal index $\nu \in (0,1)$ and non-separable spherical modes where field components couple through vectorial curl operations. We present asymptotic analysis of singular field behavior, investigate convergence rates for spectral approximations, and validate the theoretical framework through Galerkin projection methods and numerical spectral integration.</description>

      <title>When surface evolution meets Fokker-Planck equation: a novel tangential velocity model for uniform parametrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A common issue in simulating geometric evolution of surfaces is unexpected clustering of points that may cause numerical instability. We propose a novel artificial tangential velocity method for this matter. The artificial tangential velocity is generated from a surface density field governed by a Fokker-Planck equation to guide the point distribution. A target distribution matching algorithm is developed leveraging the surface Kullback-Leibler divergence of density functions. The numerical method is formulated within a fully meshless framework using the moving least squares approximation, thereby eliminating the need for mesh generation and allowing flexible treatment of unstructured point cloud data. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the robustness, accuracy, and effectiveness of the proposed approach across a variety of surface evolution problems, including the mean curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Automated $h$-adaptivity for finite element approximations of the Falkner-Skan equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper details the development and application of an $h$-adaptive finite element method for the numerical solution of the \textit{Falkner-Skan equation}. A posteriori error estimation governs the adaptivity of the mesh, specifically the well-established \textit{Kelly error estimator}, which utilizes the jump in the gradient across elements. The implementation of this method allowed for accurate and efficient resolution of the boundary layer behavior characteristic of Falkner-Skan flows. Numerical solutions were obtained across various wedge flow parameters, encompassing favorable and adverse pressure gradients. A key focus of this study was the precise computation of the skin friction coefficient, a critical parameter in boundary layer analysis, across this diverse range of flow conditions. The results are presented and discussed, demonstrating the robustness and accuracy of the adaptive finite element approach for this class of nonlinear boundary layer problems.</description>

      <title>On sliced Cram\'er metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the family of sliced Cram\'er metrics, showing that they are robust to a broad class of geometric deformations. Our central results are that the sliced Cram\'er distance between a function and its deformation may be bounded by certain natural measures of the deformation's displacement, multiplied by the function's mean mixed norm. These results extend to sliced Cram\'er distances between tomographic projections. We also remark on the effect of convolution on the sliced Cram\'er metrics. We compare these properties of sliced Cram\'er metrics to similar properties satisfied by Wasserstein distances. In addition, we study computationally efficient Fourier-based discretizations of the Cram\'er and sliced Cram\'er distances in 1D and 2D, and prove that they are robust to heteroscedastic noise. The results are illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Conjugate Gradient Solvers for Homogenization Problems with Unitary Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid and reliable solvers for parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) are needed in many scientific and engineering disciplines. For example, there is a growing demand for composites and architected materials with heterogeneous microstructures. Designing such materials and predicting their behavior in practical applications requires solving homogenization problems for a wide range of material parameters and microstructures. While classical numerical solvers offer reliable and accurate solutions supported by a solid theoretical foundation, their high computational costs and slow convergence remain limiting factors. As a result, scientific machine learning is emerging as a promising alternative. However, such approaches often lack guaranteed accuracy and physical consistency. This raises the question of whether it is possible to develop hybrid approaches that combine the advantages of both data-driven methods and classical solvers. To address this, we introduce UNO-CG, a hybrid solver that accelerates conjugate gradient (CG) solvers using specially designed machine-learned preconditioners, while ensuring convergence by construction. As a preconditioner, we propose Unitary Neural Operators as a modification of Fourier Neural Operators. Our method can be interpreted as a data-driven discovery of Green's functions, which are then used to accelerate iterative solvers. We evaluate UNO-CG on various homogenization problems involving heterogeneous microstructures and millions of degrees of freedom. Our results demonstrate that UNO-CG enables a substantial reduction in the number of iterations and is competitive with handcrafted preconditioners for homogenization problems that involve expert knowledge. Moreover, UNO-CG maintains strong performance across a variety of boundary conditions, where many specialized solvers are not applicable, highlighting its versatility and robustness.</description>

      <title>Transient thermal analysis of a bi-layered composites with the dual-reciprocity inclusion-based boundary element method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a single-domain dual-reciprocity inclusion-based boundary element method (DR-iBEM) for a three-dimensional fully bonded bi-layered composite embedded with ellipsoidal inhomogeneities under transient/harmonic thermal loads. The heat equation is interpreted as a static one containing time- and frequency-dependent nonhomogeneous source terms, which is similar to eigen-fields but is transformed into a boundary integral by the dual-reciprocity method. Using the steady-state bimaterial Green's function, boundary integral equations are proposed to take into account continuity conditions of temperature and heat flux, which avoids setting up any continuity equations at the bimaterial interface. Eigen-temperature-gradients and eigen-heat-source are introduced to simulate the material mismatch in thermal conductivity and heat capacity, respectively. The DR-iBEM algorithm is particularly suitable for investigating the transient and harmonic thermal behaviors of bi-layered composites and is verified by the finite element method (FEM). Numerical comparison with the FEM demonstrates its robustness and accuracy. The method has been applied to a functionally graded material as a bimaterial with graded particle distributions, where particle size and gradation effects are evaluated.</description>

      <title>Diffusive behavior of transport noise on $\mathbb{S}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02707v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically and numerically transport noise-induced diffusion in flows on the sphere. Previous analysis on the torus demonstrated that suitably chosen transport noise in the Euler equations leads to diffusive behavior resembling the Navier--Stokes equations. Here, we analyze dynamics on the sphere with noise-induced differential elliptic operator dissipation and characterize their energy and enstrophy decay properties. Through structure-preserving numerical simulations with the Zeitlin discretization, we demonstrate that appropriately scaled transport noise induces energy dissipation while preserving enstrophy and coadjoint orbits. The presented analysis lays a groundwork for further theoretical investigation of transport noise and supports the calibration of transport noise models as a parametrization for unresolved processes in geophysical fluid simulations.</description>

      <title>Spline Shallow Water Moment Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reduced models for free-surface flows are required due to the high dimensionality of the underlying incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which need to fully resolve the flow in vertical direction to compute the surface height. On the other hand, standard reduced models, such as the classical Shallow Water Equations (SWE), which assume a small depth-to-length ratio and use depth-averaging, do not provide information about the vertical velocity profile variations. As a compromise, a recently proposed moment approach for shallow flow using Legendre polynomials as ansatz functions for vertical velocity variations showed the derivation of so-called Shallow Water Moment Equations (SWME) that combine low dimensionality with velocity profile modeling. However, only global polynomials are considered so far.
  This paper introduces Spline Shallow Water Moment Equations (SSWME) where piecewise defined spline ansatz functions allow for a flexible representation of velocity profiles with lower regularity. The local support of the spline basis functions opens up the possibility of adaptability and greater flexibility regarding some typical profile shapes. We systematically derive and analyze hierarchies of SSWME models with different number of basis functions and different degrees, before deriving a regularized hyperbolic version by performing a hyperbolic regularization with analytical proof of hyperbolicity for a hierarchy of high-order SSWME models. Numerical simulations show high accuracy and robustness of the new models.</description>

      <title>DD-DeepONet: Domain decomposition and DeepONet for solving partial differential equations in three application scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In certain practical engineering applications, there is an urgent need to perform repetitive solving of partial differential equations (PDEs) in a short period. This paper primarily considers three scenarios requiring extensive repetitive simulations. These three scenarios are categorized based on whether the geometry, boundary conditions(BCs), or parameters vary. We introduce the DD-DeepONet, a framework with strong scalability, whose core concept involves decomposing complex geometries into simple structures and vice versa. We primarily study complex geometries composed of rectangles and cuboids, which have numerous practical applications. Simultaneously, stretching transformations are applied to simple geometries to solve shape-dependent problems. This work solves several prototypical PDEs in three scenarios, including Laplace, Poission, N-S, and drift-diffusion equations, demonstrating DD-DeepONet's computational potential. Experimental results demonstrate that DD-DeepONet reduces training difficulty, requires smaller datasets andVRAMper network, and accelerates solution acquisition.</description>

      <title>Floquet stability of periodically stationary pulses in a short-pulse fiber laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantitative modeling and design of modern short-pulse fiber lasers cannot be performed with averaged models because of large variations in the pulse parameters within each round trip. Instead, lumped models obtained by concatenating models for the various components of the laser are required. Since the optical pulses in lumped models are periodic, their linear stability is investigated using the monodromy operator, which is the linearization of the roundtrip operator about the pulse. A gradient-based optimization method is developed to discover periodic pulses. The computation of the gradient of the objective function involves numerical computation of the action of both the round trip operator and the adjoint of the monodromy operator. A novel Fourier split-step method is introduced to compute solutions of the linearization of the nonlinear, nonlocal, stiff equation that models optical propagation in the fiber amplifier. This method is derived by linearizing the two solution operators in a split-step method for the nonlinear equation. The spectrum of the monodromy operator consists of the essential spectrum, for which there is an analytical formula, and the eigenvalues. There is a multiplicity two eigenvalue at $\lambda=1$, which is due to phase and translation invariance. The remaining eigenvalues are determined from a matrix discretization of the monodromy operator. Simulation results verify the accuracy of the numerical methods, show examples of periodically stationary pulses, their spectra and eigenfunctions, and discuss their stability.</description>

      <title>Mixed Finite Element Method for a Hemivariational Inequality of Stationary convective Brinkman-Forchheimer Extended Darcy equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the formulation and analysis of a mixed finite element method for a hemivariational inequality arising from the stationary convective Brinkman-Forchheimer extended Darcy (CBFeD) equations. This model extends the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations by incorporating both damping and pumping effects. The hemivariational inequality describes the flow of a viscous, incompressible fluid through a saturated porous medium, subject to a nonsmooth, nonconvex friction-type slip boundary condition. The incompressibility constraint is handled via a mixed variational formulation. We establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions by utilizing the pseudomonotonicity and coercivity properties of the underlying operators and provide a detailed error analysis of the proposed numerical scheme. Under suitable regularity assumptions, the method achieves optimal convergence rates with low-order mixed finite element pairs. The scheme is implemented using the $\text{P1b/P1}$ element pair, and numerical experiments are presented to validate the theoretical results and confirm the expected convergence behavior.</description>

      <title>H(curl)-based approximation of the Stokes problem with weakly enforced no-slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we show how to impose no-slip boundary conditions for an H(curl)-based formulation for incompressible Stokes flow, which is used in structure-preserving discretizations of Navier-Stokes and magnetohydrodynamics equations. At first glance, it seems straightforward to apply no-slip boundary conditions: the tangential part is an essential boundary condition on H(curl) and the normal component can be naturally enforced through integration-by-parts of the divergence term. However, we show that this can lead to an ill-posed discretization and propose a Nitsche-based finite element method instead. We analyze the discrete system, establishing stability and deriving a priori error estimates. Numerical experiments validate our analysis and demonstrate optimal convergence rates for the velocity field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient approximation of quantity of interest derived from PDEs with lognormal diffusivity is a central challenge in uncertainty quantification. In this study, we propose a multilevel quasi-Monte Carlo framework to approximate deterministic, real-valued, bounded linear functionals that depend on the solution of a linear elliptic PDE with a lognormal diffusivity coefficient {parameterized by a 49-dimensional Gaussian random vector} and deterministic geometric singularities in bounded domains of $\mathbb{R}^d$. We analyze the parametric regularity and develop the multilevel implementation based on a sequence of adaptive meshes, developed in "Goal-oriented adaptive finite element multilevel Monte Carlo with convergence rates", \emph{CMAME}, 402 (2022), p. 115582. For further variance reduction, we incorporate importance sampling and introduce a level-0 control variate within the multilevel hierarchy. {Introducing such control variate can alter the optimal choice of initial mesh, further highlighting the advantages of adaptive meshes.} Numerical experiments demonstrate that our adaptive QMC algorithm achieves a prescribed accuracy at substantially lower computational cost than the standard multilevel Monte Carlo method.</description>

Abstract: A general framework for recovering drift and diffusion dynamics from sampled trajectories is presented for the first time for stochastic delay differential equations. The core relies on the well-established SINDy algorithm for the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics. The proposed methodology combines recently proposed high-order estimates of drift and covariance for dealing with stochastic problems with augmented libraries to handle delayed arguments. Three different strategies are discussed in view of exploiting only realistically available data. A thorough comparative numerical investigation is performed on different models, which helps guiding the choice of effective and possibly outperforming schemes.</description>

      <title>Low-rankness and Smoothness Meet Subspace: A Unified Tensor Regularization for Hyperspectral Image Super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image super-resolution (HSI-SR) has emerged as a challenging yet critical problem in remote sensing. Existing approaches primarily focus on regularization techniques that leverage low-rankness and local smoothness priors. Recently, correlated total variation has been introduced for tensor recovery, integrating these priors into a single regularization framework. Direct application to HSI-SR, however, is hindered by the high spectral dimensionality of hyperspectral data. In this paper, we propose a unified tensor regularizer, called JLRST, which jointly encodes low-rankness and local smoothness priors under a subspace framework. Specifically, we compute the gradients of the clustered coefficient tensors along all three tensor modes to fully exploit spectral correlations and nonlocal similarities in HSI. By enforcing priors on subspace coefficients rather than the entire HR-HSI data, the proposed method achieves improved computational efficiency and accuracy. Furthermore, to mitigate the bias introduced by the tensor nuclear norm (TNN), we introduce the mode-3 logarithmic TNN to process gradient tensors. An alternating direction method of multipliers with proven convergence is developed to solve the proposed model. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in HSI-SR.</description>

      <title>Reduced Order Data-driven Twin Models for Nonlinear PDEs by Randomized Koopman Orthogonal Decomposition and Explainable Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a data-driven twin modeling framework based on modern Koopman operator theory, offering a significant advancement over classical modal decomposition by accurately capturing nonlinear dynamics with reduced complexity and no manual parameter adjustment. The method integrates a novel algorithm with Pareto front analysis to construct a compact, high-fidelity reduced-order model that balances accuracy and efficiency. An explainable NLARX deep learning framework enables real-time, adaptive calibration and prediction, while a key innovation-computing orthogonal Koopman modes via randomized orthogonal projections-ensures optimal data representation. This approach for data-driven twin modeling is fully self-consistent, avoiding heuristic choices and enhancing interpretability through integrated explainable learning techniques. The proposed method is demonstrated on shock wave phenomena using three experiments of increasing complexity, accompanied by a qualitative analysis of the resulting data-driven twin models.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Hemodynamic Parameters via Physics Informed Neural Networks including Hematocrit Dependent Rheology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) show significant potential for solving inverse problems, especially when observations are limited and sparse, provided that the relevant physical equations are known. We use PINNs to estimate smooth velocity and pressure fields from synthetic 4D flow Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. We analyze five non-Newtonian dynamic 3D blood flow cases within a realistic aortic model, covering a range of hematocrit values from anemic to polycythemic conditions. To enhance state estimation results, we consider various design and training techniques for PINNs, including adaptive loss balancing, curriculum training, and a realistic measurement operator. Regarding blood rheology, the PINN approach accurately estimates viscosity globally and locally under peak systolic conditions. It also provides a clear pattern recognition for diastolic stages. Regarding mass conservation, PINN estimations effectively reproduce the bifurcation of flow through the different branches of the aorta, demonstrate an excellent representation of the non-slip conditions at the walls, and accurately estimate pressure drops with relative errors below the 5% in the whole pressure field. We test our pressure drop estimations against the state of the art Virtual Work Energy Relative Pressure (vWERP) estimator, and we observe how our results outperform vWERP in terms of both accuracy and time resolution. Additionally, we find that the best results are achieved by computing the velocity field using the PINN, which is then integrated into the vWERP framework, leading to time super-sampled and high-order approximations, with a clinically admissible accuracy.</description>

      <title>Two operator splitting methods for three-dimensional stochastic Maxwell equations with multiplicative noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop two energy-preserving splitting methods for solving three-dimensional stochastic Maxwell equations driven by multiplicative noise. We use operator splitting methods to decouple stochastic Maxwell equations into simple one-dimensional subsystems and construct two stochastic splitting methods, Splitting Method I and Splitting Method II, through a combination of spatial compact difference methods and the midpoint rule in time discretization for the deterministic parts, and exact unitary analytical solutions for the stochastic parts. Theoretical proofs show that both methods strictly preserve the discrete energy conservation law. Finally, numerical experiments fully verify the energy conservation of the methods and demonstrate that the temporal convergence order of the two splitting methods is first-order.</description>

      <title>A matrix preconditioning framework for physics-informed neural networks based on adjoint method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a popular approach for solving forward and inverse problems involving partial differential equations (PDEs). Compared to fully connected neural networks, PINNs based on convolutional neural networks offer advantages in the hard enforcement of boundary conditions and in reducing the computational cost of partial derivatives. However, the latter still struggles with slow convergence and even failure in some scenarios. In this study, we propose a matrix preconditioning method to improve the convergence of the latter. Specifically, we combine automatic differentiation with matrix coloring to compute the Jacobian matrix of the PDE system, which is used to construct the preconditioner via incomplete LU factorization. We subsequently use the preconditioner to scale the PDE residual in the loss function in order to reduce the condition number of the Jacobian matrix, which is key to improving the convergence of PINNs. To overcome the incompatibility between automatic differentiation and triangular solves in the preconditioning, we also design a framework based on the adjoint method to compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to the network parameters. By numerical experiments, we validate that the proposed method successfully and efficiently solves the multi-scale problem and the high Reynolds number problem, in both of which PINNs fail to obtain satisfactory results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a numerical study of macroscopic models for collective cell migration, focusing on a multi-dimensional pressureless Euler-type model with non-local interactions coupled with chemotaxis, rigorously derived from microscopic dynamics. Different mechanical interactions are investigated, including attraction-repulsion effects. Moreover, the model is extended to the case of different populations of interacting cells. The validity of such macroscopic model and its agreement with the microscopic dynamics is finally assessed through a parameter estimation analysis in a specific setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present error estimates of the fully semi-Lagrangian scheme with high-order interpolation operators, solving the initial value problems for the one-dimensional nonlinear diffusive conservation laws, including the Burgers equations. We impose certain assumptions on the interpolation operator, which are satisfied by both spline and Hermite interpolations. We establish the convergence rates of $ O(\Delta t + h^{2 s} / \Delta t) $ in the $ L^2 $-norm and $ O(\Delta t + h^{s} / (\Delta t)^{1/2} + h^{2s} / \Delta t) $ in the $ H^s $-norm for the spatial mesh size $ h $ and the temporal step size $ \Delta t $, where the spline or Hermite interpolation operator of degree $ (2s - 1) $ is employed. The numerical results are in agreement with the theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Homogenization rates of beam lattices to micropolar continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the size of a mechanical lattice with beam-modeled edges approaches zero, it undergoes homogenization into a continuum model, which exhibits unusual mechanical properties that deviate from classical Cauchy elasticity, named micropolar elasticity. Typically, the homogenization process is qualitative in the engineering community, lacking quantitative homogenization error estimates. In this paper, we rigorously analyze the homogenization process of a beam lattice to a continuum. Our approach is initiated from an engineered mechanical problem defined on a triangular lattice with periodic boundary conditions. By applying Fourier transformations, we reduce the problem to a series of equations in the frequency domain. As the lattice size approaches zero, this yields a homogenized model in the form of a partial differential equation with periodic boundary conditions. This process can be easily justified if the external conditions in the frequency domain are nonzero only at low-frequency modes. However, through numerical experiments, we discover that beyond the low-frequency regime, the homogenization of the beam lattice differs from classical periodic homogenization theory due to the additional rotational degrees of freedom in the beams. A crucial technique in our analysis is the decoupling of displacement and rotation fields, achieved through a linear algebraic manipulation known as the Schur complement. Through dedicated analysis, we establish the coercivity of the Schur complements in both lattice and continuum models, which enables us to derive convergence rate estimates for homogenization errors. Numerical experiments validate the optimality of the homogenization rate estimates.</description>

      <title>Numerical Errors in Quantitative System Analysis With Decision Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision diagrams (DDs) are a powerful data structure that is used to tackle the state-space explosion problem, not only for discrete systems, but for probabilistic and quantum systems as well. While many of the DDs used in the probabilistic and quantum domains make use of floating-point numbers, this is not without challenges. Floating-point computations are subject to small rounding errors, which can affect both the correctness of the result and the effectiveness of the DD's compression. In this paper, we investigate the numerical stability, i.e. the robustness of an algorithm to small numerical errors, of matrix-vector multiplication with multi-terminal binary decision diagrams (MTBDDs). Matrix-vector multiplication is of particular interest because it is the function that computes successor states for both probabilistic and quantum systems. We prove that the MTBDD matrix-vector multiplication algorithm can be made numerically stable under certain conditions, although in many practical implementations of MTBDDs these conditions are not met. Additionally, we provide a case study of the numerical errors in the simulation of quantum circuits, which shows that the extent of numerical errors in practice varies greatly between instances.</description>

      <title>Polynomial complexity sampling from multimodal distributions using Sequential Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to sample from the Gibbs measure with a non-convex energy function at a low temperature. We use the practical and popular geometric annealing schedule, and use a Langevin diffusion at each temperature level. The Langevin diffusion only needs to run for a time that is long enough to ensure local mixing within energy valleys, which is much shorter than the time required for global mixing. Our main result shows convergence of Monte Carlo estimators with time complexity that, approximately, scales like the forth power of the inverse temperature, and the square of the inverse allowed error. We also study this algorithm in an illustrative model scenario where more explicit estimates can be given.</description>

      <title>Neural Networks with Orthogonal Jacobian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Very deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance by extracting rich, hierarchical features. Yet, training them via backpropagation is often hindered by vanishing or exploding gradients. Existing remedies, such as orthogonal or variance-preserving initialisation and residual architectures, allow for a more stable gradient propagation and the training of deeper models. In this work, we introduce a unified mathematical framework that describes a broad class of nonlinear feedforward and residual networks, whose input-to-output Jacobian matrices are exactly orthogonal almost everywhere. Such a constraint forces the resulting networks to achieve perfect dynamical isometry and train efficiently despite being very deep. Our formulation not only recovers standard architectures as particular cases but also yields new designs that match the trainability of residual networks without relying on conventional skip connections. We provide experimental evidence that perfect Jacobian orthogonality at initialisation is sufficient to stabilise training and achieve competitive performance. We compare this strategy to networks regularised to maintain the Jacobian orthogonality and obtain comparable results. We further extend our analysis to a class of networks well-approximated by those with orthogonal Jacobians and introduce networks with Jacobians representing partial isometries. These generalized models are then showed to maintain the favourable trainability properties.</description>

      <title>A nonstandard finite difference scheme for an SEIQR epidemiological PDE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02928v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a nonstandard finite difference (NSFD) approach to a reaction-diffusion SEIQR epidemiological model, which captures the spatiotemporal dynamics of infectious disease transmission. Formulated as a system of semilinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), the model extends classical compartmental models by incorporating spatial diffusion to account for population movement and spatial heterogeneity. The proposed NSFD discretization is designed to preserve the continuous model's essential qualitative features, such as positivity, boundedness, and stability, which are often compromised by standard finite difference methods. We rigorously analyze the model's well-posedness, construct a structure-preserving NSFD scheme for the PDE system, and study its convergence and local truncation error. Numerical simulations validate the theoretical findings and demonstrate the scheme's effectiveness in preserving biologically consistent dynamics.</description>

Abstract: \emph{A Three-Field Domain Decomposition Method} is the title of a seminal paper by F. Brezzi and L. D. Marini which introduces a three-field formulation for elliptic partial differential equations. Based on that, we propose the Multiscale-Hybrid-Hybrid Method (MH$^2$M) for the Darcy model, a multiscale finite element method that yields, after a series of formal manipulations, a symmetric positive definite formulation that depends only on the trace of the solution. We show stability and convergence results for a family of finite element spaces and establish relationships with other multiscale finite element methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study sparse-grid linear sampling algorithms and their optimality for approximate recovery of functions with mixed smoothness on $\mathbb{R}^d$ from a set of $n$ their sampled values in two different settings: (i) functions to be recovered are in weighted Sobolev spaces $W^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ of mixed smoothness and the approximation error is measured by the norm of the weighted Lebesgue space $L_{q,w}(\mathbb{R}^d)$, and (ii) functions to be recovered are in Sobolev spaces with measure $W^r_p(\mathbb{R}^d; \mu_w)$ of mixed smoothness and the approximation error is measured by the norm of the Lebesgue space with measure $L_q(\mathbb{R}^d; \mu_w)$. Here, the function $w$, a tensor-product Freud-type weight is the weight in the setting (i), and the density function of the measure $\mu_w$ in the setting (ii). The optimality of linear sampling algorithms is investigated in terms of the relevant sampling $n$-widths. We construct sparse-grid linear sampling algorithms which are completely different for the settings (i) and (ii) and which give upper bounds of the corresponding sampling $n$-widths. We prove that in the one-dimensional case, these algorithms realize the right convergence rate of the sampling widths. In the setting (ii) for the high dimensional case ($d\ge 2$), we also achieve the right convergence rate of the sampling $n$-widths for $1\le q \le 2 \le p \le \infty$ through a non-constructive method.</description>

      <title>Shear-flexible geometrically exact beam element based on finite differences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proposed two-dimensional geometrically exact beam element extends our previous work by including the effects of shear distortion, and also of distributed forces and moments acting along the beam. The general flexibility-based formulation exploits the kinematic equations combined with the inverted sectional equations and the integrated form of equilibrium equations. The resulting set of three first-order differential equations is discretized by finite differences and the boundary value problem is converted into an initial value problem using the shooting method. Due to the special structure of the governing equations, the scheme remains explicit even though the first derivatives are approximated by central differences, leading to high accuracy. The main advantage of the adopted approach is that the error can be efficiently reduced by refining the computational grid used for finite differences at the element level while keeping the number of global degrees of freedom low. The efficiency is also increased by dealing directly with the global centerline coordinates and sectional inclination with respect to global axes as the primary unknowns at the element level, thereby avoiding transformations between local and global coordinates. Two formulations of the sectional equations, referred to as the Reissner and Ziegler models, are presented and compared. In particular, stability of an axially loaded beam/column is investigated and the connections to the Haringx and Engesser stability theories are discussed. Both approaches are tested in a series of numerical examples, which illustrate (i) high accuracy with quadratic convergence when the spatial discretization is refined, (ii) easy modeling of variable stiffness along the element (such as rigid joint offsets), (iii) efficient and accurate characterization of the buckling and post-buckling behavior.</description>

      <title>A practical recipe for variable-step finite differences via equidistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a short, reproducible workflow for applying finite differences on nonuniform grids determined by a positive weight function g. The grid is obtained by equidistribution, mapping uniform computational coordinates $\xi\in[0,1]$ to physical space by the cumulative integral $S(x)=\int_a^x\!1/g(s)\,ds$ and its inverse, and in multiple dimensions by the corresponding variable-diffusion (harmonic) mapping with tensor $P=(1/g)I$. We then use the standard three-point central stencils on uneven spacing for first and second derivatives. We collect the formulas, state the mild constraints on g (positivity, boundedness, integrability), and provide a small reference implementation. Finally, we solve the 2D time-independent Schr\"odinger equation for a harmonic oscillator on uniform vs. variable meshes, showing the expected improvement in resolving localized eigenfunctions without increasing matrix size. We intend this note as a how-to reference rather than a new method, consolidating widely used ideas into a single, ready-to-use recipe, claiming no novelty.</description>

      <title>Surrogate modeling of resonant behavior in scattering problems through adaptive rational approximation and sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper describes novel algorithms for the identification of (almost-)resonant behavior in scattering problems. Our methods, relying on rational approximation, aim at building surrogate models of what we call "field amplification", defined as the norm of the solution operator of the scattering problem, which we express through boundary-integral equations. To provide our techniques with theoretical foundations, we first derive results linking the field amplification to the spectral properties of the operator that defines the scattering problem. Such results are then used to justify the use of rational approximation in the surrogate-modeling task. Some of our proposed methods apply rational approximation in a "standard" way, building a rational approximant for either the solution operator directly or, in the interest of computational efficiency, for a randomly "sketched" version of it. Our other "hybrid" approaches are more innovative, combining rational-approximation-assisted root-finding with approximation using radial basis functions. Three key features of our methods are that (i) they are agnostic of the strategy used to discretize the scattering problem, (ii) they do not require any computations involving non-real wavenumbers, and (iii) they can adjust to different settings through the use of adaptive sampling strategies. We carry out some numerical experiments involving 2D scatterers to compare our approaches. In our tests, two of our approaches (one standard, one hybrid) emerge as the best performers, with one or the other being preferable, depending on whether emphasis is placed on accuracy or efficiency.</description>

      <title>Error estimates for numerical approximations of a nonlinear gradient flow model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13929v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform numerical analysis of a nonlinear gradient flow, which can be regarded as a parabolic minimal surface problem or a regularised total variation flow, using the gradient discretisation method (GDM). GDM is a unified convergence analysis framework that covers conforming and nonconforming numerical methods, for instance, conforming and nonconforming finite element, two-point flux approximation, etc.. In this paper, a fully discretised implicit scheme of the model is proposed, the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the scheme is proved, the stability and consistency of the scheme are analysed, and error estimates are established. Numerical results based on the conforming and nonconforming P1 finite elements are also provided.</description>

      <title>Interpolation in Polynomial Spaces of p-Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13640v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We recently introduced the Fast Newton Transform (FNT), an hierarchical algorithm for performing multivariate Newton interpolation in arbitrary downward closed polynomial spaces of spatial dimension $m$. Here, we analyze the FNT in the context of a specific family of downward closed sets $A_{m,n,p}$, defined as all multi-indices with $\ell^p$ norm less than $n$ with $p \in [0,\infty]$. The FNT performs with time complexity $\mathcal{O}(|A_{m,n,p}|mn)$ on the induced downward closed polynomial spaces $\Pi_{m,n,p}$. We show that the $\Pi_{m,n,p}$ choice compared to the tensor product spaces $\Pi_{m,n,\infty}$, reduces time complexity by a factor of $\rho_{m,n,p}$, decaying super exponentially with spatial dimension when $m \lesssim n^p$. We showcase the efficiency of the FNT by computing activity scores in sensitivity analysis.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Analysis For Monotonically Forward-Backward Accelerated Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nesterov's accelerated gradient method (NAG) achieves faster convergence than gradient descent for convex optimization but lacks monotonicity in function values. To address this, Beck and Teboulle [2009b] proposed a monotonic variant, M-NAG, and extended it to the proximal setting as M-FISTA for composite problems such as Lasso. However, establishing the linear convergence of M-NAG and M-FISTA under strong convexity remains an open problem. In this paper, we analyze M-NAG via the implicit-velocity phase representation and show that an additional assumption, either the position update or the phase-coupling relation, is necessary to fully recover the NAG iterates. The essence of M-NAG lies in controlling an auxiliary sequence to enforce non-increase. We further demonstrate that the M-NAG update alone is sufficient to construct a Lyapunov function guaranteeing linear convergence, without relying on full NAG iterates. By modifying the mixed sequence to incorporate forward-indexed gradients, we develop a new Lyapunov function that removes the kinetic energy term, enabling a direct extension to M-NAG. The required starting index depends only on the momentum parameter and not on problem constants. Finally, leveraging newly developed proximal inequalities, we extend our results to M-FISTA, establishing its linear convergence and deepening the theoretical understanding of monotonic accelerated methods.</description>
