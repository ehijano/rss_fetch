      <title>WiFlexFormer: Efficient WiFi-Based Person-Centric Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose WiFlexFormer, a highly efficient Transformer-based architecture designed for WiFi Channel State Information (CSI)-based person-centric sensing. We benchmark WiFlexFormer against state-of-the-art vision and specialized architectures for processing radio frequency data and demonstrate that it achieves comparable Human Activity Recognition (HAR) performance while offering a significantly lower parameter count and faster inference times. With an inference time of just 10 ms on an Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano, WiFlexFormer is optimized for real-time inference. Additionally, its low parameter count contributes to improved cross-domain generalization, where it often outperforms larger models. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that WiFlexFormer is a potential solution for efficient, scalable WiFi-based sensing applications. The PyTorch implementation of WiFlexFormer is publicly available at: https://github.com/StrohmayerJ/WiFlexFormer.</description>

      <title>Impact of white noise in artificial neural networks trained for classification: performance and noise mitigation strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the hardware implementation of neural networks, leveraging physical coupling and analog neurons has substantially increased in relevance. Such nonlinear and complex physical networks provide significant advantages in speed and energy efficiency, but are potentially susceptible to internal noise when compared to digital emulations of such networks. In this work, we consider how additive and multiplicative Gaussian white noise on the neuronal level can affect the accuracy of the network when applied for specific tasks and including a softmax function in the readout layer. We adapt several noise reduction techniques to the essential setting of classification tasks, which represent a large fraction of neural network computing. We find that these adjusted concepts are highly effective in mitigating the detrimental impact of noise.</description>

      <title>Pushing Boundaries: Quantum-Enhanced Leader Election and the Limits of Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the complexities involved in designing distributed quantum algorithms, highlighting that quantum entanglement does not bypass the Fischer-Lynch-Paterson (FLP) impossibility theorem in asynchronous networks. Although quantum resources such as entanglement offer potential speedups, the inherent constraints of classical communication remain. We develop a leader election algorithm as a proof of concept, demonstrating how entanglement can enhance efficiency while still contending with asynchronous delays. This algorithm serves as a foundation for a broader blueprint for future distributed quantum algorithms, providing insights into both the real performance gains and the limitations that entanglement offers in a distributed setting.</description>

      <title>Learn to Solve Vehicle Routing Problems ASAP: A Neural Optimization Approach for Time-Constrained Vehicle Routing Problems with Finite Vehicle Fleet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding a feasible and prompt solution to the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a prerequisite for efficient freight transportation, seamless logistics, and sustainable mobility. Traditional optimization methods reach their limits when confronted with the real-world complexity of VRPs, which involve numerous constraints and objectives. Recently, the ability of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) to solve combinatorial tasks, known as Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO), demonstrated promising results, offering new perspectives. In this study, we propose an NCO approach to solve a time-constrained capacitated VRP with a finite vehicle fleet size. The approach is based on an encoder-decoder architecture, formulated in line with the Policy Optimization with Multiple Optima (POMO) protocol and trained via a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. We successfully trained the policy with multiple objectives (minimizing the total distance while maximizing vehicle utilization) and evaluated it on medium and large instances, benchmarking it against state-of-the-art heuristics. The method is able to find adequate and cost-efficient solutions, showing both flexibility and robust generalization. Finally, we provide a critical analysis of the solution generated by NCO and discuss the challenges and opportunities of this new branch of intelligent learning algorithms emerging in optimization science, focusing on freight transportation.</description>
