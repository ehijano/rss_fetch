      <title>Revisiting some classical linearizations of the quadratic binary optimization problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present several new linearizations of a quadratic binary optimization problem (QBOP), primarily using the method of aggregations. Although aggregations were studied in the past in the context of solving system of Diophantine equations in non-negative variables, none of the approaches developed produced practical models, particularly due to the large size of associate multipliers. Exploiting the special structure of QBOP we show that selective aggregation of constraints provide valid linearizations with interesting properties. For our aggregations, multipliers can be any non-zero real numbers. Moreover, choosing the multipliers appropriately, we demonstrate that the resulting LP relaxations have value identical to the corresponding non-aggregated models. We also provide a review of existing explicit linearizations of QBOP and presents the first systematic study of such models. Theoretical and experimental comparisons of new and existing models are also provided.</description>

      <title>Robot Positioning Using Torus Packing for Multisets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the design of a positioning system where a robot determines its position from local observations. This is a well-studied problem of considerable practical importance and mathematical interest. The dominant paradigm derives from the classical theory of de Bruijn sequences, where the robot has access to a window within a larger code and can determine its position if these windows are distinct. We propose an alternative model in which the robot has more limited observational powers, which we argue is more realistic in terms of engineering: the robot does not have access to the full pattern of colours (or letters) in the window, but only to the intensity of each colour (or the number of occurrences of each letter). This leads to a mathematically interesting problem with a different flavour to that arising in the classical paradigm, requiring new construction techniques. The parameters of our construction are optimal up to a constant factor, and computing the position requires only a constant number of arithmetic operations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Spectral Decomposition for Quantum Impurity Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving quantum impurity problems may advance our understanding of strongly correlated electron physics, but its development in multi-impurity systems has been greatly hindered due to the presence of shared bath. Here, we propose a general operation strategy to disentangle the shared bath into multiple auxiliary baths and relate the problem to a spectral decomposition problem of function matrix for applying the numerical renormalization group (NRG). We prove exactly that such decomposition is possible for models satisfying (block) circulant symmetry, and show how to construct the auxiliary baths for arbitrary impurity configuration by mapping its graph structure to the subgraph of a regular impurity configuration. We further propose an approximate decomposition algorithm to reduce the number of auxiliary baths and save the computational workload. Our work reveals a deep connection between quantum impurity problems and the graph theory, and provides a general scheme to extend the NRG applications for realistic multi-impurity systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations of real-world phenomenon are implemented with at least two parts: the computational scheme and the computational domain. In the context of hemodynamics, the computational domain of a simulation represents the blood vessel network through which blood flows. Such blood vessel networks can contain millions of individual vessels that are joined together to form a in series and parallel to form the network. It is computationally unfeasible to explicitly simulate blood flow in all blood vessels. Here, from imaged data of a single porcine left coronary arterial tree, we develop a data-pipeline to obtain computational domains for hemodynmaic simulations from a graph representing the coronary vascular tree. Further, we develop a method to ascertain which subregions of the left ventricle are most likely to be perfused via a given artery using a comparison with the American Heart Association division of the left ventricle as a sense check.</description>

      <title>The Fagnano Triangle Patrolling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a combinatorial optimization problem that involves patrolling the edges of an acute triangle using a unit-speed agent. The goal is to minimize the maximum (1-gap) idle time of any edge, which is defined as the time gap between consecutive visits to that edge. This problem has roots in a centuries-old optimization problem posed by Fagnano in 1775, who sought to determine the inscribed triangle of an acute triangle with the minimum perimeter. It is well-known that the orthic triangle, giving rise to a periodic and cyclic trajectory obeying the laws of geometric optics, is the optimal solution to Fagnano's problem. Such trajectories are known as Fagnano orbits, or more generally as billiard trajectories. We demonstrate that the orthic triangle is also an optimal solution to the patrolling problem.
  Our main contributions pertain to new connections between billiard trajectories and optimal patrolling schedules in combinatorial optimization. In particular, as an artifact of our arguments, we introduce a novel 2-gap patrolling problem that seeks to minimize the visitation time of objects every three visits. We prove that there exist infinitely many well-structured billiard-type optimal trajectories for this problem, including the orthic trajectory, which has the special property of minimizing the visitation time gap between any two consecutively visited edges. Complementary to that, we also examine the cost of dynamic, sub-optimal trajectories to the 1-gap patrolling optimization problem. These trajectories result from a greedy algorithm and can be implemented by a computationally primitive mobile agent.</description>

      <title>On Generalizations of Pairwise Compatibility Graphs</title>

Abstract: A graph $G$ is a PCG if there exists an edge-weighted tree such that each leaf of the tree is a vertex of the graph, and there is an edge $\{ x, y \}$ in $G$ if and only if the weight of the path in the tree connecting $x$ and $y$ lies within a given interval. PCGs have different applications in phylogenetics and have been lately generalized to multi-interval-PCGs. In this paper we define two new generalizations of the PCG class, namely k-OR-PCGs and k-AND-PCGs, that are the classes of graphs that can be expressed as union and intersection, respectively, of $k$ PCGs. The problems we consider can be also described in terms of the \emph{covering number} and the \emph{intersection dimension} of a graph with respect to the PCG class. In this paper we investigate how the classes of PCG, multi-interval-PCG, OR-PCG and AND-PCG are related to each other and to other graph classes known in the literature. In particular, we provide upper bounds on the minimum $k$ for which an arbitrary graph $G$ belongs to k-interval-PCG, k-OR-PCG and k-AND-PCG classes. Furthermore, for particular graph classes, we improve these general bounds. Moreover, we show that, for every integer $k$, there exists a bipartite graph that is not in the k-interval-PCG class, proving that there is no finite $k$ for which the k-interval-PCG class contains all the graphs. Finally, we use a Ramsey theory argument to show that for any $k$, there exist graphs that are not in k-AND-PCG, and graphs that are not in k-OR-PCG.</description>

      <title>A quadratic estimation for the K\"uhnel conjecture on embeddings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.04188v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical Heawood inequality states that if the complete graph $K_n$ on $n$ vertices is embeddable in the sphere with $g$ handles, then $g \ge\dfrac{(n-3)(n-4)}{12}$. A higher-dimensional analogue of the Heawood inequality is the K\"uhnel conjecture. In a simplified form it states that for every integer $k&gt;0$ there is $c_k&gt;0$ such that if the union of $k$-faces of $n$-simplex embeds into the connected sum of $g$ copies of the Cartesian product $S^k\times S^k$ of two $k$-dimensional spheres, then $g\ge c_k n^{k+1}$. For $k&gt;1$ only linear estimates were known. We present a quadratic estimate $g\ge c_k n^2$. The proof is based on beautiful and fruitful interplay between geometric topology, combinatorics and linear algebra.</description>

      <title>Alon-Tarsi Number of Some Regular Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.04531v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Alon-Tarsi number of a polynomial is a parameter related to the exponents of its monomials. For graphs, their Alon-Tarsi number is the Alon-Tarsi number of their graph polynomials. As such, it provides an upper bound on their choice and online choice numbers. In this paper, we obtain the Alon-Tarsi number of some complete multipartite graphs, line graphs of some complete graphs of even order, and line graphs of some other regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Approximation Algorithms to Enhance Social Sharing of Fresh Point-of-Interest Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In location-based social networks (LBSNs), such as Gowalla and Waze, users sense urban point-of-interest (PoI) information (e.g., restaurants' queue length and real-time traffic conditions) in the vicinity and share such information with friends in online social networks. Given each user's social connections and the severe lags in disseminating fresh PoI to all users, major LBSNs aim to enhance users' social PoI sharing by selecting $k$ out of $m$ users as hotspots and broadcasting their PoI information to the entire user community. This motivates us to study a new combinatorial optimization problem by integrating two urban sensing and online social networks. We prove that this problem is NP-hard and also renders existing approximation solutions not viable. Through analyzing the interplay effects between the sensing and social networks, we successfully transform the involved PoI-sharing process across two networks to matrix computations for deriving a closed-form objective, {\color{black}which we find holds desirable properties (e.g., submodularity and monotonicity).} This finding enables us to develop a polynomial-time algorithm that guarantees a ($1-\frac{m-2}{m}(\frac{k-1}{k})^k$) approximation of the optimum. Furthermore, we allow each selected user to move around and sense more PoI information to share. To this end, we propose an augmentation-adaptive algorithm, which benefits from a resource-augmented technique and achieves bounded approximation, ranging from $\frac{1}{k}(1-\frac{1}{e})$ to $1-\frac{1}{e}&gt; 0.632$ by adjusting our augmentation factors. Finally, our theoretical results are corroborated by our simulation findings using both synthetic and real-world datasets across different network topologies.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for the bracketing number of orthants or revisiting an algorithm of Thi\'{e}mard to compute bounds for the star discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve the best known upper bound for the bracketing number of $d$-dimensional axis-parallel boxes anchored in $0$ (or, put differently, of lower left orthants intersected with the $d$-dimensional unit cube $[0,1]^d$). More precisely, we provide a better upper bound for the cardinality of an algorithmic bracketing cover construction due to Eric Thi\'emard, which forms the core of his algorithm to approximate the star discrepancy of arbitrary point sets from [E. Thi\'emard, An algorithm to compute bounds for the star discrepancy, J.~Complexity 17 (2001), 850 -- 880].
  Moreover, the new upper bound for the bracketing number of anchored axis-parallel boxes yields an improved upper bound for the bracketing number of arbitrary axis-parallel boxes in $[0,1]^d$.
  In our upper bounds all constants are fully explicit.</description>
