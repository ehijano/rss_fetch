      <title>The In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of nuclei at finite temperature is of immense interest for many areas of nuclear astrophysics and nuclear-reaction science. A variety of ab initio methods are now available for computing the properties of nuclei from interactions rooted in Quantum Chromodynamics, but applications have largely been limited to zero temperature. In the present work, we extend one such method, the In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (IMSRG), to finite temperature. Using an exactly-solvable schematic model that captures essential features of nuclear interactions, we show that the FT-IMSRG can accurately determine the energetics of nuclei at finite temperature, and we explore the accuracy of the FT-IMSRG in different parameter regimes, e.g., strong and weak pairing. In anticipation of FT-IMSRG applications for finite nuclei and infinite matter, we discuss differences arising from the choice of working with the canonical and the grand canonical ensembles. In future work, we will apply the FT-IMSRG with realistic nuclear interactions to compute nuclear structure and reaction properties at finite temperature, which are important ingredients for understanding nucleosynthesis in stellar environments, or modeling reactions of hot compound nuclei.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of mirror energy difference for states exhibiting Thomas-Ehrman shift: Gamow shell model case studies of $^{18}$Ne/$^{18}$O and $^{19}$Na/$^{19}$O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mirror energy difference (MED) of the mirror state, especially for states bearing the Thomas-Erhman shift, serves as a sensitive probe of isospin symmetry breaking. We employ the Gamow shell model, which includes the inter-nucleon correlation and continuum coupling, to investigate the MED for $sd$-shell nuclei by taking the $^{18}$Ne/$^{18}$O and $^{19}$Na/$^{19}$O as examples. Our GSM provides good descriptions for the excitation energies and MEDs for the $^{18}$Ne/$^{18}$O and $^{19}$Na/$^{19}$O. Moreover, our calculations also reveal that the large MED of the mirror states is caused by the significant occupation of the weakly bound or unbound $s_{1/2}$ waves, giving the radial density distribution of the state in the proton-rich nucleus more extended than that of mirror states in deeply-bound neutron-rich nuclei. Furthermore, our GSM calculation shows that the contribution of Coulomb is different for the low-lying states in proton-rich nuclei, which significantly contributes to MEDs of mirror states. Moreover, the contributions of the nucleon-nucleon interaction are different for the mirror state, especially for the state of proton-rich nuclei bearing the Thomas-Erhman shift, which also contributes to the significant isospin symmetry breaking with large MED.</description>

      <title>Applying Deep Learning Technique to Chiral Magnetic Wave Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral magnetic wave (CMW) is a collective mode in quark-gluon plasma originated from the chiral magnetic effect (CME) and chiral separation effect. Its detection in heavy-ion collisions is challenging due to significant background contamination. In Ref.[1], we have constructed a neural network which can accurately identify the CME-related signal from the final-state pion spectra. In this paper, we generalize such a neural network to the case of CMW search. We show that, after a updated training, the neural network can effectively recognize the CMW-related signal. Additionally, we assess the performance of the neural network compared to other known methods for CMW search.</description>

      <title>Three-Nucleon Correlations in Light Nuclei Yields Ratios from AMPT Model for QCD Critical Point Investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research use the AMPT model in Au+Au collisions to study the influence of the three nucleons correlation $C_{n2p}$ on the light nuclei yield ratios. It is found that neglecting $C_{n2p}$ leads to an overestimated relative neutron density fluctuation extraction. Including $C_{n2p}$ will enhances the agreement with experimental results with higher yield ratios, yet it does not change the energy dependence of the yield ratio. Since there is no first-order phase transition or critical physics in the AMPT model, our work fails to reproduce the experimental energy-dependent peak around $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}} = $20-30 GeV. Our work might offer a baseline for investigating critical physics phenomena using the light nuclei production as a probe.</description>

      <title>Deuteron-proton backward elastic scattering at GeV energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deuteron-proton elastic scattering is considered at the energies from 880 MeV to 2 GeV at the scattering angles $\theta^*\ge 140^\circ$. The multiple-scattering method is used to calculate the reaction amplitude. Four reaction mechanisms are taken into account: one-nucleon-exchange, single-scattering, and double-scattering with a nucleon and a delta-isobar in the intermediate state. The method allows calculating both unpolarized differential cross section and any polarization observables.
  All the results obtained are compared to the experimental data.</description>

      <title>Ab initio description of monopole resonances in light- and medium-mass nuclei: IV. Angular momentum projection and rotation-vibration coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant Resonances are, with nuclear rotations, the most evident expression of collectivity in finite nuclei. These two categories of excitations, however, are traditionally described within different formal schemes, such that vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom are separately treated and coupling effects between those are often neglected. The present work puts forward an approach aiming at a consitent treatment of vibrations and rotations. Specifically, this paper is the last in a series of four dedicated to the investigation of the giant monopole resonance in doubly open-shell nuclei via the ab initio Projected Generator Coordinate Method (PGCM). The present focus is on the treatment and impact of angular momentum restoration within such calculations. The PGCM being based on the use of deformed mean-field states, the angular-momentum restoration is performed when solving the secular equation to extract vibrational excitations. In this context, it is shown that performing the angular momentum restoration only after solving the secular equation contaminates the monopole response with an unphysical coupling to the rotational motion, as was also shown recently for (quasi-particle) random phase approximation calculations based on a deformed reference state. Eventually, the present work based on the PGCM confirms that an a priori angular momentum restoration is necessary to handle consistently both collective motions at the same time. This further pleads in favor of implementing the full-fledged projected (quasi-particle) random phase approximation in the future.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Calculation of $x$-dependent Meson Distribution Amplitudes at Physical Pion Mass with Threshold Logarithm Resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the $x$-dependent pion and kaon distribution amplitudes (DA) in the framework of large momentum effective theory. This calculation is performed on a fine lattice of $a=0.076$~fm at physical pion mass, with the pion boosted to $1.8$~GeV and kaon boosted to $2.3$~GeV. We renormalize the matrix elements in the hybrid scheme and match to $\overline{\rm MS}$ with a subtraction of the leading renormalon in the Wilson-line mass. The perturbative matching is improved by resumming the large logarithms related to the small quark and gluon momenta in the soft-gluon limit. After resummation, we demonstrate that we are able to calculate a range of $x\in[x_0,1-x_0]$ with $x_0=0.25$ for pion and $x_0=0.2$ for kaon with systematics under control. The kaon DA is shown to be slighted skewed, and narrower than pion DA. Although the $x$-dependence cannot be direct calculated beyond these ranges, we estimate higher moments of the pion and kaon DAs {by complementing} our calculation with short-distance factorization.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Polarisability of Octet Baryons via Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drawing on recent advances in lattice-QCD background-field techniques, the magnetic polarisability of octet baryons is calculated from the first principles of QCD. The results are presented in the context of new constituent quark-model calculations providing a framework for understanding the lattice results and a direct comparison with simulation results at unphysical quark masses. Using smeared quark sources, low-lying Laplacian eigenmode projection and final-state Landau mode projection, considerable attention is devoted to ensuring single-state isolation in the lattice correlation functions. We also introduce new weighting methods to reduce the sensitivity to correlation-function fits, averaging over many fits based on merit drawn from the full correlated $\chi^2$ of the fits. The techniques are implemented on the $32^3 \times 64$, 2+1-flavour dynamical-fermion lattices provided by the PACS-CS collaboration following the introduction of uniform magnetic fields quantised to the lowest nontrivial values available. After some fine tuning of the constituent quark model parameters, we find the model captures the patterns observed in the lattice QCD results very well, providing important insights into the physics underpinning the magnetic polarisabilities. Finally, comparison with the most recent results from experiment proceeds through an effective field theory formalism which incorporates estimates of finite-volume corrections and small electro-quenching corrections as the results are brought to the physical point. We find excellent agreement with experiment where available, including the proton and neutron polarisabilities.</description>

      <title>Relevance of the coupled channels in the $\phi$p and $\rho^0$p Correlation Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vector meson-baryon interaction in a coupled channel scheme is revisited within the correlation function framework. As illustrative cases to reveal the important role played by the coupled channels, we focus on the $\phi$p and $\rho^0$p systems given their complex dynamics and the presence of quasi-bound states or resonances in the vicinity of their thresholds. We show that the $\phi$p femtoscopic data provide novel information about a $N^*$ state present in the experimental region and anticipate the relevance of a future $\rho^0$p correlation function measurement in order to pin down the $S=0, Q=+1$ vector meson-baryon interaction as well as to disclose the characterizing features of the $N^*(1700)$ state.</description>

      <title>Effects of saturation and fluctuating hotspots for flow observables in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of saturation dynamics on midrapidity flow observables by adding fluctuating hotspots into the novel Monte Carlo EKRT (MC-EKRT) event generator for high-energy nuclear collisions. We demonstrate that the intensity of the saturation effects significantly affects the ratio between the flow coefficients $v_3$ and $v_2$ at the LHC. Adding a hotspot substructure to the nucleons enhances the saturation effects and improves the agreement with the measured data. We show that the collision-energy dependence of the flow coefficients obtained using the MC-EKRT initial states with hotspots is improved in comparison with the earlier event-by-event EKRT model. In addition, we present the results for the charged hadron multiplicity distribution in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC, and show that the minijet-multiplicity originating fluctuations of the saturation scale included in MC-EKRT, as well as the presence of hotspots, are necessary for describing the measured large-multiplicity tail in the distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Belle data on the $K^- p$ mass distribution of the $\Lambda_c^+ \to p K^- \pi^+$ reaction near the $\eta \Lambda$ threshold to determine the $\eta \Lambda $ scattering length and effective range. We show that from these data alone we can determine the value of $a$ with better precision than so far determined, and the value of $r_0$ for the first time. The addition of the $K^- p \to \eta \Lambda$ data allows us to improve the precision of these magnitudes, with errors smaller than $15\%$. We also determine with high precision the pole position of the $\Lambda(1670)$.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Green's function approach to low-energy fission dynamics: fluctuations in fission reactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04255v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a microscopic modeling for a decay of a heavy compound nucleus, starting from a nucleonic degree of freedom. To this end, we develop an approach based on a non-equilibrium Green's function, which is combined with a configuration interaction (CI) approach based on a constrained density-functional theory (DFT). We apply this approach to a barrier-top fission of $^{236}$U, restricting the model space to seniority zero configurations of neutrons and protons. We particularly focus on the distribution of the fission probability. We find that it approximately follows the chi-squared distribution with the number of degrees of freedom $\nu$ of the order of 1, which is consistent with the experimental finding. We also show that $\nu$ corresponds to the number of eigenstates of the many-body Hamiltonian whose energy is close to the excitation energy of the system and at the same time which have significant components on both sides of a fission barrier.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The experimental evidence for the collective wobbling motion of triaxial nuclei is reviewed. The classification into transverse and longitudinal in the presence of quasiparticle excitations is discussed. The description by means of the quasiparticle+triaxial rotor model is discussed in detail.
  The structure of the states is analyzed using the spin-coherent-state and spin-squeezed-state representations of the reduced density matrices of the total and particle angular momenta, which distill the corresponding classical precessional motions. Various approximate solutions of the quasiparticle+triaxial rotor model are evaluated.
  The microscopic studies of wobbling in the small-amplitude random phase approximation are discussed. Selected studies of wobbling by means of the triaxial projected shell model are presented, which focus on how this microscopic approach removes certain deficiencies of the semi-microscopic quasiparticle+triaxial rotor model.</description>

      <title>Constraining MeV to 10 GeV majoron by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We estimate the Big Bang nucleosynthesis (BBN) constraint on the majoron in the mass range between $1\,{\rm MeV}$ to $10\,{\rm GeV}$ which dominantly decays into the standard model neutrinos. When the majoron lifetime is shorter than $1\,{\rm sec}$, the injected neutrinos mainly heat up background plasma, which alters the relation between photon temperature and background neutrino temperature. For a lifetime longer than $1\,{\rm sec}$, most of the injected neutrinos directly contribute to the protons-to-neutrons conversion. In both cases, deuterium and helium abundances are enhanced, while the constraint from the deuterium is stronger than that from the helium. $^7{\rm Li}$ abundance gets decreased as a consequence of additional neutrons, but the parameter range that fits the observed $^7{\rm Li}$ abundance is excluded by the deuterium constraint. We also estimate other cosmological constraints and compare them with the BBN bound.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Determination of Fragmentation Functions and Test on Momentum Sum Rule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a simultaneous global analysis of hadron fragmentation functions (FFs) to various charged hadrons at next-to-leading order in QCD. The world data set includes results from electron-positron single-inclusive annihilation, semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, as well as proton-proton collisions including jet fragmentation measurements which lead to strong constraints on the gluon fragmentations. By carefully selecting hadron kinematics to ensure the validity of QCD factorization and the convergence of perturbative calculations, we achieve a satisfying best fit with $\chi^2/$d.o.f.$=0.90$, in the simultaneous extraction of FFs for light charged hadrons ($\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$ and $p/\bar{p}$). The total momentum of $u$, $d$ quarks and gluon carried by light charged hadrons have been determined precisely. That urges future precision measurements on fragmentation to neutral hadrons, which are crucial for the test of fundamental sum rules in QCD fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Role of hidden-color components in the tetraquark mixing model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiquarks can have two-hadron components and hidden-color components in their wave functions. The presence of two-hadron components in multiquarks introduces a potential source of confusion, particularly with respect to their resemblance to hadronic molecules. On the other hand, hidden-color components are essential for distinguishing between multiquarks and hadronic molecules. In this work, we study the hidden-color components in the wave functions of the tetraquark mixing model, a model that has been proposed as a suitable framework for describing the properties of two nonets in the $J^P=0^+$ channel: the light nonet [$a_0 (980)$, $K_0^* (700)$, $f_0 (500)$, $f_0 (980)$] and the heavy nonet [$a_0 (1450)$, $K_0^* (1430)$, $f_0 (1370)$, $f_0 (1500)$]. Our analysis reveals a substantial presence of hidden-color components within the tetraquark wave functions. To elucidate the impact of hidden-color components on physical quantities, we conduct computations of the hyperfine masses, $\langle V_{CS}\rangle$, for the two nonets, considering scenarios involving only the two-meson components and those incorporating the hidden-color components. We demonstrate that the hidden-color components constitute an important part of the hyperfine masses, such that the mass difference formula, $\Delta M\approx \Delta \langle V_{CS}\rangle$, which has been successful for the two nonets, cannot be achieved without the hidden-color contributions. This can provide another evidence supporting the tetraquark nature of the two nonets.</description>

      <title>Total Gluon Helicity from Lattice without Effective Theory Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two approaches for extracting the total gluon helicity contribution to proton spin from lattice QCD, one from local operator matrix elements in a fixed gauge accessible on lattice with feasible renormalization, and the other from gauge-invariant nonlocal gluon correlators. Neither of these approaches requires a matching procedure when converted to the MS scheme. Our proposal resolves a long-standing inconsistency in the literature regarding lattice calculations of the total gluon helicity, and has the potential to greatly facilitate these calculations.</description>

      <title>Topological susceptibility and axion potential in two-flavor superconductive quark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14160v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the potential of the axion, $a$, of Quantum Chromodynamics, in the two-flavor color superconducting phase of cold and dense quark matter. We adopt a Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-like model. Our interaction contains two terms, one preserving and one breaking the $U(1)_A$ symmetry: the latter is responsible of the coupling of axions to quarks. We introduce two quark condensates, $h_L$ and $h_R$, describing condensation for left-handed and right-handed quarks respectively; we then study the loci of the minima of the thermodynamic potential, $\Omega$, in the $(h_L,h_R)$ plane, noticing how the instanton-induced interaction favors condensation in the scalar channel when the $\theta-$angle, $\theta=a/f_a$, vanishes. Increasing $\theta$ we find a phase transition where the scalar condensate rotates into a pseudo-scalar one. We present an analytical result for the topological susceptibility, $\chi$, in the superconductive phase, which stands both at zero and at finite temperature. Finally, we compute the axion mass and its self-coupling. In particular, the axion mass $m_a$ is related to the full topological susceptibility via $\chi=m_a^2 f_a^2$, hence our result for $\chi$ gives an analytical result for $m_a$ in the superconductive phase of high-density Quantum Chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Color Coherence Effects in Dipole-Quark Scattering in the Soft Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color coherence effects play a crucial role in the description of jet evolution at collider experiments. It is well known that the stimulated gluon emission suffered by energetic jets traversing deconfined QCD matter is also affected by color coherence effects. Through multiple soft scatterings with the medium constituents, an antenna will lose its color correlation, causing its legs to behave as independent emitters after the so-called decoherence time. In this work we provide the first computation of the properties of the recoils produced as a result of these soft scatterings between a color coherent dipole and the medium constituents. Our findings reveal that the angular phase-space of these soft recoils is strongly restricted by the opening angle of the dipole itself due to quantum interference effects. In this long wavelength limit, one can effectively consider that interactions take place with each of the legs of the dipole separately, provided that the angular constraints dictated by the corresponding color flow topologies are respected. This is in complete analogy with the case of soft gluon emission in vacuum, where the recoil quark plays the role of the emitted gluon. As a direct phenomenological application we estimate the collisional energy loss rate of a color antenna. Importantly, these results indicate the way in which color coherence effects can be implemented in jet quenching models that account for the recoils from elastic scatterings, improving in this way our description of medium response physics in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Spin-independent interactions of Dirac Fermionic Dark Matter in the composite Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to recent measurements, dark matter magnetic dipole moment is strongly constrained. In the composite Higgs models the magnetic dipole moment of the Dirac dark matter fermion and its mass can be suppressed by the approximate U(1) symmetry. We consider E_6 inspired composite Higgs model (E_6CHM) with U(1) symmetry violating operators, which give rise to dark matter's mass and coupling constant to Higgs boson. The dependence of the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section on the E_6CHM parameters is explored. We argue that there are regions of the parameter space which are still safe from all current constraints and may lead to spectacular LHC signatures.</description>

      <title>A More Precise Measurement of the Radius of PSR J0740+6620 Using Updated NICER Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PSR J0740+6620 is the neutron star with the highest precisely determined mass, inferred from radio observations to be $2.08\pm0.07\,\rm M_\odot$. Measurements of its radius therefore hold promise to constrain the properties of the cold, catalyzed, high-density matter in neutron star cores. Previously, Miller et al. (2021) and Riley et al. (2021) reported measurements of the radius of PSR J0740+6620 based on Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) observations accumulated through 17 April 2020, and an exploratory analysis utilizing NICER background estimates and a data set accumulated through 28 December 2021 was presented in Salmi et al. (2022). Here we report an updated radius measurement, derived by fitting models of X-ray emission from the neutron star surface to NICER data accumulated through 21 April 2022, totaling $\sim1.1$ Ms additional exposure compared to the data set analyzed in Miller et al. (2021) and Riley et al. (2021), and to data from X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM-Newton) observations. We find that the equatorial circumferential radius of PSR J0740+6620 is $12.92_{-1.13}^{+2.09}$ km (68% credibility), a fractional uncertainty $\sim83\%$ the width of that reported in Miller et al. (2021), in line with statistical expectations given the additional data. If we were to require the radius to be less than 16 km, as was done in Salmi et al. (2024), then our 68% credible region would become $R=12.76^{+1.49}_{-1.02}$ km, which is close to the headline result of Salmi et al. (2024). Our updated measurements, along with other laboratory and astrophysical constraints, imply a slightly softer equation of state than that inferred from our previous measurements.</description>
