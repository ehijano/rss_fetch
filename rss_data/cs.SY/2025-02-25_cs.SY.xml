      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Bidding Strategies for Prosumers Trading in Double Auction-Based Transactive Energy Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the large number of prosumers deploying distributed energy resources (DERs), integrating these prosumers into a transactive energy market (TEM) is a trend for the future smart grid. A community-based double auction market is considered a promising TEM that can encourage prosumers to participate and maximize social welfare. However, the traditional TEM is challenging to model explicitly due to the random bidding behavior of prosumers and uncertainties caused by the energy operation of DERs. Furthermore, although reinforcement learning algorithms provide a model-free solution to optimize prosumers' bidding strategies, their use in TEM is still challenging due to their scalability, stability, and privacy protection limitations. To address the above challenges, in this study, we design a double auction-based TEM with multiple DERs-equipped prosumers to transparently and efficiently manage energy transactions. We also propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model with distributed learning and execution to ensure the scalability and privacy of the market environment. Additionally, the design of two bidding actions (i.e., bidding price and quantity) optimizes the bidding strategies for prosumers. Simulation results show that (1) the designed TEM and DRL model are robust; (2) the proposed DRL model effectively balances the energy payment and comfort satisfaction for prosumers and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in optimizing the bidding strategies.</description>

      <title>TSS GAZ PTP: Towards Improving Gumbel AlphaZero with Two-stage Self-play for Multi-constrained Electric Vehicle Routing Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Gumbel AlphaZero~(GAZ) was proposed to solve classic combinatorial optimization problems such as TSP and JSSP by creating a carefully designed competition model~(consisting of a learning player and a competitor player), which leverages the idea of self-play. However, if the competitor is too strong or too weak, the effectiveness of self-play training can be reduced, particularly in complex CO problems. To address this problem, we further propose a two-stage self-play strategy to improve the GAZ method~(named TSS GAZ PTP). In the first stage, the learning player uses the enhanced policy network based on the Gumbel Monte Carlo Tree Search~(MCTS), and the competitor uses the historical best trained policy network~(acts as a greedy player). In the second stage, we employ Gumbel MCTS for both players, which makes the competition fiercer so that both players can continuously learn smarter trajectories. We first investigate the performance of our proposed TSS GAZ PTP method on TSP since it is also used as a test problem by the original GAZ. The results show the superior performance of TSS GAZ PTP. Then we extend TSS GAZ PTP to deal with multi-constrained Electric Vehicle Routing Problems~(EVRP), which is a recently well-known real application research topic and remains challenging as a complex CO problem. Impressively, the experimental results show that the TSS GAZ PTP outperforms the state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning methods in all types of instances tested and outperforms the optimization solver in tested large-scale instances, indicating the importance and promising of employing more dynamic self-play strategies for complex CO problems.</description>

      <title>Feature Engineering Approach to Building Load Prediction: A Case Study for Commercial Building Chiller Plant Optimization in Tropical Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In tropical countries with high humidity, air conditioning can account for up to 60% of a building's energy use. For commercial buildings with centralized systems, the efficiency of the chiller plant is vital, and model predictive control provides an effective strategy for optimizing operations through dynamic adjustments based on accurate load predictions. Artificial neural networks are effective for modelling nonlinear systems but are prone to overfitting due to their complexity. Effective feature engineering can mitigate this issue. While weather data are crucial for load prediction, they are often used as raw numerical inputs without advanced processing. Clustering features is a technique that can reduce model complexity and enhance prediction accuracy. Although previous studies have explored clustering algorithms for load prediction, none have applied them to multidimensional weather data, revealing a research gap. This study presents a cooling load prediction model that combines a neural network with Kalman filtering and K-means clustering. Applied to real world data from a commercial skyscraper in Singapore's central business district, the model achieved a 46.5% improvement in prediction accuracy. An optimal chiller sequencing strategy was also developed through genetic algorithm optimization of the predictive load, potentially saving 13.8% in energy. Finally, the study evaluated the integration of thermal energy storage into the chiller plant design, demonstrating potential reductions in capital and operational costs of 26% and 13%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Model-free system identification of surface ships in waves via Hankel dynamic mode decomposition with control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces and compares the Hankel dynamic mode decomposition with control (Hankel-DMDc) and a novel Bayesian extension of Hankel-DMDc as model-free (i.e., data-driven and equation-free) approaches for system identification and prediction of free-running ship motions in irregular waves. The proposed DMDc methods create a reduced-order model using limited data from the system state and incoming wave elevation histories, with the latter and rudder angle serving as forcing inputs. The inclusion of delayed states of the system as additional dimensions per the Hankel-DMDc improves the representation of the underlying non-linear dynamics of the system by DMD. The approaches are statistically assessed using data from free-running simulations of a 5415M hull's course-keeping in irregular beam-quartering waves at sea state 7, a highly severe condition characterized by nonlinear responses near roll-resonance. The results demonstrate robust performance and remarkable computational efficiency. The results indicate that the proposed methods effectively identify the dynamic system in analysis. Furthermore, the Bayesian formulation incorporates uncertainty quantification and enhances prediction accuracy. Ship motions are predicted with good agreement with test data over a 15 encounter waves observation window. No significant accuracy degradation is noted along the test sequences, suggesting the method can support accurate and efficient maritime design and operational planning.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Iterative Water-Filling in Multi-User Non-Cooperative Power Control: A Comprehensive Analysis for Sequential, Simultaneous, and Asynchronous Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-cooperative game theory provides a robust framework for analyzing distributed resource allocation in multi-user wireless networks, with \emph{Iterative Water-Filling} (IWF) emerging as a canonical solution for power control problems. Although classical fixed-point theorems guarantee the existence of a Nash Equilibrium (NE) under mild concavity and compactness conditions, the convergence of practical iterative algorithms to that equilibrium remains a challenging endeavor. This challenge intensifies under varying update schedules, interference regimes, and imperfections such as channel estimation errors or feedback delay.
  In this paper, we present an in-depth examination of IWF in multi-user systems under three different update schemes: (1) synchronous \emph{sequential} updates, (2) synchronous \emph{simultaneous} updates, and (3) \emph{totally asynchronous} updates. We first formulate the water-filling operator in a multi-carrier environment, then recast the iterative process as a fixed-point problem. Using contraction mapping principles, we demonstrate sufficient conditions under which IWF converges to a unique NE and highlight how spectral radius constraints, diagonal dominance, and careful step-size selection are pivotal for guaranteeing convergence. We further discuss robustness to measurement noise, partial updates, and network scaling to emphasize the practical viability of these schemes. This comprehensive analysis unifies diverse threads in the literature while offering novel insights into asynchronous implementations. Our findings enable network designers to ascertain system parameters that foster both stable convergence and efficient spectrum usage.</description>

      <title>From Target Tracking to Targeting Track -- Part I: A Metric for Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of target tracking, performance evaluation plays a pivotal role in the design, comparison, and analytics of trackers. Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation of the Network of FitzHugh-Nagumo Neurons Based on the Speed-Gradient and Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper addresses the problem of parameter estimation (or identification) in dynamical networks composed of an arbitrary number of FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron models with diffusive couplings between each other. It is assumed that only the membrane potential of each model is measured, while the other state variable and all derivatives remain unmeasured. Additionally, potential measurement errors in the membrane potential due to sensor imprecision are considered. To solve this problem, firstly, the original FitzHugh-Nagumo network is transformed into a linear regression model, where the regressors are obtained by applying a filter-differentiator to specific combinations of the measured variables. Secondly, the speed-gradient method is applied to this linear model, leading to the design of an identification algorithm for the FitzHugh-Nagumo neural network. Sufficient conditions for the asymptotic convergence of the parameter estimates to their true values are derived for the proposed algorithm. Parameter estimation for a network of five interconnected neurons is demonstrated through computer simulation. The results confirm that the sufficient conditions are satisfied in the numerical experiments conducted. Furthermore, the algorithm's capabilities for adjusting the identification accuracy and time are investigated. The proposed approach has potential applications in nervous system modeling, particularly in the context of human brain modeling. For instance, EEG signals could serve as the measured variables of the network, enabling the integration of mathematical neural models with empirical data collected by neurophysiologists.</description>

      <title>Impact Analysis of Utility-Scale Energy Storage on the ERCOT Grid in Reducing Renewable Generation Curtailments and Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the solutions for minimizing renewable energy (RE) curtailment in the Texas Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) grid. By utilizing current and future planning data from ERCOT and the System Advisor Model from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, we examine how future renewable energy (RE) initiatives, combined with utility-scale energy storage, can reduce CO2 emissions while reshaping Texas's energy mix. The study projects the energy landscape from 2023 to 2033, considering the planned phase-out of fossil fuel plants and the integration of new wind/solar projects. By comparing emissions under different load scenarios, with and without storage, we demonstrate storage's role in optimizing RE utilization. The findings of this paper provide actionable guidance for energy stakeholders, underscoring the need to expand wind and solar projects with strategic storage solutions to maximize Texas's RE capacity and substantially reduce CO2 emissions.</description>

      <title>From Target Tracking to Targeting Track -- Part II: Regularized Polynomial Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Target tracking entails the estimation of the evolution of the target state over time, namely the target trajectory. Different from the classical state space model, our series of studies, including this paper, model the collection of the target state as a stochastic process (SP) that is further decomposed into a deterministic part which represents the trend of the trajectory and a residual SP representing the residual fitting error. Subsequently, the tracking problem is formulated as a learning problem regarding the trajectory SP for which a key part is to estimate a trajectory FoT (T-FoT) best fitting the measurements in time series. For this purpose, we consider the polynomial T-FoT and address the regularized polynomial T-FoT optimization employing two distinct regularization strategies seeking trade-off between the accuracy and simplicity. One limits the order of the polynomial and then the best choice is determined by grid searching in a narrow, bounded range while the other adopts $\ell_0$ norm regularization for which the hybrid Newton solver is employed. Simulation results obtained in both single and multiple maneuvering target scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Measurement Enhancement in Power Distribution Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of smart distribution networks (DNs), the integrity and accuracy of grid measurement data are crucial to the safety and stability of the entire system. However, the quality of the user power consumption data cannot be guaranteed during the collection and transmission process. To this end, this paper proposes a low-rank tensor completion model based on CANDECOMP/PARAFAC decomposition (CPD-LRTC) to enhance the quality of the measurement data of the DNs. Firstly, the causes and the associated characteristics of the missing data are analyzed, and a third-order standard tensor is constructed as a mathematical model of the measurement data of the DN. Then, a completion model is established based on the characteristics of measurement data and the low rank of the completion tensor, and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is used to solve it iteratively. Finally, the proposed model is verified through two case studies, the completion accuracy, the computational efficiency, and the memory usage are compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Demand Forecasting for Electric Vehicle Charging Stations using Multivariate Time-Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the number of electric vehicles (EVs) continues to grow, the demand for charging stations is also increasing, leading to challenges such as long wait times and insufficient infrastructure. High-precision forecasting of EV charging demand is crucial for efficient station management, to address some of these challenges. This paper presents an approach to predict the charging demand at 15-minute intervals for the day ahead using a multivariate long short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism. Additionally, the model leverages explainable AI techniques to evaluate the influence of various factors on the predictions, including weather conditions, day of the week, month, and any holiday. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) are used to quantify the contribution of each feature to the final forecast, providing deeper insights into how these factors affect prediction accuracy. As a result, the framework offers enhanced decision-making for infrastructure planning. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulations using the test data collected from the EV charging stations at California State University, Long Beach.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Gradient Estimation for Accelerating Deep Learning based AC-OPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimal power flow (OPF) problem can be rapidly and reliably solved by employing responsive online solvers based on neural networks. The dynamic nature of renewable energy generation and the variability of power grid conditions necessitate frequent neural network updates with new data instances. To address this need and reduce the time required for data preparation time, we propose a semi-supervised learning framework aided by data augmentation. In this context, ridge regression replaces the traditional solver, facilitating swift prediction of optimal solutions for the given input load demands. Additionally, to accelerate the backpropagation during training, we develop novel batch-mean gradient estimation approaches along with a reduced branch set to alleviate the complexity of gradient computation. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our neural network, equipped with the proposed gradient estimators, consistently achieves feasible and near-optimal solutions. These results underline the effectiveness of our approach for practical implementation in real-time OPF applications.</description>

      <title>Robust Nonlinear Data-Driven Predictive Control for Mixed Vehicle Platoons via Koopman Operator and Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed vehicle platoons, comprising connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), hold significant potential for enhancing traffic performance. Most existing research assumes linear system dynamics and often ignores the impact of critical factors such as noise, disturbances, and attacks, which are inherent to real-world scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a Robust Nonlinear Data-Driven Predictive Control (RNDDPC) framework that ensures safe and optimal control under uncertain and adverse conditions. By utilizing Koopman operator theory, we map the system's nonlinear dynamics into a higher-dimensional space, constructing a Koopman-based linear predictor that approximates the behavior of the original nonlinear system. To mitigate modeling errors associated with this predictor, we introduce a data-driven reachable set analysis technique that performs secondary learning using matrix zonotope sets, generating a reachable set predictor for over-approximation of the future states of the underlying system. Then, we formulate the RNDDPC optimization problem and solve it in a receding horizon manner for robust control inputs. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms baseline methods in tracking performance under noise, disturbances, and attacks.</description>

Abstract: Current affine formation maneuver of multi-agent systems (MASs) relys on the affine localizability determined by generic assumption for nominal configuration and global construction manner. This does not live up to practical constraints of robot swarms. In this paper, an equilibrium unit based structure is proposed to achieve affine localizability. In an equilibrium unit, existence of non-zero weights between nodes is guaranteed and their summation is proved to be non-zero. To remove the generic assumption, a notion of layerable directed graph is introduced, based on which a sufficient condition associated equilibrium unit is presented to establish affine localizability condition. Within this framework, distributed local construction manner is performed by a designed equilibrium unit construction (EUC) method. With the help of localized communication criterion (LCC) and localized sensing based affine formation maneuver control (LSAFMC) protocol, self-reconstruction capability is possessed by MASs when nodes are added to or removed from the swarms.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Discrepancy Modeling in Higher-Dimensional State Space via Coprime Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides a data-driven framework that combines coprime factorization with a lifting linearization technique to model the discrepancy between a nonlinear system and its nominal linear approximation using a linear time-invariant (LTI) state-space model in a higher-dimensional state space. In the proposed framework, the nonlinear system is represented in terms of the left coprime factors of the nominal linear system, along with perturbations modeled as stable, norm-bounded LTI systems in a higher-dimensional state space using a deep learning approach. Our method builds on a recently proposed parametrization for norm-bounded systems, enabling the simultaneous minimization of the H-infinity norm of the learned perturbations. We also provide a coprime factorization-based approach as an alternative to direct methods for learning lifted LTI approximations of nonlinear systems. In this approach, the LTI approximations are obtained by learning their left coprime factors, which remain stable even when the original system is unstable. The effectiveness of the proposed discrepancy modeling approach is demonstrated through multiple examples.</description>

      <title>Least Squares based Estimation of Thevenin Equivalent in Noisy Distribution Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel approach that synergizes the extremum seeking method with an online least squares estimation technique to accurately estimate Thevenin equivalent circuit being seen at each node in distribution grids. Thevenin's theorem offers a simplified representation of electrical networks, critical for the effective monitoring, control, and optimization of grid operations. However, real-time identification of Thevenin parameters, particularly impedance, poses significant challenges due to the dynamic nature of distribution grids. By integrating extremum seeking algorithms, which are adept at locating optima in dynamic systems without explicit model information, with the robustness of least squares estimation, we develop a novel methodology that continuously adapts to grid fluctuations. These fusion harnesses the strengths of both techniques: the extremum seeking method's non-model-based optimization capabilities and the least squares method's proficiency in estimating parameter value in a noisy environment. The result is a robust, adaptive algorithm capable of delivering reliable Thevenin parameter estimations in real-time. Our simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method, showcasing its potential as a tool for enhanced grid management and resilience.</description>

      <title>Enhancing sensor attack detection in supervisory control systems modeled by probabilistic automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sensor attacks compromise the reliability of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) by altering sensor outputs with the objective of leading the system to unsafe system states. This paper studies a probabilistic intrusion detection framework based on $\lambda$-sensor-attack detectability ($\lambda$-sa), a formal measure that evaluates the likelihood of a system being under attack based on observed behaviors. Our framework enhances detection by extending its capabilities to identify multiple sensor attack strategies using probabilistic information, which enables the detection of sensor attacks that were undetected by current detection methodologies. We develop a polynomial-time algorithm that verifies $\lambda$-sa detectability by constructing a weighted verifier automaton and solving the shortest path problem. Additionally, we propose a method to determine the maximum detection confidence level ($\lambda$*) achievable by the system, ensuring the highest probability of identifying attack-induced behaviors.</description>

      <title>Fast Finite-Time Sliding Mode Control for Chattering-Free Trajectory Tracking of Robotic Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving precise and efficient trajectory tracking in robotic arms remains a key challenge due to system uncertainties and chattering effects in conventional sliding mode control (SMC). This paper presents a chattering-free fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) strategy for a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm, designed to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness while ensuring finite-time convergence. The control framework is developed using Newton-Euler dynamics, followed by a state-space representation that captures the system's angular position and velocity. By incorporating an improved sliding surface and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FTSMC effectively mitigates chattering while preserving the advantages of SMC, such as fast response and strong disturbance rejection. The controller's performance is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with conventional PD sliding mode control (PDSMC) and terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior trajectory tracking performance, faster convergence, and enhanced stability compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for high-precision robotic applications.</description>

      <title>Engineering and Validating Cyber-Physical Energy Systems: Needs, Status Quo, and Research Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A driving force for the realization of a sustainable energy supply is the integration of renewable energy resources. Due to their stochastic generation behaviour, energy utilities are confronted with a more complex operation of the underlying power grids. Additionally, due to technology developments, controllable loads, integration with other energy sources, changing regulatory rules, and the market liberalization, the systems operation needs adaptation. Proper operational concepts and intelligent automation provide the basis to turn the existing power system into an intelligent entity, a cyber-physical energy system. The electric energy system is therefore moving from a single system to a system of systems. While reaping the benefits with new intelligent behaviors, it is expected that system-level developments, architectural concepts, advanced automation and control as well as the validation and testing will play a significantly larger role in realizing future solutions and technologies. The implementation and deployment of these complex systems of systems are associated with increasing engineering complexity resulting also in increased engineering costs. Proper engineering and validation approaches, concepts, and tools are partly missing until now. Therefore, this paper discusses and summarizes the main needs and requirements as well as the status quo in research and development related to the engineering and validation of cyber-physical energy systems. Also research trends and necessary future activities are outlined.</description>

      <title>On Space-Filling Input Design for Nonlinear Dynamic Model Learning: A Gaussian Process Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While optimal input design for linear systems has been well-established, no systematic approach exists for nonlinear systems, where robustness to extrapolation/interpolation errors is prioritized over minimizing estimated parameter variance. To address this issue, we develop a novel identification-oriented space-filling input design strategy for efficient covering of a well-defined region of interest. By placing a Gaussian Process (GP) prior on the joint input-state space, the proposed strategy leverages the GP posterior variance to construct a space-filling promoting input design cost function from the Bayesian point of view. This accordingly enables maximization of the coverage in the region of interest, thereby facilitating the generation of informative datasets. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that minimization of the cost function indicates the spacefilling behavior. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is demonstrated on both an academic example and a mass-spring-damper system, highlighting its potential practical impact on efficient exploration in identification scenarios for nonlinear dynamical systems</description>

      <title>Rotatable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communication System with Visual Recognition: A Prototype Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) is an emerging technology possessing great potential to exploit additional spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) by flexibly altering the three-dimensional (3D) orientation/boresight of each antenna. In this demonstration, we develop a prototype of RA-enabled wireless communication system with visual recognition module to evaluate the performance gains provided by the RA in practical environments. In particular, a mechanically-driven RA is developed by integrating a digital servo motor, a directional antenna, and a microcontroller, which enables the dynamic adjustment of the RA orientation. Moreover, the orientation adjustment of RA is guided by the target's direction provided by visual recognition module, thereby significantly enhancing system response speed and orientating accuracy. The experimental results demonstrate that the RA-enabled communication system achieves outstanding improvement in terms of communication coverage performance compared to conventional fixed antenna-based systems.</description>

      <title>Extremum Seeking Control for Antenna Pointing via Symmetric Product Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates extremum seeking control for a torque-controlled antenna pointing system without direct angular measurements. We consider a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) antenna system that receives an unknown signal from its environment, where the signal strength varies with the orientation of the antenna. It is assumed that only real-time measurements of the signal are available. We develop an extremum seeking control strategy that enables the antenna to autonomously adjust its direction to maximize the received signal strength based on the symmetric product approximation. Under suitable assumptions on the signal function, we prove local practical uniform asymptotic stability for the closed-loop system.</description>

      <title>Distributed Coordination for Heterogeneous Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To guarantee global coverage and ubiquitous connectivity, the Non-terrestrial Network (NTN) technology has been regarded as a key enabling technology in the Six Generation (6G) network, which consists of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), high-altitude platform (HAP), and satellite. It is noted that the unique characteristics of various NTN platforms directly impact the design and implementation of NTNs, which results in highly dynamic and heterogeneous networks. Even within the same tier, such as the space tier, the NTNs are developed based on different platforms including Low Earth Orbit (LEO), Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), and Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO). Therefore, distributed coordination among heterogeneous NTNs remains an important challenge. Although distributed learning framework finds a wide range of applications by leveraging rich distributed data and computation resources. The explicit and systematic analysis of the individual layers' challenges, and corresponding distributed coordination solutions in heterogeneous NTNs has not been proposed yet. In this article, we first summarize the unique characteristics of each NTN platform, and analyze the corresponding impact on the design and implementation of the NTN. We then identify the communication challenges of heterogeneous NTNs in individual layers, where the potential coordinated solutions are identified. We further illustrate the multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithms tailored for coordinated solutions in heterogeneous NTNs. Last but not least, we present a case study of the user scheduling optimization problem in heterogeneous UAVs-based cellular networks, where the multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) technique is developed to validate the effectiveness of distributed coordination in heterogeneous NTNs.</description>

      <title>Target Localization with a Coprime Multistatic MIMO Radar via Coupled Canonical Polyadic Decomposition Based on Joint EVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses target localization using a multistatic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system with coprime L-shaped receive arrays (CLsA). A target localization method is proposed by modeling the observed signals as tensors that admit a coupled canonical polyadic decomposition (C-CPD) model without matched filtering. It consists of a novel joint eigenvalue decomposition (J-EVD) based (semi-)algebraic algorithm, and a post-processing approach to determine the target locations by fusing the direction-of-arrival estimates extracted from J-EVD-based CCPD results. Particularly, by leveraging the rotational invariance of Vandermonde structure in CLsA, we convert the CCPD problem into a J-EVD problem, significantly reducing its computational complexity. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing tensor-based ones.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Detection in Smart Power Grids with Graph-Regularized MS-SVDD: a Multimodal Subspace Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address an anomaly detection problem in smart power grids using Multimodal Subspace Support Vector Data Description (MS-SVDD). This approach aims to leverage better feature relations by considering the data as coming from different modalities. These data are projected into a shared lower-dimensionality subspace which aims to preserve their inner characteristics. To supplement the previous work on this subject, we introduce novel multimodal graph-embedded regularizers that leverage graph information for every modality to enhance the training process, and we consider an improved training equation that allows us to maximize or minimize each modality according to the specified criteria. We apply this regularized graph-embedded model on a 3-modalities dataset after having generalized MS-SVDD algorithms to any number of modalities. To set up our application, we propose a whole preprocessing procedure to extract One-Class Classification training instances from time-bounded event time series that are used to evaluate both the reliability and earliness of our model for Event Detection.</description>

      <title>Qubit-Efficient Quantum Annealing for Stochastic Unit Commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic Unit Commitment (SUC) has been proposed to manage the uncertainties driven by the integration of renewable energy sources. When solved by Benders Decomposition (BD), the master problem becomes a binary integer programming which is NP-hard and computationally demanding for classical computational methods. Quantum Annealing (QA), known for efficiently solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, presents a potential solution. However, existing quantum algorithms rely on slack variables to handle linear binary inequality constraints, leading to increased qubit consumption and reduced computational efficiency. To solve the problem, this paper introduces the Powell-Hestenes-Rockafellar Augmented Lagrangian Multiplier (PHR-ALM) method to eliminate the need for slack variables so that the qubit consumption becomes independent of the increasing number of bender's cuts. To further reduce the qubit overhead, quantum ADMM is applied to break large-scale SUC into smaller blocks and enables a sequential solution. Consequently, the Quantum-based PHR-ADMM (QPHR-ADMM) can significantly reduce qubit requirements and enhancing the applicability of QA in SUC problem. The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed QPHR-ADMM algorithm, indicating its superior time efficiency over classical approaches for large scale QUBO problems under the D-Wave QPU showcases.</description>

      <title>Space-O-RAN: Enabling Intelligent, Open, and Interoperable Non Terrestrial Networks in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are essential for ubiquitous connectivity, providing coverage in remote and underserved areas. However, since NTNs are currently operated independently, they face challenges such as isolation, limited scalability, and high operational costs. Integrating satellite constellations with terrestrial networks offers a way to address these limitations while enabling adaptive and cost-efficient connectivity through the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models.
  This paper introduces Space-O-RAN, a framework that extends Open Radio Access Network (RAN) principles to NTNs. It employs hierarchical closed-loop control with distributed Space RAN Intelligent Controllers (Space-RICs) to dynamically manage and optimize operations across both domains.
  To enable adaptive resource allocation and network orchestration, the proposed architecture integrates real-time satellite optimization and control with AI-driven management and digital twin (DT) modeling. It incorporates distributed Space Applications (sApps) and dApps to ensure robust performance in in highly dynamic orbital environments. A core feature is dynamic link-interface mapping, which allows network functions to adapt to specific application requirements and changing link conditions using all physical links on the satellite.
  Simulation results evaluate its feasibility by analyzing latency constraints across different NTN link types, demonstrating that intra-cluster coordination operates within viable signaling delay bounds, while offloading non-real-time tasks to ground infrastructure enhances scalability toward sixth-generation (6G) networks.</description>

      <title>A convex variational principle for the necessary conditions of classical optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A scheme for generating a family of convex variational principles is developed, the Euler- Lagrange equations of each member of the family formally corresponding to the necessary conditions of optimal control of a given system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) in a well-defined sense. The scheme is applied to the Quadratic-Quadratic Regulator problem for which an explicit form of the functional is derived, and existence of minimizers of the variational principle is rigorously shown. It is shown that the Linear-Quadratic Regulator problem with time-dependent forcing can be solved within the formalism without requiring any nonlinear considerations, in contrast to the use of a Riccati system in the classical methodology.
  Our work demonstrates a pathway for solving nonlinear control problems via convex optimization.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides, for the first time, analytical expressions for the Long-Range (LoRa) waveform and cross-correlation in both continuous and discrete time domains under the Doppler effect in satellite communication. We propose the concept and formulas of the shared visibility window for satellites toward two ground devices. Our analysis covers cross-correlation results with varying spreading factors (SF) for no-Doppler and with-Doppler cases. We find the maximum cross-correlation with different SFs and the mean cross-correlation are immune to the Doppler effect. However, the maximum cross-correlation with the same SFs is only immune to high Doppler shift, with its value fluctuating between 0.6 and 1 under high Doppler rate. We interpret this fluctuation by introducing the relationship between transmission start time and cross-correlation. We provide a parameter analysis for orbit height, ground device distance, and inclination angle. Additionally, we analyze the bit error rate (BER) for LoRa signals and observe worse performance under high Doppler shift or interference with same SF. Increasing the SNR or the SIR improves the BER only when Doppler effect is below a frequency threshold. Notably, under Doppler effect, the performance behaviors of BER no longer align with those of maximum cross-correlation. Finally, our results lead to two recommendations: 1) To mitigate Doppler impact on cross-correlation, we recommend utilizing low SFs, high orbit height, short ground device distance, and the transmission start time with high Doppler shift; 2) To mitigate Doppler impact on BER, we recommend employing low SFs, high bandwidth, and transmission start time with high Doppler rate. These conflicting recommendations regarding transmission start time highlight the necessity of Doppler shift compensation techniques to help operate LoRa in space properly.</description>

      <title>Optimization-free Smooth Control Barrier Function for Polygonal Collision Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polygonal collision avoidance (PCA) is short for the problem of collision avoidance between two polygons (i.e., polytopes in planar) that own their dynamic equations. This problem suffers the inherent difficulty in dealing with non-smooth boundaries and recently optimization-defined metrics, such as signed distance field (SDF) and its variants, have been proposed as control barrier functions (CBFs) to tackle PCA problems. In contrast, we propose an optimization-free smooth CBF method in this paper, which is computationally efficient and proved to be nonconservative. It is achieved by three main steps: a lower bound of SDF is expressed as a nested Boolean logic composition first, then its smooth approximation is established by applying the latest log-sum-exp method, after which a specified CBF-based safety filter is proposed to address this class of problems. To illustrate its wide applications, the optimization-free smooth CBF method is extended to solve distributed collision avoidance of two underactuated nonholonomic vehicles and drive an underactuated container crane to avoid a moving obstacle respectively, for which numerical simulations are also performed.</description>

      <title>Facilitating Emergency Vehicle Passage in Congested Urban Areas Using Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergency Response Time (ERT) is crucial for urban safety, measuring cities' ability to handle medical, fire, and crime emergencies. In NYC, medical ERT increased 72% from 7.89 minutes in 2014 to 14.27 minutes in 2024, with half of delays due to Emergency Vehicle (EMV) travel times. Each minute's delay in stroke response costs 2 million brain cells, while cardiac arrest survival drops 7-10% per minute.
  This dissertation advances EMV facilitation through three contributions. First, EMVLight, a decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, integrates EMV routing with traffic signal pre-emption. It achieved 42.6% faster EMV travel times and 23.5% improvement for other vehicles.
  Second, the Dynamic Queue-Jump Lane system uses Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization for coordinated lane-clearing in mixed autonomous and human-driven traffic, reducing EMV travel times by 40%.
  Third, an equity study of NYC Emergency Medical Services revealed disparities across boroughs: Staten Island faces delays due to sparse signalized intersections, while Manhattan struggles with congestion. Solutions include optimized EMS stations and improved intersection designs.
  These contributions enhance EMV mobility and emergency service equity, offering insights for policymakers and urban planners to develop safer, more efficient transportation systems.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Process Regression for Improved Underwater Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate underwater navigation is a challenging task due to the absence of global navigation satellite system signals and the reliance on inertial navigation systems that suffer from drift over time. Doppler velocity logs (DVLs) are typically used to mitigate this drift through velocity measurements, which are commonly estimated using a parameter estimation approach such as least squares (LS). However, LS works under the assumption of ideal conditions and does not account for sensor biases, leading to suboptimal performance. This paper proposes a data-driven alternative based on multi-output Gaussian process regression (MOGPR) to improve DVL velocity estimation. MOGPR provides velocity estimates and associated measurement covariances, enabling an adaptive integration within an error-state Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). We evaluate our proposed approach using real-world AUV data and compare it against LS and a state-of-the-art deep learning model, BeamsNet. Results demonstrate that MOGPR reduces velocity estimation errors by approximately 20% while simultaneously enhancing overall navigation accuracy, particularly in the orientation states. Additionally, the incorporation of uncertainty estimates from MOGPR enables an adaptive EKF framework, improving navigation robustness in dynamic underwater environments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Coordination and Synchronization of Multi-Robot Systems Under Recurring Linear Temporal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider multi-robot systems under recurring tasks formalized as linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications. To solve the planning problem efficiently, we propose a bottom-up approach combining offline plan synthesis with online coordination, dynamically adjusting plans via real-time communication. To address action delays, we introduce a synchronization mechanism ensuring coordinated task execution, leading to a multi-agent coordination and synchronization framework that is adaptable to a wide range of multi-robot applications. The software package is developed in Python and ROS2 for broad deployment. We validate our findings through lab experiments involving nine robots showing enhanced adaptability compared to previous methods. Additionally, we conduct simulations with up to ninety agents to demonstrate the reduced computational complexity and the scalability features of our work.</description>

      <title>Continuous Wrist Control on the Hannes Prosthesis: a Vision-based Shared Autonomy Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most control techniques for prosthetic grasping focus on dexterous fingers control, but overlook the wrist motion. This forces the user to perform compensatory movements with the elbow, shoulder and hip to adapt the wrist for grasping. We propose a computer vision-based system that leverages the collaboration between the user and an automatic system in a shared autonomy framework, to perform continuous control of the wrist degrees of freedom in a prosthetic arm, promoting a more natural approach-to-grasp motion. Our pipeline allows to seamlessly control the prosthetic wrist to follow the target object and finally orient it for grasping according to the user intent. We assess the effectiveness of each system component through quantitative analysis and finally deploy our method on the Hannes prosthetic arm.

      <title>Inverse Kinematics on Guiding Vector Fields for Robot Path Following</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse kinematics is a fundamental technique for motion and positioning control in robotics, typically applied to end-effectors. In this paper, we extend the concept of inverse kinematics to guiding vector fields for path following in autonomous mobile robots. The desired path is defined by its implicit equation, i.e., by a collection of points belonging to one or more zero-level sets. These level sets serve as a reference to construct an error signal that drives the guiding vector field toward the desired path, enabling the robot to converge and travel along the path by following such a vector field. We start with the formal exposition on how inverse kinematics can be applied to guiding vector fields for single-integrator robots in an m-dimensional Euclidean space. Then, we leverage inverse kinematics to ensure that the level-set error signal behaves as a linear system, facilitating control over the robot's transient motion toward the desired path and allowing for the injection of feed-forward signals to induce precise motion behavior along the path. We then propose solutions to the theoretical and practical challenges of applying this technique to unicycles with constant speeds to follow 2D paths with precise transient control. We finish by validating the predicted theoretical results through real flights with fixed-wing drones.</description>

      <title>Experimental validation of UAV search and detection system in real wilderness environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Search and rescue (SAR) missions require reliable search methods to locate survivors, especially in challenging or inaccessible environments. This is why introducing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be of great help to enhance the efficiency of SAR missions while simultaneously increasing the safety of everyone involved in the mission. Motivated by this, we design and experiment with autonomous UAV search for humans in a Mediterranean karst environment. The UAVs are directed using Heat equation-driven area coverage (HEDAC) ergodic control method according to known probability density and detection function. The implemented sensing framework consists of a probabilistic search model, motion control system, and computer vision object detection. It enables calculation of the probability of the target being detected in the SAR mission, and this paper focuses on experimental validation of proposed probabilistic framework and UAV control. The uniform probability density to ensure the even probability of finding the targets in the desired search area is achieved by assigning suitably thought-out tasks to 78 volunteers. The detection model is based on YOLO and trained with a previously collected ortho-photo image database. The experimental search is carefully planned and conducted, while as many parameters as possible are recorded. The thorough analysis consists of the motion control system, object detection, and the search validation. The assessment of the detection and search performance provides strong indication that the designed detection model in the UAV control algorithm is aligned with real-world results.</description>

Abstract: Convergence analysis of Nesterov's accelerated gradient method has attracted significant attention over the past decades. While extensive work has explored its theoretical properties and elucidated the intuition behind its acceleration, a simple and direct proof of its convergence rates is still lacking. We provide a concise Lyapunov analysis of the convergence rates of Nesterov's accelerated gradient method for both general convex and strongly convex functions.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Battery Energy Storage System to Provide Virtual Transmission Service</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An immediate need in the transmission system is to find alternative solutions that improve system operation and defer the need for new transmission lines. This study comprehensively evaluates the performance and economic benefits of short-term operation of using battery energy storage systems (BESS) as virtual transmission (VT) to promote power transfer across distant regions. Specifically, this work implements various day-ahead energy scheduling models to analyze the impact of VT on system operation cost, network congestion, model computational time, and market performance. The performance of VT is compared with three alternative network congestion mitigation methods, including building new high-voltage physical transmission lines, cost-driven battery energy storage systems, and network reconfiguration, as well as combinations of two of the aforementioned methods. The benchmark dayahead scheduling model is a traditional security-constrained unit commitment model without system upgrades or other network congestion mitigation. Numerical simulations conducted on the IEEE 24-bus system demonstrate that VT provides a 14% operational cost reduction and 34% congested line relief compared to the base case. Compared to other examined schemes, VT is the only one comparable to physical transmission lines that can provide satisfying congestion relief and operation cost reduction without significantly sacrificing computing time and load payment.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces two sample-based formulations of incremental input/output-to-state stability (i-IOSS), a suitable detectability notion for general nonlinear systems. In this work we consider the case of limited output information, i.e., measurements are only infrequently and/or irregularly available. The output-dependent term of the sample-based i-IOSS bound is properly modified to yield a characterization for detectability in presence of incomplete output sequences. We provide both a non-timediscounted and a time-discounted formulation of samplebased i-IOSS. Furthermore, conditions for an i-IOSS system to be also sample-based i-IOSS are given and the relation between the two formulations of sample-based i-IOSS is shown.</description>

      <title>CL-DiffPhyCon: Closed-loop Diffusion Control of Complex Physical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control problems of complex physical systems have broad applications in science and engineering. Previous studies have shown that generative control methods based on diffusion models offer significant advantages for solving these problems. However, existing generative control approaches face challenges in both performance and efficiency when extended to the closed-loop setting, which is essential for effective control. In this paper, we propose an efficient Closed-Loop Diffusion method for Physical systems Control (CL-DiffPhyCon). By employing an asynchronous denoising framework for different physical time steps, CL-DiffPhyCon generates control signals conditioned on real-time feedback from the system with significantly reduced computational cost during sampling. Additionally, the control process could be further accelerated by incorporating fast sampling techniques, such as DDIM. We evaluate CL-DiffPhyCon on two tasks: 1D Burgers' equation control and 2D incompressible fluid control. The results demonstrate that CL-DiffPhyCon achieves superior control performance with significant improvements in sampling efficiency. The code can be found at https://github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/CL_DiffPhyCon.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Construction of Finite Abstractions for Interconnected Systems: A Compositional Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finite-state abstractions (a.k.a. symbolic models) present a promising avenue for the formal verification and synthesis of controllers in continuous-space control systems. These abstractions provide simplified models that capture the fundamental behaviors of the original systems. However, the creation of such abstractions typically relies on the availability of precise knowledge concerning system dynamics, which might not be available in many real-world applications. In this work, we introduce a novel data-driven and compositional approach for constructing finite abstractions for interconnected systems comprised of discrete-time control subsystems with partially unknown dynamics. These subsystems interact through a partially unknown static interconnection map. Our methodology for abstracting the interconnected system involves constructing abstractions for individual subsystems and incorporating an abstraction of the interconnection map.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05948v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Analog to digital converters (ADCs) are a major contributor to the power consumption of multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) receivers in large bandwidth millimeter-wave systems. Prior works have considered two mitigating solutions to reduce the ADC power consumption: i) decreasing the number of ADCs via analog and hybrid beamforming, and ii) decreasing the ADC resolution, i.e., utilizing one-bit and few-bit ADCs. These mitigating solutions lead to performance loss in terms of achievable rates due to increased quantization error. In this work, the use of nonlinear analog operators such as envelope detectors and polynomial operators, prior to sampling and quantization is considered, as a way to reduce the aforementioned rate-loss. The receiver architecture consists of linear combiners, nonlinear analog operators, and few-bit ADCs. The fundamental performance limits of the resulting communication system, in terms of achievable rates, are investigated under various assumptions on the set of implementable analog operators. Extensive numerical evaluations are provided to evaluate the set of achievable rates and the power consumption of the proposed receiver architectures. Circuit simulations and measurement results, based on both 22 nm FDSOI CMOS technology and 65 nm Bulk CMOS transistor technologies, are provided to justify the power efficiency of the proposed receiver architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06239v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we extend the hybridization framework for the Hodge Laplacian [Awanou et al., Hybridization and postprocessing in finite element exterior calculus, 2023] to port-Hamiltonian systems describing linear wave propagation phenomena. To this aim, a dual field mixed Galerkin discretization is introduced, in which one variable is approximated via conforming finite element spaces, whereas the second is completely local. This scheme is equivalent to the second order mixed Galerkin formulation and retains a discrete power balance and discrete conservation laws. The mixed formulation is also equivalent to the hybrid formulation. The hybrid system can be efficiently solved using a static condensation procedure in discrete time. The size reduction achieved thanks to the hybridization is greater than the one obtained for the Hodge Laplacian as one field is completely discarded. Numerical experiments on the 3D wave and Maxwell equations show the convergence of the method and the size reduction achieved by the hybridization.</description>

      <title>LQG Information Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses information design in a workhorse model of network games, where agents have linear best responses, the information designer optimizes a quadratic objective, and the payoff state follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We formulate the problem as semidefinite programming (SDP) and utilize the duality principle to characterize an optimal information structure. A Gaussian information structure is shown to be optimal among all information structures. A necessary and sufficient condition for optimality is that the induced equilibrium strategy profile and the state jointly satisfy a linear constraint derived from complementary slackness conditions. Consequently, the true state is typically revealed to the entire population of agents, even though individual agents remain only partially informed. In symmetric network games, an optimal information structure inherits the same degree of symmetry, which facilitates its computation.</description>

      <title>$\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$: Trajectory Optimization with Uniform Error Guarantees under Path Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13681v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a new transcription, change point localization, and mesh refinement scheme for direct optimization-based solutions and for uniform approximation of optimal control trajectories associated with a class of nonlinear constrained optimal control problems (OCPs). The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a direct multiple shooting technique -- $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties, along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy. We also announce, and make freely available, a new software package based on $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ along with all its functionalities for completeness. The package is available at: https://github.com/chatterjee-d/QuITOv2.git.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Advanced Longitudinal Control and Collision Avoidance in High-Risk Driving Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19087v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing Advanced Driver Assistance Systems primarily focus on the vehicle directly ahead, often overlooking potential risks from following vehicles. This oversight can lead to ineffective handling of high risk situations, such as high speed, closely spaced, multi vehicle scenarios where emergency braking by one vehicle might trigger a pile up collision. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces a novel deep reinforcement learning based algorithm for longitudinal control and collision avoidance. This proposed algorithm effectively considers the behavior of both leading and following vehicles. Its implementation in simulated high risk scenarios, which involve emergency braking in dense traffic where traditional systems typically fail, has demonstrated the algorithm ability to prevent potential pile up collisions, including those involving heavy duty vehicles.</description>

      <title>Policy Verification in Stochastic Dynamical Systems Using Logarithmic Neural Certificates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00826v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the verification of neural network policies for discrete-time stochastic systems with respect to reach-avoid specifications. We use a learner-verifier procedure that learns a certificate for the specification, represented as a neural network. Verifying that this neural network certificate is a so-called reach-avoid supermartingale (RASM) proves the satisfaction of a reach-avoid specification. Existing approaches for such a verification task rely on computed Lipschitz constants of neural networks. These approaches struggle with large Lipschitz constants, especially for reach-avoid specifications with high threshold probabilities. We present two key contributions to obtain smaller Lipschitz constants than existing approaches. First, we introduce logarithmic RASMs (logRASMs), which take exponentially smaller values than RASMs and hence have lower theoretical Lipschitz constants. Second, we present a fast method to compute tighter upper bounds on Lipschitz constants based on weighted norms. Our empirical evaluation shows we can consistently verify the satisfaction of reach-avoid specifications with probabilities as high as 99.9999%.</description>

      <title>On Stability in Optimistic Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solutions of bilevel optimization problems tend to suffer from instability under changes to problem data. In the optimistic setting, we construct a lifted formulation that exhibits desirable stability properties under mild assumptions that neither invoke convexity nor smoothness. The upper- and lower-level problems might involve integer restrictions and disjunctive constraints. In a range of results, we invoke at most pointwise and local calmness for the lower-level problem in a sense that holds broadly. The lifted formulation is computationally attractive with structural properties being brought out and an outer approximation algorithm becoming available.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multi-agent Navigation with Lightweight DRL Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present an end-to-end collision avoidance policy based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for multi-agent systems, demonstrating encouraging outcomes in real-world applications. In particular, our policy calculates the control commands of the agent based on the raw LiDAR observation. In addition, the number of parameters of the proposed basic model is 140,000, and the size of the parameter file is 3.5 MB, which allows the robot to calculate the actions from the CPU alone. We propose a multi-agent training platform based on a physics-based simulator to further bridge the gap between simulation and the real world. The policy is trained on a policy-gradients-based RL algorithm in a dense and messy training environment. A novel reward function is introduced to address the issue of agents choosing suboptimal actions in some common scenarios. Although the data used for training is exclusively from the simulation platform, the policy can be successfully transferred and deployed in real-world robots. Finally, our policy effectively responds to intentional obstructions and avoids collisions.

      <title>Towards Wireless-Native Big AI Model: Insights into Its Ambitions, Peculiarities and Methodologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Researches on leveraging big artificial intelligence model (BAIM) technology to drive the intelligent evolution of wireless networks are emerging. However, since the breakthrough in generalization brought about by BAIM techniques mainly occurs in natural language processing, there is still a lack of a clear technical roadmap on how to efficiently apply BAIM techniques to wireless systems with many additional peculiarities. To this end, this paper first reviews recent research works on BAIM for wireless and assesses the current research situation. Then, this paper analyzes and compares the differences between language intelligence and wireless intelligence on multiple levels, including scientific foundations, core usages, and technical details. It highlights the necessity and scientific significance of developing BAIM technology in a wireless-native way, as well as new issues that need to be considered in specific technical implementation. Finally, by synthesizing the evolutionary laws of language models with the particularities of wireless system, this paper provides several instructive methodologies for how to develop wireless-native BAIM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in learning-based control have increased interest in stable inversion to meet growing performance demands. Here, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for stable inversion, addressing challenges in non-minimum phase, non-square, and singular systems. An H-Infinity based algebraic approximation is introduced for near-perfect tracking without preview. Additionally, we propose a novel robust control strategy combining the nominal model with dual feedforward control to form a feedback structure. Numerical comparison demonstrates the approach's effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Dense Fixed-Wing Swarming using Receding-Horizon NMPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an approach for controlling a team of agile fixed-wing aerial vehicles in close proximity to one another. Our approach relies on receding-horizon nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to plan maneuvers across an expanded flight envelope to enable inter-agent collision avoidance. To facilitate robust collision avoidance and characterize the likelihood of inter-agent collisions, we compute a statistical bound on the probability of the system leaving a tube around the planned nominal trajectory. Finally, we propose a metric for evaluating highly dynamic swarms and use this metric to evaluate our approach. We successfully demonstrated our approach through both simulation and hardware experiments, and to our knowledge, this the first time close-quarters swarming has been achieved with physical aerobatic fixed-wing vehicles.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Design of LQG Controllers in Quantum Coherent Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08170v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a differential evolution (DE) algorithm specifically tailored for the design of Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) controllers in quantum systems. Building upon the foundational DE framework, the algorithm incorporates specialized modules, including relaxed feasibility rules, a scheduled penalty function, adaptive search range adjustment, and the ``bet-and-run'' initialization strategy. These enhancements improve the algorithm's exploration and exploitation capabilities while addressing the unique physical realizability requirements of quantum systems. The proposed method is applied to a quantum optical system, where three distinct controllers with varying configurations relative to the plant are designed. The resulting controllers demonstrate superior performance, achieving lower LQG performance indices compared to existing approaches. Additionally, the algorithm ensures that the designs comply with physical realizability constraints, guaranteeing compatibility with practical quantum platforms. The proposed approach holds significant potential for application to other linear quantum systems in performance optimization tasks subject to physically feasible constraints.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Rolling Horizon Optimization for Network-Constrained V2X Value Stacking of Electric Vehicles Under Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) coordination can provide significant benefits through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) by interacting with the grid, buildings, and other EVs. This work aims to develop a V2X value-stacking framework, including vehicle-to-building (V2B), vehicle-to-grid (V2G), and energy trading, to maximize economic benefits for residential communities while maintaining distribution voltage. This work also seeks to quantify the impact of prediction errors related to building load, renewable energy, and EV arrivals. A dynamic rolling-horizon optimization (RHO) method is employed to leverage multiple revenue streams and maximize the potential of EV coordination. To address energy uncertainties, including hourly local building load, local photovoltaic (PV) generation, and EV arrivals, this work develops a Transformer-based forecasting model named Gated Recurrent Units-Encoder-Temporal Fusion Decoder (GRU-EN-TFD). The simulation results, using real data from Australia's National Electricity Market, and the Independent System Operators in New England and New York in the US, reveal that V2X value stacking can significantly reduce energy costs. The proposed GRU-EN-TFD model outperforms the benchmark forecast model. Uncertainties in EV arrivals have a more substantial impact on value-stacking performance, highlighting the significance of its accurate forecast. This work provides new insights into the dynamic interactions among residential communities, unlocking the full potential of EV batteries.</description>

      <title>A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Safe and Optimal Control of Autonomous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As autonomous systems become more ubiquitous in daily life, ensuring high performance with guaranteed safety is crucial. However, safety and performance could be competing objectives, which makes their co-optimization difficult. Learning-based methods, such as Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL), achieve strong performance but lack formal safety guarantees due to safety being enforced as soft constraints, limiting their use in safety-critical settings. Conversely, formal methods such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability Analysis and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety assurances but often neglect performance, resulting in overly conservative controllers. To bridge this gap, we formulate the co-optimization of safety and performance as a state-constrained optimal control problem, where performance objectives are encoded via a cost function and safety requirements are imposed as state constraints. We demonstrate that the resultant value function satisfies a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which we approximate efficiently using a novel physics-informed machine learning framework. In addition, we introduce a conformal prediction-based verification strategy to quantify the learning errors, recovering a high-confidence safety value function, along with a probabilistic error bound on performance degradation. Through several case studies, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework in enabling scalable learning of safe and performant controllers for complex, high-dimensional autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>A Supervised Machine-Learning Approach For Turboshaft Engine Dynamic Modeling Under Real Flight Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotorcraft engines are highly complex, nonlinear thermodynamic systems that operate under varying environmental and flight conditions. Simulating their dynamics is crucial for design, fault diagnostics, and deterioration control phases, and requires robust and reliable control systems to estimate engine performance throughout flight envelope. However, the development of detailed physical models of the engine based on numerical simulations is a very challenging task due to the complex and entangled physics driving the engine. In this scenario, data-driven machine-learning techniques are of great interest to the aircraft engine community, due to their ability to describe nonlinear systems' dynamic behavior and enable online performance estimation, achieving excellent results with accuracy competitive with the state of the art. In this work, we explore different Neural Network architectures to model the turboshaft engine of Leonardo's AW189P4 prototype, aiming to predict the engine torque. The models are trained on an extensive database of real flight tests featuring a variety of operational maneuvers performed under different flight conditions, providing a comprehensive representation of the engine's performance. To complement the neural network approach, we apply Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to derive a low-dimensional dynamical model from the available data, describing the relationship between fuel flow and engine torque. The resulting model showcases SINDy's capability to recover the actual physics underlying the engine dynamics and demonstrates its potential for investigating more complex aspects of the engine. The results prove that data-driven engine models can exploit a wider range of parameters than standard transfer function-based approaches, enabling the use of trained schemes to simulate nonlinear effects in different engines and helicopters.</description>

      <title>TAG: A Decentralized Framework for Multi-Agent Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical organization is fundamental to biological systems and human societies, yet artificial intelligence systems often rely on monolithic architectures that limit adaptability and scalability. Current hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) approaches typically restrict hierarchies to two levels or require centralized training, which limits their practical applicability. We introduce TAME Agent Framework (TAG), a framework for constructing fully decentralized hierarchical multi-agent systems.TAG enables hierarchies of arbitrary depth through a novel LevelEnv concept, which abstracts each hierarchy level as the environment for the agents above it. This approach standardizes information flow between levels while preserving loose coupling, allowing for seamless integration of diverse agent types. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TAG by implementing hierarchical architectures that combine different RL agents across multiple levels, achieving improved performance over classical multi-agent RL baselines on standard benchmarks. Our results show that decentralized hierarchical organization enhances both learning speed and final performance, positioning TAG as a promising direction for scalable multi-agent systems.</description>
