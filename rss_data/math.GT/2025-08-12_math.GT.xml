      <title>Geometric models and asymptotic dimension for infinite-type surface mapping class groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $S$ be an infinite-type surface and let $G \leq \operatorname{Map}(S)$ be a locally bounded Polish subgroup. We construct a metric graph $M$ of simple arcs and curves on $S$ preserved by the action of $G$ and for which the vertex orbit map $G \to V(M)$ is a coarse equivalence; if $G$ is boundedly generated, then $M$ is a Cayley--Abels--Rosendal graph for $G$ and the orbit map is a quasi-isometry. In particular, if $S$ contains a non-displaceable subsurface and $G \geq \operatorname{PMap}_c(S)$ is boundedly generated or $G \in \{\overline{\operatorname{PMap}_c(S)}, \operatorname{PMap}(S), \operatorname{Map}(S) \}$ and is locally bounded, then $\operatorname{asdim} M = \operatorname{asdim} G = \infty$. This result completes the classification of the asymptotic dimension of stable boundedly generated infinite-type surface mapping class groups begun by Grant--Rafi--Verberne.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of highly twisted plat diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that if a knot or link has a sufficiently complicated plat projection, then that plat projection is unique. More precisely, if a knot or link has a $2m$-plat projection, where $m$ is at least four, and height at least two, and each twist region of the plat contains at least four crossings, then such a projection is unique up to obvious rotations. In particular, this projection gives a canonical form for such knots and links, and thus provides a classification of these links.</description>

      <title>Homotopy classification of $4$-manifolds with $3$-manifold fundamental group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a criterion on a group $\pi$ and a homomorphism $w \colon \pi \to C_2$ under which closed $4$-manifolds with fundamental group $\pi$ and orientation character $w$ are classified up to homotopy equivalence by their quadratic $2$-types. We verify the criterion for a large class of $3$-manifold groups and orientation characters, in particular for the fundamental group $\pi$ of any closed, orientable $3$-manifold whose finite subgroups are cyclic, provided $w$ vanishes on every element of $\pi$ of finite order. We deduce a homeomorphism classification of closed, orientable $4$-manifolds with infinite dihedral fundamental group $\mathbb{Z}/2 * \mathbb{Z}/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A concept of a rectangular diagram of a foliation in the three-sphere is introduced. It is shown that any co-orientable finite depth foliation in the complement of a link admits a presentation by a rectangular diagram compatible with the given rectangular diagram of the link.</description>

      <title>Knot primality: knot Floer homology, metacyclic representations and twisted homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop purely algebraic methods for proving that a knot is prime. Our approach uses the Heegaard Floer polynomial in conjunction with classical knot-theoretic methods: cyclic, dihedral, and metacyclic covering spaces. The theory of twisted homology allows us to view these approaches from a unified perspective. Collectively, the primality tests developed here have proved primality for over 99.6% of knots in large families of prime knots, including all prime knots with 15 or fewer crossings.</description>

      <title>On distributional one-category, diagonal distributional complexity, and related invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of probabilistic variants of the one-category and diagonal topological complexity, which bound the classical LS-category and topological complexity from below. Unlike any other classical or probabilistic invariants, these invariants are rigid on spaces with finite fundamental group. On Eilenberg-Mac Lane spaces, we identify these new invariants with distributional category and complexity, respectively, and use them to illuminate aspects of the behavior of the latter invariants on aspherical spaces and products of spaces. We also study their properties on covering maps, $\pi_1$-isomorphisms, $H$-spaces, and closed essential manifolds, and consequently, obtain the first examples of closed manifolds beyond the real projective spaces on which the distributional theory disagrees with the classical one.</description>

      <title>Wall-crossing formulas via spectral networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a self-contained proof of the Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formula entirely in the scope of quadratic differentials without relying on input from DT theory. Our approach is based on path-lifting rules for spectral networks introduced by Gaiotto, Moore and Neitzke. We provide a framework to justify the convergence of the path liftings, including the cases with spiral domains. In particular, we define path lifting rules for spectral networks associated to holomorphic quadratic differentials. As an intermediate step in the proof of the wall-crossing formula, we show that upon extending the path lifting rules to $\mathcal{A}_0$-laminations we generate the hat-homology lattice.</description>

      <title>Counting Salem numbers arising from arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between Salem numbers and short geodesics has been fruitful in quantitative studies of arithmetic hyperbolic orbifolds, particularly in dimensions 2 and 3. In this article, we push these connections even further. The primary goals are: (1) to bound the proportion of Salem numbers of degree up to $n+1$ in the commensurability class of classical arithmetic lattices in any odd dimension $n$; (2) to improve lower bounds for the strong exponential growth of averages of multiplicities in the geodesic length spectrum of non-compact arithmetic orbifolds. In order to accomplish these goals, we bound, for a fixed square-free integer $D$, the count of Salem numbers with minimal polynomial $f$ satisfying $f(1)f(-1)=-D$ in $\mathbb{Q}^{\times}/\mathbb{Q}^{\times 2}$. To do this, we make use of results on the distribution of Salem numbers, as well as classical methods for counting Pythagorean triples and Gauss' lattice-counting argument. To this end, we give a generalization of the count of Pythagorean triples and provide an elementary proof which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Iso-length-spectral Hyperbolic Surface Amalgams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two negatively curved metric spaces are iso-length-spectral if they have the same multisets of lengths of closed geodesics. A well-known paper by Sunada provides a systematic way of constructing iso-length-spectral surfaces that are not isometric. In this paper, we construct examples of iso-length-spectral surface amalgams that are not isometric, generalizing Buser's combinatorial construction of Sunada's surfaces. We find both homeomorphic and non-homeomorphic pairs. Finally, we construct a noncommensurable pair with the same weak length spectrum, the length set without multiplicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23507v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the structure of associated groups of symmetric quandles. Among other results, we explore the relationship between the associated group of a symmetric quandle and that of its underlying quandle. We provide a group-theoretic characterization of associated groups of symmetric quandles. Furthermore, we show that a symmetric quandle is embeddable if and only if its underlying quandle is embeddable, and we determine the abelianization of these associated groups.</description>

      <title>Sandwiched singularities and nearly Lefschetz fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Milnor fibers and symplectic fillings of links of sandwiched singularities, with the goal of contrasting their algebro-geometric deformation theory and symplectic topology. In the algebro-geometric setting, smoothings of sandwiched singularities are described by de Jong--van Straten's theory: all Milnor fibers are generated from deformations of a singular plane curve germ associated to the surface singularity. We develop an analog of this theory in the symplectic setting, showing that all minimal symplectic fillings of the links are generated by certain immersed disk arrangements resembling de Jong--van Straten's picture deformations. This paper continues our previous work for a special subclass of singularities; the general case has additional difficulties and new features. The key new ingredient in the present paper is given by spinal open books and nearly Lefschetz fibrations: we use recent work of Roy--Min--Wang to understand symplectic fillings and encode them via multisections of certain Lefschetz fibrations. As an application, we discuss arrangements that generate unexpected Stein fillings that are different from all Milnor fibers, showing that the links of a large class of sandwiched singularities admit unexpected fillings.</description>

      <title>The bridge index and the braid index for twist positive knots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23252v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general, the bridge index of a knot is less than or equal to its braid index. A natural question is when these two values coincide. Motivated by a conjecture of Krishna and Morton, we prove that the bridge index and the braid index coincide for all twist positive knots, using the knot Floer torsion order. Here, a twist positive knot is a knot that admits a positive braid representative containing at least one full twist.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the extremal stratification of an Alexandrov space introduced by Perelman-Petrunin is a CS stratification in the sense of Siebenmann. We also show that every space of directions of an Alexandrov space without proper extremal subsets is homeomorphic to a sphere. In the polyhedral case, the same holds for every iterated space of directions.</description>
