      <title>Universal Frequency Correlations and Recurrence Statistics of Complex Impedance Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear electromagnetic wave scattering systems can be characterized by an impedance matrix that relates the voltages and currents at the ports of the system. When the system size becomes greater than the wavelength of the fields involved, the impedance matrix becomes a complicated function of the details of the system, in which case a statistical model, such as the Random Coupling Model (RCM) becomes useful. The statistics of the elements of the RCM impedance matrix depend on the excitation frequency, the spectral density of the modes of the enclosed system volume, the average loss factor (Q^{-1}) of the system, and the properties of the coupling ports as given by their radiation impedances. In this paper, properties of the elements of impedance matrices are explored numerically and experimentally. These include the two point frequency correlation functions for the complex impedance of elements and the expected difference in frequencies between which impedance values are approximately repeated. Universal scaling arguments are then given for these quantities, hence these results are generic for all sufficiently complicated scattering systems, including acoustic and optical systems. The experimental data presented in this paper come from microwave graphs, billiards, and three-dimensional cavities with embedded tunable perturbers such as metasurfaces. The data is found to be in generally good agreement with the predictions for the two point frequency correlations and the frequency interval for successive repetitions of impedance matrix elements values.</description>

      <title>Universality and Invariance in Hegselmann-Krause Opinion Dynamics: Proof of Three Conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three conjectures from [R. Hegselmann, The Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulations 26(4), 11 (2023)] about the Hegselmann-Krause opinion dynamics and the structure of $\epsilon$-switches are proved. The first conjecture states that the number of $\epsilon$-switches for any given initial opinion distribution is always finite, guaranteeing that the algorithm for enumerating them terminates. The second conjecture concerns the relationship between the dynamics of two consecutive $\epsilon$-switches, showing that the opinion evolution is identical up to the switch time. The third conjecture establishes the invariance of the dynamics under positive-affine transformations of the initial distribution, with a corresponding rescaling of all $\epsilon$-switch values. Together, these results provide a formal foundation for the empirical observations reported in the literature and offer a step towards a systematic classification of BC-processes based on their initial conditions.</description>
