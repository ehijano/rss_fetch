      <title>MathPartner: An Artificial Intelligence Cloud Service</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a broad sense, artificial intelligence is a service to find a solution to complex intellectual problems. In this sense, the MathPartner service provides artificial intelligence that allows us to formulate questions and receive answers to questions formulated in a mathematical language. For mathematicians and physicists today, such a language is \LaTeX. The MathPartner service uses a dialect of \LaTeX, which is called Mathpar. The service is a cloud-based computer algebra system and provides users with the opportunity to solve many mathematical problems. In this publication, we focus only on a small class of extremum problems, which are widely applied in economics, management, logistics, and in many engineering fields. In particular, we consider the shortest path problem and discuss an algorithm that is based on the tropical mathematics. The ability to work with many types of classical and tropical algebras, which are freely available to users, is an important distinguishing feature of this intelligent tool for symbolic-numerical calculations. We also consider the use of the simplex algorithm for solving optimization problems.</description>
