      <title>The special unitary groups $SU(2n)$ as framed manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $[SU(2n),\mathscr{L}]$ denote the bordism class of $SU(2n)$ $(n\ge 2)$ equipped with the left invariant framing $\mathscr{L}$. Then it is well known that $e_\mathbb{C}([SU(2n), \mathscr{L}])=0$ in $\mathbb{O}/\mathbb{Z}$ where $e_\mathbb{C}$ denotes the complex Adams $e$-invariant. In this note we show that replacing $\mathscr{L}$ by the twisted framing by a specific map it can be transformed into a generator of $\mathrm{Im} \, e_\mathbb{C}$. In addition to that we also show that the same procedure affords an analogous result for a quotient of $SU(2n+1)$ by a circle subgroup which inherits a canonical framing from $SU(2n+1)$ in the usual way.</description>

      <title>Stability of Persistent Path Diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In real-world systems, the relationships and connections between components are highly complex. Real systems are often described as networks, where nodes represent objects in the system and edges represent relationships or connections between nodes. With the deepening of research, networks have been endowed with richer structures, such as directed edges, edge weights, and even hyperedges involving multiple nodes.
  Persistent homology is an algebraic method for analyzing data. It helps us understand the intrinsic structure and patterns of data by tracking the death and birth of topological features at different scale parameters.The original persistent homology is not suitable for directed networks. However, the introduction of path homology established on digraphs solves this problem. This paper studies complex networks represented as weighted digraphs or edge-weighted path complexes and their persistent path homology. We use the homotopy theory of digraphs and path complexes, along with the interleaving property of persistent modules and bottleneck distance, to prove the stability of persistent path diagram with respect to weighted digraphs or edge-weighted path complexes. Therefore, persistent path homology has practical application value.</description>

      <title>Intertwining category and complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of the intertwining distributional versions of the LS-category and the sequential topological complexities of a space $X$, denoted by $i\mathsf{cat}(X)$ and $i\mathsf{TC}_m(X)$, respectively. We prove that they satisfy most of the nice properties as their respective distributional counterparts $d\mathsf{cat}(X)$ and $d\mathsf{TC}_m(X)$, and their classical counterparts $\mathsf{cat}(X)$ and $\mathsf{TC}_m(X)$, such as homotopy invariance and special behavior on topological groups. We show that the notions of $i\mathsf{TC}_m$ and $d\mathsf{TC}_m$ are different for each $m \ge 2$ by proving that $i\mathsf{TC}_m(\mathcal{H})=1$ for all $m \ge 2$ for Higman's group $\mathcal{H}$. Using cohomological lower bounds, we also provide various examples of locally finite CW complexes $X$ for which $i\mathsf{cat}(X) &gt; 1$, $i\mathsf{TC}_m(X) &gt; 1$, $i\mathsf{cat}(X) = d\mathsf{cat}(X) = \mathsf{cat}(X)$, and $i\mathsf{TC}(X) = d\mathsf{TC}(X) = \mathsf{TC}(X)$.</description>

      <title>An Alternative to Homotopy Transfer for $A_\infty$-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel approach to the homotopy transfer procedure starting from a set of homotopy data such that the first differential complex is a differential graded module over the second one. We show that the module structure may be used to induce an $A_\infty$-algebra on the second differential complex, constructed in a similar fashion to the homotopy transfer $A_\infty$-algebra. We prove that, under certain conditions, the $A_\infty$-algebras obtained with this procedure are quasi-isomorphic to the homotopy transfer one. On the other hand, when the side conditions do not hold, we find that there are cases where the existence of an $A_\infty$-quasi-isomorphism with the homotopy transfer $A_\infty$-algebra is obstructed. In other words, we obtain a new $A_\infty$-algebra on the second complex, inequivalent to the homotopy transfer one. Lastly, we prove that these $A_\infty$-algebras are not infinitesimal Hochschild deformations of the homotopy transfer $A_\infty$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Unstable cohomology of $\mathsf{GL}_{2n}(\mathbb{Z})$ and the odd commutative graph complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a closed differential form on the symmetric space of positive definite matrices, which is defined using the Pfaffian and is $\mathsf{GL}_{2n}(\mathbb{Z})$ invariant up to a sign. It gives rise to an infinite family of unstable classes in the compactly-supported cohomology of the locally symmetric space for $\mathsf{GL}_{2n}(\mathbb{Z})$ with coefficients in the orientation bundle. Furthermore, by applying the Pfaffian forms to the dual Laplacian of graphs, and integrating them over the space of edge lengths, we construct an infinite family of cocycles for the odd commutative graph complex. By explicit computation, we show that the first such cocycle gives a non-trivial class in $H^{-6}(\mathsf{GC}_3)$.</description>

      <title>On the codimension-two cohomology of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Borel-Serre proved that $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ is a virtual duality group of dimension $n \choose 2$ and the Steinberg module $\mathrm{St}_n(\mathbb{Q})$ is its dualizing module. This module is the top-dimensional homology group of the Tits building associated to $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Q})$. We determine the "relations among the relations" of this Steinberg module. That is, we construct an explicit partial resolution of length two of the $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$-module $\mathrm{St}_n(\mathbb{Q})$. We use this partial resolution to show the codimension-2 rational cohomology group $H^{{n \choose 2} -2}(\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z});\mathbb{Q})$ of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$ vanishes for $n \geq 3$. This resolves a case of a conjecture of Church-Farb-Putman. We also produce lower bounds for the codimension-1 cohomology of certain congruence subgroups of $\mathrm{SL}_n(\mathbb{Z})$.</description>

      <title>Intersection Multiplicity in Loop Spaces and the String Topology Coproduct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The string topology coproduct is often perceived as a counterpart in string topology to the Chas-Sullivan product. However, in certain aspects the string topology coproduct is much harder to understand than the Chas-Sullivan product. In particular the coproduct is not homotopy-invariant and it seems much harder to compute. In this article we give an overview over the string topology coproduct and use the notion of intersection multiplicity of homology classes in loop spaces to show that the string topology coproduct and the based string topology coproduct are trivial for certain classes of manifolds. In particular we show that the string topology coproduct vanishes on product manifolds where both factors have vanishing Euler characteristic and we show that the based coproduct is trivial for total spaces of fiber bundles with sections. We also discuss implications of these results.</description>

      <title>On duoidal $\infty$-categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.14121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A duoidal category is a category equipped with two monoidal structures in which one is (op)lax monoidal with respect to the other. In this paper we introduce duoidal $\infty$-categories which are counterparts of duoidal categories in the setting of $\infty$-categories. There are three kinds of functors between duoidal $\infty$-categories, which are called bilax, double lax, and double oplax monoidal functors. We make three formulations of $\infty$-categories of duoidal $\infty$-categories according to which functors we take. Furthermore, corresponding to the three kinds of functors, we define bimonoids, double monoids, and double comonoids in duoidal $\infty$-categories.</description>

      <title>A New Construction of the Vietoris-Rips Complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.07191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new, inductive construction of the Vietoris-Rips complex, in which we take advantage of a small amount of unexploited combinatorial structure in the $k$-skeleton of the complex in order to avoid unnecessary comparisons when identifying its $(k+1)$-simplices. In doing so, we achieve a significant reduction in the number of comparisons required to construct the Vietoris-Rips compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, which is seen here by examining the computational complexity of the critical step in the algorithms. In experiments comparing a C/C++ implementation of our algorithm to the GUDHI v3.9.0 software package, this results in an observed $5$-$10$-fold improvement in speed of on sufficiently sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs with the best advantages as the graphs become sparser, as well as for higher dimensional Vietoris-Rips complexes. We further clarify that the algorithm described in Boissonnat and Maria (https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-33090-2_63) for the construction of the Vietoris-Rips complex is exactly the Incremental Algorithm from Zomorodian (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cag.2010.03.007), albeit with the additional requirement that the result be stored in a tree structure, and we explain how these techniques are different from the algorithm presented here.</description>
