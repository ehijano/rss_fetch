      <title>The Pontryagin-Thom theorem for families of framed manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pontryagin-Thom theorem gives an isomorphism from the cobordism group of framed $n$-manifolds to the $n$th stable homotopy group of the sphere spectrum. In this paper, we prove the generalization of the Pontryagin-Thom theorem for families of framed equivariant manifolds parameterized over a compact base space.</description>

      <title>Linear stable ranges for integral homotopy groups of configuration spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove explicit linear stable ranges for the $\mathsf{FI}$-modules $\mathrm{Hom}(\pi_p \mathrm{Conf} M, \mathbb Z)$ and $\mathrm{Ext}(\pi_p \mathrm{Conf} M, \mathbb Z)$ with $\mathrm{Conf} M$ being the configuration co$\mathsf{FI}$-space of a $d$-dimensional manifold with $d \geq 3$. The proof of this result uses a homotopy-theoretic approach to representation stability for $\mathsf{FI}$-modules. This allows us to derive representation stability results from homotopy-theoretical statements, in particular the generalized Blakers-Massey theorem. We also generalize to $\mathsf{FI}_G$-modules and orbit configuration spaces.</description>

      <title>Extensions of the loop product and coproduct, the space of antipodal paths and resonances of closed geodesics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the space of paths in a closed manifold $M$ with endpoints determined by an involution $f\colon M\to M$. If the involution is fixed point free and if $M$ is $2$-connected then this path space is the universal covering space of the component of non-contractible loops of the free loop space of $M/\mathbb{Z}_2$. On the homology of said path space we study string topology operations which extend the Chas-Sullivan loop product and the Goresky-Hingston loop coproduct, respectively. We study the case of antipodal involution on the sphere in detail and use Morse-Bott theoretic methods to give a complete computation of the extended loop product and the extended coproduct on even-dimensional spheres. These results are then applied to prove a resonance theorem for closed geodesics on real projective space.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of codimension of persistence barcodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01610v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a pointwise finite-dimensional persistence module over a totally ordered set $S$, a theorem of Crawley-Boevey guarantees the existence of a barcode. When the set $S$ is finite, the persistence module is an equioriented type-A quiver representation and the barcode identifies a distinguished point in an algebraic variety. We prove a formula for the codimension of this variety inside an ambient space of comparable representations which depends only on the combinatorics of the barcode. We therefore extend the notion of codimension to persistence modules over any set $S$ and prove that this extension is well-defined and can be effectively computed via a stabilization property of approximating quiver representations. Further, we prove realization theorems by constructing explicit examples via persistent homology of data for which the codimension can realize any natural number as its value.</description>

      <title>Bordism categories and orientations of gauge theory moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the second paper of a series that develops a bordism-theoretic point of view on orientations in enumerative geometry. The first paper is arXiv:2312.06818. This paper focuses on those applications to gauge theory that can be established purely using formal arguments and calculations from algebraic topology.
  We prove that the orientability of moduli spaces of connections in gauge theory for all principal $G$-bundles $P\to X$ over compact spin $n$-manifolds at once is equivalent to the vanishing of a certain morphism $\Omega_n^{\rm Spin}(\mathcal L BG)\to{\mathbb Z}_2$ on the $n$-dimensional spin bordism group of the free loop space of the classifying space of $G,$ and we give a complete list of all compact, connected Lie groups $G$ for which this holds. Moreover, we apply bordism techniques to prove that mod-$8$ Floer gradings exist for moduli spaces of $G_2$-instantons for all principal SU(2)-bundles.
  We also prove that there are canonical orientations for all principal U$(m)$-bundles $P\to X$ over compact spin $8$-manifolds satisfying $c_2(P)-c_1(P)^2=0.$ The proof is based on an interesting relationship to principal $E_8$-bundles. These canonical orientations play an important role in many conjectures about Donaldson-Thomas type invariants on Calabi-Yau $4$-folds, and resolve an apparent paradox in these conjectures.</description>

      <title>Steenrod operations for $4$-dimensional toric orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of non-trivial Steenrod actions on the mod-$2$ cohomology of 4-dimensional toric orbifolds. As applications, the stable homotopy type and the gauge groups of a $4$-dimensional toric orbifold are determined, a partial solution to the cohomological rigidity problem for $4$-dimensional toric orbifolds is provided, and, in the smooth case, a combinatorial criterion is established for when the toric orbifold is spin.</description>

      <title>An Expansion of the Continuity Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the advantages of working with Alexander-Spanier-\v{C}ech type cohomology theory is the continuity property: For inverse systems of sufficiently well-behaved spaces, the result of taking the cohomology of their limit is a direct limit of their cohomologies. However, \v{C}ech cohomology natively works with presheaves of modules rather than modules themselves. We define the notion of a system of presheaves for an inverse system of topological spaces, and show that, under the same circumstances as the ordinary continuity property, a suitable limit of the system provides the \v{C}ech cohomology of the inverse limit of the spaces. We then show one application of this result in comparing the cohomology of an inverse limit of finite groups to that of the inverse limit of their classifying spaces.</description>

      <title>Orientability of moduli spaces of Spin(7)-instantons and coherent sheaves on Calabi-Yau 4-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.09658</link>
      <description>arXiv:1811.09658v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns orientability of moduli spaces of Spin(7)-instantons on compact 8-manifolds $X$ with Spin(7)-structure for the Lie groups SU($m$) and U($m$), and of moduli spaces of coherent sheaves on Calabi-Yau 4-folds. Such orientations are needed to define enumerative invariants 'counting' Spin(7) instantons, or coherent sheaves on Calabi-Yau 4-folds $X$. The previous version of the paper, version 2, published in Advances in Mathematics 368 (2020), claimed to prove all these moduli spaces are orientable.
  VERSION 3 BEGINS WITH AN ERRATUM. THERE IS A MISTAKE IN THE PROOF OF THEOREM 1.11 OF VERSION 2, AND THE THEOREM ITSELF, ONE OF OUR MAIN RESULTS, IS FALSE. THE 8-MANIFOLD SU(3) IS A COUNTEREXAMPLE. COROLLARIES 1.12 AND 1.17 OF VERSION 2 DEPEND ON THEOREM 1.11, AND SO MAY ALSO BE FALSE, THOUGH WE DO NOT HAVE COUNTEREXAMPLES. OUR OTHER MAIN RESULT, THEOREM 1.15, IS UNAFFECTED BY THE MISTAKE. THE AUTHORS APOLOGIZE FOR THIS.
  Joyce-Upmeier arXiv:2503.20456 (197 pages) gives a new theory for studying orientability of moduli spaces using 'bordism categories'. Amongst other results they prove corrected versions of Theorem 1.11 and Corollaries 1.12 and 1.17, which hold with an extra assumption on $H^3(X,\mathbb Z)$.
  In version 3, we highlight and explain the mistakes, but we do not correct them, as this would take many pages. Except for Theorem 1.15, readers are advised to read, and cite, Joyce-Upmeier arXiv:2503.20456 instead of this paper.</description>

      <title>An Equisingular Specialisation of the Compactified Jacobian and its applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.12259v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any positive integer $k$, let $X_k$ be a projective irreducible nodal curve with $k$ nodes. We show that the Betti numbers and the mixed Hodge numbers of the compactified Jacobian $\overline{J_{k}}$ of an irreducible nodal curve $X_k$ with $k$ nodes are the same as the Betti numbers and the mixed Hodge numbers of $J_0\times R^k$, where $J_0$ is the Jacobian of the normalisation of the irreducible nodal curve and $R$ denotes the rational nodal curve with one node. We prove it by constructing a topologically locally trivial family of projective varieties containing $\overline{J_{k}}$ and $J_0\times R^k$ as fibres.</description>

      <title>Pl\"ucker formulas using equivariant cohomology of coincident root strata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06430v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new method to calculate the universal cohomology classes of coincident root loci. We show a polynomial behavior of them and apply this result to prove that generalized Pl\"ucker formulas are polynomials in the degree, just as the classical Pl\"ucker formulas counting the bitangents and flexes of a degree $d$ generic plane curve. We establish an upper bound for the degrees of these polynomials, and we calculate the leading terms of those whose degrees reach this upper bound.
  We believe that the paper is understandable without detailed knowledge of equivariant cohomology. It may serve as a demonstration of the use of equivariant cohomology in enumerative geometry through the examples of coincident root strata. We also explain how the equivariant method can be "translated" into the traditional non-equivariant method of resolutions.</description>
