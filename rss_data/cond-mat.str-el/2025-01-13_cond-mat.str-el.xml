      <title>Kondo impurity in an attractive Fermi-Hubbard bath: Equilibrium and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically equilibrium and dynamical properties of a Kondo impurity coupled to either 1D or 2D superconductors, modeled by the attractive Fermi-Hubbard model. By employing a non-Gaussian variational approach, we go beyond the approximation of a constant superconducting (SC) gap. We show that dynamical properties of the system can be modified qualitatively, when space and time dependent renormalization of the SC gap and electron-impurity hybridization are included. For the ground state, we find the singlet-doublet phase transition and $\pi$-phase shifts of the SC order parameter. For dynamics, first we consider spin dynamics following an abrupt connection of the polarized impurity to the 2D bath. We find rapid relaxation of impurity polarization and directional emission of a magnetization pulse, which becomes damped as it propagates into the bulk. Then we analyze transport between two SC leads coupled through the impurity at finite bias voltage. Here we go beyond analysis of the steady state to investigate full-time dynamics following an abrupt application of the bias voltage. We uncover four distinct regimes in the transient dynamics and transport properties: (I) the AC Josephson effect regime; (II) dynamical competition between charge-density-wave (CDW) and SC orders with transient Kondo correlations; (III) the coexistence of AC and DC currents facilitated by partial Kondo screening and dynamical stabilization of the SC order; (IV) DC Kondo transport regime modified by the SC order. Regime II exhibits a dynamical transition from SC to CDW order that locally restores the U(1) symmetry. We argue that our findings for regime IV provide a theoretical explanation for the experimentally observed anomalous enhancement of DC conductance and suppression of the AC Josephson current. Finally, we discuss the potential experimental realization with ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids (QSLs) represent exotic states of matter where quantum spins interact strongly yet evade long-range magnetic order down to absolute zero. Characterized by non-local quantum entanglement and resultant fractionalized excitations, QSLs have emerged as a frontier in condensed matter physics, bolstered by the recent identification of several candidate materials. This field holds profound implications for understanding strong correlations, topological order, and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. Among them, the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb model, featuring bond-directional Ising interactions, provides a rare exactly solvable QSL example. Its ground state is a topological QSL, with spin degrees of freedom fractionalized into emergent Majorana fermions. Under an applied magnetic field, the Kitaev QSL transitions to a topologically non-trivial chiral spin liquid state with non-Abelian anyons, offering potential resources for topological quantum computation. The non-Abelian character of these anyons in the Kitaev QSL demonstrates a profound connection to certain topological superconductors and even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states. Since the theoretical prediction that the Kitaev model could manifest in spin-orbit-coupled materials such as honeycomb iridates and ruthenates, research has focused on identifying candidate compounds. In particular, experimental evidence suggests spin fractionalization and topological phenomena akin to the Kitaev model in the spin-orbit Mott insulator $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. However, results and interpretations remain actively debated. This review presents a comprehensive survey of existing studies on Kitaev candidate materials, with a particular focus on $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. Rather than offering conclusive remarks, our aim is to inspire future research by examining several key aspects of the current literature and perspectives.</description>

      <title>High order strong-coupling expansion for X-ray absorption on a dynamically screened impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-resolved X-ray absorption can reveal the dynamical screening of the local Coulomb interaction in strongly correlated photo-excited materials. Here, we focus on the theoretical prediction of X-ray absorption in the presence of dynamical screening using the strong coupling expansion, i.e., an expansion around the isolated absorption site in terms of the retarded interaction. The evaluation of higher order diagrams is made numerically feasible by an approach based on the decomposition of the retarded interaction into complex exponentials. With this, we evaluate the strong coupling series to third order on an electron-boson model of Holstein type. We demonstrate that in relevant coupling regimes, even low orders of the strong coupling expansion can give a significant correction over the previously used lowest order approximation.</description>

      <title>The Kekul\'e-Kitaev model: linear and non-linear responses and magnetic field effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kekul\'e-Kitaev model, an extension of the Kitaev model, exhibits quantum spin liquid (QSL) properties, which has an exact solution through Kitaev parton construction. In this study, we calculate the dynamical spin structure factor as a linear response and the third-order magnetic susceptibility as a nonlinear response using two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy for Kekul\'e-Kitaev model. Our results reveal that the few-matter fermion excitations approximation provides reliable results for both linear and nonlinear responses. Notably, while the Kekul\'e-Kitaev model shows linear and nonlinear responses qualitatively similar to the Kitaev model, it displays distinct behavior under a weak uniform/staggered magnetic field. Specifically, the Kekul\'e-Kitaev model does not present a non-Abelian phase under a uniform magnetic field, while such phase appears in the presence of a staggered magnetic field. Interestingly, within the non-Abelian phase, signals originating from two non-adjacent fluxes in the nonlinear response are stronger than signals from other flux excitations. Furthermore, We demonstrate that the ground state of the Kekul\'e-Kitaev model at isotropic coupling is mapped, through unitary spin rotations, to an excited state of the Kitaev model with a uniform flux configuration.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian interlayer coherent fractional quantum Hall states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-Abelian fractional quantum Hall state in double layer systems at total filling factor $1/2$. Recent progresses in two-dimensional van der Waals materials made it possible to explore the regime with very small interlayer distance. Numerical calculations suggests interlayer phase coherence can develop between the layers such that the electrons may redistribute between them without changing the Hall response. It corresponds to spontaneous breaking of the U(1) symmetry associated with the particle number difference in the layers. This state manifests itself as superfluid in counterflow measurement and has characteristic Hall response when current is passed through one layer and voltages in both layers are measured. As the interlayer distance increases, a phase transition into the Halperin 331 state occurs. We also discuss similar physics for bosonic systems with specially designed interactions.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Force-Field Approach for Itinerant Electron Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the recent development of machine-learning (ML) force-field frameworks for Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) dynamics simulations of itinerant electron magnets, focusing on the general theory and implementations of symmetry-invariant representations of spin configurations. The crucial properties that such magnetic descriptors must satisfy are differentiability with respect to spin rotations and invariance to both lattice point-group symmetry and internal spin rotation symmetry. We propose an efficient implementation based on the concept of reference irreducible representations, modified from the group-theoretical power-spectrum and bispectrum methods. The ML framework is demonstrated using the s-d models, which are widely applied in spintronics research. We show that LLG simulations based on local fields predicted by the trained ML models successfully reproduce representative non-collinear spin structures, including 120$^\circ$, tetrahedral, and skyrmion crystal orders of the triangular-lattice s-d models. Large-scale thermal quench simulations enabled by ML models further reveal intriguing freezing dynamics and glassy stripe states consisting of skyrmions and bi-merons. Our work highlights the utility of ML force-field approach to dynamical modeling of complex spin orders in itinerant electron magnets.</description>

      <title>Evaluating SCAN and r$^2$SCAN meta-GGA functionals for predicting transition temperatures in antiferromagnetic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in exchange-correlation functionals within density functional theory highlight the need for rigorous validation across diverse types of materials properties. In this study, we assess the performance of the newly developed meta-GGA r$^2$SCAN and its predecessor, SCAN, in predicting the N\'eel transition temperature of antiferromagnetic materials. Our analysis includes 48 magnetic materials, spanning both simple and complex systems. Using DFT, we compute the energies of various magnetic configurations and extract exchange interaction parameters through a least-squares fitting approach. These parameters are then used in classical Monte Carlo simulations to estimate the transition temperatures. Our results demonstrate that both SCAN and r$^2$SCAN greatly outperform standard GGA and GGA+$U$ methods, yielding predictions that closely align with experimental values. The Pearson correlation coefficients for SCAN and r$^2$SCAN are 0.97 and 0.98, respectively, when compared to experimental transition temperatures. Additionally, we calculate the energy differences between antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic configurations to assess the performance of the hybrid HSE06 functional. We found that the HSE06 functional underestimates transition temperatures compared to the meta-GGA functionals and experimental values.</description>

      <title>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge in quantum statistical mechanics of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In contrast, the quantum theory of many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. We relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum RP resonances converge inside the unit disk. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions. Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We identify the exact RP resonances in the RPM and prove that the same RP resonances are obtained from operator truncation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance. Finally, we demonstrate how conservation laws, many-body localization, and nonlocal interactions merge the leading RP resonance into the unit circle, thereby suppressing anomalous relaxation.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced nonlinear magnon transport in noncentrosymmetric magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effect of the magnon-magnon interaction on the nonlinear magnon transport. The magnonmagnon interaction induces nonreciprocal magnon decay when the time-reversal symmetry is broken and leads to nonlinear thermal responses of magnons. We construct a theoretical framework to study the nonlinear thermal responses due to the nonreciprocal magnon decay by using the imaginary Dyson equation and quantum kinetic theory, which is then applied to models of one-dimensional (1D) antiferromagnets and 2D honeycomb ferromagnets with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions. An order estimate shows that the nonlinear thermal response from the present mechanism is feasible for experimental measurement.</description>

      <title>Anomalous diffusion in quantum system driven by heavy-tailed stochastic processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a stochastically driven non-equilibrium quantum system where the driving protocols consist of hopping and waiting processes. The waiting times between two hopping processes satisfy a heavy-tailed distribution. By calculating the squared width of the wavepackets, our findings demonstrate the emergence of various anomalous transport phenomena when the system remains unchanged within the heavy-tailed regime, including superdiffusive, subdiffusive, and standard diffusive motion. Only subdiffusion occurs when the system has evolved during the waiting process. All these transport behaviors are accompanied by a breakdown of ergodicity, highlighting the complex dynamics induced by the stochastic driving mechanism.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians: Reduced Memory Cost and Complexity Scaling via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only $2$. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. We also propose that our method is compatible with parallel computing, which is essential for calculating large-size systems.</description>

      <title>Formations of generalized Wannier-Stark ladders: Theorem and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wannier-Stark ladder (WSL) is a basic concept, supporting periodic oscillation, widely used in many areas of physics. In this paper, we investigate the formations of WSL in generalized systems, including strongly correlated and non-Hermitian systems. We present a theorem on the existence of WSL for a set of general systems that are translationally symmetric before the addition of a linear potential. For a non-Hermitian system, the WSL becomes complex but maintains a real energy level spacing. We illustrate the theorem using 1D extended Bose-Hubbard models with both real and imaginary hopping strengths. It is shown that the Bloch-Zener oscillations of correlated bosons are particularly remarkable under resonant conditions. Numerical simulations for cases with boson numbers $n=2$, $3$, and $4$ are presented. Analytical and numerical results for the time evolution of the $n$-boson-occupied initial state indicate that all evolved states exhibit quasi periodic oscillations, but with different profiles, depending on the Hermiticity and interaction strength.</description>

      <title>Rotational Gr\"{u}neisen ratio: a probe for quantum criticality in anisotropic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gr\"{u}neisen ratio $\Gamma$ and its magnetic analog, the magnetic Gr\"{u}neisen ratio $\Gamma_H$, are powerful probes to study the nature of quantum phase transitions. Here, we propose a Gr\"{u}neisen parameter, the rotational Gr\"{u}neisen ratio $\Gamma_\phi$, by introducing the orientation of the external field as a control parameter. We investigate $\Gamma_\phi$ of the highly anisotropic paramagnets CeRhSn and CeIrSn by measuring the rotational magnetocaloric effect in a wide range of temperatures and magnetic fields. We find that the $\Gamma_\phi$ data of both compounds are scaled by using the same critical exponents and the field-invariant critical field angle. Remarkably, the scaling function for the $\Gamma_\phi$ data reveals the presence of highly anisotropic quantum criticality that develops as a function of the easy-axis component of the magnetic field from the quantum critical line. This paper provides a thermodynamic approach to detect and identify magnetic quantum criticality in highly anisotropic systems.</description>

      <title>Thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without translational symmetry breaking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15330v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the evolution of low-temperature thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions in Kondo lattice models without translational symmetry breaking. This transition moves from a heavy Fermi liquid with a conventional Luttinger-volume large Fermi surface to a 'FL*' state, characterized by a small Fermi surface and a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. The onset of the large Fermi surface phase is driven by the condensation of a Higgs field that carries a unit gauge charge under an emergent U(1) gauge field. We consider the case with spatially random Kondo exchange, as this leads to strange metal behavior in electrical transport. We find a large asymmetric thermopower in a 'skewed' marginal Fermi liquid, with similarities to the skewed non-Fermi liquid of Georges and Mravlje (arXiv:2102.13224). Our findings are consistent with recent observations in heavy fermion compounds (Z.-Y. Cao et al., arXiv:2408.13604), and describe an enhancement of thermopower on the large Fermi surface side as well as a non-monotonic behavior on the small Fermi surface side. Our results also apply to single-band Hubbard models and the pseudogap transition in the cuprates. In the ancilla framework, single-band models exhibit an inverted Kondo lattice transition: the small Fermi surface pseudogap state corresponds to the condensed Higgs state. This inversion results in an enhancement of thermopower on the pseudogap side in our theory, consistent with observations in the cuprates (C. Collignon et al., arXiv:2011.14927; A. Gourgout et al., arXiv:2106.05959). We argue that these observations support a non-symmetry-breaking Fermi-volume-changing transition as the underlying description of the onset of the pseudogap in the cuprates.</description>

      <title>Self-doped Molecular Mott Insulator for Bilayer High-Temperature Superconducting La3Ni2O7</title>

Abstract: The bilayer structure of recently discovered high-temperature superconducting nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a new platform for investigating correlation and superconductivity. Starting from a bilayer Hubbard model, we show that there is a molecular Mott insulator limit forming by the bonding band owing to Hubbard interaction and large interlayer coupling. This molecular Mott insulator becomes self-doped from electrons transferred to the antibonding bands at a weaker interlayer coupling strength. The self-doped molecular Mott insulator is similar to the doped Mott insulator studied in cuprates. We propose La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is a self-doped molecular Mott insulator, whose molecular Mott limit is formed by two nearly degenerate antisymmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $d_{z^2}$ orbitals. Partial occupation of higher energy symmetric $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital leads to self-doping, which may be responsible for high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quantum phase transitions following a noisy quench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13337v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how time-dependent energy fluctuations impact the dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs) following a noisy ramped quench of the transverse magnetic field in a quantum Ising chain. By numerically solving the stochastic Schr\"odinger equation of the mode-decoupled fermionic Hamiltonian of the problem, we identify two generic scenarios: Depending on the amplitude of the noise and the rate of the ramp, the expected periodic sequence of noiseless DQPTs may either be uniformly shifted in time or else replaced by a disarray of closely spaced DQPTs. Guided by an exact noise master equation, we trace the phenomenon to the interplay between noise-induced excitations which accumulate during the quench and the near-adiabatic dynamics of the massive modes of the system. Our analysis generalizes to any 1D fermionic two-band model subject to a noisy quench.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity-enhanced quantum sensing in Stark probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stark systems in which a linear gradient field is applied across a many-body system have recently been proposed for quantum sensing. Here, we explore sensing capacity of Stark probes, in both single-particle and many-body interacting systems, for estimating nonlinear forms of the gradient fields. Our analysis reveals that, this estimation can achieve super-Heisenberg scaling precision that grows linearly by increasing the nonlinearity. Specifically, we find a universal algebraic relation between the scaling of the precision and the degree of the nonlinearity. This universal behavior remains valid in both single-particle and many-body interacting probes and reflects itself in the properties of the phase transition from an extended to a localized phase, obtained through establishing a comprehensive finite-size scaling analysis. Considering a parabolic gradient potential composed of both linear and nonlinear fields, we used multi-parameter estimation methodology to estimate the components of the gradient potential. The phase diagram of the system is determined in terms of both linear and nonlinear gradient fields showing how the nonlocalized phase turns into a localized one as the Stark fields increase. The sensing precision of both linear and nonlinear Stark fields follows the same universal algebraic relation that was found for the case of single parameter sensing. We demonstrate that simple and experimentally available measurements can reach the theoretical precision bounds. Finally, we show that quantum enhanced sensitivity is still achievable even when we incorporate the preparation time of the probe into our resource analysis.</description>

      <title>Stable Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Systems with Heralded Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a family of local quantum channels whose steady-states exhibit stable mixed-state symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order. Motivated by recent experimental progress on "erasure conversion" techniques that allow one to identify ($\textit{herald}$) decoherence processes, we consider open systems with biased erasure noise, which leads to strongly symmetric heralded errors. We utilize this heralding to construct a local correction protocol that effectively confines errors into short-ranged pairs in the steady-state. Using a combination of numerical simulations and mean-field analysis, we show that our protocol stabilizes SPT order against a sufficiently low rate of decoherence. As the rate of heralded noise increases, SPT order is eventually lost through a directed percolation transition. We further find that while introducing unheralded errors destroys SPT order in the limit of long length- and time-scales, the correction protocol is sufficient for ensuring that local SPT order persists, with a correlation length that diverges as $\xi \sim (1-f_e)^{-1/2}$, where $f_e$ is the fraction of errors that are heralded.</description>

Abstract: We identify a pseudolocal conserved charge in the Fredkin and Motzkin quantum spin chains and explore its consequences for the hydrodynamics of systems with Fredkin- or Motzkin-type kinetic constraints. We use this quantity to formulate an exact upper bound ${\cal O}(L^{-5/2})$ on the gap of the Fredkin and Motzkin spin chains. Our results establish that transport in kinetically constrained dynamical systems with Fredkin or Motzkin constraints is subdiffusive, with dynamical exponent $z \geq 5/2$.</description>

      <title>Aspects of Hilbert space fragmentation in the quantum East model: fragmentation, subspace-restricted quantum scars, and effects of density-density interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional correlated-hopping model of spinless fermions with an East constraint. We first analytically unravel the complete fragmentation structure of this model by labeling each fragment by a unique root configuration and utilizing the transfer matrix method. We show that the growth of the size of each fragment of the model follows the widely studied Dyck sequence, and is therefore analytically tractable with the help of Catalan triangles. While the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) does not hold within the full Hilbert space which exhibits Poisson statistics of the energy level spacing, an examination of various quantities restricted to the largest fragments shows that a weaker version of the subspace-restricted thermalization holds. This weaker violation of the ETH within the largest fragments is supported by the presence of subspace-restricted quantum many-body scars due to quantum fragmentation. Next, we show that the inclusion of a nearest-neighbor density-density interaction with strength $V$ induces a spectral transition within the largest fragment from a weakly ETH-violating phase containing scars to a statistical bubble localized phase as $V$ increases. In particular, the $V\to \infty$ limit produces an integrable model. We find that the addition of finite-$V$ stabilizes the ground state near half-filling while keeping intact the fragmentation structure of the East model. However, this behavior abruptly changes exactly at $V = \infty$ due to the emergence of a distinct fragmentation structure. The infinite-$V$ model has many interesting properties, among which the appearance of the ground state and the largest fragment at two different filling fractions is specially noteworthy. Finally, we propose an experimental setup to realize the infinite-$V$ model as a particular limit of a special kind of $t-V$ model with an on-site potential.</description>

      <title>Measurement-induced transitions for interacting fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effect of measurements on interacting fermionic systems with particle-number conservation, whose dynamics is governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian, is studied. We develop Keldysh field-theoretical framework that provides a unified approach to observables characterizing entanglement and charge fluctuations. Within this framework, we derive a replicated Keldysh non-linear sigma model (NLSM), which incorporates boundary conditions specifically designed to produce generating functions for charge cumulants and entanglement entropies directly in the NLSM language. By using the renormalization-group approach for the NLSM, we determine the phase diagram and the scaling of physical observables. Crucially, the interaction-induced terms in the NLSM action reduce its symmetry, which affects the physics of the problem in a dramatic way. First, this leads to the "information-charge separation": charge cumulants get decoupled from entanglement entropies. Second, the interaction stabilizes the volume-law phase for the entanglement. Third, for spatial dimensionality $d=1$, the interaction stabilizes the phase with logarithmic growth of charge cumulants (in the thermodynamic limit). Thus, in the presence of interaction, there are measurement transitions in any $d$, at variance with free fermions, for which a $d=1$ system is always in the area-law phase. Analytical results are supported by numerical simulations using time-dependent variational principles for matrix product states, which, in particular, confirm the separation of information and charge as a hallmark of the delocalized phase.</description>

      <title>Programmable Magnetic Hysteresis in Orthogonally-Twisted Two-Dimensional CrSBr Magnets via Stacking Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisting two-dimensional van der Waals magnets allows the formation and control of different spin-textures, as skyrmions or magnetic domains. Beyond the rotation angle, different spin reversal processes can be engineered by increasing the number of magnetic layers forming the twisted van der Waals heterostructure. Here, we consider pristine monolayers and bilayers of the A-type antiferromagnet CrSBr as building blocks. By rotating 90 degrees these units, we fabricate symmetric (monolayer/monolayer and bilayer/bilayer) and asymmetric (monolayer/bilayer) heterostructures. The magneto-transport properties reveal the appearance of magnetic hysteresis, which is highly dependent upon the magnitude and direction of the applied magnetic field and is determined not only by the twist-angle but also by the number of layers forming the stack. This high tunability allows switching between volatile and non-volatile magnetic memory at zero-field and controlling the appearance of abrupt magnetic reversal processes at either negative or positive field values on demand. The phenomenology is rationalized based on the different spin-switching processes occurring in the layers, as supported by micromagnetic simulations. Our results highlight the combination between twist-angle and number of layers as key elements for engineering spin-switching reversals in twisted magnets, of interest towards the miniaturization of spintronic devices and realizing novel spin textures.</description>
