      <title>zERExtractor:An Automated Platform for Enzyme-Catalyzed Reaction Data Extraction from Scientific Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of enzyme kinetics literature has outpaced the curation capabilities of major biochemical databases, creating a substantial barrier to AI-driven modeling and knowledge discovery. We present zERExtractor, an automated and extensible platform for comprehensive extraction of enzyme-catalyzed reaction and activity data from scientific literature. zERExtractor features a unified, modular architecture that supports plug-and-play integration of state-of-the-art models, including large language models (LLMs), as interchangeable components, enabling continuous system evolution alongside advances in AI. Our pipeline combines domain-adapted deep learning, advanced OCR, semantic entity recognition, and prompt-driven LLM modules, together with human expert corrections, to extract kinetic parameters (e.g., kcat, Km), enzyme sequences, substrate SMILES, experimental conditions, and molecular diagrams from heterogeneous document formats. Through active learning strategies integrating AI-assisted annotation, expert validation, and iterative refinement, the system adapts rapidly to new data sources. We also release a large benchmark dataset comprising over 1,000 annotated tables and 5,000 biological fields from 270 P450-related enzymology publications. Benchmarking demonstrates that zERExtractor consistently outperforms existing baselines in table recognition (Acc 89.9%), molecular image interpretation (up to 99.1%), and relation extraction (accuracy 94.2%). zERExtractor bridges the longstanding data gap in enzyme kinetics with a flexible, plugin-ready framework and high-fidelity extraction, laying the groundwork for future AI-powered enzyme modeling and biochemical knowledge discovery.</description>

      <title>HelixVS: Deep Learning Enhanced Structure-based Virtual Screening Platform for Hit Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug discovery through virtual screening (VS) has become a popular strategy for identifying hits against protein targets. VS has the potential to reduce the cost and time needed for manual selection and wet-laboratory experiments. Improving the cost-effectiveness of virtual screening is a significant challenge, aiming to explore larger compound libraries while maintaining lower screening costs. Here, we present HelixVS, a structure-based VS platform enhanced by deep learning models. HelixVS integrates a precise deep learning-based pose-scoring model and a pose-screening module into a multi-stage VS process, enabling more effective screening of active compounds. Compared to classic molecular docking tools like Vina, HelixVS demonstrated significantly improved screening performance across nearly a hundred targets, achieving an average 2.6-fold higher enrichment factor (EF) and more than 10 times faster screening speed. We applied HelixVS in four drug development pipelines, targeting both traditional competitive drug-binding pockets and novel protein-protein interaction interfaces. Wet-lab validations across these pipelines consistently identified active compounds, with over 10% of the molecules tested in wet labs demonstrating activity at uM or even nM levels. This demonstrates the ability of HelixVS to identify high-affinity ligands for various targets and pockets. Furthermore, we provide a publicly available and free version of HelixVS with limited computing power to assist drug development scientists in accelerating their drug discovery processes.</description>

      <title>FROGENT: An End-to-End Full-process Drug Design Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Powerful AI tools for drug discovery reside in isolated web apps, desktop programs, and code libraries. Such fragmentation forces scientists to manage incompatible interfaces and specialized scripts, which can be a cumbersome and repetitive process. To address this issue, a Full-pROcess druG dEsign ageNT, named FROGENT, has been proposed. Specifically, FROGENT utilizes a Large Language Model and the Model Context Protocol to integrate multiple dynamic biochemical databases, extensible tool libraries, and task-specific AI models. This agentic framework allows FROGENT to execute complicated drug discovery workflows dynamically, including component tasks such as target identification, molecule generation and retrosynthetic planning. FROGENT has been evaluated on eight benchmarks that cover various aspects of drug discovery, such as knowledge retrieval, property prediction, virtual screening, mechanistic analysis, molecular design, and synthesis. It was compared against six increasingly advanced ReAct-style agents that support code execution and literature searches. Empirical results demonstrated that FROGENT triples the best baseline performance in hit-finding and doubles it in interaction profiling, significantly outperforming both the open-source model Qwen3-32B and the commercial model GPT-4o. In addition, real-world cases have been utilized to validate the practicability and generalization of FROGENT. This development suggests that streamlining the agentic drug discovery pipeline can significantly enhance researcher productivity.</description>

      <title>Physical Principles of Size and Frequency Scaling of Active Cytoskeletal Spirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cytoskeletal filaments transported by surface immobilized molecular motors with one end pinned to the surface have been observed to spiral in a myosin-driven actin 'gliding assay'. The radius of the spiral was shown to scale with motor density with an exponent of -1/3, while the frequency was theoretically predicted to scale with an exponent of 4/3. While both the spiraling radius and frequency depend on motor density, the theory assumed independence of filament length, and remained to be tested on cytoskeletal systems other than actin-myosin. Here, we reconstitute dynein-driven microtubule spiraling and compare experiments to theory and numerical simulations. We characterize the scaling laws of spiraling MTs and find the radius dependence on force density to be consistent with previous results. Frequency on the other hand scales with force density with an exponent of ~1/3, contrary to previous predictions. We also predict that the spiral radius scales proportionally and the frequency scales inversely with filament length, both with an exponent of ~1/3. A model of variable persistence length best explains the length dependence observed in experiments. Our findings that reconcile theory, simulations, and experiments improve our understanding of the role of cytoskeletal filament elasticity, mechanics of microtubule buckling and motor transport and the physical principles of active filaments.</description>

      <title>IBEX: Information-Bottleneck-EXplored Coarse-to-Fine Molecular Generation under Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional generative models increasingly drive structure-based drug discovery, yet it remains constrained by the scarce publicly available protein-ligand complexes. Under such data scarcity, almost all existing pipelines struggle to learn transferable geometric priors and consequently overfit to training-set biases. As such, we present IBEX, an Information-Bottleneck-EXplored coarse-to-fine pipeline to tackle the chronic shortage of protein-ligand complex data in structure-based drug design. Specifically, we use PAC-Bayesian information-bottleneck theory to quantify the information density of each sample. This analysis reveals how different masking strategies affect generalization and indicates that, compared with conventional de novo generation, the constrained Scaffold Hopping task endows the model with greater effective capacity and improved transfer performance. IBEX retains the original TargetDiff architecture and hyperparameters for training to generate molecules compatible with the binding pocket; it then applies an L-BFGS optimization step to finely refine each conformation by optimizing five physics-based terms and adjusting six translational and rotational degrees of freedom in under one second. With only these modifications, IBEX raises the zero-shot docking success rate on CBGBench CrossDocked2020-based from 53% to 64%, improves the mean Vina score from $-7.41 kcal mol^{-1}$ to $-8.07 kcal mol^{-1}$, and achieves the best median Vina energy in 57 of 100 pockets versus 3 for the original TargetDiff. IBEX also increases the QED by 25%, achieves state-of-the-art validity and diversity, and markedly reduces extrapolation error.</description>

      <title>AmpLyze: A Deep Learning Model for Predicting the Hemolytic Concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Red-blood-cell lysis (HC50) is the principal safety barrier for antimicrobial-peptide (AMP) therapeutics, yet existing models only say "toxic" or "non-toxic." AmpLyze closes this gap by predicting the actual HC50 value from sequence alone and explaining the residues that drive toxicity. The model couples residue-level ProtT5/ESM2 embeddings with sequence-level descriptors in dual local and global branches, aligned by a cross-attention module and trained with log-cosh loss for robustness to assay noise. The optimal AmpLyze model reaches a PCC of 0.756 and an MSE of 0.987, outperforming classical regressors and the state-of-the-art. Ablations confirm that both branches are essential, and cross-attention adds a further 1% PCC and 3% MSE improvement. Expected-Gradients attributions reveal known toxicity hotspots and suggest safer substitutions. By turning hemolysis assessment into a quantitative, sequence-based, and interpretable prediction, AmpLyze facilitates AMP design and offers a practical tool for early-stage toxicity screening.</description>
