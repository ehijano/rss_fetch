      <title>Multigenerational Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A growing literature provides evidence on multigenerational inequality -- the extent to which socio-economic advantages persist across three or more generations. This chapter reviews its main findings and implications. Most studies find that inequality is more persistent than a naive iteration of conventional parent-child correlations would suggest. We discuss potential interpretations of this new ``fact'' related to (i) latent, (ii) non-Markovian or (iii) non-linear transmission processes, empirical strategies to discriminate between them, and the link between multigenerational and assortative associations.</description>

      <title>Trade, Political Distance and the World Trade Organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trade agreements are often understood as shielding commerce from fluctuations in political relations. This paper provides evidence that World Trade Organization membership reduces the penalty of political distance on trade at the extensive margin. Using a structural gravity framework covering 1948 to 2023 and two measures of political distance, based on high-frequency events data and UN General Assembly votes, GATT/WTO status is consistently associated with a wider range of products traded between politically distant partners. The association is strongest in the early WTO years (1995 to 2008). Events-based estimates also suggest attenuation at the intensive margin, while UN vote-based estimates do not. Across all specifications, GATT/WTO membership increases aggregate trade volumes. The results indicate that a function of the multilateral trading system has been to foster new trade links across political divides, while raising trade volumes among both close and distant partners.</description>

      <title>Economic Complexity Alignment and Sustainable Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economic complexity has been linked to sustainability outcomes, such as income inequality and greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, it is unclear whether the pursuit of complex and/or related activities naturally aligns with these outcomes, or whether meeting sustainability goals requires policy interventions that pursue unrelated diversification. Here, we exploit multidimensional social and environmental sustainability indicators to quantify the alignment between a country's closest diversification opportunities and sustainability goals. We find that high- and upper-middle-income countries face significantly better environmentally aligned diversification opportunities than poorer economies. This means that, while richer countries enjoy diversification opportunities that align complexity, relatedness and environmental performance, this alignment is weaker for developing economies. These findings underscore the value of evaluating future diversification trajectories through a multidimensional sustainability framework, and emphasise the strategic relevance of unrelated diversification for less developed economies to foster sustainable development.</description>

      <title>Incentives and Outcomes in Bug Bounties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bug bounty programs have contributed significantly to security in technology firms in the last decade, but little is known about the role of reward incentives in producing useful outcomes. We analyze incentives and outcomes in Google's Vulnerability Rewards Program (VRP), one of the world's largest bug bounty programs. We analyze the responsiveness of the quality and quantity of bugs received to changes in payments, focusing on a change in Google's reward amounts posted in July, 2024, in which reward amounts increased by up to 200% for the highest impact tier. Our empirical results show an increase in the volume of high-value bugs received after the reward increase, for which we also compute elasticities. We further break down the sources of this increase between veteran researchers and new researchers, showing that the reward increase both redirected the attention of veteran researchers and attracted new top security researchers into the program.</description>

      <title>Tenure Under Pressure: Simulating the Disruptive Effects of AI on Academic Publishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to reshape academic publishing by enabling the rapid production of submission-ready manuscripts. While such tools promise to enhance productivity, they also raise concerns about overwhelming journal systems that have fixed acceptance capacities. This paper uses simulation modeling to investigate how AI-driven surges in submissions may affect desk rejection rates, review cycles, and faculty publication portfolios, with a focus on business school journals and tenure processes. Three scenarios are analyzed: a baseline model, an Early Adopter model where a subset of faculty boosts productivity, and an AI Abuse model where submissions rise exponentially. Results indicate that early adopters initially benefit, but overall acceptance rates fall sharply as load increases, with tenure-track faculty facing disproportionately negative outcomes. The study contributes by demonstrating the structural vulnerabilities of the current publication system and highlights the need for institutional reform in personnel evaluation and research dissemination practices.</description>

      <title>Exposure to World War II and Its Labor Market Consequences over the Life Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With 70 million dead, World War II remains the most devastating conflict in history. Among the survivors, millions were displaced, returned maimed from the battlefield, or endured years of captivity. We examine the effects of such war exposures on labor market careers, showing that they often become apparent only at certain life stages. While war injuries reduced employment in old age, former prisoners of war prolonged their time in the workforce before retiring. Many displaced workers, especially women, never returned to employment. These responses align with standard life-cycle theory and thus likely hold relevance for other conflicts.</description>

      <title>A mechanistic model of trust based on neural information processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trust is central to human social interactions, manifesting in actions that make one vulnerable to another. We argue that trust will thus depend on the decision-making processes that arise in neural systems. Building on advances in the cognitive neuroscience of decision making, we propose a mechanistic model of trust arising from multiple parallel systems that perform distinct, complementary information processing. Because each system learns via different mechanisms, trust can be created (or destroyed) in multiple ways. This systems-level taxonomy of information representations provides a principled basis for differentiating forms of trust, linking them to specific learning processes, and generating testable predictions about their expression in behavior. By situating trust within a broader theory of neural decision systems, our account unifies diverse findings across psychology, neuroscience, and the social sciences, and offers a foundation for explaining how humans develop, maintain, and repair trust in a complex social world.</description>

      <title>Concentration-Based Inference for Evaluating Horizontal Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12924v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antitrust authorities routinely rely on market concentration measures to assess the potential adverse effects of mergers on consumer welfare. Using a first-order approximation argument with logit and CES demand, I derive the relationship between the welfare effect of a merger on consumer surplus and the change in the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). My results suggest that merger harm is correlated with the merger-induced change in HHI, and the proportionality coefficient depends on the price responsiveness parameter, market size, and the distribution of market shares within and across the merging firms. I present numerical validation of my formula along with an empirical illustration.</description>

      <title>Estimating Spillovers from Sampled Connections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical researchers often estimate spillover effects by fitting linear or non-linear regression models to sampled network data. We show that common sampling schemes bias these estimates, potentially upwards, and derive biased-corrected estimators that researchers can construct from aggregate network statistics. Our results apply under different assumptions on the relationship between observed and unobserved links, allow researchers to bound true effect sizes, and to determine robustness to mismeasured links. As an application, we estimate the propagation of climate shocks between U.S. public firms from self-reported supply links, building a new dataset of county-level incidence of large climate shocks.</description>

      <title>Are Elites Meritocratic and Efficiency-Seeking? Evidence from MBA Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15443v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elites disproportionately influence policymaking, yet little is known about their fairness and efficiency preferences -- key determinants of support for redistributive policies. We investigate these preferences in an incentivized lab experiment with a group of future elites -- Ivy League MBA students. We find that MBA students implement substantially more unequal earnings distributions than the average American, regardless of whether inequality stems from luck or merit. Their redistributive choices are also highly responsive to efficiency costs, with an effect that is an order of magnitude larger than that found in representative U.S. samples. Analyzing fairness ideals, we find that MBA students are less likely to be strict meritocrats than the broader population. These findings provide novel insights into how elites' redistributive preferences may shape high levels of inequality in the U.S.</description>

      <title>Does Medicaid Expansion Lead to Income Adjustment? Evidence from the Survey of Income Program Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using monthly Survey of Income Program Participation (SIPP) data and a regression discontinuity (RD) design at the 138 percent Federal Poverty Line (FPL) threshold, this paper shows that childless adults in Medicaid expansion states lowered their lowest monthly earnings by about 39 FPL percentage points, equal to 700 dollars in 2025 for a two person household, to qualify for Medicaid. The response was largest when the individual mandate penalty was in effect and declined after the penalty was reduced to zero in 2019. Evidence from zero earnings months and hours worked indicates adjustments along both extensive and intensive margins. These results validate lowest monthly earnings as a practical eligibility measure and provide new evidence of substantial labor supply responses to the Affordable Care Act Medicaid notch.</description>

      <title>Racial bias, colorism, and overcorrection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines whether increased awareness can affect racial bias and colorism. We exploit a natural experiment from the widespread publicity of Price and Wolfers (2010), which intensified scrutiny of racial bias in men's basketball officiating. We investigate refereeing decisions in the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), an organization with a long-standing commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). We apply machine learning techniques to predict player race and to measure skin tone. Our empirical strategy exploits the quasi-random assignment of referees to games, combined with high-dimensional fixed effects, to estimate the relationship between referee-player racial and skin tone compositions and foul-calling behavior. We find no racial bias before the intense media coverage. However, we find evidence of overcorrection, whereby a player receives fewer fouls when facing more referees from the opposite race and skin tone. This overcorrection wears off over time, returning to zero-bias levels. We highlight the need to consider baseline levels of bias before applying any prescription with direct relevance to policymakers and organizations given the recent discourse on DEI.</description>

      <title>Machines are more productive than humans until they aren't, and vice versa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the growth of artificial skills, organizations are increasingly confronting with the problem of optimizing skill policy decisions guided by economic principles. This paper addresses the underlying complexity of this challenge by developing an in-silico framework based on Monte Carlo simulations grounded in empirical realism to analyze the economic impact of human and machine skills, individually or jointly deployed in the execution of tasks presenting varying levels of complexity. Our results provide quantitative support for the established notions that automation tends to be the most economically-effective strategy for tasks characterized by low-to-medium generalization difficulty, while automation may struggle to match the economic utility of human skills in more complex scenarios. Critically, our simulations highlight that, when high level of generalization is required and the cost of errors is high, combining human and machine skills can be the most effective strategy, but only if genuine augmentation is achieved. In contrast, when failing to realize this synergy, the human-machine policy is severely penalized by the inherent costs of its dual skill structure, causing it to destroy value and becoming the worst choice from an economic perspective. The takeaway for decision-makers is unambiguous: in complex and critical contexts, simply allocating human and machine skills to a task may be insufficient, and a human-machine skill policy is neither a silver-bullet solution nor a low-risk compromise. Rather, it is a critical opportunity to boost competitiveness that demands a strong organizational commitment to enabling augmentation. Also, our findings show that improving the cost-effectiveness of machine skills over time, while useful, does not replace the fundamental need to focus on achieving augmentation.</description>
