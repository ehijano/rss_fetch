      <title>The Inductive Coherator For Grothendieck Infinity Groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the theory of distributive series of monads of \cite{EC1} by extending the definition to include an $\bN$-indexed collection of monads. Under certain conditions, distributive series of monads will have a colimit in the category of pointed endofunctors. We define a \emph{completable} distributive series of monads to be a distributive series of monads whose induced pointed endofunctor, if it exists, lifts to a monad. We then construct factorization systems used to generate monads on the category of theories over $\Theta_0^\op$, in order to form two \emph{completable} distributive series of monads. The first completable distributive series of monads induces a monad that sends the identity theory over $\Theta_0^\op$ to an $(\infty,0)$-coherator whose inductive construction mimics inductive weak enrichment. The second completable distributive series of monads induces a monad that sends the identity theory over $\Theta_0^\op$ to a theory for strict $\infty$-groupoids.</description>

      <title>Coalgebraic models of Omega-groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate models of algebraic theories in the category of cocommutative coalgebras over a field. We establish some of their categorical properties, similar to those of algebraic varieties. We introduce a class of categories of coalgebraic models of algebraic theories endowed with an underlying structure of cocommutative Hopf algebra, and show that these categories are semi-abelian. We call them ``categories of Omega-Hopf algebras'', since it is possible to characterize them as coalgebraic models of algebraic theories of Omega-groups.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence between the existence of $n$-kernels and $n$-cokernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an elementary proof of the statement that if an idempotent complete additive category has weak kernels and weak cokernels, then it has $n$-kernels if and only if it has $n$-cokernels, where $n$ is a nonnegative integer. As a consequence, elementary proofs of two results concerning the equality between the global dimensions of certain right and left module categories are obtained.</description>

      <title>Classifying strict discrete opfibrations with lax morphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how discrete opfibration classifiers in a(n enhanced) 2-category can be endowed with the structure of a $T$-algebra and thereby lift to the enhanced 2-category of 2-algebras and lax morphisms. To support this study, we give a definition of discrete opfibration classifier in the enhanced setting in which tight (e.g. strict) discrete opfibrations are classified by loose (e.g. lax) maps.
  We then single out conditions on the 2-monad $T$ and the classifier that make this possible, and observe these hold in a wide range of examples: double categories (recovering the results of Par\`e and Lambert), (symmetric) monoidal categories, and all structures encoded by familial 2-monads. We also prove the properties needed on such 2-monads are stable under replacement by pseudo-algebra coclassifiers (when sufficient exactness conditions hold), allowing us to replace a pseudo-algebra structure on the classifier by a strict one.
  To get to our main theorem, we introduce the concepts of \emph{cartesian maps} and \emph{cartesian objects} of a 2-algebra, which generalize various other notions in category theory such as cartesian monoidal categories, extensive categories, categories with descent, and more. As a corollary, we characterize when representable copresheaves are pseudo rather than lax in terms of the cartesianity at their representing object.</description>

      <title>Sheaves on Quivers via a Grothendieck Topology on the Path Category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct Grothendieck topologies on the path category of a finite graph, examining both coarse and discrete cases that offer different perspectives on quiver representations. The coarse topology declares each vertex covered by all incoming morphisms, giving the minimal non-trivial Grothendieck topology where sheaves correspond to dual representations via dualization. The discrete topology is the finest possible, forcing sheaves to be locally constant with isomorphic restriction maps. We verify these satisfy Grothendieck's axioms, characterize their sheaf categories, and establish functorial relationships between them. Sheaves on the coarse site arise naturally from quiver representations through dualization, while discrete sheaves correspond to representations of the groupoid completion. This work suggests intermediate topologies could capture subtler representation-theoretic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Games as recursive coalgebras: A categorical view on the Nim-sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1901, Bouton proved that a winning strategy of the game of Nim is given by the bitwise XOR, called the nim-sum. But, why does such a weird binary operation work? Led by this question, this paper introduces a categorical reinterpretation of combinatorial games and the nim-sum. The main categorical gadget used here is recursive coalgebras, which allow us to redefine games as ``graphs on which we can conduct recursive calculation'' in a concise and precise way.
  For game-theorists, we provide a systematic framework to decompose an impartial game into simpler games and synthesize the quantities on them, which generalizes the nim-sum rule for the Conway addition. To read the first half of this paper, the categorical preliminaries are limited to the definitions of categories and functors.
  For category theorists, this paper offers a nicely behaved category of games $\mathbf{Games}$, which is a locally finitely presentable symmetric monoidal closed category comonadic over $\mathbf{Set}$ admitting a subobject classifier!
  As this paper has several ways to be developed, we list seven open questions in the final section.</description>

      <title>Left-exact Localizations of $\infty$-Topoi III: The Acyclic Product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a commutative monoid structure on the poset of left-exact localizations of a higher topos, that we call the acyclic product. Our approach is anchored in a structural analogy between the poset of left-exact localizations of a topos and the poset of ideals of a commutative ring. The acyclic product is analogous to the product of ideals. The sequence of powers of a given left-exact localization defines a tower of localizations. We show how this recovers the towers of Goodwillie calculus in the unstable homotopical setting. We use this to describe the topoi of $n$-excisive functors as classifying $n$-nilpotent objects.</description>

      <title>Monoidal closure of Grothendieck constructions via $\Sigma$-tractable monoidal structures and Dialectica formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07724v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the categorical structure of the Grothendieck construction $\Sigma_{\mathsf{C}}\mathsf{L}$ of an indexed category $\mathsf{L} \colon \mathsf{C}^{op} \to \mathsf{CAT}$. Our analysis begins with characterisations of fibred limits, colimits, and monoidal (closed) structures. The study of fibred colimits leads naturally to a generalisation of the notion of extensive indexed category introduced in CHAD for Expressive Total Languages, and gives rise to the concept of left Kan extensivity, which provides a uniform framework for computing colimits in Grothendieck constructions.
  We then establish sufficient conditions for the (non-fibred) monoidal closure of the total category $\Sigma_{\mathsf{C}}\mathsf{L}$. This extends G\"odel's Dialectica interpretation and rests upon a new notion of $\Sigma$-tractable monoidal structure. Under this notion, $\Sigma$-tractable coproducts unify and extend cocartesian coclosed structures, biproducts, and extensive coproducts. Finally, we consider when the induced closed structure is fibred, showing that this need not hold in general, even in the presence of a fibred monoidal structure.</description>

      <title>The algebraic small object argument as a saturation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02759v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the structure of left maps in algebraic weak factorization systems constructed using Garner's algebraic small object argument. We find that any left map can be constructed from generators in Bourke and Garner's double category of left maps by operations that parallel the classical cell-complex-forming operations of Quillen's small object argument (coproducts, cobase changes, transfinite composites, and retracts). Our main theorems are phrased as "saturation" principles, which express the closure conditions necessary for a given property or structure to extend from generators to all left maps. The core of the argument is an analysis of the construction of the free monad on a pointed endofunctor.</description>

      <title>Classical notions of computation and the Hasegawa-Thielecke theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the spirit of the Curry-Howard correspondence between proofs and programs, we define and study a syntax and semantics for classical logic equipped with a computationally involutive negation, using a polarised effect calculus, the linear classical L-calculus. A main challenge in designing a denotational semantics for the calculus is to accommodate both call-by-value and call-by-name evaluation strategies, which leads to a failure of associativity of composition. In order to tackle this issue, we define a notion of adjunction between graph morphisms on non-associative categories, which we use to formulate polarized and non-associative notions of symmetric monoidal closed duploid and of dialogue duploid. We show that they provide a direct style counterpart to adjunction models: linear effect adjunctions for the (linear) call-by-push-value calculus and dialogue chiralities for linear continuations, respectively. In particular, we show that the syntax of the linear classical L-calculus can be interpreted in any dialogue duploid, and that it defines in fact a syntactic dialogue duploid. As an application, we establish, by semantic as well as syntactic means, the Hasegawa-Thielecke theorem, which states that the notions of central map and of thunkable map coincide in any dialogue duploid (in particular, for any double negation monad on a symmetric monoidal category).</description>

      <title>Thomason cohomology and Quillen's Theorem A</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a functor $\varphi : \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ between two small categories, there is a homotopy equivalence $\kappa: hocolim _{\mathcal{D}} N(\varphi /-) \to N\mathcal{C}$ where $N(\varphi/-)$ is the functor which sends every object $d$ in $\mathcal{D}$ to the nerve of the comma category $\varphi/d$. We prove that the homotopy equivalence $\kappa$ induces an isomorphism on cohomology with coefficients in any coefficient system. As a consequence, we obtain a version of Quillen's Theorem A for the Thomason cohomology of categories. We also construct a spectral sequence for the Thomason cohomology of the Grothendieck construction $\int _{\mathcal{D}} F$ of a functor $F: \mathcal{D} \to Cat$ using the isomorphism in the main theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that any open 2-dimensional topological field theory valued in a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category (with suitable colimits) extends canonically to an open-closed field theory whose value at the circle is the Hochschild homology object of its value at the disk. As a corollary, we obtain an action of the moduli spaces of surfaces on the Hochschild homology object of $E_1$-Calabi-Yau algebras. This provides a space level refinement of previous work of Costello over $\mathbb{Q}$ and Wahl-Westerland and Wahl over $\mathbb{Z}$, and serves as a crucial ingredient to Lurie's "non-compact cobordism hypothesis" in dimension 2. As part of the proof we also give a description of slice categories of the d-dimensional bordism category with boundary, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Clifford algebra construction from the perspective of adjunctions motivated by the general framework of Krashen and Lieblich. We introduce a category of weighted polynomial laws whose associated Clifford algebra functor is a left adjoint on this category. We introduce a notion of lifting weighted polynomial laws generalizing explicit constructions of Krashen and Lieblich. As another application, we construct derived Clifford algebras of derived homogeneous polynomial forms of arbitrary degree with noncommutative coefficients.</description>
