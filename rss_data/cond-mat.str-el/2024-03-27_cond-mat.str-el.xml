      <title>Altermagnetism and superconductivity in a multiorbital t-J model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by exploring doped multi-orbital antiferromagnets (AFMs) and altermagnets (ALMs) we explore minimal $t$-$J$ models on the square-octagon lattice which favor such collinear magnetic orders in the regime where spin exchange dominates. While the AFM order breaks translational and time-reversal symmetries, the ALM state (equivalently, a `$d$-wave ferromagnet') features multipolar order which separately breaks time-reversal and crystal rotation symmetries but preserves their product leading to spin-split bands with zero net magnetization. We study the mean field phase diagram of these models as we vary doping and interactions, discovering regimes of weak and strong ALM order, superconductivity including uniform $s$-wave and $d$-wave pairing states, incipient $d$-wave pair density wave order, and phases with coexisting singlet-triplet pairing and AFM/ALM orders which appear unstable to phase separation and could host stripe order with longer-range interactions. Our results may be relevant to doping or pressure studies of multiorbital ALM materials.</description>

      <title>Origin of competing charge density waves in kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding competing charge density wave (CDW) orders in the bilayer kagome metal ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ remains a challenge. Experimentally, upon cooling, short-range CDW order with the wave vector $\mathbf{q}_{2}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{2})$ is observed, which is subsequently suppressed by the condensation of the long-range CDW order $\mathbf{q}_{3}=(\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3},\frac{1}{3})$ at lower temperature. In conflict with these observations, theoretical calculations overestimate the transition temperature by a few thousand Kelvin and incorrectly predict the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW order to be the ground state. Here, we develop a theory of CDW order in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$ based on anharmonic phonon-phonon calculations combined with density functional theory. We predict a temperature-driven phase transition from the high-temperature $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW to the low-temperature $\mathbf{q}_{3}$ CDW order, fully explaining experimental observations. Additionally, we clarify that both multi-phonon effects and semi-core electron states play a crucial role in stabilizing the $\mathbf{q}_{3}$ order. Finally, we construct a phase diagram of the competing CDWs in the lattice parameter space and demonstrate that the out-of-plane lattice parameter plays a pivotal role in manipulating the competing CDWs in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, motivating us to propose compressive bi-axial strain as an experimental protocol to stabilize the $\mathbf{q}_{2}$ CDW order. Our work provides a full theory of CDWs in ScV$_6$Sn$_6$, rationalizing experimental observations and resolving ealier discrepancies between theory and experiment. Overall, our work contributes to the wider effort of understanding CDWs in the kagome metal family.</description>

      <title>Tensor network formulation of symmetry protected topological phases in mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and classify symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in mixed states based on the tensor network formulation of the density matrix. In one dimension, we introduce strong injective matrix product density operators (MPDO), which describe a broad class of short-range correlated mixed states, including the locally decohered SPT states. We map strong injective MPDO to a pure state in the doubled Hilbert space and define the SPT phases according to the cohomology class of the symmetry group in the doubled state. Although the doubled state exhibits an enlarged symmetry, the possible SPT phases are also constrained by the Hermiticity and the semi-positivity of the density matrix. We here obtain a complete classification of SPT phases with a direct product of strong $G$ and weak $K$ unitary symmetry given by the cohomology group $\mathcal{H}^2(G, \text{U}(1))\oplus\mathcal{H}^1(K, \mathcal{H}^1(G, \text{U}(1)))$. The SPT phases in our definition are preserved under symmetric local circuits consisting of non-degenerate channels. This motivates an alternative definition of SPT phases according to the equivalence class of mixed states under a ``one-way" connection using symmetric non-degenerate channels. In locally purifiable MPDO with strong symmetry, we prove that this alternative definition reproduces the cohomology classification. We further extend our results to two-dimensional mixed states described by strong semi-injective tensor network density operators and classify the possible SPT phases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Liquids: Emergent higher-rank gauge theory and fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fracton emerges from strongly interacting many-body systems whose excitations, referred to as sub-dimensional particles, have restricted mobility or kinetic motions. These entities have garnered significant interest due to their interdisciplinary implications spanning topological quantum codes, quantum field theory, emergent gravity, quantum information, and more, revealing unique nonequilibrium behaviors such as nonergodicity and glassy dynamics. This review presents a structured and educational overview of fracton phenomena, specifically focusing on gapless fracton liquids. Noteworthy for their compressibility and gapless excitations, fracton liquids facilitate collective modes reminiscent of those gauge fluctuations found in Maxwell's electromagnetic framework. However, they are distinct due to an additional higher-moment conservation law that restricts the mobility of individual charges and monopoles. Our exploration begins with the theoretical foundation of 3D fracton liquids, presenting a variety of emergent symmetric tensor gauge theories and reviewing their equilibrium and dynamic properties. Following this theoretical groundwork, we discuss the material realization of various fracton liquids in Yb-based breathing pyrochlore lattices, close-packed tiling structures and other synthetic quantum matter platforms. Additionally, we introduce a general protocol to foster and manipulate emergent fracton spin liquids in the realm of frustrated magnetism.</description>

      <title>Magnetic vs. nonmagnetic polymorphs of RuBr$_3$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pressure evolution of the crystal structure and magnetism of the honeycomb $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ is studied using high-pressure x-ray diffraction, magnetometry, and density-functional band-structure calculations. Hydrostatic compression transforms antiferromagnetic $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ ($R\bar 3$) into paramagnetic $\alpha'$-RuBr$_3$ ($P\bar 1$) where short Ru-Ru bonds cause magnetism collapse above 1.3 GPa at 0 K and 2.5 GPa at 295 K. Below this critical pressure, the N\'eel temperature of $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ increases with the slope of 1.8 K/GPa. Pressure tunes $\alpha$-RuBr$_3$ away from the Kitaev limit, whereas increased third-neighbor in-plane coupling and interlayer coupling lead to a further stabilization of the collinear zigzag state. Both $\alpha$- and $\alpha'$-RuBr$_3$ are metastable at ambient pressure, but their transformation into the thermodynamically stable $\beta$-polymorph is kinetically hindered at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Spin-state ordering and intermediate states in the mixed-valence cobalt oxyborate Co$_3$O$_2$BO$_3$ with spin crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-state ordering - a periodic pattern of ions with different spin-state configurations along a crystal lattice - is a rare phenomenon, and its possible interrelation with other electronic degrees of freedom remains little explored. Here we perform a structural investigation of the mixed-valence Co homometallic ludwigite Co$_2^{2+}$Co$^{3+}$O$_2$BO$_3$. A superstructure consistent with a long-range Co$^{3+}$ spin-state ordering is observed between $T_{4}=580$ K and $T_{3}=510$ K. Intermediate states with mesoscopic correlations are detected below $T_{3}$ down to $T_{1}=480$ K with a change of dimensionality at $T_{2}=495$ K. The spin-state correlations are connected to the charge sector as revealed by the abrupt changes in the electrical resistance at $T_1$ and $T_2$. The evolution of the structural parameters below $T_{1}$ indicate that the spin crossover is ignited by a moderate degree of thermally-induced Co$^{2+}$/Co$^{3+}$ charge disorder. Charge and spin-state degrees of freedom can be interrelated in mixed-valence spin-crossover materials, leading to sharp transitions involving intermediate spin-state/charge correlated states at the mesoscale.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Edelstein Effect in Strongly Correlated Electron Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear spintronics, which combines nonlinear dynamics and spintronics, opens a new route for controlling spins and spin dynamics beyond conventional spintronics based on linear responses. Strongly correlated electron systems, which can have large nonlinear responses, are promising candidates for nonlinear spintronics. In this paper, we focus on the nonlinear Edelstein effect (NEE), a generalization of the Edelstein effect, and study the impact of electron correlations on the NEE by performing numerical calculations on a Hubbard model. We find that correlation effects can either enhance or suppress the nonlinear response. We show that the enhancement and suppression of the response are due to the real and imaginary components of the self-energy, respectively. Additionally, we have explored the relationship between the NEE and photomagnetic or optomagnetic effects. Our findings demonstrate that electron correlations can either enhance or suppress the optical spin injection, depending on the light frequency, while always strengthening the inverse Faraday effect.</description>

      <title>Multi-Triplon Excitations of Hubbard Ladders with Site-Dependent Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study low-lying spin-singlet excitations of two-leg Hubbard ladders with site-dependent potentials. Using general formulas of the charge disproportionation induced by the site-dependent potentials, we derive the contributions of spin degrees of freedom to the spectral functions such as the dynamical charge structure factor $N(\boldsymbol{k},\omega)$ and the optical conductivity $\sigma_{\gamma}(\omega)$ along the $\gamma(=x,y)$-direction of the two-leg ladders. Numerical results obtained by the Lanczos diagonalization method have clarified that the multi-triplon singlet states, including two- and three-triplon excitations, can be detected by observing these quantities. Furthermore, we have found that ladders with random potentials also have non-negligible contributions of these excitations to $\sigma_x(\omega)$.</description>

      <title>Critical Behavior of Non-Hermitian Kondo effect in Pseudogap System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The combination of non-Hermitian physics and strong correlation can yield numerous novel and intriguing effects. A previous study on the non-Hermitian Kondo model in ultra-cold atoms reports the reversion of the renormalization group flow. In this work, We investigate the non-Hermitian Kondo effect in system with special form of density of sates $\rho (\omega) \sim |\omega|^{r}(r&gt;0)$, which is called pseudogap system. We find that when $r&lt;1/2$, our conclusion from perturbative renormalization group theory aligns well with previous studies on the traditional pseudogap Kondo problem. In the case of $r$ being equal to $1/2$, a fixed point with reverse property appears in the renormalization group flow. When $r$ is lager than $1/2$, an unstable fixed point appears on the complex plane of the parameter space. Additionally, we validate the conclusions around renormalization group for the $r&lt;1/2$ interval using the large $N$ expansion method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the magnetic structure and properties of a thiocyanate-based honeycomb magnet [Na(OH$_2$)$_3$]Mn(NCS)$_3$ which crystallises in the unusual low-symmetry trigonal space group $P\overline{3}$. Magnetic measurements on powder samples show this material is an antiferromagnet (ordering temperature ($T_\mathrm{N,mag} = 18.1(6)\,$)K) and can be described by nearest neighbour antiferromagnetic interactions $J=-11.07(4)\,$K. A method for growing neutron-diffraction sized single crystals (\textgreater10 mm$^3$) is demonstrated. Low temperature neutron single crystal diffraction shows that the compound adopts the collinear antiferromagnetic structure with $T_\mathrm{N,neut}= 18.94(7)\,$K, magnetic space group $P \bar{3}'$. Low temperature second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurements provide no evidence of breaking of the centre of symmetry.</description>

      <title>Band Structure and Fermi Surface Nesting in $LaSb_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use high-resolution angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the electronic structure of the charge density wave (CDW) system LaSb$_2$. This compound is among an interesting group of materials that manifests both a CDW transition and lower temperature superconductivity. We find the DFT calculations to be in good agreement with our ARPES data. The Fermi surface of LaSb$_2$ consists of two small hole pockets close to $\Gamma$ and four larger pockets near the Brillouin zone (BZ) boundary. The overall features of the Fermi surface do not vary with temperature. A saddle point is present at -0.19 $eV$ below the Fermi level at $\Gamma$. Critical points in band structure have more pronounced effects on a materials properties when they are located closer to the Fermi level, making doped LaSb$_2$ compounds a potential interesting subject of future research. Multiple peaks are present in the generalized, electronic susceptibility calculations indicating the presence of possible nesting vectors. We were not able to detect any signatures of the CDW transition at 355 K, pointing to the subtle nature of this transition. This is unusual, given that such a high transition temperature is expected to be associated with the presence of a large CDW gap. This is confirmed through investigation of the Fermi surface and through analysis of momentum distribution curves (MDC). It is possible that changes are subtle and occur below current sensitivity of our measurements.</description>

      <title>Scaling tunnelling noise in the fractional quantum Hall effect tells about renormalization and breakdown of chiral Luttinger liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect provides a paradigmatic example of a topological phase of matter. FQH edges are theoretically described via models belonging to the class of chiral Luttinger liquid (CLL) theories [1 (Wen, 2007)]. These theories predict exotic properties of the excitations, such as fractional charge and fractional statistics. Despite theoretical confidence in this description and qualitative experimental confirmations, quantitative experimental evidence for CLL behaviour is scarce. In this work, we study tunnelling between edge modes in the quantum Hall regime at the filling factor $\nu=1/3$. We present measurements at different system temperatures and perform a novel scaling analysis of the experimental data, originally proposed in Ref. [2 (Schiller et al., 2022)]. Our analysis shows clear evidence of CLL breakdown - above a certain energy scale. In the low-energy regime, where the scaling behaviour holds, we extract the property called the scaling dimension and find it heavily renormalized compared to na\"ive CLL theory predictions. Our results show that decades-old experiments contain a lot of previously overlooked information that can be used to investigate the physics of quantum Hall edges. In particular, we open a road to quantitative experimental studies of (a) scaling dimension renormalization in quantum point contacts and (b) CLL breakdown mechanisms at an intermediate energy scale, much smaller than the bulk gap.</description>

      <title>Floquet Prethermal Order by Disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frustrated magnets can have accidental ground state degeneracies which may be lifted by various forms of disorder, for example in the form of thermal or quantum fluctuations. This order by disorder (ObD) paradigm is well established in equilibrium and here is generalized to Floquet many-body systems. Investigating a periodically-driven XXZ-compass model on the square lattice, we show that in a prethermal regime, dynamical fluctuations induced by high-frequency drives select a discrete set of states out of a degenerate ground state manifold of the lowest order Floquet Hamiltonian chosen as initial states. Remarkably, prior to the ObD selection, an unusual fluctuating regime emerges leading to a prethermalization timescale scaling linearly with the drive frequency. We argue that prethermal ObD with its unusual approach to the selected states is a generic phenomenon of driven frustrated systems and confirm it in the paradigmatic $J_1-J_2$ XX model.</description>

      <title>Superlattice induced electron percolation within a single Landau level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum Hall effect in a single Landau level in the presence of a square superlattice of $\delta$-function potentials. The interplay between the superlattice spacing $a_s$ and the magnetic length $\ell_B$ in clean system leads to three interesting characteristic regimes corresponding to $a_s \lt \ell_B$, $a_s \gg \ell_B$ and the intermediate one where $a_s \sim \ell_B$ . In the intermediate regime, the continuous magnetic translation symmetry breaks down to discrete lattice symmetry. In contrast, we show that in the other two regimes, the same is hardly broken in the topological band despite the presence of the superlattice. In the presence of weak disorder (white-noise) one typically expects a tiny fraction of extended states due to topological protection of the Landau level. Interestingly, we obtain a large fraction of extended states throughout the intermediate regime which maximizes at the special point $a_s = \sqrt{2\pi} \ell_B$. We argue the superlattice induced percolation phenomenon requires both the breaking of the time reversal symmetry and the continuous magnetic translational symmetry. It could have a direct implication on the integer plateau transitions in both continuous quantum Hall systems and the lattice based anomalous quantum Hall effect.</description>

A NiAs-type CrSe is one of the candidates owing to alternate stackings of Cr and Se triangular atomic networks in its crystal structure. While fabrication of CrSe thin films is indispensable to develop functional devices, studies on its thin-film properties have been limited to date due to the lack of metallic samples. Here, we report on realization of metallic conductivities of CrSe thin films, which allows to investigate their intrinsic magneto-transport properties. The metallic sample exhibits co-occurrence of a weak ferromagnetism with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and the antiferromagnetic behavior, indicating the presence of non-coplanar spin structures. In addition, control of polarity and tilting angle of the non-coplanar spin structure is accomplished by a sign of cooling magnetic fields. The observed non-coplanar spin structure, which can be a source of emergent magnetic field acting on the conducting electrons, highlights a high potential of the triangular lattice antiferromagnet and provide unique platform for functional thin-film devices composed of NiAs-type derivative Cr chalcogenides and pnictides.</description>

      <title>Determination of the dynamic Young's modulus of quantum materials in piezoactuator-driven uniaxial pressure cells using a low-frequency a.c. method</title>

Abstract: We report on a new technique for measuring the dynamic Young's modulus, $E$, of quantum materials at low temperatures as a function of static tuning strain, $\epsilon$, in piezoactuator-driven pressure cells. In addition to a static tuning of stress and strain, we apply a small-amplitude, finite-frequency a.c. (1 Hz$ \lesssim \omega \lesssim $1000 Hz) uniaxial stress, $\sigma_{ac}$, to the sample and measure the resulting a.c. strain, $\epsilon_{ac}$, using a capacitive sensor to obtain the associated modulus $E$. We demonstrate the performance of the new technique through proof-of-principle experiments on the unconventional superconductor Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, which is known for its rich temperature-strain phase diagram. In particular, we show that the magnitude of $E$, measured using this a.c. technique at low frequencies, exhibits a pronounced nonlinear elasticity, which is in very good agreement with previous Young's modulus measurements on Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under [100] strain using a d.c. method (Noad et al., Science 382, 447-450 (2023)). By combining the new a.c. Young's modulus measurements with a.c. elastocaloric measurements in a single measurement, we demonstrate that these a.c. techniques are powerful in detecting small anomalies in the elastic properties of quantum materials. Finally, using the case of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ as an example, we demonstrate how the imaginary component of the modulus can provide additional information about the nature of ordered phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose to adapt the precise definition of the flowing effective action in order to obtain a functional flow equation with simple properties close to physical intuition. The simplified flow equation is invariant under local gauge transformations and suitable for both euclidean and Minkowski signature and analytic continuation. The cutoff always removes fluctuations close to zeros of the inverse full propagator. A formulation of the simplified flow equation in terms of renormalized scale invariant fields permits direct access to scaling solutions and associated fixed points. Corrections to the simplified flow equation involve a field-dependent modification of the cutoff for which we discuss a systematic expansion. Truncated solutions for a scalar field theory in four dimensions suggest a new fixed point with a field-dependent coefficient of the kinetic term.</description>

      <title>Negative electronic compressibility in charge islands in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the observation of negative electronic compressibility in twisted bilayer graphene for Fermi energies close to insulating states. To observe this negative compressibility, we take advantage of naturally occurring twist angle domains that emerge during the fabrication of the samples, leading to the formation of charge islands. We accurately measure their capacitance using Coulomb oscillations, from which we infer the compressibility of the electron gas. Notably, we not only observe the negative electronic compressibility near correlated insulating states at integer filling, but also prominently near the band insulating state at full filling, located at the edges of both the flat- and remote bands. Furthermore, the individual twist angle domains yield a well-defined carrier density, enabling us to quantify the strength of electronic interactions and verify the theoretical prediction that the inverse negative capacitance contribution is proportional to the average distance between the charge carriers. A detailed analysis of our findings suggests that Wigner crystallization is the most likely explanation for the observed negative electronic compressibility.</description>

      <title>Experimental Realization of Discrete Time Quasi-Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet (periodically driven) systems can give rise to unique non-equilibrium phases of matter without equilibrium analogs. The most prominent example is the realization of discrete time crystals. An intriguing question emerges: what other novel phases can manifest when the constraint of time periodicity is relaxed? In this study, we explore quantum systems subjected to a quasi-periodic drive. Leveraging a strongly interacting spin ensemble in diamond, we identify the emergence of long-lived discrete time quasi-crystals. Unlike conventional time crystals, time quasi-crystals exhibit robust sub-harmonic responses at multiple incommensurate frequencies. Furthermore, we show that the multi-frequency nature of the quasi-periodic drive allows for the formation of diverse patterns associated with different discrete time quasi-crystalline phases. Our findings demonstrate the existence of non-equilibrium phases in quasi-Floquet settings, significantly broadening the catalog of novel phenomena in driven many-body quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Thermodynamics studies of a prototypical quasi-two-dimensional frustrated magnet Ba$_2$Sn$_2$ZnCr$_{7p}$Ga$_{10-7p}$O$_{22}$ where the magnetic Cr$^{3+}$ ions are arranged in a triangular network of bipyramids show that the magnetic zero-point entropy for $p=0.98$ is 55(1)\% of the entropy expected when the Cr$^{3+}$ moments are fully disordered. Furthermore, when combined with a previous neutron scattering study and the perimeter scaling entropy of a spin jam, the analysis reveals that with decreasing $p$, i.e., doping of the nonmagnetic Ga$^{3+}$ ions, the variation in the magnetic zero-point entropy can be well explained by the combined effects of the zero-point entropy of the spin jam state and that of weakly coupled orphan spins, shedding light on the coexistence of the two types of spin states in quantum magnetism.</description>

      <title>Chiral spin liquid and quantum phase diagram of spin-$1/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_{\chi}$ model on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice with the first and second nearest-neighbor antiferromagnetic couplings $J_1$, $J_2$, as well as the three-spin scalar chiral coupling $J_{\chi}$. Using density matrix renormalization group calculations, we obtain a quantum phase diagram of this system for $0 \leq J_2/J_1 \leq 1.0$ and $0 \leq J_{\chi}/J_1 \leq 1.5$. We identify the N\'eel and stripe magnetic order phase at small $J_{\chi}$ coupling. With growing $J_{\chi}$, we identify the emergent chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase characterized by the quantized spin Chern number $C = 1/2$ and entanglement spectrum with the quasidegenerate group of levels agreeing with chiral SU(2)$_1$ conformal field theory, which is an analog of the $\nu = 1/2$ Laughlin state in spin system. In the vicinity of the N\'eel and CSL phase boundary, our numerical results do not find evidence to support the phase coexistence of N\'eel order and topological order that was conjectured by mean-field calculations. In the larger $J_2$ and $J_{\chi}$ coupling regime, the entanglement spectrum of the ground state also exhibits the chiral quasidegeneracy consistent with a CSL, but the adiabatic flux insertion simulations fail to obtain the quantized Chern number. By analyzing the finite-size scaling of magnetic order parameter, we find the vanished magnetic order suggesting a magnetic disorder phase, whose nature needs further studies. Different from the spin-$1$ $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_\chi$ model, we do not find the coexistent stripe magnetic order and topological order. We also investigate the $J_{\chi}$ dominant regime and find a strong tendency of the system to develop a dimer order rather than the chiral spin magnetic order observed in the spin-$1$ model.</description>

      <title>Exact functional integration of radial and complex slave-boson fields: thermodynamics and dynamics of the two-site extended Hubbard model</title>

Abstract: The functional integral formulation of the Hubbard model when treated in its Kotliar-Ruckenstein representation in the radial gauge involves fermionic, as well as complex and radial slave boson fields. In order to improve on the understanding of the interplay of the three types of fields, and on the nature of the latter, we perform a comprehensive investigation of an exactly solvable two-site cluster, as it entails all pitfalls embodied in this approach. It is first shown that the exact partition function is recovered, even when incorporating in the calculation the square root factors that are at the heart of the representation, when suitably regularized. We show that using radial slave boson fields allows to overcome all hurdles following from the normal ordering procedure. We then demonstrate that this applies to the Green's function as well, and to the correlation functions of physical interest, thereby answering the criticisms raised by Sch\"onhammer [K. Sch\"onhammer, Phys. Rev. B 1990, 42, 2591]. In addition, the investigation generalizes the calculations to the Hubbard model extended by a non-local Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Charge Collective Modes in Correlated Electron Systems: Plasmons Beyond the Random Phase Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elucidating the impact of strong electronic interactions on the collective excitations of metallic systems has been of longstanding interest, mainly due to the inadequacy of the random phase approximation (RPA) in the strongly correlated regime. Here, we adopt our newly developed radial Kotliar and Ruckenstein slave boson representation to analyze the charge excitation spectrum of a Hubbard model, extended with long range interactions. Working on the face centered cubic lattice, at half filling, and in different coupling regimes ranging from uncorrelated to the metal-to-insulator transition, we compare our results to conventional RPA as a benchmark. We focus on the influence of the local and long range couplings on the particle-hole excitation continuum and the plasmon and upper Hubbard band collective modes. Beyond the weak coupling regime, we find numerous quantitative and even qualitative discrepancies between our method and standard RPA. Our work thus deepens our understanding of charge collective modes in correlated systems, and lays the foundations for future studies of realistic materials.</description>

      <title>Minimal Fractional Topological Insulator in half-filled conjugate moir\'{e} Chern bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a "minimal" fractional topological insulator (mFTI), motivated by the recent experimental report on the signatures of FTI at total filling factor $\nu_{\rm tot} = 3$ in a transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'{e} system. The observed FTI at $\nu_{\rm tot} = 3$ is likely given by a topological state living in a pair of half-filled conjugate Chern bands with Chern numbers $C=\pm 1$ on top of another pair of fully-filled conjugate Chern bands. We propose the mFTI as a strong candidate topological state in the half-filled conjugate Chern bands. The mFTI is characterized by the following features: (1) It is a fully gapped topological order (TO) with 16 Abelian anyons if the electron is considered trivial (32 including electrons); (2) the minimally-charged anyon carries electric charge $e^\ast = e/2$, together with the fractional quantum spin-Hall conductivity, implying the robustness of the mFTI's gapless edge state whenever time-reversal symmetry and charge conversation are present; (3) the mFTI is "minimal" in the sense that it has the smallest total quantum dimension (a metric for the TO's complexity) within all the TOs that can potentially be realized at the same electron filling and with the same Hall transports; the mFTI is also the unique one that respects time-reversal symmetry. (4) the mFTI is the common descendant of multiple valley-decoupled "product TOs" with larger quantum dimensions. It can also be viewed as the result of gauging multiple symmetry-protected topological states. Similar mFTIs can be constructed for a pair of $1/q$-filled conjugate Chern bands. We classify the mFTIs via the stability of the gapless interfaces between them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear temperature dependence of transport coefficients in metals is habitually ascribed to non-Fermi-liquid physics. Here we establish the T-linear behavior for 2D electron fluids, systems in which carrier collisions assist conduction, leading to resistance decreasing with temperature. This behavior originates from exotic hydrodynamics described by Fermi surface modulations evolving in space and time in an amoeba-like loop manner that features a large family of long-lived excitations manifest as multiple viscous modes. A cascade of these modes results in a linear T dependence that extends down to lowest temperatures, as well as a Kolmogorov-like fractional power -5/3 scaling of conductivity vs. wavenumber. These dependences provide a smoking gun for nonclassical hydrodynamics and are expected to be generic for strongly-correlated 2D systems with simple near-circular Fermi surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the interplay of fractal geometry and quantum entanglement by analyzing the von Neumann entropy (known as entanglement entropy) and the entanglement contour in the scaling limit. Focusing on free-fermion quantum models known for their simplicity and effectiveness in studying highly entangled quantum systems, we uncover intriguing findings. For gapless ground states exhibiting a finite density of states at the chemical potential, we reveal a super-area law characterized by the presence of a logarithmic divergence in the entanglement entropy. This extends the well-established super-area law observed on translationally invariant Euclidean lattices where the Gioev-Klich-Widom conjecture regarding the asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices holds significant influence. Furthermore, we observe the emergence of a self-similar and universal pattern termed an ``entanglement fractal'' in the entanglement contour data as we approach the scaling limit. Remarkably, this pattern bears resemblance to intricate Chinese paper-cutting designs. We provide general rules to artificially generate this fractal, offering insights into the universal scaling of entanglement entropy. Building upon the insights gained from the entanglement fractal, we explicitly elucidate the origin of the logarithmic divergence on fractals where translation symmetry is broken and the Widom conjecture is inapplicable. For gapped ground states, we observe that the entanglement entropy adheres to a generalized area law, with its dependence on the Hausdorff dimension of the boundary between complementary subsystems.</description>

      <title>Electronic Phase Propagation Speed in BaFe$_2$As$_2$ Revealed by Dilatometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18442v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermal expansion offers deep insights into phase transitions in condensed matter physics. Utilizing an advanced AC-temperature dilatometer with picometer resolution, this study clearly resolves the antiferromagnetic and structural transition in BaFe$_2$As$_2$. The implementation of temperature oscillation reveals a hysteresis near the transition temperature $T_\mathrm{N}$ with unprecedented resolution. Unexpectedly, we find that the hysteretic width exhibits a universal dependence on the parameters of temperature oscillation and the sample's longidutinal dimension, which in turn reveals a finite transition speed. Our quantitative analysis shows that this phase boundary propagates at a mere 188 $\mu$m/s - a speed seven orders of magnitude slower than acoustic waves. It suggests a hidden thermodynamic constraint imposed by the electronic degrees of freedom. Our research not only sheds light on the dynamics of phase transitions between different correlated phases, but also establishes high precision dilatometry as a powerful tool for material studies. This measurement technique, when properly modified, can be extended to studies of other material properties such as piezoelectric, magneto-restriction, elastic modulus, etc.</description>

      <title>Prediction of $s^\pm$-wave superconductivity enhanced by electronic doping in trilayer nickelates La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently reported signatures of superconductivity in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure, we comprehensively study this system using {\it ab initio} and random-phase approximation techniques. Without electronic interactions, the Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals show a bonding-antibonding and nonbonding splitting behavior via the O $p_z$ orbitals inducing a ``trimer'' lattice in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, analogous to the dimers of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$. The Fermi surface consists of three electron sheets with mixed $e_g$ orbitals, and a hole and an electron pocket made up of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital, suggesting a Ni two-orbital minimum model. In addition, we find that superconducting pairing is induced in the $s^{\pm}$-wave channel due to partial nesting between the {\bf M}=$(\pi, \pi)$ centered pockets and portions of the Fermi surface centered at the {\bf $\Gamma$}=$(0, 0)$ point. With changing electronic density $n$, the $s^\pm$ instability remains leading and its pairing strength shows a dome-like behavior with a maximum around $n = 4.2$ ($\sim 6.7\%$ electron doping). The superconducting instability disappears at the same electronic density as that in the new 1313 stacking La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, correlated with the vanishing of the hole pocket that arises from the trilayer sublattice, suggesting that the high-$T_c$ superconductivity of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ may $not$ originate from a trilayer- and single-layer structure. Furthermore, we predict an interesting spin-density-wave state in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ with an in-plane ($\pi$, $\pi$) order and antiferromagnetic coupling between the top and bottom Ni layers, while the middle layer has spin zero.</description>
