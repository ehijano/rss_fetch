      <title>Lambert's problem in orbital dynamics: a self--contained introduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lambert's problem is a classical boundary value problem in analytical mechanics. It arises when trying to determine the energy required to place a particle, subject to a central gravitational potential, in a free fall trajectory connecting two given points on a desired travel time. Due to its mathematical beauty and its relevance in aerospace engineering, it has been and remains the object of attention of countless engineers, mathematicians (pure and applied), and physicists seeking to produce efficient solution algorithms. In this expository article, didactic in nature, we present a unified and comprehensive derivation that assumes only a minimal background in physics and mathematics. We focus on the simplest two--body case and carefully develop the argument for elliptical trajectories. The goal is to provide a single reference that can serve as an accelerated introduction for students and researchers interested in a quick introduction to the subject.</description>

      <title>Nethotrons: exploring the possibility of measuring relativistic spin precessions, from Earth's satellites to the Galactic Centre</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By ``nethotrons'', from the ancient Greek verb for to ``spin'', it is meant here a natural or artificial rotating object, like a pulsar or an artificial satellite, whose rotational axis is cumulatively displaced by the post-Newtonian static (gravitoelectric) and stationary (gravitomagnetic) components of the gravitational field of some massive body around which it freely moves. Until now, both relativistic effects have been measured only by the dedicated space-based mission Gravity Probe B in the terrestrial environment. It detected the gravitoelectric de Sitter and gravitomagnetic Pugh-Schiff spin precessions of four superconducting gyroscopes accumulated in a year after about 50 years from conception to completion of data analysis at a cost of 750 million dollars to $0.3$ and $19$ per cent accuracy, respectively. The perspectives to measure them also with long-lived Earth's laser-ranged geodetic satellites, like those of the LAGEOS family or possibly one or more of them to be built specifically from scratch, and pulsars orbiting the supermassive black hole in the Galactic Centre, yet to be discovered, are preliminarily investigated. The double pulsar PSR J0737-3039A/B is examined as well.</description>
