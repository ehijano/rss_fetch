      <title>PyPotteryInk: One-Step Diffusion Model for Sketch to Publication-ready Archaeological Drawings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Archaeological pottery documentation traditionally requires a time-consuming manual process of converting pencil sketches into publication-ready inked drawings. I present PyPotteryInk, an open-source automated pipeline that transforms archaeological pottery sketches into standardised publication-ready drawings using a one-step diffusion model. Built on a modified img2img-turbo architecture, the system processes drawings in a single forward pass while preserving crucial morphological details and maintaining archaeologic documentation standards and analytical value. The model employs an efficient patch-based approach with dynamic overlap, enabling high-resolution output regardless of input drawing size. I demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach on a dataset of Italian protohistoric pottery drawings, where it successfully captures both fine details like decorative patterns and structural elements like vessel profiles or handling elements. Expert evaluation confirms that the generated drawings meet publication standards while significantly reducing processing time from hours to seconds per drawing. The model can be fine-tuned to adapt to different archaeological contexts with minimal training data, making it versatile across various pottery documentation styles. The pre-trained models, the Python library and comprehensive documentation are provided to facilitate adoption within the archaeological research community.</description>

      <title>MeshSplats: Mesh-Based Rendering with Gaussian Splatting Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) is a recent and pivotal technique in 3D computer graphics. GS-based algorithms almost always bypass classical methods such as ray tracing, which offers numerous inherent advantages for rendering. For example, ray tracing is able to handle incoherent rays for advanced lighting effects, including shadows and reflections. To address this limitation, we introduce MeshSplats, a method which converts GS to a mesh-like format. Following the completion of training, MeshSplats transforms Gaussian elements into mesh faces, enabling rendering using ray tracing methods with all their associated benefits. Our model can be utilized immediately following transformation, yielding a mesh of slightly reduced quality without additional training. Furthermore, we can enhance the reconstruction quality through the application of a dedicated optimization algorithm that operates on mesh faces rather than Gaussian components. The efficacy of our method is substantiated by experimental results, underscoring its extensive applications in computer graphics and image processing.</description>

      <title>Prompt-Aware Scheduling for Efficient Text-to-Image Inferencing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional ML models utilize controlled approximations during high loads, employing faster, but less accurate models in a process called accuracy scaling. However, this method is less effective for generative text-to-image models due to their sensitivity to input prompts and performance degradation caused by large model loading overheads. This work introduces a novel text-to-image inference system that optimally matches prompts across multiple instances of the same model operating at various approximation levels to deliver high-quality images under high loads and fixed budgets.</description>

      <title>Efficient Diffusion Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative models capable of producing high-quality contents such as images, videos, and audio, demonstrating their potential to revolutionize digital content creation. However, these capabilities come at the cost of their significant computational resources and lengthy generation time, underscoring the critical need to develop efficient techniques for practical deployment. In this survey, we provide a systematic and comprehensive review of research on efficient diffusion models. We organize the literature in a taxonomy consisting of three main categories, covering distinct yet interconnected efficient diffusion model topics from algorithm-level, system-level, and framework perspective, respectively. We have also created a GitHub repository where we organize the papers featured in this survey at https://github.com/AIoT-MLSys-Lab/Efficient-Diffusion-Model-Survey. We hope our survey can serve as a valuable resource to help researchers and practitioners gain a systematic understanding of efficient diffusion model research and inspire them to contribute to this important and exciting field.</description>

      <title>Harness Local Rewards for Global Benefits: Effective Text-to-Video Generation Alignment with Patch-level Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of diffusion models (DMs) has significantly improved the quality of text-to-video generation models (VGMs). However, current VGM optimization primarily emphasizes the global quality of videos, overlooking localized errors, which leads to suboptimal generation capabilities. To address this issue, we propose a post-training strategy for VGMs, HALO, which explicitly incorporates local feedback from a patch reward model, providing detailed and comprehensive training signals with the video reward model for advanced VGM optimization. To develop an effective patch reward model, we distill GPT-4o to continuously train our video reward model, which enhances training efficiency and ensures consistency between video and patch reward distributions. Furthermore, to harmoniously integrate patch rewards into VGM optimization, we introduce a granular DPO (Gran-DPO) algorithm for DMs, allowing collaborative use of both patch and video rewards during the optimization process. Experimental results indicate that our patch reward model aligns well with human annotations and HALO substantially outperforms the baselines across two evaluation methods. Further experiments quantitatively prove the existence of patch defects, and our proposed method could effectively alleviate this issue.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Lavender, a simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) method that boosts the performance of advanced vision-language models (VLMs) by leveraging state-of-the-art image generation models such as Stable Diffusion. Specifically, Lavender aligns the text-vision attention in the VLM transformer with the equivalent used by Stable Diffusion during SFT, instead of adapting separate encoders. This alignment enriches the model's visual understanding and significantly boosts performance across in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Lavender requires just 0.13 million training examples, 2.5% of typical large-scale SFT datasets, and fine-tunes on standard hardware (8 GPUs) in a single day. It consistently improves state-of-the-art open-source multimodal LLMs (e.g., Llama-3.2-11B, MiniCPM-Llama3-v2.5), achieving up to 30% gains and a 68% boost on challenging out-of-distribution medical QA tasks. By efficiently transferring the visual expertise of image generators with minimal supervision, Lavender offers a scalable solution for more accurate vision-language systems. All code, training data, and models will be shared at https://astrazeneca.github.io/vlm/.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-empowered AutoPrompt MedSAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MedSAM, a medical foundation model derived from the SAM architecture, has demonstrated notable success across diverse medical domains. However, its clinical application faces two major challenges: the dependency on labor-intensive manual prompt generation, which imposes a significant burden on clinicians, and the absence of semantic labeling in the generated segmentation masks for organs or lesions, limiting its practicality for non-expert users. To address these limitations, we propose AutoMedSAM, an end-to-end framework derived from SAM, designed to enhance usability and segmentation performance. AutoMedSAM retains MedSAM's image encoder and mask decoder structure while introducing a novel diffusion-based class prompt encoder. The diffusion-based encoder employs a dual-decoder structure to collaboratively generate prompt embeddings guided by sparse and dense prompt definitions. These embeddings enhance the model's ability to understand and process clinical imagery autonomously. With this encoder, AutoMedSAM leverages class prompts to embed semantic information into the model's predictions, transforming MedSAM's semi-automated pipeline into a fully automated workflow. Furthermore, AutoMedSAM employs an uncertainty-aware joint optimization strategy during training to effectively inherit MedSAM's pre-trained knowledge while improving generalization by integrating multiple loss functions. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate that AutoMedSAM achieves superior performance while broadening its applicability to both clinical settings and non-expert users. Code is available at https://github.com/HP-ML/AutoPromptMedSAM.git.</description>

      <title>Functional 3D Scene Synthesis through Human-Scene Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel generative approach that outputs 3D indoor environments solely from a textual description of the scene. Current methods often treat scene synthesis as a mere layout prediction task, leading to rooms with overlapping objects or overly structured scenes, with limited consideration of the practical usability of the generated environment. Instead, our approach is based on a simple, but effective principle: we condition scene synthesis to generate rooms that are usable by humans. This principle is implemented by synthesizing 3D humans that interact with the objects composing the scene. If this human-centric scene generation is viable, the room layout is functional and it leads to a more coherent 3D structure. To this end, we propose a novel method for functional 3D scene synthesis, which consists of reasoning, 3D assembling and optimization. We regard text guided 3D synthesis as a reasoning process by generating a scene graph via a graph diffusion network. Considering object functional co-occurrence, a new strategy is designed to better accommodate human-object interaction and avoidance, achieving human-aware 3D scene optimization. We conduct both qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate the effectiveness of our method in generating coherent 3D scene synthesis results.</description>

      <title>DiffListener: Discrete Diffusion Model for Listener Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The listener head generation (LHG) task aims to generate natural nonverbal listener responses based on the speaker's multimodal cues. While prior work either rely on limited modalities (e.g. audio and facial information) or employ autoregressive approaches which have limitations such as accumulating prediction errors. To address these limitations, we propose DiffListener, a discrete diffusion based approach for non-autoregressive listener head generation. Our model takes the speaker's facial information, audio, and text as inputs, additionally incorporating facial differential information to represent the temporal dynamics of expressions and movements. With this explicit modeling of facial dynamics, DiffListener can generate coherent reaction sequences in a non-autoregressive manner. Through comprehensive experiments, DiffListener demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. The user study shows that DiffListener generates natural context-aware listener reactions that are well synchronized with the speaker. The code and demo videos are available in https://siyeoljung.github.io/DiffListener</description>

      <title>CTR-Driven Advertising Image Generation with Multimodal Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In web data, advertising images are crucial for capturing user attention and improving advertising effectiveness. Most existing methods generate background for products primarily focus on the aesthetic quality, which may fail to achieve satisfactory online performance. To address this limitation, we explore the use of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for generating advertising images by optimizing for Click-Through Rate (CTR) as the primary objective. Firstly, we build targeted pre-training tasks, and leverage a large-scale e-commerce multimodal dataset to equip MLLMs with initial capabilities for advertising image generation tasks. To further improve the CTR of generated images, we propose a novel reward model to fine-tune pre-trained MLLMs through Reinforcement Learning (RL), which can jointly utilize multimodal features and accurately reflect user click preferences. Meanwhile, a product-centric preference optimization strategy is developed to ensure that the generated background content aligns with the product characteristics after fine-tuning, enhancing the overall relevance and effectiveness of the advertising images. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both online and offline metrics. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/Chenguoz/CAIG.</description>

      <title>Learning to Synthesize Compatible Fashion Items Using Semantic Alignment and Collocation Classification: An Outfit Generation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of fashion compatibility learning has attracted great attention from both the academic and industrial communities in recent years. Many studies have been carried out for fashion compatibility prediction, collocated outfit recommendation, artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled compatible fashion design, and related topics. In particular, AI-enabled compatible fashion design can be used to synthesize compatible fashion items or outfits in order to improve the design experience for designers or the efficacy of recommendations for customers. However, previous generative models for collocated fashion synthesis have generally focused on the image-to-image translation between fashion items of upper and lower clothing. In this paper, we propose a novel outfit generation framework, i.e., OutfitGAN, with the aim of synthesizing a set of complementary items to compose an entire outfit, given one extant fashion item and reference masks of target synthesized items. OutfitGAN includes a semantic alignment module, which is responsible for characterizing the mapping correspondence between the existing fashion items and the synthesized ones, to improve the quality of the synthesized images, and a collocation classification module, which is used to improve the compatibility of a synthesized outfit. In order to evaluate the performance of our proposed models, we built a large-scale dataset consisting of 20,000 fashion outfits. Extensive experimental results on this dataset show that our OutfitGAN can synthesize photo-realistic outfits and outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of similarity, authenticity and compatibility measurements.</description>

      <title>AutoSketch: VLM-assisted Style-Aware Vector Sketch Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to automatically complete a partial sketch that depicts a complex scene, e.g., "a woman chatting with a man in the park", is very useful. However, existing sketch generation methods create sketches from scratch; they do not complete a partial sketch in the style of the original. To address this challenge, we introduce AutoSketch, a styleaware vector sketch completion method that accommodates diverse sketch styles. Our key observation is that the style descriptions of a sketch in natural language preserve the style during automatic sketch completion. Thus, we use a pretrained vision-language model (VLM) to describe the styles of the partial sketches in natural language and replicate these styles using newly generated strokes. We initially optimize the strokes to match an input prompt augmented by style descriptions extracted from the VLM. Such descriptions allow the method to establish a diffusion prior in close alignment with that of the partial sketch. Next, we utilize the VLM to generate an executable style adjustment code that adjusts the strokes to conform to the desired style. We compare our method with existing methods across various sketch styles and prompts, performed extensive ablation studies and qualitative and quantitative evaluations, and demonstrate that AutoSketch can support various sketch scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PrismAvatar: a 3D head avatar model which is designed specifically to enable real-time animation and rendering on resource-constrained edge devices, while still enjoying the benefits of neural volumetric rendering at training time. By integrating a rigged prism lattice with a 3D morphable head model, we use a hybrid rendering model to simultaneously reconstruct a mesh-based head and a deformable NeRF model for regions not represented by the 3DMM. We then distill the deformable NeRF into a rigged mesh and neural textures, which can be animated and rendered efficiently within the constraints of the traditional triangle rendering pipeline. In addition to running at 60 fps with low memory usage on mobile devices, we find that our trained models have comparable quality to state-of-the-art 3D avatar models on desktop devices.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Multi-Human Neural Rendering Using Geometry Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a method for recovering the shape and radiance of a scene consisting of multiple people given solely a few images. Multi-human scenes are complex due to additional occlusion and clutter. For single-human settings, existing approaches using implicit neural representations have achieved impressive results that deliver accurate geometry and appearance. However, it remains challenging to extend these methods for estimating multiple humans from sparse views. We propose a neural implicit reconstruction method that addresses the inherent challenges of this task through the following contributions: First, we propose to use geometry constraints by exploiting pre-computed meshes using a human body model (SMPL). Specifically, we regularize the signed distances using the SMPL mesh and leverage bounding boxes for improved rendering. Second, we propose a ray regularization scheme to minimize rendering inconsistencies, and a saturation regularization for robust optimization in variable illumination. Extensive experiments on both real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the benefits of our approach and show state-of-the-art performance against existing neural reconstruction methods.</description>

      <title>Parametric type design in the era of variable and color fonts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric fonts are programatically defined fonts with variable parameters, pioneered by Donald Kunth with his MetaFont technology in the 1980s. While Donald Knuth's ideas in MetaFont and subsequently in MetaPost are often seen as legacy techniques from the pre-graphical user interface (GUI) era of type design, recent trends like variable fonts suggest a resurgence of certain principles. This paper explores a modern type design process built on parametric design principles, specifically using MetaPost. The author created two variable fonts with this method and released them under a free, open-source license. The paper details the methodology, workflow, and insights gained from this process.</description>

      <title>Multi-directional Backlighting Compressive Light Field Displays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a compressive light field display of a wide viewing angle with a multi-directional backlight. Displayed layer images of sub-viewing zones are synchronized with the multi-directional backlight. Viewers can perceive a three-dimensional scene with a large viewing angle based on the persistence of vision.</description>

      <title>MatSwap: Light-aware material transfers in images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present MatSwap, a method to transfer materials to designated surfaces in an image photorealistically. Such a task is non-trivial due to the large entanglement of material appearance, geometry, and lighting in a photograph. In the literature, material editing methods typically rely on either cumbersome text engineering or extensive manual annotations requiring artist knowledge and 3D scene properties that are impractical to obtain. In contrast, we propose to directly learn the relationship between the input material -- as observed on a flat surface -- and its appearance within the scene, without the need for explicit UV mapping. To achieve this, we rely on a custom light- and geometry-aware diffusion model. We fine-tune a large-scale pre-trained text-to-image model for material transfer using our synthetic dataset, preserving its strong priors to ensure effective generalization to real images. As a result, our method seamlessly integrates a desired material into the target location in the photograph while retaining the identity of the scene. We evaluate our method on synthetic and real images and show that it compares favorably to recent work both qualitatively and quantitatively. We will release our code and data upon publication.</description>

      <title>Pippo: High-Resolution Multi-View Humans from a Single Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Pippo, a generative model capable of producing 1K resolution dense turnaround videos of a person from a single casually clicked photo. Pippo is a multi-view diffusion transformer and does not require any additional inputs - e.g., a fitted parametric model or camera parameters of the input image. We pre-train Pippo on 3B human images without captions, and conduct multi-view mid-training and post-training on studio captured humans. During mid-training, to quickly absorb the studio dataset, we denoise several (up to 48) views at low-resolution, and encode target cameras coarsely using a shallow MLP. During post-training, we denoise fewer views at high-resolution and use pixel-aligned controls (e.g., Spatial anchor and Plucker rays) to enable 3D consistent generations. At inference, we propose an attention biasing technique that allows Pippo to simultaneously generate greater than 5 times as many views as seen during training. Finally, we also introduce an improved metric to evaluate 3D consistency of multi-view generations, and show that Pippo outperforms existing works on multi-view human generation from a single image.</description>

      <title>DreamCatalyst: Fast and High-Quality 3D Editing via Controlling Editability and Identity Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score distillation sampling (SDS) has emerged as an effective framework in text-driven 3D editing tasks, leveraging diffusion models for 3D-consistent editing. However, existing SDS-based 3D editing methods suffer from long training times and produce low-quality results. We identify that the root cause of this performance degradation is \textit{their conflict with the sampling dynamics of diffusion models}. Addressing this conflict allows us to treat SDS as a diffusion reverse process for 3D editing via sampling from data space. In contrast, existing methods naively distill the score function using diffusion models. From these insights, we propose DreamCatalyst, a novel framework that considers these sampling dynamics in the SDS framework. Specifically, we devise the optimization process of our DreamCatalyst to approximate the diffusion reverse process in editing tasks, thereby aligning with diffusion sampling dynamics. As a result, DreamCatalyst successfully reduces training time and improves editing quality. Our method offers two modes: (1) a fast mode that edits Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) scenes approximately 23 times faster than current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods, and (2) a high-quality mode that produces superior results about 8 times faster than these methods. Notably, our high-quality mode outperforms current state-of-the-art NeRF editing methods in terms of both speed and quality. DreamCatalyst also surpasses the state-of-the-art 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) editing methods, establishing itself as an effective and model-agnostic 3D editing solution.

      <title>MeshUp: Multi-Target Mesh Deformation via Blended Score Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14899v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose MeshUp, a technique that deforms a 3D mesh towards multiple target concepts, and intuitively controls the region where each concept is expressed. Conveniently, the concepts can be defined as either text queries, e.g., "a dog" and "a turtle," or inspirational images, and the local regions can be selected as any number of vertices on the mesh. We can effectively control the influence of the concepts and mix them together using a novel score distillation approach, referred to as the Blended Score Distillation (BSD). BSD operates on each attention layer of the denoising U-Net of a diffusion model as it extracts and injects the per-objective activations into a unified denoising pipeline from which the deformation gradients are calculated. To localize the expression of these activations, we create a probabilistic Region of Interest (ROI) map on the surface of the mesh, and turn it into 3D-consistent masks that we use to control the expression of these activations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BSD empirically and show that it can deform various meshes towards multiple objectives. Our project page is at https://threedle.github.io/MeshUp.</description>

      <title>SpaceMesh: A Continuous Representation for Learning Manifold Surface Meshes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Meshes are ubiquitous in visual computing and simulation, yet most existing machine learning techniques represent meshes only indirectly, e.g. as the level set of a scalar field or deformation of a template, or as a disordered triangle soup lacking local structure. This work presents a scheme to directly generate manifold, polygonal meshes of complex connectivity as the output of a neural network. Our key innovation is to define a continuous latent connectivity space at each mesh vertex, which implies the discrete mesh. In particular, our vertex embeddings generate cyclic neighbor relationships in a halfedge mesh representation, which gives a guarantee of edge-manifoldness and the ability to represent general polygonal meshes. This representation is well-suited to machine learning and stochastic optimization, without restriction on connectivity or topology. We first explore the basic properties of this representation, then use it to fit distributions of meshes from large datasets. The resulting models generate diverse meshes with tessellation structure learned from the dataset population, with concise details and high-quality mesh elements. In applications, this approach not only yields high-quality outputs from generative models, but also enables directly learning challenging geometry processing tasks such as mesh repair.</description>
