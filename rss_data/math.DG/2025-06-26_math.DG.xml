      <title>On the space of metrics with non-positive curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{M} (X)$ denote the space of complete Riemannian metrics with non-positive sectional curvature and with negatively curved ends, on a manifold $X$. We show that $\mathcal{M} (\mathbb{R} \times S ^{1}) $ and $\mathcal{M} (\mathbb{R} ^{} \times Y)$ are path disconnected, where $Y$ is compact and admits a negative curvature metric. The proof is very concise, using as the main ingredient Fuller index theory. Furthermore, we get a new metric deformation invariant based on geodesic string counting, and this gives a basic tool (likely to be very extendable) to further study the topology of $\mathcal{M} (X)$.</description>

      <title>Application of Chern-Simons gauge theory to the enclosed volume of constant mean curvature surfaces in the 3-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on Hitchin's work of the Wess-Zumino-Witten term for harmonic maps into Lie groups, we derive a formula for the enclosed volume of a compact CMC surface $f$ in $\mathbb S^3$ in terms of a holonomy on the Chern-Simons bundle and the Willmore functional. By construction the enclosed volume only depends on the gauge classes of the associated family of flat connections of $f$. In this paper we show in various examples the effectiveness of this formula, in particular for surfaces of genus $g\geq2.$</description>

      <title>On geometry of $Q^{(2k)}_g$-curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of current article is to study the geometry of $Q$-curvature. For simplicity, we start with a very simple model: a complete and conformal metric $g=e^{2u}|dx|^2$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We assume the metric $g$ has non-negative $nth$-order $Q$-curvature and non-negative scalar curvature. We show that the Ricci curvature is non-negative. We further assume that the metric $g$ is not degenerate in the sense that the isoperimetric ratio near the end is positive. With this extra assumption, we show that the growth rate of $kth$ elementary symmetric function $\sigma_k(g)$ of Ricci curvature over geodesic ball of radius $r$ is at most polynomial in $r$ with order $n-2k$ for all $1 \leq k \leq \frac{n-2}{2}$. Similarly, we are able to show that the same growth control holds for $2kth$-order $Q$-curvature. Finally, we also observe that for $k=1$ or $2$, the gap theorems for $Q^{(2k)}_g$ hold true.</description>

      <title>Decompositions of Scherk-Type Zero Mean Curvature Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by using a special Euler-Ramanujan identity and the idea of Wick rotation, we show that a one-parameter family of solutions to the zero mean curvature equation in Lorentz-Minkowski $3$-space $\mathbb E_1^3$, namely Scherk-type zero mean curvature surfaces, can be expressed as an infinite superposition of dilated helicoids. Further, we also obtain different finite decompositions for these surfaces. We end this paper with an application of these decompositions to formulate maximal codimension 2 surfaces into finite and infinite "sums" of weakly untrapped and *-surfaces in Lorentz-Minkowski 4-space.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relation of the sign of the Gaussian and mean curvature of modular surfaces in Lorentz-Minkowski $3$-space to the zeroes of the associated complex analytic functions and its derivatives. Further, we completely classify zero Gaussian curvature modular surfaces. Next we show non-existence of non-planar maximal modular surfaces, characterize CMC modular surfaces, analyze asymptotic behaviour of Gaussian curvature of complete modular graphs and the Hessian of their height functions and lastly as application, demonstrate how modular surfaces can be realised as integral surfaces of some conformal field theories and non-linear sigma models.</description>

      <title>Compact Cauchy horizons admit constant surface gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that in any spacetime dimension and under the dominant energy condition, every totally geodesic connected smooth compact null hypersurface (hence every compact Cauchy horizon) admits a smooth lightlike tangent vector field of constant surface gravity. That is, we solve the open degenerate case by showing that, if there is a complete generator, then there exists a smooth future-directed geodesic lightlike tangent field. The result can be stated as an existence result for a particular cohomological equation. The proof uses elements of ergodic theory, Hodge theory and Riemannian flow theory.</description>

Abstract: Let $(M,g)$ be a closed Riemannian manifold of dimension at least $3$. Let $S$ be the union of the focal submanifolds of an isoparametric function on $(M,g)$. In this article we address the existence of solutions of the Hardy-Sobolev type equation $\Delta_g u+K(x)u=\frac{u^{q-1}}{\left(d_{S}(x)\right)^s}$, where $d_{S}(x)$ is the distance from $x$ to $S$ and $q&gt;2$. In particular, we will prove the existence of infinite sign-changing solutions to the equation.</description>

      <title>Generalized existence of extremizers for the sharp $p$-Sobolev inequality on Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generalized existence of extremizers for the sharp $p$-Sobolev inequality on noncompact Riemannian manifolds in connection with nonnegative curvature and Euclidean volume growth assumptions. Assuming a nonnegative Ricci curvature lower bound, we show that almost extremal functions are close in gradient norm to radial Euclidean bubbles. In the case of nonnegative sectional curvature lower bounds, we additionally deduce that vanishing is the only possible behavior, in the sense that almost extremal functions are almost zero globally. Our arguments rely on nonsmooth concentration compactness methods and Mosco-convergence results for the Cheeger energy on noncompact varying spaces, generalized to every exponent $p\in (1,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Local space time constant mean curvature and constant expansion foliations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14025v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the small sphere-limit for quasi-local energy we study local foliations of surfaces with prescribed mean curvature. Following the strategy used by Ye in 1991 to study local constant mean curvature foliations, we use a Lyapunov Schmidt reduction in an n+1 dimensional manifold equipped with a symmetric 2-tensor to construct the foliations around a point, prove their uniqueness and show their nonexistence conditions. To be specific, we study two foliation conditions. First we consider constant space-time mean curvature surfaces. These foliations were used by Cederbaum and Sakovich to characterize the center of mass in general relativity. Second, we study local foliations of constant expansion surfaces.</description>

      <title>Local foliations by critical surfaces of the Hawking energy and small sphere limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.04904v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local foliations of area constrained Willmore surfaces on a 3-dimensional Riemannian manifold were constructed by Lamm, Metzger and Schulze, and Ikoma, Machiodi and Mondino, the leaves of these foliations are, in particular, critical surfaces of the Hawking energy in case they are contained in a totally geodesic spacelike hypersurface. We generalize these foliations to the general case of a non-totally geodesic spacelike hypersurface, constructing a unique local foliation of area constrained critical surfaces of the Hawking energy. A discrepancy when evaluating the so called small sphere limit of the Hawking energy was found by Friedrich. He studied concentrations of area constrained critical surfaces of the Hawking energy and obtained a result that apparently differs from the well established small sphere limit of the Hawking energy of Horowitz and Schmidt, this small sphere limit in principle must be satisfied by any quasi local energy. We independently confirm the discrepancy and explain the reasons for it to happen. We also prove that these surfaces are suitable to evaluate the Hawking energy in the sense of Lamm, Metzger and Schulze, and we find an indication that these surfaces may induce an excess in the energy measured.</description>

      <title>Positive mass and isoperimetry for continuous metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with quasi-local isoperimetric versions of the positive mass theorem on $3$-manifolds endowed with continuous complete metrics having nonnegative scalar curvature in a suitable weak sense. As a corollary, we derive existence results for isoperimetric sets in such low regularity setting. Our main tool is a new local version of the weak inverse mean curvature flow enjoying $C^0$-stable quantitative estimates.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16814v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the set of (real Dolbeault classes of) balanced metrics $\Theta$ on a balanced manifold $X$ with respect to which a torsion-free coherent sheaf $\mathcal{E}$ on $X$ is slope stable. We prove that the set of all such $[\Theta] \in H^{n - 1,n - 1}(X,\mathbb{R})$ is an open convex cone locally defined by a finite number of linear inequalities.
  When $\mathcal{E}$ is a Hermitian vector bundle, the Kobayashi--Hitchin correspondence provides associated Hermitian Yang--Mills connections, which we show depend continuously on the metric, even around classes with respect to which $\mathcal{E}$ is only semi-stable. In this case, the holomorphic structure induced by the connection is the holomorphic structure of the associated graded object. The method relies on semi-stable perturbation techniques for geometric PDEs with a moment map interpretation and is quite versatile, and we hope that it can be used in other similar problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that there exist complex solvmanifolds $(\Gamma\backslash G,J)$ whose canonical bundle is trivialized by a holomorphic section which is not invariant under the action of $G$. The main goal of this article is to classify the six-dimensional Lie algebras corresponding to such complex solvmanifolds, thus extending the previous work of Fino, Otal and Ugarte for the invariant case. To achieve this, we complete the classification of six-dimensional solvable strongly unimodular Lie algebras admitting complex structures and identify among them, the ones admitting complex structures with Chern-Ricci flat metrics. Finally we construct complex solvmanifolds with non-invariant holomorphic sections of their canonical bundle. In particular, we present an example of one such solvmanifold that is not biholomorphic to a complex solvmanifold with an invariant section of its canonical bundle. Additionally, we discover a new $6$-dimensional solvable strongly unimodular Lie algebra equipped with a complex structure that has a non-zero holomorphic $(3,0)$-form.</description>

      <title>Codimension-Two Spacelike Submanifolds with Umbilical Lightlike Normal Sections and Their Relationship to Lightlike Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07934v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study codimension-two spacelike submanifolds in Lorentzian spacetimes that admit umbilical lightlike normal directions. We show that such submanifolds are subject to strong geometric and topological constraints, establishing explicit relationships between extrinsic geometry, mean curvature, and shear-isotropy. In the compact case, we obtain sharp restrictions on their topology. We precisely characterize when the umbilical lightlike normal vector field can be rescaled to be parallel, in terms of the curvature tensor of the ambient spacetime, and prove that this property is conformally invariant. Our main result is a factorization theorem: any such submanifold is contained in a lightlike hypersurface, which is totally umbilical whenever the lightlike normal direction is umbilical. We also provide explicit conformal relations between the induced metrics on the family of spacelike leaves generated by the lightlike normal flow, with consequences for isometry, parallelism of lightlike normal directions, volume evolution, and variational properties. These results yield a detailed geometric framework relevant to the mathematical study of horizons and lightlike structures in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Taut smoothings of arcs and curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06623v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometric and combinatorial effect of smoothing an intersection point in a collection of arcs or curves on a surface. We prove that all taut arcs with fixed endpoints and all taut 1-manifolds with at least two non-disjoint components on an orientable surface with negative Euler characteristic admit a taut smoothing, and also that all taut arcs with free endpoints admit a smoothing that is either taut or becomes taut after removing at most one intersection. We deduce that for every Riemannian metric on a surface, the shortest properly immersed arcs with at least $k$ self-intersections have exactly $k$ self-intersections when the endpoints of the arc are fixed, and at most $k+1$ self-intersections otherwise, and that the arc length spectrum is "coarsely ordered" by self-intersection number. Along the way, we obtain partial analogous results in the case of curves.</description>

      <title>Killing and homothetic initial data for general hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a collection of general identities relating the deformation tensor $\mathcal{K}=\mathcal{L}_{\eta}g$ of an arbitrary vector field $\eta$ with the tensor $\Sigma=\mathcal{L}_{\eta}\nabla$ on an abstract hypersurface $\mathcal{H}$ of any causal character. As an application we establish necessary conditions on $\mathcal{H}$ for the existence of a homothetic Killing vector on the spacetime where $\mathcal{H}$ is embedded. The sufficiency of these conditions is then analysed in three specific settings. For spacelike hypersurfaces, we recover the well-known homothetic KID equations [10, 13] in the language of hypersurface data. For two intersecting null hypersurfaces, we generalize a previous result [7], valid for Killings, to the homothetic case and, moreover, demonstrate that the equations can be formulated solely in terms of the initial data for the characteristic Cauchy problem, i.e., without involving a priori spacetime quantities. This puts the characteristic KID problem on equal footing with the spacelike KID problem. Furthermore, we highlight the versatility of the formalism by addressing the homothetic KID problem for smooth spacelike-characteristic initial data. Other initial value problems, such as the spacelike-characteristic with corners, can be approached similarly.</description>

      <title>A Proof of the Hodge Conjecture for a Special Class of Calabi-Yau 5-Folds via Exceptional Group Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a complete proof of the (1,1)-type Hodge conjecture for a special class of 5-dimensional Calabi-Yau manifolds ($h^{1,1}=56$), while establishing and implementing a novel methodology based on exceptional group constraints. The core idea of this methodology is to replace the "geometric construction" that traditional methods rely on -- which becomes infeasible in high-dimensional cases -- with the "algebraic rigidity" of Lie algebra representation theory. We prove that by introducing the symmetry of the $E_7$ group, we can generate a "dimension tension" in the Spencer cohomology framework we developed, which forcibly makes the dimension of the Spencer kernel precisely match the Hodge numbers of the manifold, thereby bypassing concrete algebraic geometric calculations. This dimension matching result is a key step in satisfying the "Spencer-Hodge verification criterion" we previously established. Its completion not only solves a non-trivial special case of the Hodge conjecture, but more importantly, provides the first strong evidence for this new paradigm of connecting representation theory with Hodge theory to solve core problems in algebraic geometry.</description>
