      <title>Signatures of Black Hole Spin and Plasma Acceleration in Jet Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the polarization of black hole jets on scales of $10-10^3\,GM/c^2$ and show that large spatial swings in the polarization occur at three characteristic distances from the black hole: the radius where the counter-jet dims, the radius where the magnetic field becomes azimuthally dominated (the light cylinder), and the radius where the plasma reaches its terminal Lorentz factor. To demonstrate the existence of these swings, we derive a correspondence between axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic outflows and their force-free limits, which allows us to analytically compute the plasma kinematics and magnetic field structure of collimated, general relativistic jets. We then use this method to ray trace polarized images of black hole jets with a wide range of physical parameters, focusing on roughly face-on jets like that of M87. We show that the location of the polarization swings is strongly tied to the location of the light cylinder and thus to the black hole's spin, illustrating a new method of measuring spin from polarized images of the jet. This signature of black hole spin should be observable by future interferometric arrays like the (Next Generation) Event Horizon Telescope, which will be able to resolve the polarized emission of the jet down to the near-horizon region at high dynamic range.</description>

      <title>Extreme scale height variations and nozzle shocks in warped disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion disks around both stellar-mass and supermassive black holes are likely often warped. Whenever a disk is warped, its scale height varies with azimuth. Sufficiently strong warps cause extreme compressions of the scale height, which fluid parcels "bounce" off of twice per orbit to high latitudes. In this paper, we study the dynamics of such strong warps using two methods: (i) the nearly analytic "ring theory" of Fairbairn &amp; Ogilvie (2021a), which we generalize to the Kerr metric; and (ii) 3D general-relativistic hydrodynamic simulations of tori ("rings") around black holes, using the H-AMR code. We initialize a ring with a warp and study the subsequent evolution on tens of orbital periods. The simulations agree excellently with the ring theory until the warp amplitude, $\psi$, reaches a critical value $\psi_{\rm c}$. When $\psi&gt;\psi_{\rm c}$, the rings enter the bouncing regime. We analytically derive (and numerically validate) that $\psi_{\rm c}\approx (r/r_{\rm g})^{-1/2}$ in the non-Keplerian regime, where $r_{\rm g}=GM/c^2$ is the gravitational radius and $M$ is the mass of the central object. Whenever the scale height bounces, the vertical velocity becomes supersonic, which leads to a "nozzle shock" as the gas collides at the scale height minima. Nozzle shocks damp the warp within $\approx10-20$ orbits in the simulations; but, that damping is not captured by the ring theory. Nozzle shock dissipation leads to inflow timescales that are 1-2 orders of magnitude shorter than unwarped $\alpha$ disks which may result in rapid variability, such as in changing-look active galactic nuclei or in the soft state of X-ray binaries. We also propose that steady disks with strong enough warps may self-regulate to have amplitudes near $\psi_{\rm c}$.</description>

      <title>X-ray spectro-polarimetric characterization of GX 340+0 in the horizontal branch: a highly inclined source?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first detection of X-ray polarization in the horizontal branch for GX 340+0 as obtained by Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE). A polarization degree of 4.3%$\pm$0.3% is obtained. This value is in agreement with the previous polarization measurements of Z-sources in the horizontal branch. Spectro-polarimetric analysis, performed using a broad-band spectral model obtained by NICER and NuSTAR quasi-simultaneous observations, allowed us to constrain the polarization for the soft and hard spectral components typical to these sources. The polarization angle for the two components differs by ${\sim}40{\deg}$. This result could be explained by a misalignment of the NS rotations axis with respect to the accretion disk axis. We provide a comparison of the results with polarization expected in different models. Theoretical expectations for the polarization of the disk and the Comptonization components favor an orbital inclination for GX 340+0 higher than 60{\deg}, as expected for Cyg-like sources, in contrast with results we report for the reflection component using broad-band spectrum.</description>

      <title>Synchrotron break frequencies of mildly-to-highly relativistic outflows observed off-axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the synchrotron spectrum produced by mildly-to-highly relativistic collisionless shocks. Simple analytic formulae are derived for the break frequencies (peak frequency, self-absorption frequency, synchrotron and inverse Compton cooling frequencies) of the emission produced by post-shock plasma elements propagating at an angle $\theta_e$ relative to the observer's line of sight. These formulae reproduce well the results of earlier exact analytic calculations valid for ultra-relativistic shocks and also hold for $\gamma&lt;10$ and for "off-axis" propagation (deviating from the ultra-relativistic results by approximately an order of magnitude). Our results will improve parameter estimation accuracy from future observations of synchrotron emission produced by collisionless shocks driven by the relativistic ejected material from compact objects mergers and jetted tidal disruption events. The improved accuracy for mildly relativistic velocities is essential since most events will be observed off-axis, with $\gamma&lt;10$ outflows dominating the synchrotron emission (due to relativistic beaming). For GW170817, our results imply that (i) the Lorentz factor of the plasma emitting the observed radiation is bounded by $2.6&lt;\gamma$ at $t\sim10$ days and by $\gamma&lt;12$ at $t&gt;16$ days, (ii) the interstellar medium (ISM) density, $n$, and the fraction of internal energy density held by magnetic fields, $\varepsilon_B$, are bounded by $n\cdot\varepsilon_B\lesssim 3\times10^{-7}$cm$^{-3}$. In future merger events in higher-density ISM, the peak and cooling frequencies may be identified in the radio and X-ray bands; consequently, $\gamma,n\cdot\varepsilon_B$ could be measured as opposed to the case of GW170817, where these frequencies are out of the observable range.</description>

      <title>The Symbiotic Recurrent Nova V745 Sco at Radio Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V745 Sco is a Galactic symbiotic recurrent nova with nova eruptions in 1937, 1989 and 2014. We study the behavior of V745 Sco at radio wavelengths (0.6-37,GHz), covering both its 1989 and 2014 eruptions and informed by optical, X-ray, and $\gamma$-ray data. The radio light curves are synchrotron-dominated. Surprisingly, compared to expectations for synchrotron emission from explosive transients such as radio supernovae, the light curves spanning 0.6-37 GHz all peak around the same time ($\sim$18-26 days after eruption) and with similar flux densities (5-9 mJy).We model the synchrotron light curves as interaction of the nova ejecta with the red giant wind, but find that simple spherically symmetric models with wind-like circumstellar material (CSM) cannot explain the radio light curve. Instead, we conclude that the shock suddenly breaks out of a dense CSM absorbing screen around 20 days after eruption, and then expands into a relatively low density wind ($\dot{M}_{out} \approx 10^{-9}-10^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ for $v_w = 10$ km s$^{-1}$) out to $\sim$1 year post-eruption. The dense, close-in CSM may be an equatorial density enhancement or a more spherical red giant wind with $\dot{M}_{in} \approx [5-10] \times 10^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, truncated beyond several $\times 10^{14}$ cm. The outer lower-density CSM would not be visible in typical radio observations of Type Ia supernovae: V745 Sco cannot be ruled out as a Type Ia progenitor based on CSM constraints alone.Complementary constraints from the free-free radio optical depth and the synchrotron luminosity imply the shock is efficient at accelerating relativistic electrons and amplifying magnetic fields, with $\epsilon_e$ and $\epsilon_B \approx 0.01-0.1$.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Broadband Reflection Spectrum of MAXI J1803-298 During its 2021 Outburst with NuSTAR and NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MAXI J1803-298 is a transient black hole candidate discovered in May of 2021 during an outburst that lasted several months. Multiple X-ray observations reveal recurring "dipping" intervals in several of its light curves, particularly during the hard/intermediate states, with a typical recurrence period of $\sim7\,\mathrm{hours}$. We report analysis of four NuSTAR observations of the source, supplemented with NICER data where available, over the duration of the outburst evolution covering the hard, intermediate and the soft states. Reflection spectroscopy reveals the black hole to be rapidly spinning ($a_*=0.990\pm{0.001}$) with a near edge-on viewing angle ($i=70\pm{1}\deg$). Additionally, we show that the light-curve dips are caused by photo-electric absorption from a moderately ionized absorber whose origin is not fully understood, although it is likely linked to material from the companion star impacting the outer edges of the accretion disk. We further detect absorption lines in some of the spectra, potentially associated with Fe XXV and Fe XXVI, indicative of disk winds with moderate to extreme velocities. During the intermediate state and just before transitioning into the soft state, the source showed a sudden flux increase which we found to be dominated by soft disk photons and consistent with the filling of the inner accretion disk, at the onset of state transition. In the soft state, we show that models of disk self-irradiation provide a better fit and a preferred explanation to the broadband reflection spectrum, consistent with previous studies of other accreting sources.</description>

      <title>Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center (MMDC): A Tool for Retrieving and Modeling Multi-temporal, Multi-wavelength and Multi-messenger Data from Blazar Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Markarian Multiwavelength Data Center (MMDC) is a web-based tool designed for accessing and retrieving multiwavelength and multimessenger data from blazar observations.MMDC facilitates the construction and interactive visualization of time-resolved multi-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of blazars by integrating: \textit{(i)} archival data from over 80 catalogs and databases, \textit{(ii)} optical data from all-sky survey facilities such as ASAS-SN, ZTF, and Pan-STARRS, and \textit{(iii)} newly analyzed datasets in the optical/UV band from \textit{Swift}-UVOT, in the X-ray band from \textit{Swift}-XRT and NuSTAR observations, and the high-energy $\gamma$-ray band from \textit{Fermi}-LAT observations. MMDC distinguishes itself from other online platforms by the large quantity of available data. For instance, it includes data from all blazar observations by \textit{Swift} and NuSTAR, as well as the results of detailed spectral analysis in the $\gamma$-ray band during different emission states, covering the period from 2008 to 2023. Another important distinguishing feature of MMDC is its ability to enable precise, self-consistent theoretical modeling of the observed data using machine learning algorithms trained on leptonic and lepto-hadronic models, which consider the injection of particles and all relevant cooling processes. MMDC is an innovative tool which significantly enhances blazar research by providing a comprehensive framework for data accessibility, analysis, and theoretical interpretation, thereby advancing our understanding of blazar emissions and the underlying astrophysical processes.</description>

      <title>Probing X-ray Timing and Spectral Variability in the Blazar PKS 2155-304 Over a Decade of XMM-Newton Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blazars, a class of active galactic nuclei (AGN) powered by supermassive black holes, are known for their remarkable variability across multiple timescales and wavelengths. With advancements in both ground- and space-based telescopes, our understanding of AGN central engines has significantly improved. However, the mechanisms driving this variability remain elusive, and continue to fascinate both theorists and observers alike. The primary objective of this study is to constrain the X-ray variability properties of the TeV blazar PKS 2155-304. We conduct a comprehensive X-ray spectral and timing analysis, focusing on both long-term and intra-day variability. This analysis uses data from 22 epochs of XMM-Newton EPIC-pn observations, collected over 15 years (2000-2014). To investigate the variability of the source, we applied both timing and spectral analyses. For the timing analysis, we estimated fractional variability, variability amplitude, minimum variability timescales, flux distribution, and power spectral density (PSD). In the spectral analysis, we fitted the X-ray spectra using power-law, log-parabola, and broken power-law (BPL) models to determine the best-fitting parameters. Additionally, we studied the hardness ratio (HR). We observed moderate intra-day variability in most of the light curves. Seven out of the twenty-two observations showed a clear bimodal flux distribution, indicating the presence of two distinct flux states. Our analysis revealed a variable power-law PSD slope. Most HR plots did not show significant variation with flux, except for one observation (OBSID 0124930501), where HR increased with flux (Count/s). The fitted X-ray spectra favored the BPL model for the majority of observations. The findings of this work shed light on the intraday variability of blazars, providing insights into the non-thermal jet processes that drive the observed flux variations.</description>

      <title>NGC 7314: X-ray Study of the Evolving Accretion Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the timing and spectral properties of NGC 7314, a Seyfert 1.9 galaxy, using X-ray observations from {\it XMM-Newton}, {\it NuSTAR}, and {\it RXTE}/PCA. The timing analysis reveals significant variability across different energy bands, with fractional variability (F$_{\rm var}$) values consistent with previous studies. The highly variable soft photons and comparatively less variable high energy photons imply different origins of these two types. The soft energy photons come from a hot corona near the center, while the high-energy photons are produced by inverse Compton scattering of these primary X-ray photons in a hot plasma away from the central region. The spectral analysis employs various models to characterize the emission components. The results indicate the presence of a soft energy bump, Fe K$\alpha$ line emission, and a prominent reflection component. The long-term {\it RXTE}/PCA data analysis reveals temporal variations in the photon index ($\Gamma$) and power-law flux, suggesting evolving emission properties over time. The signature of both broad and narrow Fe~K$\alpha$ emission line features suggested the broad, variable one coming from the accretion disk ($\sim10^{-5}$~pc), while the non-evolving narrow line can not be well constrained. The absorption feature could originate in a highly ionized region, possibly closer to the broad-line region (BLR). The evolution of the inner accretion properties indicates that NGC 7314 could be a potential changing-state active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Late-Time Supernovae Radio Re-brightening in the VAST Pilot Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our analysis of supernovae serendipitously found to be radio-bright several years after their optical discovery. We used recent observations from the Australian SKA Pathfinder taken as part of the pilot Variables and Slow Transients and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey programs. We identified 29 objects by cross-matching sources from these ASKAP observations with known core-collapse supernovae below a declination of $+40^{\circ}$ and with a redshift of $z\leq0.15$. Our results focus on eight cases that show potential late-time radio emission. These supernovae exhibit significantly greater amounts of radio emission than expected from the standard model of a single shockwave propagating through a spherical circumstellar medium, with a constant density structure produced by regular stellar mass-loss. We also discuss how we can learn from future ASKAP surveys about the circumstellar environments and emission mechanisms of supernovae that undergo late-time radio re-brightening. This pilot work tested and confirmed the potential of the Variables and Slow Transients survey to discover and study late-time supernova emission.</description>

      <title>Compact object populations over cosmic time II. Compact object merger rates and masses over redshift from varying initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a first study of the impact of varying two components of the initial conditions in binary population synthesis of compact binary mergers - the initial mass function, which is made metallicity- and star formation rate-dependent, and the orbital parameter (orbital period, mass ratio and eccentricity) distributions, which are assumed to be correlated - within a larger grid of initial condition models also including alternatives for the primary mass-dependent binary fraction and the metallicity-specific cosmic star formation history. We generate the initial populations with the sampling code BOSSA and evolve them with the rapid population synthesis code COMPAS. We find strong suggestions that the main role of initial conditions models is to set the relative weights of key features defined by the evolution models. In the two models we compare, black hole-black hole (BHBH) mergers are the most strongly affected, which we connect to a shift from the common envelope to the stable Roche lobe overflow formation channels with decreasing redshift. We also characterize variations in the black hole-neutron star (BHNS) and neutron star-neutron star (NSNS) final parameter distributions. We obtain the merger rate evolution for BHBH, BHNS and NSNS mergers up to $z=10$, and find a variation by a factor of $\sim50-60$ in the local BHBH and BHNS merger rates, suggesting a more important contribution from initial conditions than previously thought, and calling for a complete exploration of the initial conditions model permutations.</description>

      <title>Modeling Cosmic-Ray Transport: A CRPropa based stochastic differential equation solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new code that significantly extends CRPropa's capabilities to model the ensemble averaged transport of charged cosmic rays in arbitrary turbulent magnetic fields. The software is based on solving a set of stochastic differential equations (SDEs).
  In this work we give detailed instructions to transform a transport equation, usually given as a partial differential equation, into a Fokker-Planck equation and further into the corresponding set of SDEs. Furthermore, detailed tests of the algorithms are done and different sources of uncertainties are compared to each other. So to some extend, this work serves as a technical reference for existing and upcoming work using the new generalized SDE solver based on the CRPropa framework.
  On the other hand, the new flexibility allowed us to implement first test cases on continuous particle injection and focused pitch angle diffusion. For the latter one we show that focused pitch angle diffusion leads to a drift velocity along the field lines that is defined by the fixed points of the pitch angle diffusion equation.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave asteroseismology of accreting neutron stars in a steady state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accreting neutron star is potentially the gravitational wave source. In this study, we examine the gravitational wave frequencies from such an object in the steady state, adopting the Cowling approximation. We can derive the empirical relations independently of the mass accretion rate for the frequencies of the fundamental and 1st pressure modes multiplied by the stellar mass as a function of the stellar compactness, together with those for the 1st and 2nd gravity mode frequencies. So, once one simultaneously observes the fundamental (or 1st pressure) and gravity mode frequencies, one could constrain the neutron star mass and radius. In addition, we find that the luminosity can be well characterized by the mass accretion rate independently of the stellar mass and equation of state, if the direct Urca does not work inside the star. Since the luminosity from the neutron star with the direct Urca can deviate from this characterization, one could identify whether the direct Urca process works or not inside the star by observing the luminosity. Both information obtained from the gravitational waves and luminosity help us to understand the equation of state for neutron star matter.</description>

      <title>A Catalog of Pulsar X-ray Filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first Chandra X-ray Observatory (CXO) catalog of "pulsar X-ray filaments," or "misaligned outflows." These are linear, synchrotron radiating features powered by ultra-relativistic electrons and positrons that escape from bow shock pulsars. The filaments are misaligned with the (large) pulsar velocity, distinguishing them from the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) trail which is also often visible in CXO ACIS images. Spectral fits and morphological properties are extracted for five secure filaments and three candidates using a uniform method. We present a search of archival CXO data for linear diffuse features; the known examples are recovered and a few additional weak candidates are identified. We also report on a snapshot CXO ACIS survey of pulsars with properties similar to the filament producers, finding no new filaments, but some diffuse emission including one PWN trail. Finally, we provide an updated model for the pulsar properties required to create filaments in light of these new observations.</description>

      <title>Finding radio transients with anomaly detection and active learning based on volunteer classifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore the applicability of unsupervised machine learning algorithms to the task of finding radio transients. Facilities such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will provide huge volumes of data in which to detect rare transients; the challenge for astronomers is how to find them. We demonstrate the effectiveness of anomaly detection algorithms using 1.3 GHz light curves from the SKA precursor MeerKAT. We make use of three sets of descriptive parameters ('feature sets') as applied to two anomaly detection techniques in the Astronomaly package and analyse our performance by comparison with citizen science labels on the same dataset. By using transients found by volunteers as our ground truth, we demonstrate that anomaly detection techniques can recall over half of the radio transients in the 10 per cent of the data with the highest anomaly scores. We find that the choice of anomaly detection algorithm makes a minimal (sub-one per cent) level difference, but that feature set choice is crucial, especially when considering available resources for human inspection and/or follow-up. Active learning, where human labels are given for just 2 per cent of the data, improves recall by up to 10 percentage points, depending on the feature-model pair. The best performing feature-model pairs result in a factor of 5 times fewer sources requiring vetting by experts. This is the first effort to apply anomaly detection techniques to finding radio transients and shows great promise for application to other datasets, and as a real-time transient detection system for upcoming large surveys.</description>

      <title>Non-conservation of Lepton Numbers in the Neutrino Sector Could Change the Prospects for Core Collapse Supernova Explosions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that strong interactions violating the conservation of lepton numbers in the neutrino sector could significantly alter the standard low entropy picture for the pre-supernova collapsing core of a massive star. A rapid neutrino-antineutrino equilibration leads to entropy generation and enhanced electron capture and, hence, a lower electron fraction than in the standard model. This would affect the downstream core evolution, the prospects for a supernova explosion, and the emergent neutrino signal. If realized by lepton-number-violating neutrino self-interactions (LNV $\nu$SI), the relevant mediator mass and coupling ranges can be probed by future accelerator-based experiments.</description>

      <title>Prospects for detecting asteroid-mass primordial black holes in extreme-mass-ratio inspirals with continuous gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite decades of research, the existence of asteroid-mass primordial black holes (PBHs) remains almost completely unconstrained and thus could still comprise the totality of dark matter (DM). In this paper, we show that standard searches for continuous gravitational waves -- long-lived, quasi-monochromatic signals -- could detect extreme mass-ratio inspirals of asteroid-mass PBHs in orbit around a stellar-mass companion using future gravitational-wave (GW) data from Einstein Telescope (ET) and the Neutron Star Extreme Matter Observatory (NEMO). We evaluate the robustness of our projected constraints against the eccentricity of the binary, the choice of the mass of the primary object, and the GW frequency range that we analyze. Furthermore, to determine whether there could be ways to detect asteroid-mass PBHs using current GW data, we quantify the impact of changes in current techniques on the sensitivity towards asteroid-mass PBHs. We show that methods that allow for signals with increased and more complicated frequency drifts over time could obtain much more stringent constraints now than those derived from standard techniques, though at slightly larger computational cost, potentially constraining the fraction of DM that certain asteroid-mass PBHs could compose to be less than one with current detectors.</description>

      <title>Generating X-ray transit profiles with batman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an adaptation of the exoplanet transit model code batman, in order to permit the generation of X-ray transits. Our underlying extended coronal model assumes an isothermal plasma that is radially symmetric. While this ignores the effect of bright, active regions, observations of transits in X-rays will require averaging across multiple epochs of data for the foreseeable future, significantly reducing the importance of more complex modelling. Our publicly available code successfully generates the predicted W-shaped transit profile in X-rays due to the optically thin nature of the emission, which concentrates the expected observational emission around the limb of the photospheric stellar disc. We provide some examples based on the best known X-ray transit target, HD 189733b, and examine the effect of varying the planet size, coronal temperature, and impact parameter on the resulting transit profile. We also derived scaling relationships for how the overall transit detectability is affected by changing these parameters. Over most of the parameter space, we find that the detectability scales linearly with the cross-sectional area of the planet in X-rays. The relationship with increasing coronal temperature is less fixed, but averages out to a power law with slope $-1/4$ except when the impact parameter is high. Indeed, varying impact parameter has little effect on detectability at all until it approaches unity.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Ray Feedback on Bi-stable ISM Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While cosmic rays $(E\gtrsim 1\,\mathrm{GeV})$ are well coupled to a galaxy's interstellar medium (ISM) at scales of $L&gt;100\,\mathrm{pc}$, adjusting stratification and driving outflows, their impact on small scales is less clear. Based on calculations of the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient from observations of the grammage in the Milky Way, cosmic rays have little time to dynamically impact the ISM on those small scales. Using numerical simulations, we explore how more complex cosmic ray transport could allow cosmic rays to couple to the ISM on small scales. We create a two-zone model of cosmic ray transport, with the cosmic ray diffusion coefficient set at the estimated Milky Way value in cold gas but smaller in warm gas. We compare this model to simulations with a constant diffusion coefficient. Quicker diffusion through cold gas allows more cold gas to form compared to a simulation with a constant, small diffusion coefficient. However, slower diffusion in warm gas allows cosmic rays to take energy from the turbulent cascade anisotropically. This cosmic ray energization comes at the expense of turbulent energy which would otherwise be lost during radiative cooling. Finally, we show our two-zone model is capable of matching observational estimates of the grammage for some transport paths through the simulation.</description>

      <title>Expected Gamma-Ray Burst Detection Rates and Redshift Distributions for the BlackCAT CubeSat Mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the results of an extensive set of simulations exploring the sensitivity of the BlackCAT CubeSat to long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). BlackCAT is a NASA APRA-funded CubeSat mission for the detection and real-time sub-arcminute localization of high-redshift ($z\gtrsim 3.5$) GRBs. Thanks to their luminous and long-lived afterglow emissions, GRBs are uniquely valuable probes of high-redshift star-forming galaxies and the intergalactic medium. In addition, each detected GRB with a known redshift serves to localize a region of high-redshift star formation in three dimensions, enabling deep follow-on searches for host galaxies and associated local and large-scale structures. We explore two distinct models for the GRB redshift distribution and luminosity function, both consistent with Swift observations. We find that, for either model, BlackCAT is expected to detect a mean of 42 bursts per year on-orbit, with 6.7% to 10% of these at $z&gt;3.5$. BlackCAT bursts will be localized to $r_{90} \lesssim 55^{\prime\prime}$ precision and reported to the community within seconds. Due to the mission orbit and pointing scheme, bursts will be located in the night sky and well-placed for deep multiwavelength follow-up observations. BlackCAT is on schedule to achieve launch readiness in 2025.</description>

      <title>The Pulsar Science Collaboratory: Multi-Epoch Scintillation Studies of Pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on findings from scintillation analyses using high-cadence observations of eight canonical pulsars with observing baselines ranging from one to three years. We obtain scintillation bandwidth and timescale measurements for all pulsars in our survey, scintillation arc curvature measurements for four, and detect multiple arcs for two. We find evidence of a previously undocumented scattering screen along the line of sight (LOS) to PSR J1645$-$0317, as well as evidence that a scattering screen along the LOS to PSR J2313$+$4253 may reside somewhere within the Milky Way's Orion-Cygnus arm. We report evidence of a significant change in the scintillation pattern in PSR J2022$+$5154 from the previous two decades of literature, wherein both the scintillation bandwidth and timescale decreased by an order of magnitude relative to earlier observations at the same frequencies, potentially as a result of a second screen dominating the observed scattering. By augmenting the results of previous studies, we find general agreement with estimations of scattering delays from pulsar observations and predictions by the NE2001 electron density model but not for the newest data we have collected, providing some evidence of changes in the interstellar medium along various LOSs over the timespans considered. In a similar manner, we find additional evidence of a correlation between a pulsar's dispersion measure and the overall variability of its scattering delays over time. The plethora of interesting science obtained through these observations demonstrates the capabilities of the Green Bank Observatory's 20m telescope to contribute to pulsar-based studies of the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Occurrence of gravitational collapse in the accreting neutron stars of binary-driven hypernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The binary-driven hypernova (BdHN) model proposes long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate in binaries composed of a carbon-oxygen (CO) star and a neutron star (NS) companion. The CO core collapse generates a newborn NS and a supernova that triggers the GRB by accreting onto the NSs, rapidly transferring mass and angular momentum to them. This article aims to determine the conditions under which a black hole (BH) forms from NS collapse induced by the accretion and the impact on the GRB observational properties and taxonomy. We perform three-dimensional, smoothed-particle-hydrodynamics simulations of BdHNe using up-to-date NS nuclear equations of state (EOS), with and without hyperons, and calculate the structure evolution in full general relativity. We assess the binary parameters leading either NS in the binary to the critical mass for gravitational collapse into a BH and its occurrence time, $t_{\rm col}$. We include a non-zero angular momentum of the NSs and find that $t_{\rm col}$ ranges from a few tens of seconds to hours for decreasing NS initial angular momentum values. BdHNe I are the most compact (about five minutes orbital period), promptly form a BH and release $\gtrsim 10^{52}$ erg. They form NS-BH binaries with tens of kyr merger timescale by gravitational-wave emission. BdHNe II and III do not form BHs, release $\sim 10^{50}$-$10^{52}$ erg and $\lesssim 10^{50}$ erg. They form NS-NS binaries with a range of merger timescales larger than for NS-BH binaries. In some compact BdHNe II, either NS can become supramassive, i.e., above the critical mass of a non-rotating NS. Magnetic braking by a $10^{13}$ G field can delay BH formation, leading to BH-BH or NS-BH of tens of kyr merger timescale.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a millisecond pulsar associated with Terzan 6</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations show that globular clusters might be among the best places to find millisecond pulsars. However, the globular cluster Terzan 6 seems to be an exception without any pulsar discovered, although its high stellar encounter rate suggests that it harbors dozens of them. We report the discovery of the first radio pulsar, PSR J1750-3116A, likely associated with Terzan 6 in a search of C-band (4-8 GHz) data from the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope with a spin period of 5.33 ms and dispersion measure, DM$\simeq$ 383 ${\rm pc\,cm^{-3}}$. The mean flux density of this pulsar is approximately 3 $\mu$Jy. The DM agrees well with predictions from the Galactic free electron density model, assuming a distance of 6.7 kpc for Terzan 6. PSR J1750-3116A is likely an isolated millisecond pulsar, potentially formed through dynamical interactions, considering the core-collapsed classification and the exceptionally high stellar encounter rate of Terzan 6. This is the highest radio frequency observation that has led to the discovery of a pulsar in a globular cluster to date. While L-band (1-2GHz) observations of this cluster are unlikely to yield significant returns due to propagation effects, we predict that further pulsar discoveries in Terzan 6 will be made by existing radio telescopes at higher frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel framework for explaining the mass and radius relationships of observed neutron stars by considering strange stars (SSs) admixed with mirror dark matter (MDM). We develop a theoretical model that incorporates non-commutative algebra to describe the interactions between ordinary strange quark matter (SQM) and MDM, which are predicted to form compact objects that could explain recent astrophysical data, including observations of PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0437-4715, and the central compact object in HESS J1731-347. Notably, we demonstrate that the exotic mass-radius measurement of XTE J1814-338 can be explained by the presence of a mirror SS with an ordinary SQM core. In contrast to other explanations based on boson stars, our SS+MDM model offers a natural explanation for this system. We provide detailed mass-radius comparisons with observational data and discuss future observations that could test the predictions of our model, offering new insights into neutron star structure and the role of dark matter in compact objects.</description>

Abstract: The angular correlation of pulsar residuals observed by NANOGrav and other pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations show evidence in support of the Hellings-Downs correlation expected from stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this paper, we offer a non-gravitational wave explanation of the observed pulsar timing correlations as caused by an ultra-light $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ gauge boson dark matter (ULDM). ULDM can affect the pulsar correlations in two ways. The gravitational potential of vector ULDM gives rise to a Shapiro time delay of the pulsar signals and a non-trivial angular correlation (as compared to the scalar ULDM case). In addition, if the pulsars have a non-zero charge of the dark matter gauge group, then the electric field of the local dark matter causes an oscillation of the pulsar and a corresponding Doppler shift of the pulsar signal. We point out that pulsars carry a significant charge of muons, and thus the $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ vector dark matter contributes to both the Doppler oscillations and the time delay of the pulsar signals. The synergy between these two effects provides a better fit to the shape of the angular correlation function, as observed by the NANOGrav collaboration, compared to the standard SGWB explanation or the SGWB combined with time delay explanations. Our analysis shows that in addition to the SGWB signal, there may potentially be excess timing residuals attributable to the $L_{\mu} - L_{\tau}$ ULDM.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we compute departures in the black hole thermodynamics induced by either geometric or topological corrections to general relativity. Specifically, we analyze the spherically symmetric spacetime solutions of two modified gravity scenarios with Lagrangians $\mathcal{L}\sim R^{1+\epsilon}$ and $\mathcal{L}\sim R+\epsilon\, \mathcal{G}^2$, where $\mathcal{G}$ is the Euler density in four dimensions, while $ 0&lt;\epsilon\ll 1$ measures the perturbation around the Hilbert-Einstein action. Accordingly, we find the expressions of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy by the Wald formula, and the black hole temperature and horizon of the obtained solutions. We then investigate the heat capacities in terms of the free parameters of the theories under study. In doing so, we show that healing the problem of negative heat capacities can be possible under particular choices of the free constants, albeit with limitations on the masses allowed for the black hole solutions.</description>

      <title>Approaches to photon absorption in a Lorentz invariance violation scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07842v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very high-energy astrophysical gamma rays suffer a suppression of their flux along their propagation due to their interaction, through the $\gamma\gamma\to e^+e^-$ pair-production process, with the soft photon backgrounds present in the Universe. We examine the Universe's transparency to gamma rays within a Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV) framework, focusing on photon subluminal quadratic corrections driven by a high-energy scale. Based on an explicit calculation, we provide a new expression for the cross section that overcomes the limitations of previous approaches and refines existing constraints for the LIV scale, while we introduce a new approximation that may be useful in LIV scenarios beyond effective field theory. These improvements appear essential for setting constraints on LIV effects with future observations at ultra-high energies, where previous approximations may fall short.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Guiding-Center Motion: Action Principle, Kinetic Theory, and Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We treat the guiding-center dynamics in a varying external Maxwell field using a relativistically covariant action principle which reproduces the known Vandervoort expression for the drift velocity and extends it to curved spacetime. We derive the corresponding kinetic theory and ideal hydrodynamic theory. In contrast to conventional five-equation hydrodynamics, the guiding-center hydrodynamics needs only three equations due to a constraint on the motion across magnetic field. We argue that such a hydrodynamics is applicable to strongly coupled plasmas where kinetic theory fails.</description>

      <title>Digging into the ultraviolet luminosity functions of galaxies at high redshifts: galaxies evolution, reionization, and cosmological parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09350v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thanks to the successful performance of the James Webb Space Telescope, our understanding of the epoch of reionization of the Universe has been advanced. The ultraviolet luminosity functions (UV LFs) of galaxies span a wide range of redshift, not only revealing the connection between galaxies and dark matter (DM) halos but also providing the information during reionization. In this work, we develop a model connecting galaxy counts and apparent magnitude based on UV LFs, which incorporates redshift-dependent star formation efficiency (SFE) and corrections for dust attenuation. By synthesizing some observations across the redshift range $4\le z \le 10$ from various galaxy surveys, we discern the evolving SFE with increasing redshift and DM halo mass through model fitting. Subsequent analyses indicate that the Thomson scattering optical depth was $\tau_{\rm e} = 0.054^{+0.001}_{-0.003}$ and the epoch of reionization started (ended) at $z=18.8^{+7.2}_{-6.0}$ ($z=5.3^{+0.8}_{-1.0}$) which is insensitive to the choice of the truncated magnitude of the UV LFs. Incorporating additional dataset and some reasonable constraints, the amplitude of matter perturbation is found to be $\sigma_8=0.80\pm0.05$, which is consistent with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. Future galaxy surveys and the dynamical simulations of galaxy evolution will break the degeneracy between SFE and cosmological parameters, improving the accuracy and the precision of the UV LF model further.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Amplification during Stellar Collisions between Low-Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00148v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Blue straggler stars in stellar clusters are a subset of stars that are bluer and appear younger than other cluster members, seemingly straggling behind in their evolution. They offer a unique opportunity to understand the stellar dynamics and populations within their hosts. In the collisional formation scenario, a persistent challenge is the excessive angular momentum in the collision product. The consequent significant mass loss during transition to a stable state leads to a star with too low a mass to be a blue straggler, unless it spins down efficiently. While many proposed spin-down mechanisms involve boosted angular momentum loss via magnetic braking within the collision product, the existence or strength of these magnetic fields has not been confirmed. Here, we report three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of collisions between two low-mass main-sequence stars and investigate magnetic field amplification. Magnetic field energy is amplified by a factor of $10^{8}-10^{10}$, resulting in the magnetic field strength of $10^{7}-10^{8}$G at the core of the collision product, independent of collision parameters. The surface magnetic field strengths have increased up to $10-10^{4}$ G. In addition, a distinctly flattened, rotating gas structure appears around the collision products in off-axis collisions, which may be a hint of possible disk formation. Such significant magnetic amplification and potential disk formation suggest the possibility of efficient spin-down of collision products via magnetic braking and magnetic disk locking, which can result in their appearance as blue stragglers.</description>
