      <title>Hybrid Superscattering Driven by Toroidal Dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic toroidal dipole is a unique radiation source beyond standard multipoles. Since its first demonstration 15 years ago, it has attracted growing theoretical and experimental interest. Research mainly aims to enhance its weak electromagnetic coupling to free space. Here we report on a surprising finding that the toroidal dipole can, in fact, be engaged in the enhancement of electromagnetic scattering per se driving the so-called superscattering the regime of anomalously strong light scattering where the total cross-section of the effect exceeds the fundamental single-channel limit. We introduce a new paradigm of hybrid superscattering enabled by the toroidal dipole, which we implement with a dielectric scatterer of a simple geometry, and demonstrate for the first time that two complementary mechanisms of superscattering the Friedrich-Wintgen mechanism and resonance overlap can act synergistically to yield the substantially enhanced effect. Using coupled-dipole theory, full-wave numerical modeling and coupled-mode theory, we identify and quantify the dominant multipolar contributions and show that the normalized scattering cross-section exceeds the dipole limit due to a toroidal dipole-magnetic quadrupole interplay. These findings are supported by experimental measurements in the GHz frequency range using a dimer of ceramic cubes, which confirm both the spectral and spatial features of toroidal superscattering. Our results open a new powerful route to engineering strong light-matter interaction via peculiar toroidal modes (never observed before) with potential applications in toroidal superscattering metamaterials and metasurfaces, photonic devices, and sensors.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Spike Geometry on the Linear and Nonlinear Plasmonic Properties of Gold Nanourchins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wet-chemistry synthesized Gold nanourchins (Au NUs), characterized by spiky morphologies with spherical cores, exhibit complex and geometry-dependent plasmonic properties distinct from those of symmetrical nanostructures. While plasmon hybridization and mode coupling in branched nanostructures have been broadly studied, the specific optical behavior of Au NUs-particularly regarding spike length distribution and ultrafast dynamics-remains underexplored. This study investigates the steady-state and transient absorption spectra of Au NUs with 50-80 nm cores and 5-20 nm spikes, revealing multiple resonance bands. Transient absorption spectroscopy at various excitation wavelengths confirmed the presence of distinct resonances. Electromagnetic simulations based on TEM tomography-inspired models identified two key extinction bands: a green-wavelength dark mode resonance and a red-nIR spike-induced resonance attributed to the lightning rod effect. Simulations further showed that short, uniformly distributed spikes (aspect ratio &lt;= 1) weakly excite dark resonances, while longer spikes (aspect ratio &gt; 1) induce hybridized longitudinal resonances and significant redshifts. Broad spike length distributions result in multiple coexisting resonances, aligning with experimental extinction spectra. A preliminary surface-enhanced Raman scattering study using 2-naphthalene thiol confirmed stronger enhancement for long-spiked Au NUs under 785 nm excitation, validating the field enhancement potential of the identified resonances.</description>

      <title>Parity-time symmetry phase transition in photonic time-modulated media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time modulation can cause gain and loss in photonic media, leading to complex modal behaviors and enhanced wave controllability in the non-Hermitian regime. Conversely, we reveal that Hermiticity and parity-time $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry phase transition are possible under the temporal $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry in time-modulated photonic media. We prove that, for a homogeneously modulated photonic medium with complex-valued modulation, temporal $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry is a necessary but insufficient condition for obtaining a real eigenvalue spectrum, giving rise to $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry phase transition. Specifically, the $\mathcal{PT}$ phase transition critically depends on the contrast between the modulation depth of the real and imaginary parts of permittivity when they are sinusoidally modulated with a $\pi/2$ phase difference. We generalize the discretized temporal-interface transfer matrix method to a continuous differential operator framework, which facilitates the confirmation of the phase transition condition via Magnus expansion analysis. Full-wave simulations and analytical calculations jointly confirm the occurrence of $\mathcal{PT}$-transition by examining the scattering behavior of a propagating pulse in such a type of modulated medium. The findings provide a temporal $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric paradigm for controlling Hermiticity and non-Hermiticity in spatiotemporal photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Mimicking Surface Plasmons with Structured Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metals such as silver support surface plasmons: electromagnetic surface excitations localised near the surface which originate from the free electrons of the metal. Surface modes are also observed on highly conducting surfaces perforated by holes. We establish a close connection between the two, showing that electromagnetic waves in both materials are governed by an effective permittivity of the same plasma form. Because the size and spacing of holes can readily be controlled on all relevant length scales, this gives the opportunity to create designer surface plasmons with almost arbitrary dispersion in frequency and in space, opening new vistas in surface plasmon optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the freedom of design which metamaterials provide, we show how electromagnetic fields can be redirected at will and propose a design strategy. The conserved fields: electric displacement field, D, magnetic induction field, B, and Poynting vector, S, are all displaced in a consistent manner. A simple illustration is given of the cloaking of a proscribed volume of space to exclude completely all electromagnetic fields. Our work has relevance to exotic lens design and to the cloaking of objects from electromagnetic fields</description>

      <title>Tunable and low-noise WSe$_2$ quantum emitters for quantum photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-noise and tunable single-photon sources are essential components of photonic quantum technologies. However, in WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, charge noise from fluctuations in their local electrostatic environment remains a major obstacle to achieving transform-limited single-photon emission and high photon indistinguishability. Here, we systematically investigate two noise mitigation strategies in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation and electrostatic biasing. We demonstrate that hBN encapsulation alone suppresses spectral wandering (from $\sim$170 $\mu$eV to $\sim$40 $\mu$eV) and narrows emission linewidths (from $\sim$500 $\mu$eV to $\sim$150 $\mu$eV), while applied bias enables stable Stark tuning over a 280 $\mu$eV range and further linewidth narrowing down to $\sim$100 $\mu$eV reaching the resolution-limited regime. Time-resolved and second-order correlation measurements confirm stable mono-exponential decay and high single-photon purity ($g^{(2)}(0) \approx 0.01$) with no observable blinking. To quantify progress toward the transform limit, we define two figures of merit: the linewidth ratio $R = W_{\text{exp}} / W_{\text{rad}}$ and total broadening $\Delta W = W_{\text{exp}} - W_{\text{rad}}$, with both being reduced more than five-fold in optimized devices. These results provide a robust framework for developing and evaluating low-noise, tunable WSe$_2$ quantum emitters, potentially realizing electrically controllable sources of indistinguishable single-photons for future photonic quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Combining the tools for transforming space-time developed for General Relativity with the capabilities of artificially structured metamaterials, an entirely new means of controlling electromagnetic fields has emerged. Here, we utilize a coordinate transformation in which a hole is opened up in space. The transformation provides a complete prescription for an electromagnetic cloak which, although complex, can be readily constructed with metamaterials</description>

      <title>Holonomically constrained polarization transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In polarization optics, various topological constructs, namely Poincar\'e spheres of different orders, are used to represent uniform and structured polarization distributions. Similarly, there are also structured polarization optical elements. Consequently, various topological indices are defined for structured beams and elements. These topological aspects naturally allow us to holonomy-based categorization of polarization transformations. In this paper, we introduce holonomically constrained polarization transformations on topological constructs. The conditions on the topological parameters of the beams, elements and spheres to achieve holonomically constrained polarization transformations are discussed in detail. A topological treatment of holonomic systems is needed, since abundant polarization transformations reported in the literature on beams with structured polarization are nonholonomic. It is prudent to carry out this study since it can not be assumed that switching between holonomic and nonholonomic transformations does not affect the system output. It is shown here how these concepts enable us to introduce topological index spaces for polarization optics.</description>

      <title>Effects due to generation of negative frequencies during temporal diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporal diffraction from rapidly time-modulated materials can generate new frequency components not present in an incident wave. In such an experiment, the spectral extent of these new frequencies is determined by the rate of modulation relative to the period of the oscillating field. Here we present a temporal diffraction experiment carried out in the far-infrared (THz) spectral region. Using graphene, a fast modulator for this spectral domain, we show that one can modulate the transmission significantly faster than the period of a narrow band THz field. This leads to a large bandwidth for the generated frequencies, including the generation of negative frequency components. We show that interference between negative and positive frequency components give rise to distinctive oscillatory features in the transmitted spectrum.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks To Inverse Design Metasurfaces For Incident Angle-Independent Unidirectional Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization of metasurface designs for specific functionality is a challenging problem due to the intricate relation between structural features and electromagnetic responses. Recently, many researchers resolved to inverse design of metasurfaces for efficient design parameters based on methods such as parameter optimization, evolutionary optimization and machine learning. In this paper a hybrid quantum machine learning method which uses quantum encoders to enhance the performance of a classical GAN is applied to implement inverse design of a metasurface. Aiming towards angle-independent unidirectional transmission, this approach combines a Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN) with a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to optimize metasurface designs. Incident-angle independent uni-directional transmission has potential applications in efficient solar cells, thermal cooling, non-reciprocal devices, etc. However, it is very challenging to achieve such a metasurface design via forward methods and hence very few studies exist till now in this direction. The methodology employed in this work reduces the data requirement for inverse design by 30% compared to conventional GAN-based methods. More importantly, the developed metasurface designs show high fidelity of 95% with regard to the targeted far-field radiation patterns. We also provide a material look-up table for feasible substitutes of the obtained material design with real materials and yet maintaining performance accuracy. Further, we embed the inverse-designed metasurfaces into Perovskite solar cell layers to demonstrate the improvement in its performance. We observe that the conversion efficiency of the example perovskite solar cell improves by 95% and remains independent of incident angle in the range -60$^\circ$ to 60$^\circ$ within the desired frequency range.</description>

      <title>Mode-dependent Emission Thresholds and Frequencies in Metal Nanoparticles within Gain-enhanced Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a mode-resolved analysis of emission thresholds in metal nanoparticles embedded within an infinite gain medium, using Mie scattering theory as a rigorous framework. Focusing on the first three resonant modes, we identify the onset of emission by locating the complex zeros of the electric scattering coefficient a_n(omega), which serve as indicators of lasing conditions. Our hybrid numerical scheme-combining coarse bracketing and two-dimensional Newton refinement-enables precise determination of both the threshold gain G_th,n and the corresponding emission frequency omega_th,n across varying particle radii. The results uncover strong size-dependent behavior, with higher-order modes in larger particles exhibiting significantly reduced threshold gain. These insights elucidate the modal dynamics underlying plasmonic nanolasing and provide design guidelines for active photonic systems leveraging gain-enhanced nanoparticles.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of photonic spin Hall effect in Mie scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photonic spin Hall effect, a hallmark of spin-orbit interaction in light, has emerged as a platform for spin-dependent applications in nanophotonics. Due to intrinsic weak spin-orbit interaction, the resultant shift is tiny with drastically low scattering efficiency, which necessitates signal amplification and high-precision weak measurements for detection - often at the cost of further lowering the intensity. This dilemma between the photonic spin Hall shift and the scattered intensity becomes even more pronounced when the geometry shrinks to the scale of a single particle. Here, we overcome this dilemma by breaking the rotational symmetry of the scatterer to induce multipolar coupling along with strong spin-orbit coupling, resulting in superscattering that boosts the scattering intensity at the maximal photonic spin Hall shift by two orders of magnitude compared to conventional dipolar particle. By tailoring the multipolar interference, the photonic spin Hall shift is enhanced at an angle feasible for direct observation. In doing so, we perform a post-selection-free experiment to bypass the loss in intensity and preserve both the spin Hall shift and the scattering efficiency. We have, for the first time, experimentally demonstrated the predicted photonic spin Hall shift for a standalone particle through measurable differences in far-field scattering intensity in the microwave regime. These findings pave the way for a deeper exploration of the spin Hall effect of light and open new avenues for applications in precision metrology and advanced optical imaging.</description>

      <title>Hyperparametric solitons in nondegenerate optical parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative solitons and their associated low-noise, chip-scale frequency combs hold great potential for applications in optical communications, spectroscopy, precision time-keeping, and beyond. These applications drive interest in shifting soliton spectra to frequency bands far detuned from the telecom's C-band pump sources. Recent demonstrations have utilized second-harmonic generation and degenerate optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) to shift soliton combs away from the primary pump. However, these approaches lack the tunability offered by nondegenerate OPOs. This work presents a proof-of-principle demonstration of solitons in a silicon-nitride microresonator-based nondegenerate OPO system with engineered dispersion and optimized coupling rates. By pumping a relatively low-Q resonance in the C-band, we excite a signal soliton comb centred around a far-detuned, high-Q O-band resonance. This process also generates repetition-rate-locked combs at the pump and idler frequencies, with the latter occurring at a wavelength beyond
  2$\mu$m. We demonstrate that the solitons supported by this platform are distinct from other families of dissipative solitons and call them - hyperparametric solitons. They emerge when the narrow-band signal mode, phase-matched under negative pump detuning, reaches sufficient power to drive bistability in the parametric signal. We investigate the properties of hyperparametric solitons, including their parametrically generated background and multisoliton states, both experimentally and through theoretical modelling.</description>

      <title>Subpixel correction of diffraction pattern shifts in ptychography via automatic differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ptychography, a coherent diffraction imaging technique, has become an indispensable tool in materials characterization, biological imaging, and nanostructure analysis due to its capability for high-resolution, lensless reconstruction of complex-valued images. In typical workflows, raw diffraction patterns are commonly cropped to isolate the valid central region before reconstruction. However, if the crop is misaligned from the diffraction pattern's zero-order, reconstruction may suffer from slower convergence, phase wrapping, and reduced image fidelity. These issues are further exacerbated in experimental configurations involving reflective geometries or broadband illumination, where incorrect cropping introduces systematic preprocessing errors that compromise the entire ptychographic inversion. To address this challenge, we present an approach based on automatic differentiation (AD), where the cropping shift is treated as an optimizable parameter within the reconstruction framework. By integrating shift correction into the backpropagation loop, our method simultaneously refines the object, probe, and shift positions without requiring manual tuning. Simulation results demonstrate that, even with initial offsets ranging up to 5 pixels, the proposed method achieves subpixel correction, with an average deviation below 0.5 pixels. Experiments in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) regime further validate the method's robustness and effectiveness. This AD-based strategy enhances the automation and robustness of ptychographic reconstructions, and is adaptable to diverse experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Bulk-to-surface coupling of spatiotemporal vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider coupling of bulk space-time-structured waves, such as spatiotemporal vortex pulses (STVPs), to surface waves, such as surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs). For resonant coupling that preserves the frequency and tangent wavevector components, it is challenging to transfer the space-time wave structure because of the difference between the bulk and surface wave dispersions. We describe three mechanisms allowing for the bulk-to-surface conversion of STVPs: (i) suitable tilt of the pulse spectrum in the $(\omega,{\bf k})$ space; (ii) confinement of the incident pulse in the direction orthogonal to the vortex; and (iii) losses in surface waves. We supply general considerations with numerical simulations of the STVP-to-SPP coupling at a dielectric-prism/metal-film interface.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Optical Processing With Spatial Light Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for real-time data processing in applications such as neural networks and embedded control systems has spurred the search for faster, more efficient alternatives to traditional electronic systems. In response, we experimentally investigate an optical processing scheme that encodes information in the transverse wavefront of light fields using spatial light modulators. Our goal is to explore the limits on parallelism imposed by technical constraints. We begin by implementing optical an XOR logic gate applied to binary matrices. By analyzing the average error rate in the optical operation between matrices of varying sizes (up to 300 x 300 elements), we analyze the bit depth capacity of the system and the role of information redundancy. Furthermore, we successfully demonstrate image encryption and decryption using a one-time pad protocol for matrices as large as 164 x 164 elements. These findings support the development of a high-dimensional matrix optical processor.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Turbulence-Resilient Long-Range Fourier Ptychography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Fourier ptychography (FP) offers super-resolution for macroscopic imaging, its real-world application is severely hampered by atmospheric turbulence, a challenge largely unaddressed in existing macroscopic FP research operating under idealized conditions. This work establishes, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive computational framework specifically designed for turbulence mitigation in long-range FP, termed Turbulence-Mitigated FP (TMFP). Rather than correcting pupil errors, an image degradation model is developed alongside a reconstruction pipeline inspired by speckle interferometry. By taking multiple short-exposure randomly-distorted measurements and exploiting their statistical properties, the diffraction-limited sub-aperture images can be recovered for further FP reconstruction. Numerical simulations and experimental validations under optical turbulence demonstrate the method's robustness, resolution enhancement, and practicality in adverse conditions, paving the way for the reliable deployment of high-resolution macroscopic FP in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable non-Abelian geometric phase in hybrid integrated photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Abelian geometric phase possesses the capability of enabling robust and fault-resilient unitary transformations, making it a cornerstone of holonomic quantum computation. This "all-geometric" approach has successfully advanced the manipulation of electrons in condensed matter physics and has sparked growing interest in its implementation within photonics, an area that has traditionally relied on sensitive dynamic phases. However, a major limitation of the topologically protected and inherently robust geometric phase is its lack of reconfigurability. In contrast, mainstream optical computing schemes demand high reconfigurability to compensate for fabrication errors and to support diverse computational tasks. Here, we demonstrate a reconfigurable non-Abelian geometric phase based on the non-volatile phase-change material Sb$_2$Se$_3$. By switching between its crystalline and amorphous states, the number of degenerate subspaces can be actively adjusted. Thus, multilevel second-order matrices and reconfigurable third-order matrices with 3-bit control is realized. For larger reconfigurable rotation angles, tunable braiding operations are also demonstrated. Furthermore, high-dimensional reconfigurable braiding shows promising potential for applications in optical switching. Our results pave the way for the all-geometric-phase-based approach in optical computing.</description>

      <title>Sensitive and accurate femtosecond pulse characterization via two-photon absorption in Fabry-P\'erot laser diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semiconductor lasers offer native bifunctionality enabling coherent light emission and linear photodetection. They can also operate as sensitive two-photon absorption detectors due to the third-order nonlinearity of the heterostructure constituting the active region. The strong two-photon response at room temperature is highly desired in ultrafast optics, where such detectors are used for interferometric characterization of femtosecond light pulses for shape and duration. Another niche is pulse detection in dual-comb ranging. While prior studies have focused on the two-photon response of commercial photodiodes or proprietary semiconductor microcavities for intensity autocorrelation measurements, a systematic analysis of the semiconductor lasers ability to accurately characterize the optical pulse width is missing. To address this niche, here we measure autocorrelation traces of femtosecond pulses with varying durations from sub 50 fs to 250 fs at the common 1.5 $\mu$m wavelength using AlGaAs and InGaAsP laser diodes designed to operate at emission wavelengths of 0.95 $\mu$m and 1.3 $\mu$m, respectively. We validate the obtained waveforms using a silicon avalanche photodetector and conventional crystal-based second-harmonic autocorrelator. We consider the effects of optical polarization, operation mode and electrical load resistance on the shape and intensity of generated electrical signals. Our results prove the suitability of Fabry-P\'erot laser structures for interferometric autocorrelation measurements of 53 $\mu$W (220 fJ pulse energy) average power pulses as short as 33 fs with a mean square error of 7 $\times$ 10$^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Skin modes tunability and self-healing effect in photonic Floquet lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems can exhibit a number of intriguing physics not presented by the Hermitian models, including skin effect, non-Bloch bands, generalized bulk-edge correspondence and self-healing effect (SHE). In this manuscript, we demonstrate that when eigenstates are fully localized at one boundary, the biorthogonal normalization of left and right eigenstates enables the tunability of skin modes through local potential modulation at the opposite boundary,a phenomenon termed as skin mode tunability, exclusive to non-Hermitian systems. With this technique, we show that certain skin modes are highly susceptible to the local potential, allowing wide-range control over the eigenvalues' imaginary components. We demonstrate these results utilizing a finite system of $L=100$ coupled waveguides and show that the SHE can be engineered and realized on this platform with experimentally accessible parameters. This research sheds new light on the distinctive behavior of non-Hermitian skin modes, and introduces a local tuning approach for skin modes, paving the way for engineering localized skin modes in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Unveiling prethermalization and thermal processes through the simplest one-dimensional topological model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawing on classical thermodynamic principles-such as the equipartition of energy and entropy maximization-extensive research has shown that the evolution of optical power in multimode optical systems tends toward a Rayleigh-Jeans distribution at thermal equilibrium. Understanding of the processes associated with the thermalization dynamics are of fundamental importance in analyzing and controlling such complex systems. In this work, we utilize a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice as the simplest topological model to investigate the thermalization process of multiband systems in both topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. Specifically, we identify that thermalization develops in three stages: (i) out-of-equilibrium dynamics, (ii) prethermal stage and (iii) final thermalization. Each individual band constitutes a subsystem that prethermalizes to the Rayleigh-Jeans distribution predicted from its power and internal energy. We find that this leads to a continuously varying prethermalization that eventually relaxes to the final thermal state (a dynamically evolving prethermal state). The presence of topological edge states can accelerate the thermalization process, although prethermal states exist both in the topologically trivial and nontrivial regimes. Factors such as bandgap width, temperature and nonlinearity that can influence the thermalization dynamics are examined in detail. Our work may offer valuable physical insights into understanding and controlling the thermalization process in multiband optical systems, paving the way for more efficient manipulation of light in complex settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a modular user-oriented simulation toolbox for studying highharmonic generation in gases. The first release consists of the computational pipeline to 1) compute the unidirectional IR-pulse propagation incylindrical symmetry, 2) solve the microscopic responses in the whole macroscopic volume using a 1D-TDSE solver, 3) obtain the far-field harmonic field using a diffraction-integral approach. The code comes with interfaces and tutorials, based on practical laboratory conditions, to facilitate the usage and deployment of the code both locally and in HPC-clusters. Additionally, the modules are designed to work as stand-alone applications as well, e.g., 1D-TDSE is available through Pythonic interface.</description>

      <title>Hyperspectral Dual-Comb Compressive Imaging for Minimally-Invasive Video-Rate Endomicroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Endoscopic imaging is essential for real-time visualization of internal organs, yet conventional systems remain bulky, complex, and expensive due to their reliance on large, multi-element optical components. This limits their accessibility to delicate or constrained anatomical regions. Achieving real-time, high-resolution endomicroscopy using compact, low-cost hardware at the hundred-micron scale remains an unsolved challenge. Optical fibers offer a promising route toward miniaturization by providing sub-millimeter-scale imaging channels; however, existing fiber-based methods typically rely on raster scanning or multicore bundles, which limit the resolution and imaging speed. In this work, we overcome these limitations by integrating dual-comb interferometry with compressive ghost imaging and advanced computational reconstruction. Our technique, hyperspectral dual-comb compressive imaging, utilizes optical frequency combs to generate wavelength-multiplexed speckle patterns that are delivered through a single-core fiber and detected by a single-pixel photodetector. This parallel speckle illumination and detection enable snapshot compression and acquisition of image information using zero-dimensional hardware, completely eliminating the need for both spatial and spectral scanning. To decode these highly compressed signals, we develop a transformer-based deep learning model capable of rapid, high-fidelity image reconstruction at extremely low sampling ratios. This approach significantly outperforms classical ghost imaging methods in both speed and accuracy, achieving video-rate imaging with a dramatically simplified optical front-end. Our results represent a major advance toward minimally invasive, cost-effective endomicroscopy and provide a generalizable platform for optical sensing in applications where hardware constraints are critical.</description>

      <title>Deep ultraviolet resonant Raman (DUVRR) spectroscopy for spectroscopic evaluation and disinfection of food and agricultural samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demands on modern plant and food production due to climate change, regulatory pressures, and the Sustainable Development Goals necessitate advanced photonic technologies for improved sustainability. Deep ultraviolet resonant Raman (DUVRR) spectroscopy offers precise spectral fingerprinting and potential disinfection capabilities, making it a promising tool for agricultural and food sciences. We developed a cost-effective, portable DUVRR spectroscopy system using a mercury (Hg) lamp as the excitation source at 253.65 \unit{\nano\meter}. The system was tested on diverse samples, including alcohol solvents, organic extracts, and industrial chemicals. The DUVRR system successfully resolved sub-1000 \unit{\per\centi\meter} Raman peaks, enabling detailed spectral fingerprints of various constituents and biomarkers. The system's high sensitivity and specificity ensure precise identification of nutritional values and food quality. The DUV light used in the system, defined here as less than 260 \unit{\nano\meter}, demonstrated potential disinfection properties, adding significant value for food safety applications. The highly sensitive detection capability of our DUVRR system at low powers has significant implications for plant and agricultural sciences. The detailed spectral information enhances the evaluation of nutritional values, food quality, and ripening processes. This dually-functional system is highly valuable for precision farming, food production, and quality control. Our DUVRR spectroscopy system provides a highly sensitive, affordable, and portable method for the spectroscopic evaluation and disinfection of food and agricultural samples. Its ability to resolve detailed Raman peaks below 1000 \unit{\per\centi\meter}, combined with DUV light's disinfection capabilities, makes it a promising tool for advancing sustainability and safety in agriculture and food production.</description>

      <title>Amorphous Silicon-Carbide Photonics for Ultrasound Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic ultrasound sensors offer unparalleled potential for improving spatial and temporal resolution in ultrasound imaging applications due to their size-independent noise figure, high sensitivity, and broad bandwidth characteristics. The exploration of optical materials in ultrasound sensing has attracted significant interest due to their potential to further enhance device performance, fabrication compatibility, and long-term stability. This work introduces amorphous silicon carbide (a-SiC) as a material for optical ultrasound sensing. a-SiC offers a balanced combination of optical confinement, low propagation loss, and high material stability, enabling sensitive and miniaturized microring sensors. We demonstrate a compact ultrasound detection system with a linear array of 20 transducers coupled to a single bus waveguide. The sensors feature a maximum optical finesse of 1320 and an intrinsic platform sensitivity of 78 fm/kPa, leading to a noise equivalent pressure density below 55 $\mathrm{mPa}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, which is calibrated to a hydrophone from 3.36 MHz to 30 MHz. Additionally, we perform high-resolution ultrasound imaging of fine structures, highlighting the viability of these sensors in real-world applications. Moreover, its low deposition temperature allows a-SiC material for optical ultrasound sensors to be integrated on most substrates. These results position a-SiC as a promising material for optical ultrasound sensing, offering a miniaturized, low-loss, and high-sensitivity solution for next-generation photoacoustic imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Directional Flow of Confined Polaritons in CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale control of energy transport is a central challenge in modern photonics. Utilization of exciton-polaritons hybrid light-matter quasiparticles is one viable approach, but it typically demands complex device engineering to enable directional transport. Here, we demonstrate that the van der Waals magnet CrSBr offers an inherent avenue for steering polariton transport leveraging a unique combination of intrinsic optical anisotropy, high refractive index, and excitons dressed by photons. This combination enables low-loss guided modes that propagate tens of microns along the crystal $a$-axis, while simultaneously inducing strong one-dimensional confinement along the orthogonal $b$-axis. By embedding CrSBr flakes in a microcavity, we further enhance the confinement, as evidenced by energy modes that are discretized along the $b$-axis but continuous along the $a$-axis. Moreover, the magneto-exciton coupling characteristic of CrSBr allows unprecedented control over both unidirectional propagation and confinement. Our results establish CrSBr as a versatile polaritonic platform for integrated optoelectronic device applications, including energy-efficient optical modulators and switches.</description>

      <title>Light Pipe Holographic Display: Bandwidth-preserved Kaleidoscopic Guiding for AR Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a holographic display using a light pipe for augmented reality, and the hologram rendering method via bandwidth-preserved kaleidoscopic guiding method. Conventional augmented reality displays typically share optical architectures where the light engine and image combiner are adjacent. Minimizing the size of both components is highly challenging, and most commercial and research prototypes of augmented reality displays are bulky, front-heavy and sight-obstructing. Here, we propose the use of light pipe to decouple and spatially reposition the light engine from the image combiner, enabling a pragmatic glasses-type design. Through total internal reflection, light pipes have an advantage in guiding the full angular bandwidth regardless of its length. By modeling such kaleidoscopic guiding of the wavefront inside the light pipe and applying it to holographic image generation, we successfully separate the light engine from the image combiner, making the front of the device clear and lightweight. We experimentally validate that the proposed light pipe system delivers virtual images with high-quality and 3D depth cues. We further present a method to simulate and compensate for light pipe misalignment, enhancing the robustness and practicality of the proposed system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3D printing of high-quality silica photonic structures is particularly challenging, as surface roughness at the nanoscale can severely degrade optical performance through scattering losses. Here, we develop a technique to fold ultrasmooth silica on silicon chips into such desired 3D structures. A laser-induced, surface-tension-driven method achieves folding with 20 nm alignment accuracy, enabling origami-like polylines and helices with integrated 0.5 nm-smooth photonic devices. The technique allows for the fabrication of record length-to-thickness ratio structures, incorporating concave micromirrors with numerical aperture of 0.41, and microresonators with quality factors exceeding ${8 \times 10^6}$. This on-chip silica origami approach offers a pathway to transform planar electro-opto-mechanical circuits into high-quality 3D configurations.</description>

      <title>Compact, intense attosecond sources driven by hollow Gaussian beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation (HHG) enables the up-conversion of intense infrared or visible femtosecond laser pulses into extreme-ultraviolet attosecond pulses. However, the highly nonlinear nature of the process results in low conversion efficiency, which can be a limitation for applications requiring substantial pulse energy, such as nonlinear attosecond time-resolved spectroscopy or single-shot diffractive imaging. Refocusing of the attosecond pulses is also essential to achieve a high intensity, but difficult in practice due to strong chromatic aberrations. In this work, we address both the generation and the refocusing of attosecond pulses by sculpting the driving beam into a ring-shaped intensity profile with no spatial phase variations, referred to as a Hollow Gaussian beam (HGB). Our experimental and theoretical results reveal that HGBs efficiently redistribute the driving laser energy in the focus, where the harmonics are generated on a ring with low divergence, which furthermore decreases with increasing order. Although generated as a ring, the attosecond pulses can be refocused with greatly reduced chromatic spread, therefore reaching higher intensity. This approach enhances the intensity of refocused attosecond pulses and enables significantly higher energy to be delivered in the driving beam without altering the focusing conditions. These combined advantages open pathways for compact, powerful, tabletop, laser-driven attosecond light sources.</description>

      <title>Disorder-enabled Synthetic Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces have catalyzed transformative advances across imaging, optoelectronics, quantum information processing, sensing, energy conversion, and optical computing. Yet, despite this rapid progress, most research remains focused on optimizing single functionalities, constrained by the persistent challenge of integrating multiple functions within a single device. Here, we demonstrate that engineered structural disorder of metapixels, used to implement a photonic function, can significantly reduce the area required across the entire aperture without compromising optical performance. The unallocated space can then be repurposed to encode functionally distinct metapixels without increasing the design complexity, each independently addressable via various optical degrees of freedom. As a proof of concept, we present a synthetic achromatic metalens featuring 11 spectrally distinct lens profiles encoded through nonlocal metapixels engineered to support sharp resonances via quasi bound states in the continuum. This large-scale metalens with 8.1 mm aperture achieves diffraction-limited achromatic focusing across the 1200 to 1400 nm spectral window. We further incorporate polarization-selective metapixels to implement momentum-space distinct gratings, enabling single-shot, high spatial resolution polarimetric imaging of arbitrarily structured light fields, including radial and azimuthal vector beams and optical skyrmions. Altogether, this disorder-enabled synthetic metasurface platform establishes a versatile foundation for unifying diverse photonic functionalities within a single optical element, marking a substantial step toward compact, high-density, multifunctional optical devices.</description>

      <title>Analytical Model for Light Scattering in Transparent Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transparent composites that combine optical transmittance with mechanical performance are increasingly important for applications in optical devices, sustainable building materials, and photonic engineering. However, predicting light scattering in such materials remains a challenge due to complex, multi-scale microstructural interactions. Here, we present a physically grounded and computationally efficient analytical model. It predicts angular light scattering in transparent composites based on the Average Interface Number (AIN), a single governing microstructural metric derived in this work from geometrical optics. The model accurately captures angular scattering behavior in both fiber- and particle-reinforced composites, as well as in transparent wood. We further introduce the Equivalent Average Interface Number (EAIN), combining AIN with refractive index mismatch into a unified parameter for fast haze prediction. Deep neural network (DNN) analyses confirm AIN as the dominant feature influencing optical scattering. The model predictions are supported by ray-tracing simulations and experimental trends from literature. Finally, we demonstrate the application of our model in fast image rendering simulations through transparent composites. This work provides a compact and practical toolbox for optical design and optimization of transparent structural materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically discuss a new kind of photonic spin-Hall effect (PSHE) for optical beams propagating inside an inhomogeneously twisted anisotropic material. The rotation angle plays the role of an effective gauge field. When the twisting distribution is odd symmetric, the optical beams move along mirror-symmetric trajectories according to their helicity. Connection of this volumetric PSHE with the geometric phase and the Kapitza effect is elucidated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a diffusion equation for light scattering from ejecta produced by extreme shocks on metallic samples. This model is easier to handle than a more conventional model based on the Radiative Transfer Equation (RTE), and is a relevant tool to analyze spectrograms obtained from Photon Doppler Velocimetry (PDV) measurements in the deep multiple scattering regime. We also determine the limits of validity of the diffusive model compared to the RTE, based on a detailed analysis of various ejecta properties in configurations with increasing complexity.</description>

      <title>Surface Plasmon Polariton Excitation in Time-modulated Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) are central to application areas such as sensing, energy harvesting, and nanoscale optics, and are typically excited via spatial structuring -- an approach lacking dynamic control. We demonstrate that step-like time modulation allows the excitation and out-coupling of SPPs through modulating a dispersive Drude-like metal thereby modelling realistic transparent conducting oxides; this establishes a pathway for the active control and extraction of plasmons in experimentally viable time-varying systems. Using finite-difference time-domain simulations we show that time modulation facilitates both the launching and radiation of surface plasmons with frequencies governed by the dispersion of the bounding media. Our results also reveal the generation of time-reflected waves and the emergence of a magnetostatic mode required for matching boundary conditions at the temporal interface.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic Structural Light Absorbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of light with optical and mechanical systems is influenced by material properties, geometrical configurations, and surface topographies. Designing these systems necessitates a careful balance of conflicting requirements, such as minimising size and weight while simultaneously improving heat transfer and reducing stray light from illuminated peripheral mounting surfaces. Stray light is typically mitigated by apertures, coatings, and microscopic structures, alongside maintaining cleanliness. However, using apertures may not always be feasible, and effective optical absorber coatings or microscopic light absorbing structures can be costly and sensitive to environmental factors such as abrasion, radiation heating, or cleaning agents.
  In a proof-of-concept investigation, we design and analyse macroscopic structural light absorbers realised as periodic minimal surface approximations and quasi-stochastic lattices. The term "macroscopic" refers to minimal structural dimensions of approximately 100 micrometres. By increasing the number of reflections before residual reflected light reaches a hemispherical receiver, we achieve reductions in received peak intensities by factors of less than 0.39 and average intensities by factors of less than 0.65, without altering the surface properties.
  Macroscopic structural light absorbers support cost-effective and robust light-absorbing materials, such as black anodised aluminium or ABS polymers, while still achieving satisfactory stray light suppression. This approach is applicable to aerospace optical systems (such as telescopes and imaging spectrometers), as well as general scientific and industrial optical instruments and commercial products (including projectors and luminaires). The demonstrated structures can be sustainably fabricated through additive manufacturing processes like laser powder bed fusion.</description>

      <title>Viscoelastic Characterization of Melanoma Cells Using Brillouin Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, Brillouin spectroscopy was employed to investigate the viscoelastic properties of melanoma cells in vitro. Using a custom-built confocal Brillouin microspectrometer, we obtained Brillouin shifts and full width at half maximum (FWHM) values, enabling the non-invasive assessment of cellular stiffness and viscosity. The Brillouin spectra revealed the biomechanical characteristics of melanoma cells, with measured shifts and FWHM values providing a detailed viscoelastic profile. These findings demonstrate the capability of Brillouin microscopy to probe the mechanical properties of cancer cells at the subcellular level. This technique holds significant potential for advancing cancer research by providing insights into the mechanical behavior of melanoma cells, which could inform the development of diagnostic tools and therapeutic strategies based on cellular biomechanics.</description>

      <title>Quantum Quasinormal Mode Theory for Dissipative Nano-Optics and Magnetodielectric Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unprecedented pace of evolution in nanoscale architectures for cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has posed crucial challenges for theory, where the quantum dynamics arising from the non-perturbative dressing of matter by cavity electric and magnetic fields, as well as the fundamentally non-hermitian character of the system are to be treated without significant approximation. The lossy electromagnetic resonances of photonic, plasmonic or magnonic nanostructures are described as quasinormal modes (QNMs), whose properties and interactions with quantum emitters and spin qubits are central to the understanding of dissipative nano-optics and magnetodielectric cQED. Despite recent advancements toward a fully quantum framework for QNMs, a general and universally accepted approach to QNM quantization for arbitrary linear media remains elusive. In this work, we introduce a unified theoretical framework, based on macroscopic QED and complex coordinate transformations, that achieves QNM quantization for a wide class of spatially inhomogeneous, dissipative (with possible gain components) and dispersive, linear, magnetodielectric resonators. The complex coordinate transformations effectively convert the radiative losses into non-radiative material dissipation, and via a suitable transformation that reflects all the losses of the resonator, we define creation and annihilation operators that allow the construction of modal Fock states for the joint excitations of field-dressed matter. By directly addressing the intricacies of modal loss in a fully quantum theory of magnetodielectric cQED, our approach enables the exploration of modern, quantum nano-optical experiments utilizing dielectric, plasmonic, magnetic or hybrid cQED architectures, and paves the way towards a rigorous assessment of room-temperature quantum nanophotonic technologies without recourse to ad hoc quantization schemes.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoparticles are ubiquitous, and methods that reveal insights into single-particle properties are highly desired to enable their advanced characterization. Techniques that achieve label-free single-nanoparticle detection often lack bandwidth or do not provide quantitative information. Here, we present a cavity-based dispersive sensing method that achieves a high bandwidth to capture all relevant timescales of translational diffusion, and a sensitivity to detect and size single particles with diameters down to 3 nm. We develop an analytical model describing the autocorrelation function for particle diffusion in a standing-wave sensing geometry and propose a method to address the challenges posed by the transient nature of single-particle signals. With this, we achieve quantitative particle sizing with high precision and accuracy, and provide an important tool to analyze single-particle diffusion.</description>

      <title>Stealthy-Hyperuniform Wave Dynamics in Two-Dimensional Photonic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperuniform structures are spatial patterns whose fluctuations disappear on long length scales, making them effectively homogeneous when observed from afar. Mathematically, this means that their spectral density, $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$, approaches zero for low wavenumber, $|\textbf{k}|$. Crystalline lattices are hyperuniform, as are certain quasicrystals, maximally random jammed packing of spheres, and electrons in the fractional quantum Hall state. Stealthy-hyperuniformity is an even stronger constraint on the spectral density: it requires that $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$ is strictly zero in a finite range of wavevectors around $\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{0}$, called the stealthy regime, or exclusion region. Since the degree of scattering by disorder is, to leading order, proportional to $\tilde{\rho}({\bf k})$, waves propagating through such structures may do so without scattering for sufficiently long wavelengths and short distances. Here, we measure scattering by disorder in photonic crystal slabs with stealthy-hyperuniform disorder by measuring the linewidths of the photonic bands. We observe the transition between the stealthy and non-stealthy regimes, marked by a sharp increase in linewidth. We also observe the effects of multiple scattering in the stealthy regime, which implies diminishing transparency. Moreover, we show that residual single scattering in the stealthy regime arises from an intrinsically non-Hermitian effect: propagating light has a complex effective mass due to radiative loss out of the slab.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical system is a complex and precise subsystem for the atom interferometer (AI), especially for those used in field or space applications. Here, we introduce the design of the optical system of the China Space Station atom interferometer (CSSAI). The scheme is optimized to reduce the complexity while maintaining the capability to achieve the dual-species AI. It features a fused silica optical bench with bonding technology, ensuring compactness and smaller thermal deformation. Spatial structures are designed to isolate the vibration and transfer the heat. After assembling, the optical system has a size of 250 mm * 240 mm * 104 mm and weighs 5.2 kg. After installing in the CSSAI, it passed the thermal and mechanical tests and then launched to the China Space Station (CSS). The output laser power changes are less than 15% from ground to space, and its long-term fluctuations are less than 2.5% for months in space. Cold atom preparation and interference are also realized in space. This optical system is extremely integrated and robust, which provides a foundation for the design of future cold atom payloads in space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective thermal management at variable and extreme temperatures face limitations for the development of novel energy and aerospace applications. Plasmonic approaches, shown to be capable of tailoring black-body emission, could be effective if materials with high-temperature and tunable plasmonic-resonance were available. Here, we report a synergy between experimental and theoretical results proving that many high-entropy transition-metal carbides, consisting of four or more metals at equal molar ratio, have plasmonic resonance at room, high (&gt;1000C) and variable temperatures. We also found that these high-entropy carbides can be tuned and show considerable plasmonic thermal cycling stability. This paradigm-shift approach could prove quite advantageous as it facilitates the accelerated rational discovery and manufacturability of optically highly-optimized high-entropy carbides with ad-hoc properties.</description>

      <title>Theory of Three-Photon Transport Through a Weakly Coupled Atomic Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding multi-photon interactions in non-equilibrium quantum systems is an outstanding challenge in quantum optics. In this work, we develop an analytical and diagrammatic framework to explore three-photon interactions in atomic ensembles weakly coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. Taking advantage of the weak coupling, we use our diagrammatic framework to perform perturbation theory and calculate the leading-order contributions to the three-photon wavefunction, which would otherwise be intractable. We then compute the outgoing photon wavefunction of a resonantly driven atomic ensemble, with photon-photon interactions truncated up to three photons. Our formulation not only captures the individual transmission of photons but also isolates the connected S-matrix elements that embody genuine photon-photon correlations. Through detailed analysis, we obtain the analytic expressions of the connected third-order correlation function and the third-order electric-field-quadrature cumulant, which reveal non-Gaussian signatures emerging from the interplay of two- and three-photon processes. We also calculate the optical depth where non-Gaussian photon states can be observed. Numerical simulations based on a cascaded master equation validate our analytical predictions on a small-scale system. These results provide a formalism to further explore non-equilibrium quantum optics in atomic ensembles and extend this to the regime of non-Gaussian photon transport.</description>

      <title>Chirality-dependent terahertz topological resonance and inertial dynamics of magnetic skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of the terahertz (THz) optical response of magnetic skyrmions governed by an inertial-modified Thiele equation. By incorporating the inertial mass term, we derive analytical expressions for the THz absorption spectrum of skyrmions, revealing a topological resonance phenomenon tunable via the skyrmion's topological charge $Q$, damping factor $\alpha$, and effective mass $m$. The resonance frequency $\omega_0 \propto Q/m$ emerges from the interplay between gyroscopic coupling and inertial mass, enabling precise control over skyrmion dynamics through circularly polarized THz fields. Our results demonstrate that the helical motion trajectories and velocity components of skyrmions depend on the chirality of light and the topological charge $Q$, with critical damping $\alpha_c$ marking the transition to overdamped regimes. Our findings establish an optical method for designing tunable THz devices, such as topological filters and detectors, by exploiting the interplay between magnetic skyrmion topology and the chirality of THz light coupling.</description>

      <title>Determination of Particle-Size Distributions from Light-Scattering Measurement Using Constrained Gaussian Process Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel methodology for robustly estimating particle size distributions from optical scattering measurements using constrained Gaussian process regression. The estimation of particle size distributions is commonly formulated as a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind, an ill-posed inverse problem characterized by instability due to measurement noise and limited data. To address this, we use a Gaussian process prior to regularize the solution and integrate a normalization constraint into the Gaussian process via two approaches: by constraining the Gaussian process using a pseudo-measurement and by using Lagrange multipliers in the equivalent optimization problem. To improve computational efficiency, we employ a spectral expansion of the covariance kernel using eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator, resulting in a computationally tractable low-rank representation without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we investigate two complementary strategies for hyperparameter estimation: a data-driven approach based on maximizing the unconstrained log marginal likelihood, and an alternative approach where the physical constraints are taken into account. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed constrained Gaussian process regression framework accurately reconstructs particle size distributions, producing numerically stable, smooth, and physically interpretable results. This methodology provides a principled and efficient solution for addressing inverse scattering problems and related ill-posed integral equations.</description>

      <title>High-harmonic spectroscopy of the nonadiabatic coupling via Floquet-Bloch states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong laser light drives complex quantum electron dynamics in solids, which is captured by the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process. Here we report the observation of laser-dressed Floquet-Bloch states (FBSs) at the edge of the Brillouin zone (BZ) in HHG, by driving a large-bandgap MgO crystal in the strong-field regime where the laser pulse is intense enough both to accelerate electrons to the BZ edge as well as to dress the bands. We experimentally show and numerically confirm that the HHG spectrum encodes the nonadiabatic coupling between the conduction bands and FBSs, induced by the high-intensity driver, when some high harmonics are resonant with the dressed band structure. This enables us to trace the bandgap morphology - expanding HHG-spectroscopy techniques to cover the HHG tomography of the BZ edge.</description>

      <title>Probing coherent electronic superpositions of singly- and doubly-excited states of krypton with attosecond four-wave mixing spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative nonlinear four-wave mixing can monitor the evolution of electronic wave packets, providing access to lifetimes and quantifies the light induced couplings between excited states. We report the observation of quantum beats in an autoionizing electronic wavepacket in krypton, probed using this technique. Analysis of the signal reveals that these beats originate from the contribution of previously unassigned, doubly excited states interacting with singly excited ones. We introduce a minimal theoretical model, based on multichannel quantum defect theory, that quantitatively reproduces both the wavepacket dynamics and the static spectrum. This work combines a versatile, background-free experimental scheme with a tractable model, establishing a powerful approach for the metrology and control of complex, correlated electronic states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators (NOs) for solving the problem of diffraction of Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) electromagnetic waves from a mask are presented. A novel hybrid Waveguide Neural Operator (WGNO) is introduced, which is based on a waveguide method with its most computationally expensive part replaced by a neural network. Numerical experiments on realistic 2D and 3D masks show that the WGNO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and inference time, providing a highly efficient solution for accelerating the design workflows of lithography masks.</description>

      <title>Coherent synchrotron radiation by excitation of surface plasmon polariton on near-critical solid microtube surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) is vital for developing powerful ultrashort light sources. We introduce a CSR generation mechanism using surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) resonantly excited on a solid, near-critical-density microtube. A high-intensity, circularly polarised laser pulse, propagating along the microtube axis, efficiently couples the cylindrical SPP modes. This process creates azimuthally structured, rotating electromagnetic fields. These rotating fields subsequently confine, modulate, and directly accelerate surface electrons, causing them to emit CSR in the Valilov-Cherenkov angle. We further demonstrate that by improving the azimuthal symmetry, the helical modulation enables CSR emission across all azimuthal directions, significantly enhancing radiation intensity even when full coherence is imperfect. The harmonics can be well isolated for a high charge beam. Our full 3D Particle-in-Cell simulations indicate this scheme can generate X-rays with coherence enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude compared to incoherent emission.</description>

      <title>From Wavefunctional Entanglement to Entangled Wavefunctional Degrees of Freedom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of whether entanglement between photons is equivalent to entanglement between their characteristic field modes, specifically, the single-particle wavefunctions that are composed and superposed to describe identical particles, is a key, open problem concerning multi-partite optical degrees of freedom, and has profound implications for topics ranging from quantum foundations to quantum computation. In this Letter, I offer a fresh, deeper, physical insight into this subtle, albeit enduring, issue by describing a situation in which entangling interactions between optical modes, namely, the wavefunctions can be distilled into genuine entanglement between the physical properties of the photons, which are the wavefunctional degrees of freedom. This theoretical observation also highlights the salience of the measurement context, especially, of clearly disambiguating between the choice of the quantum subsystem and the decision to measure an observable along a particular axis of measurement, while quantifying and transforming quantum optical entanglement. This understanding might be applied to formulate a new class of protocols for distilling quantum magic from contextually and nonlocally entangled photons within inseparable field modes.</description>

Abstract: Multiport interferometers can be constructed out of two-port components in various ways. We study how this choice affects the quality of the operations performed by the interferometer, through the asymmetry of optical losses in the multiport. We find that some operations benefit from asymmetrically designed interferometers. Our results point to a fundamental tradeoff between lowering infidelity and achieving high success rates, which are key considerations in quantum information processing applications. Our results challenge the common understanding that balanced losses are always optimal for quantum information processing tasks.</description>

      <title>Experimental entropic uncertainty relations in dimensions three to five</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide experimental validation of tight entropic uncertainty relations for the Shannon entropies of observables with mutually unbiased eigenstates in high dimensions. In particular, we address the cases of dimensions $d = 3$, $4$ and $5$ and consider from $2$ to $d+1$ mutually unbiased bases. The experiment is based on pulsed frequency bins measured with a multi-output quantum pulse gate, which can perform projective measurements on a complete high-dimensional basis in the time-frequency domain. Our results fit the theoretical predictions: the bound on the sum of the entropies is never violated and is saturated by the states that minimize the uncertainty relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over nearly two decades, Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM) has become a standard technique for extracting dynamic correlation functions from time-lapse microscopy data, with applications spanning colloidal suspensions, polymer solutions, active fluids, and biological systems. In its most common implementation, DDM analyzes image sequences acquired with a conventional microscope equipped with a digital camera, yielding time- and wavevector-resolved information analogous to that obtained in multi-angle Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS). With a widening array of applications and a growing, heterogeneous user base, lowering the technical barrier to performing DDM has become a central objective. In this tutorial article, we provide a step-by-step guide to conducting DDM experiments -- from planning and acquisition to data analysis -- and introduce the open-source software package fastDDM, designed to efficiently process large image datasets. fastDDM employs optimized, parallel algorithms that reduce analysis times by up to four orders of magnitude on typical datasets (e.g., 10,000 frames), thereby enabling high-throughput workflows and making DDM more broadly accessible across disciplines.</description>

      <title>Violation of local realism with spatially multimode parametric down-conversion pumped by spatially incoherent light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a violation of local realism with negligible spatial postselection on the polarization-entangled two-photon states produced by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) pumped by a spatially incoherent light source-a light-emitting diode (LED). While existing studies have observed such a violation only by post-selecting the LED-pumped SPDC into a single spatial detection mode, we achieve a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt inequality violation of $S = 2.532 \pm 0.069 &gt; 2$ using a spatially multimode detection setup that supports more than 45,000 spatial modes. These results indicate that coherent pump sources, such as lasers, are not required for SPDC-based entanglement generation. Our work could enable novel and practical sources of entangled photons for quantum technologies such as device-independent quantum key distribution and quantum-enhanced sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study theoretically the emission and lasing properties of a single nanoshell spaser nanoparticle, or plasmonic nanolaser, made of an active core (gain material) and a plasmonic metal shell. Based on an analytical framework coupling together time-dependent equations for the gain and the metal, we calculate the lasing threshold with the help of an instability analysis. We characterize the regime under the threshold, where the nanoshell behaves as an optical amplifier when excited by an incident probe field. We then investigate in depth the non-linear lasing regime above the threshold, under autonomous conditions (free lasing without external drive), by computing the system's dynamics both in the transient state and in the final steady state. We show that at threshold, the lasing starts at one frequency only, usually one of the plasmon resonances of the nanoshell; then as the gain is further raised, the emission widens to other frequencies. This differs significantly from previous findings in the literature, which found only one emission wavelength above threshold. We proceed to calculate the complete (maximal) emission spectrum of the nanolaser as well as its emission linewidth, both of which are evidenced to be affected by unusually strong frequency shifts (pull-out) effects. We find that the nanolaser emission is highly asymmetrical spectrally and only occurs on one side (high-frequency) of the plasmon resonance. Finally, we show that the spectral position of the emission line can be tuned across the whole visible range, by changing the geometrical aspect ratio of the nanoshell.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20567v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Noise can play an important role in nonlinear pulse propagation. It is not only the origin of fluctuations in supercontinuum but can also determine the generated signal amplitude and phase, as seen in phenomena such as noise-seeded four-wave mixing and spontaneous Raman scattering. Current models rely on input-pulse shot noise and Raman Langevin term to simulate noise-seeded Kerr effects and spontaneous Raman scattering, respectively. However, they cannot accurately simulate any nonlinear effects exhibiting asymmetries, for example, between spontaneous Stokes and anti-Stokes generation, or in amplification with emission and absorption cross sections. Moreover, combining these two techniques does not lead to accurate modeling of both effects simultaneously, especially in unsaturated Raman operational regimes or supercontinuum where spontaneous Raman emission noise plays a crucial role. To resolve this issue, we propose a new modified shot-noise model by directly introducing noise into the pulse propagation equation. It minimally modifies current models that contain only stimulated terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong coupling between matter and vacuum electromagnetic fields in a cavity can induce novel quantum phases in thermal equilibrium via symmetry breaking. Particularly intriguing is the coupling with circularly polarized cavity fields, which can break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and lead to topological bands. This has spurred significant interest in developing chiral cavities that feature broken TRS, especially in the terahertz (THz) frequency range, where various large-oscillator-strength resonances exist. Here, we present a design for high-quality-factor THz chiral photonic-crystal cavities (PCCs) that achieves broken TRS using a magnetoplasma in a lightly doped semiconductor. We incorporate ab initio density functional theory calculations into the derived microscopic model, allowing a realistic estimate of the vacuum-induced gap in graphene when coupled to our chiral cavity. Our calculations show an enhancement in the light-matter interaction due to Dirac nodes and predict an energy gap on the order of 1 meV. The THz chiral PCCs offer a promising platform for exploring cavity-dressed condensed matter with broken TRS.</description>

      <title>A New Method for Wavefront Sensing using Optical Masking Interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wave front sensing of the surface of equal phase for a propagating electromagnetic wave is a vital technology in fields ranging from real time adaptive optics, to high accuracy metrology, to medical optometry. We have developed a new method of wavefront sensing that makes a direct measurement of the electromagnetic phase distribution, or path-length delay, across an optical wavefront. The method is based on techniques developed in radio astronomical interferometric imaging. The method employs optical interferometry using a 2-D aperture mask, a Fourier transform of the interferogram to derive interferometric visibilities, and self-calibration of the complex visibilities to derive the voltage amplitude and phase gains at each hole in the mask, corresponding to corrections for non-uniform illumination and wavefront distortions across the aperture, respectively. The derived self-calibration gain phases are linearly proportional to the electromagnetic path-length distribution to each hole in the aperture mask, relative to the path-length to the reference hole, and hence represent a wavefront sensor with a precision of a small fraction of a wavelength. The method was tested at $\lambda=400\,$nm at the Xanadu optical bench at the ALBA synchrotron light source using a rotating mirror to insert tip-tilt changes in the wavefront. We reproduce the wavefront tilts to within $0.1''$ ($5\times 10^{-7}$~radians). We also derive the static metrology though the optical system for non-planar wavefront distortions to $\sim \pm1$~nm repeatability. Lastly, we derive frame-to-frame variations of the wavefront tilt due to vibrations of the optical components which range up to $\sim 0.5"$. These variations are relevant to adaptive optics applications. Based on the measured visibility phase noise after self-calibration, we estimate an rms path-length precision per 1~ms exposure of 0.6 nm.</description>

      <title>Double-pass rotating z-cut quartz plate as a rapidly variable waveplate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a rapidly tunable waveplate based on a rotating z-cut quartz plate in a double-pass configuration. In contrast to previous single-pass implementations, where angular rotation of birefringent crystals causes significant beam path displacement, we show that the double-pass geometry effectively suppresses beam walk-off, reducing lateral shifts to below 10 $\mu$m, which is stable enough to have a fiber coupling. We present a full theoretical description of the polarization changes using Jones matrix calculations and verify it through polarization-resolved measurements. Additionally, the retardation is stable across a broad spectral range without requiring wavelength-specific optimization. When combined with a polarizing beam splitter, the system functions as a high-speed optical power modulator, achieving a dynamic power conversion in 1~ms with its contrast about 1000:1. This compact and robust design is particularly suited for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) physics experiments requiring rapid and precise control of light intensity.</description>

      <title>Broadband Two-Dimensional Far-Field Beam Profiling of Commercial CW Terahertz Photomixers from 0.2 to 1.5 THz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic far-field characterization of four commercial PIN diode terahertz photomixers over the 0.2-1.5 THz frequency range using a two-dimensional (2D) raster scanning method. The emission pattern of each transmitter, equipped with an integrated hyper-hemispherical silicon lens, was characterized using a broadband Schottky diode receiver over a 35 mm x 35 mm grid grid. The results reveal consistent frequency-dependent beam divergence and the emergence of distinct Airy diffraction patterns at intermediate frequencies, attributed to lens-induced aperture effects. In addition to qualitative mapping, we extract quantitative metrics -- including divergence slope, beam asymmetry, ellipticity, and centroid variability -- that enable objective comparison of beam profiles across devices and frequencies. This comprehensive mapping underscores the importance of full 2D beam profiling for understanding THz propagation and offers insights into lens design and photomixer packaging for optimized system performance.</description>

      <title>A refinement of the Lorentz local field expression with impact on the Clausius-Mossotti and Lorentz-Lorenz models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01993v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 19th century Mossotti and Clausius developed an expression linking the electrical permittivity of a dielectric to the product of molecular polarizability and number density. Lorenz and Lorentz later extended this framework to encompass the refractive index of the dielectric. These classical expressions have proven remarkably successful in describing how permittivity and refractive index vary with number density, under the assumption that molecular polarizability remains relatively constant. While these models have stood the test of time and continue to offer valuable insights, their derivation relies on an approximation of the local electric field within a spherical cavity that simulates the molecular environment, excluding the field generated by the molecule or molecules themselves. For regimes of higher number densities, such as those encountered in densified dielectrics, employing an exact solution for the local field becomes increasingly important. This refinement extends the applicability of the Clausius-Mossotti and Lorentz-Lorenz equations and leads to more accurate estimates of molecular polarizability in general.</description>

      <title>Active, reactive and instantaneous optical forces on small particles in the time domain: Ultrafast attosecond subcycle pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently discovered reactive optical forces have nule time-average of their instantaneous values on monochromatic illumination, so that their detection suggests the use of ultrafast optics, specially in the femto and attosecond domains. By using illumination with subcycle attosecond evanescent pulses, we report a theoretical study of the time variations of instantaneous forces and the behaviour of reactive forces versus those active \bb on small resonant particles that we consider dipolar. We demonstrate how the structure of these pulses permit to obtain three remarkable novel effects on electric dipoles; namely, a lateral force, a pulling force against the canonical and Poynting momenta of the wavefield, and a levitating effect on the particle under repetition of the pulse. We expect that this study inaugurates a novel research in the area of optical manipulation. Future developments and experiments based on this theory should increase the insight and operation of the ultrafast dynamics of nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved three-dimensional elucidation of complex-refractive-index alteration induced by ultrashort laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrashort pulse lasers (USPLs) have attracted attention as tools capable of inducing unique phenomena by instantaneously generating regions with transiently modified properties (filaments) in the material. However, a comprehensive understanding of USPL-induced filaments remains elusive due to the complexity of their dynamics and insufficient imaging techniques to accurately capture them. In this study, we propose a novel methodology to measure the transient complex refractive index of filaments through polarization analysis of a probe pulse. To our knowledge, this approach achieves, for the first time, accurate three dimensional mapping of the ultrafast fluctuations in complex refractive index. The present findings provide critical insights into the ablation mechanisms driven by USPLs, essential for optimizing laser parameters in micro- and nanoprocessing. Moreover, this work contributes valuable experimental data to condensed matter and computational physics by elucidating the physical properties of USPL-irradiated regions.</description>

      <title>A scalable and programmable optical neural network in a time-synthetic dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Programmable optical neural networks (ONNs) can offer high-throughput and energy-efficient solutions for accelerating artificial intelligence (AI) computing. However, existing ONN architectures, typically based on cascaded unitary transformations such as Mach-Zehnder interferometer meshes, face inherent scalability limitations due to spatial encoding, which causes optical components and system complexity to scale quadratically with network size. A promising solution to this challenge is the use of synthetic dimensions to enhance scalability, though experimental demonstration has remained scarce. Here, we present the first experimental demonstration of an all-optical, highly scalable, programmable ONN operating in a time-synthetic dimension. By implementing a time-cycle computation paradigm analogous to gate cycling in conventional spatial photonic circuits, our approach achieves a gate count surpassing that of state-of-the-art programmable photonic processors. Unlike conventional ONN architectures that rely on real-space wave interferences, our framework exploits time-reflection and time-refraction to perform computations, fundamentally eliminating backscattering errors through causality constraints. To bridge the gap between simulation and reality, we introduce an in-situ training framework that dynamically adapts to experimental errors, achieving performance exceeding traditional in silico learning paradigms. Our synthetic-dimension-based approach provides a compact, scalable, backscattering-free, and programmable neuromorphic computing architecture, advancing the potential for next-generation photonic AI systems.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale cuticle mass density variations influenced by pigmentation in butterfly wing scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16628v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How pigment distribution influences the cuticle density within a microscopic butterfly wing scale, and how both impact each scale's final reflected color, remains unknown. We use ptychographic X-ray computed tomography to quantitatively determine, at nanoscale resolutions, the three-dimensional mass density of scales with pigmentation differences. By comparing cuticle densities between two pairs of scales with pigmentation differences, we determine that the density of the lower lamina is inversely correlated with pigmentation. In the upper lamina structure of Junonia orithya and Bicyclus anynana, low pigment levels also correlate with sheet-like chitin structures as opposed to rod-like structures. Within each scale, we determine that the lower lamina in all scales has the highest density, and distinct layers within the lower lamina help explain reflected color. We hypothesize that pigments, in addition to absorbing specific wavelengths, can affect cuticle polymerization, density, and refractive index, thereby impacting reflected wavelengths that produce colors.</description>

      <title>Polarization Multi-Image Synthesis with Birefringent Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08106v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical metasurfaces composed of precisely engineered nanostructures have gained significant attention for their ability to manipulate light and implement distinct functionalities based on the properties of the incident field. Computational imaging systems have started harnessing this capability to produce sets of coded measurements that benefit certain tasks when paired with digital post-processing. Inspired by these works, we introduce a new system that uses a birefringent metasurface with a polarizer-mosaicked photosensor to capture four optically-coded measurements in a single exposure. We apply this system to the task of incoherent opto-electronic filtering, where digital spatial-filtering operations are replaced by simpler, per-pixel sums across the four polarization channels, independent of the spatial filter size. In contrast to previous work on incoherent opto-electronic filtering that can realize only one spatial filter, our approach can realize a continuous family of filters from a single capture, with filters being selected from the family by adjusting the post-capture digital summation weights. To find a metasurface that can realize a set of user-specified spatial filters, we introduce a form of gradient descent with a novel regularizer that encourages light efficiency and a high signal-to-noise ratio. We demonstrate several examples in simulation and with fabricated prototypes, including some with spatial filters that have prescribed variations with respect to depth and wavelength.

      <title>Eikonal phase retrieval: Unleashing the fourth generation sources potential for enhanced propagation based tomography on biological samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The evolution of synchrotrons towards higher brilliance beams has increased the possible sample-to-detector propagation distances for which the source confusion circle does not lead to geometrical blurring. This makes it possible to push near-field propagation driven phase contrast enhancement to the limit, revealing low contrast features which would otherwise remain hidden under an excessive noise. Until today this possibility was hindered, in many objects of scientific interest, by the simultaneous presence of strong phase gradient regions and low contrast features. The strong gradients, when enhanced with the now possible long propagation distances, induce such strong phase effects that the linearisation assumptions of current state-of-the-art single-distance phase retrieval filters are broken, and the resulting image quality is jeopardized. Here, we introduce a new iterative phase-retrieval algorithm and compare it with the Paganin phase-retrieval algorithm, in both the monochromatic and polychromatic cases, obtaining superior image quality. In the polychromatic case the comparison was done with an extrapolated Paganin algorithm obtained by reintroducing, into our phase retrieval algorithm, the linearization approximations underlying the Paganin forward model. Our work provides an innovative algorithm which efficiently performs the phase retrieval task over the entire near-field range, producing images of exceptional quality for mixed attenuation objects.</description>
