      <title>Fast Iterative Configuration of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in mmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are a promising solution to improve the coverage of cellular networks, thanks to their ability to steer impinging signals in desired directions. However, they introduce an overhead in the communication process since the optimal configuration of a RIS depends on the channels to and from the RIS, which must be estimated. In this paper, we propose a novel fast iterative configuration (FIC) protocol to determine the optimal RIS configuration that exploits the small number of paths of millimetre-wave (mmWave) channels and an adaptive choice of the explored RIS configurations. In particular, we split the elements of the RIS into a number of subsets equal to the number of channel taps. For each subset, then an iterative procedure finds at each iteration the optimal RIS configuration in a codebook exploring a two-dimensional grid of possible angles of arrival and departure of the path at the RIS. Over the iterations, the grid is made finer around the point identified in previous iterations. Numerical results obtained using an urban channel model confirm that the proposed solution is fast and provides a configuration close to the optimal in a shorter time than other existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Intelligent fault diagnosis of worm gearbox based on adaptive CNN using amended gorilla troop optimization with quantum gate mutation strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The worm gearbox is a high-speed transmission system that plays a vital role in various industries. Therefore it becomes necessary to develop a robust fault diagnosis scheme for worm gearbox. Due to advancements in sensor technology, researchers from academia and industries prefer deep learning models for fault diagnosis purposes. The optimal selection of hyperparameters (HPs) of deep learning models plays a significant role in stable performance. Existing methods mainly focused on manual tunning of these parameters, which is a troublesome process and sometimes leads to inaccurate results. Thus, exploring more sophisticated methods to optimize the HPs automatically is important. In this work, a novel optimization, i.e. amended gorilla troop optimization (AGTO), has been proposed to make the convolutional neural network (CNN) adaptive for extracting the features to identify the worm gearbox defects. Initially, the vibration and acoustic signals are converted into 2D images by the Morlet wavelet function. Then, the initial model of CNN is developed by setting hyperparameters. Further, the search space of each Hp is identified and optimized by the developed AGTO algorithm. The classification accuracy has been evaluated by AGTO-CNN, which is further validated by the confusion matrix. The performance of the developed model has also been compared with other models. The AGTO algorithm is examined on twenty-three classical benchmark functions and the Wilcoxon test which demonstrates the effectiveness and dominance of the developed optimization algorithm. The results obtained suggested that the AGTO-CNN has the highest diagnostic accuracy and is stable and robust while diagnosing the worm gearbox.</description>

      <title>Multimodal wearable EEG, EMG and accelerometry measurements improve the accuracy of tonic-clonic seizure detection in-hospital</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Most current wearable tonic-clonic seizure (TCS) detection systems are based on extra-cerebral signals, such as electromyography (EMG) or accelerometry (ACC). Although many of these devices show good sensitivity in seizure detection, their false positive rates (FPR) are still relatively high. Wearable EEG may improve performance; however, studies investigating this remain scarce. This paper aims 1) to investigate the possibility of detecting TCSs with a behind-the-ear, two-channel wearable EEG, and 2) to evaluate the added value of wearable EEG to other non-EEG modalities in multimodal TCS detection. Method: We included 27 participants with a total of 44 TCSs from the European multicenter study SeizeIT2. The multimodal wearable detection system Sensor Dot (Byteflies) was used to measure two-channel, behind-the-ear EEG, EMG, electrocardiography (ECG), ACC and gyroscope (GYR). First, we evaluated automatic unimodal detection of TCSs, using performance metrics such as sensitivity, precision, FPR and F1-score. Secondly, we fused the different modalities and again assessed performance. Algorithm-labeled segments were then provided to a neurologist and a wearable data expert, who reviewed and annotated the true positive TCSs, and discarded false positives (FPs). Results: Wearable EEG outperformed the other modalities in unimodal TCS detection by achieving a sensitivity of 100.0% and a FPR of 10.3/24h (compared to 97.7% sensitivity and 30.9/24h FPR for EMG; 95.5% sensitivity and 13.9 FPR for ACC). The combination of wearable EEG and EMG achieved overall the most clinically useful performance in offline TCS detection with a sensitivity of 97.7%, a FPR of 0.4/24 h, a precision of 43.0%, and a F1-score of 59.7%. Subsequent visual review of the automated detections resulted in maximal sensitivity and zero FPs.</description>

      <title>Modeling RIS from Electromagnetic Principles to Communication Systems--Part II: System-Level Simulation, Ray Tracing, and Measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically study the electromagnetic (EM) and communication aspects of an RIS through EM simulations, system-level and ray-tracing simulations, and finally measurements. We simulate a nearly perfect, lossless RIS, and a realistic lossy anomalous reflector (AR) in different ray tracers and analyze the large-scale fading of simple RIS-assisted links. We also compare the results with continuous and quantized unit cell reflection phases with one to four-bit resolutions. Finally, we perform over-the-air communication link measurements in an indoor setting with a manufactured sample of a wide-angle AR. The EM, system-level, and ray-tracing simulation results show good agreement with the measurement results. It is proved that the introduced macroscopic model of RIS from the EM aspects is consistent with our proposed communication models, both for an ideal RIS and a realistic AR.</description>

      <title>Superposed IM-OFDM (S-IM-OFDM): An Enhanced OFDM for Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is a critical enabler for emerging 6G applications, and at its core lies in the dual-functional waveform design. While orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been a popular basic waveform, its primitive version falls short in sensing due to the inherent unregulated auto-correlation properties. Furthermore, the sensitivity to Doppler shift hinders its broader applications in dynamic scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a superposed index-modulated OFDM (S-IM-OFDM). The proposed scheme improves the sensing performance without excess power consumption by translating the energy efficiency of IM-OFDM onto sensing-oriented signals over OFDM. Also, it maintains excellent communication performance in time-varying channels by leveraging the sensed parameters to compensate for Doppler. Compared to conventional OFDM, the proposed S-IM-OFDM waveform exhibits better sensing capabilities and wider applicability in dynamic scenarios. Both theoretical analyses and simulations corroborate its dual benefits.</description>

      <title>The performance of microwave photonic signal processors based on microcombs with different input signal waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microwave photonic (MWP) signal processors, which process microwave signals based on pho-tonic technologies, bring advantages intrinsic to photonics such as low loss, large processing bandwidth, and strong immunity to electromagnetic interference. Optical microcombs can offer a large number of wavelength channels and compact device footprints, which make them powerful multi-wavelength sources for MWP signal processors to realize a variety of processing functions. In this paper, we experimentally demonstrate the capability of microcomb-based MWP signal processors to handle diverse input signal waveforms. In addition, we quantify the processing accuracy for different input signal waveforms, including Gaussian, triangle, parabolic, super Gaussian, and nearly square waveforms. Finally, we analyze the factors contributing to the dif-ference in the processing accuracy among the different input waveforms, and our theoretical analysis well elucidates the experimental results. These results provide a guidance for micro-comb-based MWP signal processors when processing microwave signals of various waveforms.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Optimization for Data Collection in UAV-assisted Agricultural IoT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ground fixed base stations (BSs) are often deployed inflexibly, and have high overheads, as well as are susceptible to the damage from natural disasters, making it impractical for them to continuously collect data from sensor devices. To improve the network coverage and performance of wireless communication, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been introduced in diverse wireless networks, therefore in this work we consider employing a UAV as an aerial BS to acquire data of agricultural Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To this end, we first formulate a UAV-assisted data collection multi-objective optimization problem (UDCMOP) to efficiently collect the data from agricultural sensing devices. Specifically, we aim to collaboratively optimize the hovering positions of UAV, visit sequence of UAV, speed of UAV, in addition to the transmit power of devices, to simultaneously achieve the maximization of minimum transmit rate of devices, the minimization of total energy consumption of devices, and the minimization of total energy consumption of UAV. Second, the proposed UDCMOP is a non-convex mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem, which indicates that it includes continuous and discrete solutions, making it intractable to be solved. Therefore, we solve it by proposing an improved multi-objective artificial hummingbird algorithm (IMOAHA) with several specific improvement factors, that are the hybrid initialization operator, Cauchy mutation foraging operator, in addition to the discrete mutation operator. Finally, simulations are carried out to testify that the proposed IMOAHA can effectively improve the system performance comparing to other benchmarks.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents the examination of the 5G cellular network aware of Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) and supported by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles working as mobile access nodes. The investigations have been focused on the energy side of the Radio Access Network (RAN) placed within the area of the city of Poznan (Poland). The gain related to enabling RES generators, i.e., photovoltaic (PV) panels, for base stations (BSs) was presented in the form of two factors -- the average number of UAV replacements (ANUR) with a fully charged one to ensure continuous access to mobile services for currently served user equipment (UE) terminals, and the average reduction in energy consumption (AREC) within the whole network.</description>

Abstract: Industrial production processes, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, are complex systems that require continuous monitoring to ensure efficiency, product quality, and safety. This paper presents a hybrid unsupervised learning strategy (HULS) for monitoring complex industrial processes. Addressing the limitations of traditional Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs), especially in scenarios with unbalanced data sets and highly correlated process variables, HULS combines existing unsupervised learning techniques to address these challenges. To evaluate the performance of the HULS concept, comparative experiments are performed based on a laboratory batch</description>

      <title>Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of deep learning models across diverse tasks, their complexity poses challenges for interpretation. This challenge is particularly evident for audio signals, where conveying interpretations becomes inherently difficult. To address this issue, we introduce Listenable Maps for Audio Classifiers (L-MAC), a posthoc interpretation method that generates faithful and listenable interpretations. L-MAC utilizes a decoder on top of a pretrained classifier to generate binary masks that highlight relevant portions of the input audio. We train the decoder with a special loss that maximizes the confidence of the classifier decision on the masked-in portion of the audio while minimizing the probability of model output for the masked-out portion. Quantitative evaluations on both in-domain and out-of-domain data demonstrate that L-MAC consistently produces more faithful interpretations than several gradient and masking-based methodologies. Furthermore, a user study confirms that, on average, users prefer the interpretations generated by the proposed technique.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Impact of Partial Sharing on the Resilience of Online Federated Learning Against Model Poisoning Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We scrutinize the resilience of the partial-sharing online federated learning (PSO-Fed) algorithm against model-poisoning attacks. PSO-Fed reduces the communication load by enabling clients to exchange only a fraction of their model estimates with the server at each update round. Partial sharing of model estimates also enhances the robustness of the algorithm against model-poisoning attacks. To gain better insights into this phenomenon, we analyze the performance of the PSO-Fed algorithm in the presence of Byzantine clients, malicious actors who may subtly tamper with their local models by adding noise before sharing them with the server. Through our analysis, we demonstrate that PSO-Fed maintains convergence in both mean and mean-square senses, even under the strain of model-poisoning attacks. We further derive the theoretical mean square error (MSE) of PSO-Fed, linking it to various parameters such as stepsize, attack probability, number of Byzantine clients, client participation rate, partial-sharing ratio, and noise variance. We also show that there is a non-trivial optimal stepsize for PSO-Fed when faced with model-poisoning attacks. The results of our extensive numerical experiments affirm our theoretical assertions and highlight the superior ability of PSO-Fed to counteract Byzantine attacks, outperforming other related leading algorithms.</description>

      <title>Massive MIMO CSI Feedback using Channel Prediction: How to Avoid Machine Learning at UE?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the literature, machine learning (ML) has been implemented at the base station (BS) and user equipment (UE) to improve the precision of downlink channel state information (CSI). However, ML implementation at the UE can be infeasible for various reasons, such as UE power consumption. Motivated by this issue, we propose a CSI learning mechanism at BS, called CSILaBS, to avoid ML at UE. To this end, by exploiting channel predictor (CP) at BS, a light-weight predictor function (PF) is considered for feedback evaluation at the UE. CSILaBS reduces over-the-air feedback overhead, improves CSI quality, and lowers the computation cost of UE. Besides, in a multiuser environment, we propose various mechanisms to select the feedback by exploiting PF while aiming to improve CSI accuracy. We also address various ML-based CPs, such as NeuralProphet (NP), an ML-inspired statistical algorithm. Furthermore, inspired to use a statistical model and ML together, we propose a novel hybrid framework composed of a recurrent neural network and NP, which yields better prediction accuracy than individual models. The performance of CSILaBS is evaluated through an empirical dataset recorded at Nokia Bell-Labs. The outcomes show that ML elimination at UE can retain performance gains, for example, precoding quality.</description>

      <title>An Extended Kuramoto Model for Frequency and Phase Synchronization in Delay-Free Networks with Finite Number of Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to its description of a synchronization between oscillators, the Kuramoto model is an ideal choice for a synchronisation algorithm in networked systems. This requires to achieve not only a frequency synchronization but also a phase synchronization - something the standard Kuramoto model can not provide for a finite number of agents. In this case, a remaining phase difference is necessary to offset differences of the natural frequencies. Setting the Kuramoto model into the context of dynamic consensus and making use of the $n$th order discrete average consensus algorithm, this paper extends the standard Kuramoto model in such a way that frequency and phase synchronization are separated. This in turn leads to an algorithm achieve the required frequency and phase synchronization also for a finite number of agents. Simulations show the viability of this extended Kuramoto model.</description>

Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) converts the human voice into readily understandable and categorized text or words. Although Bengali is one of the most widely spoken languages in the world, there have been very few studies on Bengali ASR, particularly on Bangladeshi-accented Bengali. In this study, audio recordings of spoken digits (0-9) from university students were used to create a Bengali speech digits dataset that may be employed to train artificial neural networks for voice-based digital input systems. This paper also compares the Bengali digit recognition accuracy of several Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using spectrograms and shows that a test accuracy of 98.23% is achievable using parameter-efficient models such as SqueezeNet on our dataset.</description>

We exploit an additional design degree of freedom provided by MA to enhance the desired signal and suppress interference so as to reduce the total transmit power of interference network. To this end, we jointly optimize the MA positions and transmit beamforming, subject to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraints of users. To address the non-convex optimization problem, we propose an efficient iterative algorithm to alternately optimize the MA positions via successive convex approximation method and the transmit beamforming via second-order cone program approach. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MA-enabled MISO interference network outperforms its conventional counterpart without MA, which significantly enhances the capability of inter-cell frequency reuse and reduces the complexity of transmitter design.</description>

      <title>Densify &amp; Conquer: Densified, smaller base-stations can conquer the increasing carbon footprint problem in nextG wireless</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connectivity on-the-go has been one of the most impressive technological achievements in the 2010s decade. However, multiple studies show that this has come at an expense of increased carbon footprint, that also rivals the entire aviation sector's carbon footprint. The two major contributors of this increased footprint are (a) smartphone batteries which affect the embodied footprint and (b) base-stations that occupy ever-increasing energy footprint to provide the last mile wireless connectivity to smartphones. The root-cause of both these turn out to be the same, which is communicating over the last-mile lossy wireless medium. We show in this paper, titled DensQuer, how base-station densification, which is to replace a single larger base-station with multiple smaller ones, reduces the effect of the last-mile wireless, and in effect conquers both these adverse sources of increased carbon footprint. Backed by a open-source ray-tracing computation framework (Sionna), we show how a strategic densification strategy can minimize the number of required smaller base-stations to practically achievable numbers, which lead to about 3x power-savings in the base-station network. Also, DensQuer is able to also reduce the required deployment height of base-stations to as low as 15m, that makes the smaller cells easily deployable on trees/street poles instead of requiring a dedicated tower. Further, by utilizing newly introduced hardware power rails in Google Pixel 7a and above phones, we also show that this strategic densified network leads to reduction in mobile transmit power by 10-15 dB, leading to about 3x reduction in total cellular power consumption, and about 50% increase in smartphone battery life when it communicates data via the cellular network.</description>

      <title>MIMO Channel as a Neural Function: Implicit Neural Representations for Extreme CSI Compression in Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acquiring and utilizing accurate channel state information (CSI) can significantly improve transmission performance, thereby holding a crucial role in realizing the potential advantages of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology. Current prevailing CSI feedback approaches improve precision by employing advanced deep-learning methods to learn representative CSI features for a subsequent compression process. Diverging from previous works, we treat the CSI compression problem in the context of implicit neural representations. Specifically, each CSI matrix is viewed as a neural function that maps the CSI coordinates (antenna number and subchannel) to the corresponding channel gains. Instead of transmitting the parameters of the implicit neural functions directly, we transmit modulations based on the CSI matrix derived through a meta-learning algorithm. Modulations are then applied to a shared base network to generate the elements of the CSI matrix. Modulations corresponding to the CSI matrix are quantized and entropy-coded to further reduce the communication bandwidth, thus achieving extreme CSI compression ratios. Numerical results show that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and showcases flexibility in feedback strategies.</description>

      <title>SDOA-Net: An Efficient Deep Learning-Based DOA Estimation Network for Imperfect Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The estimation of direction of arrival (DOA) is a crucial issue in conventional radar, wireless communication, and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, low-cost systems often suffer from imperfect factors, such as antenna position perturbations, mutual coupling effect, inconsistent gains/phases, and non-linear amplifier effect, which can significantly degrade the performance of DOA estimation. This paper proposes a DOA estimation method named super-resolution DOA network (SDOA-Net) based on deep learning (DL) to characterize the realistic array more accurately. Unlike existing DL-based DOA methods, SDOA-Net uses sampled received signals instead of covariance matrices as input to extract data features. Furthermore, SDOA-Net produces a vector that is independent of the DOA of the targets but can be used to estimate their spatial spectrum. Consequently, the same training network can be applied to any number of targets, reducing the complexity of implementation. The proposed SDOA-Net with a low-dimension network structure also converges faster than existing DL-based methods. The simulation results demonstrate that SDOA-Net outperforms existing DOA estimation methods for imperfect arrays. The SDOA-Net code is available online at https://github.com/chenpengseu/SDOA-Net.git.</description>

      <title>A New Heterogeneous Hybrid Massive MIMO Receiver with An Intrinsic Ability of Removing Phase Ambiguity of DOA Estimation via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08100v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna arrays eventuate a huge amount of circuit costs and computational complexity. To satisfy the needs of high precision and low cost in future green wireless communication, the conventional Hybrid analog and digital MIMO receive structure emerges a natural choice. But it exists an issue of the phase ambiguity in direction of arrival (DOA) estimation and requires at least two time-slots to complete one-time DOA measurement with the first time-slot generating the set of candidate solutions and the remaining ones to find a true direction by received beamforming over this set. This will lead to a low time-efficiency. To address this problem, a new heterogeneous sub-connected hybrid analog and digital (HAD) MIMO structure is proposed with an intrinsic ability of removing phase ambiguity and a corresponding new framework is developed to implement a rapid high-precision DOA estimation using only single time-slot. This framework consists of two steps: 1) form a set of candidate solutions using existing methods like MUSIC) find the class of the true solutions and compute the class mean. To infer the set of true solutions, we propose two new clustering methods: weight global minimum distance (WGMD) and weight local minimum distance (WLMD). And, we also enhance two classic clustering methods: accelerating local weighted k-means (ALW-K-means) and improved density. Additionally, the corresponding closed-form expression of Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived. Simulation results show that the proposed frameworks using the above four clustering can approach the CRLB at almost all SNR regions except for extremely low SNR. Four clustering methods have an accuracy decreasing order as follows: WGMD, improved DBSCAN, ALW-K-means and WLMD.</description>

      <title>Cross-Domain Dual-Functional OFDM Waveform Design for Accurate Sensing/Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been widely recognized as the representative waveform for 5G wireless networks, which can directly support sensing/positioning with existing infrastructure. To guarantee superior sensing/positioning accuracy while supporting high-speed communications simultaneously, the dual functions tend to be assigned with different resource elements (REs) due to their diverse design requirements. This motivates optimization of resource allocation/waveform design across time, frequency, power and delay-Doppler domains. Therefore, this article proposes two cross-domain waveform optimization strategies for effective convergence of OFDM-based communications and sensing/positioning, following communication- and sensing-centric criteria, respectively. For the communication-centric design, to maximize the achievable data rate, a fraction of REs are optimally allocated for communications according to prior knowledge of the communication channel. The remaining REs are then employed for sensing/positioning, where the sidelobe level and peak-to-average power ratio are suppressed by optimizing its power-frequency and phase-frequency characteristics for sensing performance improvement. For the sensing-centric design, a `locally' perfect auto-correlation property is ensured for accurate sensing and positioning by adjusting the unit cells of the ambiguity function within its region of interest (RoI). Afterwards, the irrelevant cells beyond RoI, which can readily determine the sensing power allocation, are optimized with the communication power allocation to enhance the achievable data rate. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed waveform designs.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Analog Beamforming for RF-WET with Charging Time Constraint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) sustainability may hinge on radio frequency wireless energy transfer (RF-WET). However, energy-efficient charging strategies are still needed, motivating our work. Specifically, this letter proposes a time division scheme to efficiently charge low-power devices in an IoT network. For this, a multi-antenna power beacon (PB) drives the devices' energy harvesting circuit to the highest power conversion efficiency point via energy beamforming, thus achieving minimum energy consumption. Herein, we adopt the analog multi-antenna architecture due to its low complexity, cost, and energy consumption. The proposal includes a simple yet accurate model for the transfer characteristic of the energy harvesting circuit, enabling the optimization framework. The results evince the effectiveness of our RF-WET strategy over a benchmark scheme where the PB charges all the IoT devices simultaneously. Furthermore, the performance increases with the number of PB antennas.</description>

      <title>Iterative Regularization with k-support Norm: An Important Complement to Sparse Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05394v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sparse recovery is ubiquitous in machine learning and signal processing. Due to the NP-hard nature of sparse recovery, existing methods are known to suffer either from restrictive (or even unknown) applicability conditions, or high computational cost. Recently, iterative regularization methods have emerged as a promising fast approach because they can achieve sparse recovery in one pass through early stopping, rather than the tedious grid-search used in the traditional methods. However, most of those iterative methods are based on the $\ell_1$ norm which requires restrictive applicability conditions and could fail in many cases. Therefore, achieving sparse recovery with iterative regularization methods under a wider range of conditions has yet to be further explored. To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative regularization algorithm, IRKSN, based on the $k$-support norm regularizer rather than the $\ell_1$ norm. We provide conditions for sparse recovery with IRKSN, and compare them with traditional conditions for recovery with $\ell_1$ norm regularizers. Additionally, we give an early stopping bound on the model error of IRKSN with explicit constants, achieving the standard linear rate for sparse recovery. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of our algorithm on several experiments, including a support recovery experiment with a correlated design matrix.</description>

      <title>Simple But Effective: Rethinking the Ability of Deep Learning in fNIRS to Exclude Abnormal Input</title>

Abstract: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a non-invasive technique for monitoring brain activity. To better understand the brain, researchers often use deep learning to address the classification challenges of fNIRS data. Our study shows that while current networks in fNIRS are highly accurate for predictions within their training distribution, they falter at identifying and excluding abnormal data which is out-of-distribution, affecting their reliability. We propose integrating metric learning and supervised methods into fNIRS research to improve networks capability in identifying and excluding out-of-distribution outliers. This method is simple yet effective. In our experiments, it significantly enhances the performance of various networks in fNIRS, particularly transformer-based one, which shows the great improvement in reliability. We will make our experiment data available on GitHub.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with state estimation of stochastic models with linear state dynamics, continuous or discrete in time. The emphasis is laid on a numerical solution to the state prediction by the time-update step of the grid-point-based point-mass filter (PMF), which is the most computationally demanding part of the PMF algorithm. A novel efficient PMF (ePMF) estimator, unifying continuous and discrete, approaches is proposed, designed, and discussed. By numerical illustrations, it is shown, that the proposed ePMF can lead to a time complexity reduction that exceeds 99.9% without compromising accuracy. The MATLAB code of the ePMF is released with this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11872v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prior works on near-field beam training have mostly assumed dedicated polar-domain codebook and on-grid range estimation, which, however, may suffer long training overhead and degraded estimation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose in this paper new and efficient beam training schemes with off-grid range estimation by using conventional discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook. Specifically, we first analyze the received beam pattern at the user when far-field beamforming vectors are used for beam scanning, and show an interesting result that this beam pattern contains useful user angle and range information. Then, we propose two efficient schemes to jointly estimate the user angle and range with the DFT codebook. The first scheme estimates the user angle based on a defined angular support and resolves the user range by leveraging an approximated angular support width, while the second scheme estimates the user range by minimizing a power ratio mean square error (MSE) to improve the range estimation accuracy. Finally, numerical simulations show that our proposed schemes greatly reduce the near-field beam training overhead and improve the range estimation accuracy as compared to various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a valuable non-invasive tool for monitoring brain activity. The classification of fNIRS data in relation to conscious activity holds significance for advancing our understanding of the brain and facilitating the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCI). Many researchers have turned to deep learning to tackle the classification challenges inherent in fNIRS data due to its strong generalization and robustness. In the application of fNIRS, reliability is really important, and one mathematical formulation of the reliability of confidence is calibration. However, many researchers overlook the important issue of calibration. To address this gap, we propose integrating calibration into fNIRS field and assess the reliability of existing models. Surprisingly, our results indicate poor calibration performance in many proposed models. To advance calibration development in the fNIRS field, we summarize three practical tips. Through this letter, we hope to emphasize the critical role of calibration in fNIRS research and argue for enhancing the reliability of deep learning-based predictions in fNIRS classification tasks. All data from our experimental process are openly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>MusicHiFi: Fast High-Fidelity Stereo Vocoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based audio and music generation models commonly generate music by constructing an image representation of audio (e.g., a mel-spectrogram) and then converting it to audio using a phase reconstruction model or vocoder. Typical vocoders, however, produce monophonic audio at lower resolutions (e.g., 16-24 kHz), which limits their effectiveness. We propose MusicHiFi -- an efficient high-fidelity stereophonic vocoder. Our method employs a cascade of three generative adversarial networks (GANs) that convert low-resolution mel-spectrograms to audio, upsamples to high-resolution audio via bandwidth expansion, and upmixes to stereophonic audio. Compared to previous work, we propose 1) a unified GAN-based generator and discriminator architecture and training procedure for each stage of our cascade, 2) a new fast, near downsampling-compatible bandwidth extension module, and 3) a new fast downmix-compatible mono-to-stereo upmixer that ensures the preservation of monophonic content in the output. We evaluate our approach using both objective and subjective listening tests and find our approach yields comparable or better audio quality, better spatialization control, and significantly faster inference speed compared to past work.
