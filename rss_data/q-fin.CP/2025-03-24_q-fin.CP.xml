      <title>Equilibrium with non-convex preferences: some insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence of equilibrium when agents' preferences may not beconvex. For some specific utility functions, we provide a necessary and sufficientcondition under which there exists an equilibrium. The standard approach cannot be directly applied to our examples because the demand correspondence of some agents is neither single-valued nor convex-valued.</description>

      <title>Data-driven measures of high-frequency trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-frequency trading (HFT) accounts for almost half of equity trading volume, yet it is not identified in public data. We develop novel data-driven measures of HFT activity that separate strategies that supply and demand liquidity. We train machine learning models to predict HFT activity observed in a proprietary dataset using concurrent public intraday data. Once trained on the dataset, these models generate HFT measures for the entire U.S. stock universe from 2010 to 2023. Our measures outperform conventional proxies, which struggle to capture HFT's time dynamics. We further validate them using shocks to HFT activity, including latency arbitrage, exchange speed bumps, and data feed upgrades. Finally, our measures reveal how HFT affects fundamental information acquisition. Liquidity-supplying HFTs improve price discovery around earnings announcements while liquidity-demanding strategies impede it.</description>

      <title>Unified continuous-time q-learning for mean-field game and mean-field control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the continuous-time q-learning in mean-field jump-diffusion models when the population distribution is not directly observable. We propose the integrated q-function in decoupled form (decoupled Iq-function) from the representative agent's perspective and establish its martingale characterization, which provides a unified policy evaluation rule for both mean-field game (MFG) and mean-field control (MFC) problems. Moreover, we consider the learning procedure where the representative agent updates the population distribution based on his own state values. Depending on the task to solve the MFG or MFC problem, we can employ the decoupled Iq-function differently to characterize the mean-field equilibrium policy or the mean-field optimal policy respectively. Based on these theoretical findings, we devise a unified q-learning algorithm for both MFG and MFC problems by utilizing test policies and the averaged martingale orthogonality condition. For several financial applications in the jump-diffusion setting, we obtain the exact parameterization of the decoupled Iq-functions and the value functions, and illustrate our q-learning algorithm with satisfactory performance.</description>

      <title>Label Unbalance in High-frequency Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09988v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In financial trading, return prediction is one of the foundation for a successful trading system. By the fast development of the deep learning in various areas such as graphical processing, natural language, it has also demonstrate significant edge in handling with financial data. While the success of the deep learning relies on huge amount of labeled sample, labeling each time/event as profitable or unprofitable, under the transaction cost, especially in the high-frequency trading world, suffers from serious label imbalance issue.In this paper, we adopts rigurious end-to-end deep learning framework with comprehensive label imbalance adjustment methods and succeed in predicting in high-frequency return in the Chinese future market. The code for our method is publicly available at https://github.com/RS2002/Label-Unbalance-in-High-Frequency-Trading .</description>
