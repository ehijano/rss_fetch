      <title>The equivalence between two real Seiberg-Witten homologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for a real rational homology sphere $Y$ equipped with a real $\mathrm{spin^c}$ structure $\s$, the real monopole Floer homology defined by Li and the real Seiberg-Witten Floer homology defined by Konno, Miyazawa and Taniguchi are isomorphic. As corollaries, we identify some Fr\o yshov-type invariants and prove two Smith-type inequalities.</description>

      <title>Disintegrating the curve complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a finite sequence of graphs, beginning with the curve graph and ending with a graph quasi-isometric to a tree. There is a Lipschitz map from one graph in the sequence to the next. This sequence was first introduced by Hamenst\"adt. We prove (as conjectured by Hamenst\"adt) that the graphs in this sequence are hyperbolic and that the coarse fibers of the maps in the sequence are quasi-trees. This gives an upper bound on the asymptotic dimension of each graph in the sequence and as a result, an upper bound on the asymptotic dimension of the curve graph. Additionally, we show that the action of the mapping class group on each graph in the sequence is acylindrical, and classify the boundary and actions of individual mapping classes for each graph in the sequence.</description>

      <title>Trisected Rainbows and Braids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New explicit procedures for passing among triplane diagrams, braid movies, and braid charts for knotted surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^4$ are presented. To this end, rainbow diagrams, which lie between braid charts and triplanes, are introduced. Inequalities relating the braid index and the bridge index of 2-knots are obtained via these procedures. Another consequence is a 4-dimensional version of the classical result that ``the minimal number of Seifert circles equals the braid index of a link'' due to Yamada. The procedures are exemplified for the spun trefoil, the 2-twist spun trefoil, and other related examples.
  Of independent interest, an appendix is included that describes a procedure for drawing a triplane diagram for a satellite surface with a 2-sphere companion. Thus, larger families of surfaces for which we know specific triplane diagrams are obtained.</description>

      <title>Singularity of Cannon-Thurston maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a closed fibered hyperbolic 3-manifold M, the inclusion of a fiber S, with S and M lifted to the universal covers gives an exponentially distorted embedding of the hyperbolic plane into hyperbolic 3-space. Nevertheless, Cannon and Thurston showed that there is a map from the circle at infinity of the hyperbolic plane to the 2-sphere at infinity of hyperbolic 3-space. The Cannon-Thurston map is surjective, finite-to-one, and gives a space-filling curve. Here we prove that many natural measures on the circle when pushed forward by the Cannon-Thurston map become singular with respect to many natural measures on the 2-sphere. The circle measures we consider are the Lebesgue measure and stationary measures that arise from fully supported random walks on the surface group. Whereas the measures on the sphere we consider are the Lebesgue measure and stationary measures that arise from geometric random walks on the 3-manifold group. The singularity of measures is ultimately derived from the following geometric result. We prove that a hyperbolic geodesic sampled with respect to a pushforward measure asymptotically spends a definite proportion of its time close to a fiber. On the other hand, we show that a hyperbolic geodesic sampled with respect to a natural measure on the sphere spends an asymptotically negligible proportion of its time close to a fiber. For a more restricted class of measures, namely the Lebesgue measure and stationary measures from geometric random walks on the surface group, we also prove an effective result for the proportion of time spent close to a fiber. To this end, we give precise descriptions if quasi-geodesics in the Cannon-Thurston metric, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A representation of Milnor's triple linking number by chord diagrams and doodle invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From the work of X. S. Lin and Z. Wang, it follows that degree two knot invariant admits a decomposition into the sum of a Gauss diagram count and a term involving Arnold invariants. In this paper we establish an analogous description for Milnor's triple linking number - likewise of degree two - showing that it can be represented in terms of counts of certain chord diagrams together with doodle invariants.</description>

      <title>How large is the braid monodromy of low-genus Lefschetz fibrations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04389v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a genus $g$ smooth Lefschetz fibration $\pi : M \to S^2$ with singular locus $\Delta \subseteq S^2$, we describe the subgroup $\operatorname{Br}(\pi)$ of the spherical braid group $\operatorname{Mod}(S^2,\Delta)$ consisting of braids admitting a lift to a fiber-preserving diffeomorphism of $M$. We develop general methods for showing that the index $[\operatorname{Mod}(S^2,\Delta) : \operatorname{Br}(\pi)]$ is infinite. As an application of our methods, we prove that $[\operatorname{Mod}(S^2,\Delta) : \operatorname{Br}(\pi)] = \infty$ when $g = 1$, when $\pi$ is expressible as a self-fiber sum when $g \geq 2$, or when $\pi$ is a holomorphic genus $g = 2$ Lefschetz fibration whose vanishing cycles are nonseparating. In the genus $g = 1$ case, we relate the subgroup $\operatorname{Br}(\pi)$ to the action of $\operatorname{Mod}(S^2,\Delta)$ on the $\operatorname{SL}_2$-character variety for $S^2 \setminus \Delta$ and provide an alternate proof of the first application via recent work of Lam--Landesman--Litt.</description>

      <title>Classifying links and spatial graphs with finite $N$-quandles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental quandle is a complete invariant for unoriented tame knots \cite{JO, Ma} and non-split links \cite{FR}. The proof involves proving a relationship between the components of the fundamental quandle and the cosets of the peripheral subgroup(s) in the fundamental group of the knot or link. We extend these relationships to spatial graphs, and to $N$-quandles of links and spatial graphs. As an application, we are able to give a complete list of links with finite $N$-quandles, proving a conjecture from \cite{MS}, and a partial list of spatial graphs with finite $N$-quandles.</description>

      <title>On The Cost Function Associated With Legendrian Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a non-negative integer-valued function that measures the obstruction for converting topological isotopy between two Legendrian knots into a Legendrian isotopy. We refer to this function as the Cost function. We show that the Cost function induces a metric on the set of topologically isotopic Legendrian knots. Hence, the set of topologically isotopic Legendrian knots can be seen as a graph with path-metric given by the Cost function. Legendrian simple knot types are shown to be characterized using the Cost function. We also get a quantitative version of Fuchs-Tabachnikov's Theorem that says any two Legendrian knots in $(\mathbb{S}^3,\xi_{std})$ in the same topological knot type become Legendrian isotopic after sufficiently many stabilizations. We compute the Cost function for Legendrian simple knots (for example torus knots) and we note the behavior of Cost function for twist knots and cables of torus knots (some of which are Legendrian non-simple). We also construct examples of Legendrian representatives of 2-bridge knots and compute the Cost between them. Further, we investigate the behavior of the Cost function under the connect sum operation. We conclude with some questions about the Cost function, its relation with the standard contact structure, and the topological knot type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we will associate a family $\{K_1,\dots,K_l\}\subset \mathbb{S}^3$ of iterated torus knots to a given free numerical semigroup. We will describe the fundamental group of the knot complement of each knot of the family. Finally, we will show that all knots in the family have same Alexander polynomial and it coincides (up to a factor) with the Poincar\'e series of the free numerical semigroup. As a consequence, we will provide families of iterated torus knots with the same Alexander polynomial of an irreducible plane curve singularity but which are non-isotopic to its associated knot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Bott and Cattaneo's $\Theta$-invariant of 3-manifolds applied to $\mathbb{Z}\pi$-homology equivalences from 3-manifolds to a fixed spherical 3-manifold. The $\Theta$-invariants are defined by integrals over configuration spaces of two points with local systems and by choosing some invariant tensors. We compute upper bounds of the dimensions of the space spanned by the Bott--Cattaneo $\Theta$-invariants and of that spanned by Garoufalidis and Levine's finite type invariants of type 2. The computation is based on representation theory of finite groups.</description>

      <title>The LMO Spectrum: Factorization Homology and the E_3-Structure of the Jacobi Diagram Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18985v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the LMO spectrum, a categorification of the Le-Murakami-Ohtsuki (LMO) invariant for 3-manifolds, using factorization homology. The theoretical foundation is our main algebraic result (Theorem A): the algebra of Jacobi diagrams, $\AJac$, possesses a homotopy $E_3$-algebra structure. This is a necessary condition for consistency within factorization homology, and the proof relies on the formality of the little 3-disks operad. A universal surgery formula is derived from the excision axiom (Theorem B), providing a computational basis independent of conjectural models. As an application (Theorem C), we construct an ``$H_1$-decorated LMO invariant'' that distinguishes the lens spaces $L(156, 5)$ and $L(156, 29)$, a pair that the classical LMO invariant fails to separate.</description>

Abstract: We construct and study representations of rational and pretzel tangle and knot groups into the affine group $\mathrm{AGL}(1,\mathbb{C})$, via a TQFT that is valued in the category of spans of singular vector bundles over $\mathbb{C}^{\ast}$. For these families, we derive closed-form expressions for their Alexander polynomials and establish bounds on their zeros. Finally, we specialize the functor at $t=-1$ and analyze colorings of rational tangles in terms of spans of complex vector spaces.</description>

      <title>The Chiral Anomaly of the Free Fermion in Functorial Field Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:1909.04212v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When trying to cast the free fermion in the framework of functorial field theory, its chiral anomaly manifests in the fact that it assigns the determinant of the Dirac operator to a top-dimensional closed spin manifold, which is not a number as expected, but an element of a complex line. In functorial field theory language, this means that the theory is twisted, which gives rise to an anomaly theory. In this paper, we give a detailed construction of this anomaly theory, as a functor that sends manifolds to infinite-dimensional Clifford algebras and bordisms to bimodules.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the topological complexity of manifolds with a lower scalar curvature bound. We introduce a small scale index theorem to establish an upper bound for Gromov's simplicial norm of the Poincar\'e dual of the A-hat class for manifolds with spin universal covering. The bound depends on a scalar curvature lower bound, injectivity radius, and volume. This result can be viewed both as a generalization of Lichnerowicz vanishing theorem and as a scalar curvature analogue to Cheeger finiteness theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08478v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey reviews recent advances connecting link homology theories to invariants of smooth 4-manifolds and extended topological quantum field theories. Starting from joint work with Morrison and Walker, I explain how functorial link homologies that satisfy additional invariance conditions become diagram-independent, give rise to braided monoidal 2-categories, extend naturally to links in the 3-sphere, and globalize to skein modules for 4-manifolds. Later developments show that these skein lasagna modules furnish invariants of embedded and immersed surfaces and admit computation via handle decompositions. I then survey structural properties, explicit computations, and applications to exotic phenomena in 4-manifold topology, and place link homology and skein lasagna modules within the framework of extended topological quantum field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13296v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe the structure of simplicial locally convex fans associated to even-dimensional complete toric varieties with signature 0. They belong to the set of such toric varieties whose even degree Betti numbers yield a top gamma vector component equal to 0. The gamma vector is an invariant of palindromic polynomials whose nonnegativity lies between unimodality and real-rootedness. It is known (and expected more generally) that the cases where this top component is 0 are among the "building blocks" of those where it is nonnegative. This means minimality with respect to a certain restricted class of blowups. However, this equality to 0 case is currently poorly understood. In the course of addressing this situation, we find that this interpretation encodes *intrinsic* combinatorial information on the fan in addition to earlier compatibility with existing natural combinatorial examples.
  Our main method uses wall crossings. The links of the fan come from a repeated suspension of the maximal linear subspace in its realization in the ambient space of the fan. Conversely, the centers of these links containing any particular line form a cone or a repeated suspension of one. The intersection patterns between these "anchoring" linear subspaces come from how far certain submodularity inequalities are from equality and parity conditions on their dimensions. This involves linear dependence and containment relations between them which are connected to optimization. We obtain these relations by viewing the vanishing of certain mixed volumes from the perspective of the exponents. Finally, these wall crossings yield a simple method of generating induced 4-cycles covering the minimal objects described above. We intersect rational equivalence relations with 2-dimensional orbit closures instead of 1-dimensional ones as in most combinatorial applications.</description>

      <title>Strong cohomological integrality for symmetric stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a strong form of the cohomological integrality theorem, decomposing the cohomology of smooth symmetric stacks as the cohomological Hall induction of the intersection cohomology of the good moduli spaces of stacks of graded points. This generalizes the previous result by the second author together with Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--P\u{a}durariu to non-orthogonal stacks, and confirms a conjecture of the first author that the algebraic BPS cohomology of the quotient stack of a symmetric representation matches the intersection cohomology group whenever it is nonzero. As a consequence, we obtain a version of the cohomological integrality theorem for general 0-shifted symplectic stacks with good moduli spaces, as well as for the character stacks of general compact oriented $3$-manifolds with reductive gauge groups. As an application, we prove Halpern-Leistner's conjecture on the purity of the Borel--Moore homology of $0$-shifted symplectic stacks admitting proper good moduli spaces.
  Our proof combines a cohomological bound for the algebraic BPS cohomology, due to the first author and based on Efimov's lemma, with a vanishing-cycle argument due to the second author in collaboration with Bu--Davison--Ib\'a\~nez Nu\~nez--P\u{a}durariu. We also give a purely geometric proof of the required cohomological bound.</description>

      <title>Smooth functions which are Morse on preimages of values not being local extrema and constructing natural functions of the class on connected sums of manifolds admitting these functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss smooth functions which are Morse on preimages of values not being local extrema. We call such a function internally Morse or I-Morse.
  The Reeb graph of a smooth function is the space of all connected components of preimages of single points of it topologized with the natural quotient topology of the manifolds and a vertex of it is a point corresponding to a preimage with critical points. A smooth function is neat with respect to the Reeb graph or N-Reeb if the preimages of the vertices are the closed subsets in the manifolds of the domains with interiors being empty.
  We discuss I-Morse and N-Reeb functions, IN-Morse-Reeb functions. Our main result presents an IN-Morse-Reeb function respecting two such functions, on a connected sum of these given manifolds.</description>
