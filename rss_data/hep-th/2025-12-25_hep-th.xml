      <title>Probing Stringy Horizons with Pole-Skipping in Non-Maximal Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study pole-skipping in non-maximally quantum chaotic systems. Using Rindler conformal field theories and the large-$q$ SYK chain as illustrative examples, we argue that the pole-skipping points of few-body operators organize into trajectories in the complex frequency-momentum plane, with the leading trajectory encoding the quantum Lyapunov exponent. We further propose that these trajectories admit a natural interpretation as Regge trajectories of stringy excitations in a dual stringy black hole geometry. From this perspective, pole-skipping for an individual operator can be viewed as tracking the stringy horizon through the response of a single excitation. Our results suggest that pole-skipping reflects intrinsic properties of quantum chaotic systems and may be deeply connected to the structure of horizons in the stringy regime.</description>

      <title>Propagator positivity bounds for cosmological correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using unitarity and causality, we derive an infinite tower of two-sided positivity bounds on the effective field theory coefficients which describe the propagation of heavy fields on de Sitter spacetime. We design this EFT to describe propagators with the in-in boundary conditions that are relevant for cosmological correlators. Our positivity bounds therefore identify EFT correlators that can never emerge from a consistent underlying model of inflation. This implies non-trivial constraints on primordial non-Gaussianity; for instance the cosmological collider oscillations in the squeezed bispectrum from the exchange of a heavy scalar are tied to the shape of its EFT background.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Abelian Currents in 4d CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study four-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs) with an abelian $U(1)$ global symmetry using the conformal bootstrap approach. We obtain numerical bounds on the scaling dimensions of low-lying operators, the stress-tensor central charge, and a particular combination of the 't Hooft anomaly and the current central charge. Our analysis provides the first non-perturbative constraints on four-dimensional CFTs with conserved abelian currents and establishes a framework that can be extended to theories with non-abelian global symmetries.</description>

      <title>A single-cut discontinuity for cosmological correlators from unitarity and analyticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive discontinuity relations, also known as cutting rules, and explore the analytic properties of cosmological correlators, fundamental observables of the primordial universe. Our emphasis is on how these relations arise from unitarity and hermitian analyticity in interacting quantum field theories on de Sitter space-time. Instead of analyzing wave-function coefficients, we apply these relations directly to cosmological correlators. By studying conformally coupled and massless scalar fields with $\phi^n$ self-interactions, we demonstrate that the discontinuity of a cosmological correlator can be expressed as a sum of products of lower-point discontinuities, stemming from a single-cut of one internal line in the corresponding tree-level exchange Witten diagram. Notably, beyond lower-point correlators, the decomposition of the discontinuities of cosmological correlators includes contributions from auxiliary elements that consist of both the real and imaginary parts of the lower-point wave-function coefficients, which have not been reported in the existing literature. Interestingly, depending on whether $n$ is even or odd in a $\phi^n$ interaction, these different lower-point discontinuities contribute as the leading or sub-leading piece in the late-time limit to the discontinuity relations. Additionally, our single-cut discontinuity relation leads to a decomposition rule for the residue of the cosmological correlators at partial energy singularities, incorporating contributions from these auxiliary objects. Through explicit calculations in several models, we confirm that our discontinuity relations are consistent with results from the in-in formalism. While primarily developed using tree-level exchanges with polynomial interactions, we also demonstrate that our framework can be extended to include loop corrections and cases with derivative interactions.</description>

      <title>A remarkably simple covariant graviton propagator in (Anti-)de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present remarkably simple covariant expressions for the graviton and ghost propagators in Anti-de Sitter and de-Sitter spacetimes valid in any spacetime dimension. In gravity there is a $2$-parameter family of covariant gauge-fixing conditions and the simplification occurs for a special choice of these parameters. In this gauge the graviton propagator satisfies $\nabla^\mu\mu\nabla^\nu\mu \, G_{\mu\nu,\alpha'\beta'}(\mu)=0$, where $\mu$ is the geodesic distance between two points, and this condition implies an improved IR behavior. This gauge choice is not possible in flat spacetime.</description>

      <title>Scaling Symmetry and Carrollian Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate matter-coupled scaling-Carroll gravity as a gauge theory and analyze its associated gravity multiplet. After fixing the scaling symmetry, the theory is governed by the trace of the extrinsic curvature, the Carroll boost symmetry, and a vector field descending from dilatations. We show that appropriate gauge choices and geometric constraints lead to distinct regimes, including dynamical Carroll gravity, Aristotelian gravity, and a fracton gauge theory coupled to Aristotelian geometry. In the fracton phase, the Carroll boost parameter plays the role of a vector-charge gauge symmetry.</description>

      <title>Horizons and Soft Quantum Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently shown that black holes decohere any quantum superpositions in their vicinity. This decoherence is mediated by soft radiation through the horizon, and can be understood as the result of the fact that quantum states in the exterior source distinguishable states of long-range fields in the interior. To study this phenomenon and others, we extend Tomita-Takesaki theory to accommodate states of soft radiation such as arise in the electromagnetic and gravitational memory effects, and provide a general framework for computing the distinguishability of general coherent states. Applying these tools, we use the methods of unambiguous state discrimination and approximate quantum error correction to prove some new relations regarding the distinguishability of quantum states, and the quantum information content of soft radiation, and thereby show that a black hole (or any horizon) decoheres its environment as though its interior were full of optimal observers.</description>

      <title>Dyon-like black hole solutions in the model with two Abelian gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dilatonic black hole dyon-like solutions in the gravitational
  $4d$ model with a scalar field, two 2-forms, two dilatonic coupling constants
  $\lambda_i \neq 0$, $i =1,2$, obeying $\lambda_1 \neq - \lambda_2$
  and the sign parameter $\varepsilon = \pm 1$ for scalar field kinetic term
  are overviewed. Here $\varepsilon = - 1$ corresponds to a phantom scalar field.
  The solutions are defined up to solutions of two master equations for two moduli functions, when
  $\lambda^2_i \neq 1/2$ for $\varepsilon = - 1$. Several integrable cases
  corresponding to Lie algebras $A_1 + A_1$, $A_2$, $B_2 = C_2$ and $G_2$ are considered.
  Some physical parameters of the solutions are derived:
  gravitational mass, scalar charge, Hawking temperature, black hole area entropy and
  PPN parameters $\beta$ and $\gamma$. Bounds on the gravitational mass
  and scalar charge (based on a certain conjecture) are presented.</description>

      <title>On-shell representation and further instances of the 2-split behavior of amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The newly discovered splitting behavior of tree-level scattering amplitudes of particles and strings has been expressed in terms of currents containing one off-shell leg. In this work, we explain how to obtain on-shell representations of the split amplitudes in different theories, thereby avoiding any ambiguity involved in the definition of the currents. Furthermore, we show that this 2-split behavior is also verified in gauge and gravity theories involving higher-dimensional operators, thereby providing additional evidence to its universal character. As a byproduct, we also generalize the transmuting operators to amplitudes in higher-derivative theories.</description>

      <title>Topological Classification of a 4D AdS Black Hole with Non-Minimal Maxwell Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a topological classification of the phase structure of a four-dimensional AdS black hole with non-minimal Maxwell coupling. Critical points are treated as topological defects, allowing us to assign a winding number to each black hole branch and compute the global topological invariant W. The system exhibits a duality governed by its Maxwell charge Q: for large Q it falls into the class W = 1, displaying van der Waals-type behavior with a first-order small-large black hole transition. For small Q, it shifts to W = 0, characteristic of a Hawking-Page transition. This topological classification provides a model-independent validation of the conventional thermodynamic analysis. Crucially, we find that the non-minimal coupling lambda stabilizes the Hawking-Page universality class W=0 for black holes with non-zero charge, a phenomenon absent in the standard Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS case. This establishes a direct link between the microscopic coupling and the macroscopic topological class, demonstrating the power of topological methods in decoding thermodynamic universality across modified gravity theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large-charge bootstrap for conformal field theories with a U(1) symmetry extending the analysis of scalar probes to include conserved currents. We formulate the bootstrap equations and analyze their solutions assuming the existence of a non-trivial macroscopic limit and that the spectrum organizes into a finite number of Regge trajectories. We show that current probes lead to additional bootstrap constraints that are absent in the purely scalar case, and we classify the resulting solutions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discretizing the $\lambda \phi^4$ scalar field theory on a lattice yields a system of coupled anharmonic oscillators with quadratic and quartic potentials. We begin by analyzing the two coupled oscillators in the second quantization method to derive several analytic relations to the second-order perturbation, which are then employed to numerically calculate the thermal out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), $C_T(t)$. We find that the function $C_T(t)$ exhibits exponential growth over a long time window in the early stages, with Lyapunov exponent $\lambda\sim T^{1/4}$, which diagnoses quantum chaos. We furthermore investigate the quantum chaos properties in a closed chain of N coupled anharmonic oscillators, which relates to the 1+1 dimensional interacting quantum scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>Black hole as a multipartite entangler: multi-entropy in AdS${}_3$/CFT${}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study multipartite entanglement in typical pure states holographically dual to pure BTZ black holes, using multi-entropy and its ``genuine'' version. In the bulk, these quantities are computed by minimal geodesic networks (so-called Steiner trees). We find that at sufficiently high temperature, the genuine tripartite multi-entropy exhibits a volume-law scaling in sharp contrast to vacuum AdS$_3$, where the genuine contribution is universal and size-independent. Moreover, we find another phase: once one subsystem exceeds half of the total system, the leading genuine tripartite entanglement vanishes and reduces to that for global AdS${}_3$. This transition is indeed consistent with recent arguments for distillable EPR pairs in tripartite Haar-random states. Motivated by finite-cutoff holography, we further study the radial cutoff dependence of multi-entropy and show that genuine multi-entropy acquires nontrivial size dependence even for the tripartite case in AdS${}_3$. As a byproduct, we also observe an intriguing ``area-law'' contribution to multi-entropy that is relevant to vacuum AdS${}_3$.</description>

      <title>Three-Family Supersymmetric Pati-Salam Flux Models from Rigid D-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intersecting D-brane model building often suffer from the unstabilized open-string moduli, leading to the unwanted massless adjoint scalars. In our previous work arXiv:2505.03664, this issue was resolved by employing the rigid D6-branes on the $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^\prime)$ orientifold with discrete torsion, where fractional cycles eliminate all adjoint scalars. In this paper, we construct new three-family flux models in the Type IIB setup on $\mathbb{T}^6/(\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2)$, T-dual to the Type IIA rigid D6-brane construction with discrete torsion, by introducing the quantized background $G_3$ flux that stabilizes the closed-string complex structure moduli and axio-dilaton. The resulting Pati-Salam gauge symmetry can be spontaneously broken down to the Standard Model via a supersymmetry-preserving Higgs mechanism. All the consistency conditions, including $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry, RR tadpole cancellation, and K-theory constraints, are satisfied. We present the complete particle spectra for these models and discuss how exotic states dynamically decouple through strong dynamics in the hidden sector.</description>

      <title>Twisted Feynman Integrals: from generating functions to spin-resummed post-Minkowskian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to call a class of deformed Feynman integrals as twisted Feynman integrals, where the integrand has an additional exponential factor linear in loop momenta. Such integrals appear in various contexts: tensor reduction of Feynman integrals, Fourier transform of Feynman integrals, and spin-resummed dynamics in post-Minkowskian gravity. First, we construct a mathematical framework that manifests the geometric interpretation of twisted Feynman integrals. Next, we generalise the standard mathematical tools for studying Feynman integrals for application to their twisted cousins, and explore their mathematical properties. In particular, it is found that (i) twisted Feynman integrals fall under the class of exponential periods, and (ii) the leading singularity approach using the (generalised) Baikov parametrisation applied to twisted Feynman integrals fail to detect the geometry underlying their function space.</description>

Abstract: We construct a gravitational open extension of the effective field theory of inflation in the Schwinger-Keldysh framework. While physical symmetries allow many open operators in the Schwinger-Keldysh action, most of them overconstrain the equations of motion, yielding inconsistent dynamics. We identify the minimal open operators compatible with propagating scalar and tensor modes and build the gravitational action, recovering dissipative models of inflation.</description>

Here we extend this result to massless matter which is both more subtle and surprising. We derive the charge associated to divergent superphaserotations and show that it exactly vanishes to all orders in the electromagnetic coupling. This is in agreement with the vanishing of the classical logarithmic soft photon theorem which is one-loop exact. Special care is required for massless matter due to potential collinear divergences which, as we show, do however not affect the superphaserotation charge. We furthermore compute the infrared corrections to the charge associated to the subleading tree-level soft photon theorem. As a corollary of our result, we find that the tail to the velocity kick memory due to the long-range interactions between soft electromagnetic radiation and massless matter vanishes.</description>

      <title>Deforming and dissecting AdS$_3$ with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study deformations of the model by Henneaux, Mart\'inez, Troncoso and Zanelli [arXiv:hep-th/0201170] which features asymptotically AdS$_3$ black hole solutions that incorporate the exact backreaction of a scalar field. The presence of bulk matter causes the $T \overline T$ deformation of the (putative) dual CFT$_2$ to differ from the deformation defined in the bulk by imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions at finite radius. We work out both of these deformations explicitly and verify that $T \overline T$-deforming the boundary theory corresponds to imposing mixed boundary conditions on the metric at the conformal boundary, whereas the bulk "Dirichlet deformation" gives rise to a field theory deforming operator that includes $T \overline T$ as well as other irrelevant terms. We check our results by calculating the deformed energy spectrum for either case using both the bulk and boundary prescriptions, finding agreement after taking into account additional terms coming from the flow of the scalar source. We interpret our explicit results and compare them with the predictions of similar proposals in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the crossing symmetry of the ensemble of large-$c$ 2D CFTs defined through 3D gravity. A central observation is that statistical moments of OPE coefficients are not independent; rather, lower and higher moments are strongly correlated. Using Virasoro TQFT, we clarify how these correlations arise and how they guarantee consistency across OPE channels. Our analysis introduces the new notion of pseudo-hyperbolic manifolds, which are a certain class of non-hyperbolic manifolds whose partition functions are nevertheless related to those of hyperbolic ones. These manifolds serve as bridges that help manifest the crossing symmetry of the CFT ensemble.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between T-duality and (2+1)- dimensional electrodynamics, revealing a relationship between short and large length scales of the gauge potential. Our findings demonstrate that the electrostatic potential energy between static charges is no longer divergent at short distances in the presence of T-duality effects. It remains logarithmic at large distances, suggesting the possibility of a regulatory role for the T-duality scale \( l_0 \) in the space where the radial coordinate goes into its inverse. We also discuss the potential of T-duality to elucidate fractalization effects in physical systems, paving the way for future research on the implications for superconductors and condensed matter systems in general.</description>

      <title>Aspects of holographic timelike entanglement entropy in black hole backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the holographic construction of timelike entanglement entropy (tEE) in black hole backgrounds in Lorentzian geometries. The holographic tEE is realized through extremal surfaces consisting of spacelike and timelike branches that encode its real and imaginary components, respectively. In the BTZ black hole, these surfaces extend into the interior of the black hole and reproduce the field-theoretic results. The analysis is further generalized to higher-dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black holes, where the characteristics of tEE are obtained with increasing size of the boundary subsystem. Besides, we also show that the boundary subsystem length diverges at a dimension-dependent critical turning point. Notably, this critical point moves closer to the black hole horizon as the dimensionality of the bulk increases. For large subsystem lengths, the finite part of the tEE displays a characteristic volume-plus-area structure, with a real volume term and a complex coefficient of the area term approaching constant values at large dimensions. Besides, we also study the monotonicity of a new quantity, timelike entanglement density, which offers insights into a timelike area theorem in specific limits. Subsequently, we investigate the near-horizon dynamics in various black hole backgrounds, where the spacelike and timelike surfaces exhibit exponential growth of the form $e^{\frac{2\pi}{\beta} \Delta t}$ with inverse black hole temperature $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Breakthrough on dynamical higgs mechanism for dRGT gravity: Example in which graviton gains mass through electroweak phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive gravity is an interesting theoretical framework capable of explaining among others things cosmological IR (infra-red) phenomena like late-time cosmic acceleration. Unfortunately, it turned out to be very difficult of getting consistent massive gravity theory due, among other things, to ghost appearance and strong coupling break-down problems. Of course, even though since the work of de Rham, Gabadadge and Tolley; the ghost problem appears overcame; things remain unchanged for the strong coupling break-down problem which is the problem that a massive gravity of experimentally viable graviton mass $m$ has (in comparison of standard massless gravity theory) a very low cutoff-scale $\Lambda_3= \Big[m^2M_P\Big]^{\frac{1}{3}}$ above which the theory fails; a problem what must be resolved if we want massive gravity be a consistent physical theory which can pretend to describe nature. Now as we know, one of the better way of overcoming this strong coupling break-down problem of massive gravity is to have a dynamical Higgs mechanism for gravity capable of providing a clear-cut way of making the graviton massless dynamically above the cutoff-scale $\Lambda_3$; a challenge what turned out to be difficult to surmount. It is this difficult that I overcome in the present paper by showing that it is quite possible of getting a four-dimensional modified massless gravity theory which becomes dynamically massive through for example the dynamical standard model electroweak phase transition. More precisely, I propose the first example of dynamical Higgs mechanism for dRGT gravity permitting to overcome the strong coupling break-down problem of dRGT gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a general framework for the study of asymptotically flat spinning dyonic {\it extremal} black holes (eBHs) in $D=4$ Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton theory. Restricting to the stringy value $\gamma=1$ of the dilaton coupling constant, we report on the existence of a one parameter family of eBHs which are free of pathologies, provided their magnetic and electric charges are equal. An understanding of this condition is found from a study of the near horizon limit of the solutions, both perturbative closed form and numerical solutions being presented.</description>

      <title>Quantum Ising Model on $(2+1)-$Dimensional Anti$-$de Sitter Space using Tensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum Ising model on (2+1)-dimensional anti-de Sitter space using Matrix Product States (MPS) and Matrix Product Operators (MPOs). Our spatial lattices correspond to regular tessellations of hyperbolic space with coordination number seven. We find the ground state of this model using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm which allowed us to probe lattices that range in size up to 232 sites. We explore the bulk phase diagram of the theory and find disordered and ordered phases separated by a phase transition. We find that the boundary-boundary spin correlation function exhibits power law scaling deep in the disordered phase of the Ising model consistent with the anti-de Sitter background. By tracing out the bulk indices, we are able to compute the density matrix for the boundary theory. At the critical point, we find the entanglement entropy exhibits the logarithmic dependence of boundary length expected for a one-dimensional CFT but away from this, we see a linear scaling. In comparison, the full system exhibits a volume law scaling, which is expected in chaotic and highly connected systems. We also measure Out-of-time-Ordered-Correlators (OTOCs) to explore the scrambling behavior of the theory.</description>

      <title>Renormalized tropical field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce tropical scalar field theory as a model for renormalizable quantum field theory, and examine in detail the case of quartic self-interaction and internal $O(N)$ symmetry. This model arises in a formally zero-dimensional limit of critical long-range models, but nevertheless its Feynman integrals exhibit strong numerical correlations with the ordinary 4-dimensional theory. The tropical theory retains the full complexity of renormalization with nested and overlapping vertex subdivergences and infinitely many primitive graphs.
  We compute the perturbation series of the tropical renormalization group functions exactly to 400 loops and study their asymptotic growth. In the minimal subtraction scheme, we find only an arithmetic sequence of singularities on the negative real axis in the Borel plane. These singularities are confluent and imply that the large-order perturbative asymptotics contain logarithmic and fractional power corrections. The absence of any further singularities suggests these series are Borel summable. In contrast, in a kinematic subtraction scheme, the singularity structure on the negative axis changes, and we find additional singularities on the positive real axis.</description>

      <title>Bridging Microscopic Constructions and Continuum Topological Field Theory of Three-Dimensional Non-Abelian Topological Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we provide a microscopic lattice construction of excitations, fusion, and shrinking in a non-Abelian topological order by studying the three-dimensional quantum double model. We explicitly construct lattice operators that create, fuse, and shrink particle and loop excitations, systematically derive their fusion and shrinking rules, and demonstrate that non-Abelian shrinking channels can be controllably selected through internal degrees of freedom of loop operators. Most importantly, we show that the lattice shrinking rules obey the fusion--shrinking consistency relations predicted by twisted $BF$ field theory, providing solid evidence for the validity of field-theoretical principles developed over the past years. In particular, we compute the full set of excitations, fusion, and shrinking data at the microscopic lattice level and verify exact agreement between the microscopic $\mathbb{D}_4$ quantum double lattice model and the continuum $BF$ field theory with an $AAB$ twist and $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$ gauge group, thereby placing the latter field theory, originally discovered in 2018 in connection with Borromean-ring braiding, on a solid microscopic footing. Our results bridge continuum topological field theory and exactly solvable lattice models, elevate fusion--shrinking consistency from a continuum field-theoretical principle to a genuine topological phenomenon defined at the microscopic lattice scale, and provide a concrete microscopic foundation for experimentally engineering higher-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders in controllable quantum simulators, such as trapped-ion systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Starobinsky model of inflation in light of recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), which indicates a potential preference for a slightly larger scalar spectral index $n_s$ than predicted by the standard $R^2$ scenario. We demonstrate that a natural one-parameter generalization to a quadratic model $\sim L+L^2$ in the Lovelock invariant $L=R+\frac{\alpha}{4}{\cal G}$ ($\cal G$ is the Gauss--Bonnet term), can effectively resolve this minor tension. Scalar-tensor formulation of this theory yields an Einstein-frame Starobinsky-type scalar potential augmented by Gauss--Bonnet and derivative couplings, which modify the inflationary slow-roll dynamics. We show that a non-zero coupling $\alpha$ for the Gauss-Bonnet term can shift $(n_s, r)$ along a trajectory that brings the predictions into better agreement with the ACT likelihood. We also find that $L+L^2$ gravity, in its scalar-tensor formulation, is equivalent to Higgs inflation coupled to the Gauss--Bonnet term, and belongs to the Horndeski/galileon class of modified gravities. This work establishes the quadratic $f(L)$ gravity as a compelling and physically motivated extension that preserves the successes of Starobinsky inflation while improving its fit to modern precision cosmological data.</description>

      <title>Can Randomness lead to non-anarchical mixing angles ?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the proposal of Craig and Sutherland that Anderson localization in a disordered fermion theory space can generate small neutrino masses from TeV scale physics \citecraig2018exponential}. Building on this idea, we ask a broader question: can randomness in fermion mass parameters also give rise to nonanarchical neutrino mixing angles, and how does the answer depend on the geometry of the mass graph? To explore this, we analyse three representative geometries a nearest neighbour chain, a fully connected non local model, and the Petersen graph in both Dirac and Majorana neutrino realisations. In the regime of strong diagonal disorder, all geometries display robust localization and naturally generate the observed neutrino mass scale, with the corresponding flavour mixing angles reflecting the random localization centres and thus taking an anarchical form. In the regime of weak disorder, where localization is milder, and eigenmodes can exhibit quasidegeneracies, light neutrino masses can emerge through GIM-mechanismlike cancellations among the heavy states. The weak disorder with geometry dependent weak localization constitutes a distinct pathway to structured mixings within disordered theory spaces. Overall, our results delineate the regimes in which disorder driven mechanisms produce hierarchical masses and identify the conditions under which structured flavour mixing can arise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a first-principles, non-perturbative investigation of quantum entanglement between partonic constituents in a strongly coupled 3+1-dimensional scalar Yukawa theory, using light-front Hamiltonian methods with controlled Fock-space truncations. By explicitly constructing reduced density matrices for (mock) nucleon, pion, and anti-nucleon subsystems from light-front wave functions, we compute key entanglement witnesses, including von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and linear entropy, in both quenched (no sea pairs) and unquenched frameworks. We find that the entanglement entropy is closely related to the Shannon entropy of the transverse momentum dependent distribution, establishing a link between quantum information and parton structure. In contrast, the unquenched theory reveals genuinely non-classical correlations: the entanglement entropy cannot be reduced to any Shannon entropy of normalized parton distributions, demonstrating that the full hadronic wave function encodes quantum information beyond classical probabilities. Our findings highlight the role of entanglement as a fundamental probe of non-perturbative dynamics in relativistic quantum field theory and lay the groundwork for extending these concepts to QCD and future collider phenomenology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of the eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix (entanglement spectrum) after a global quantum quench. We show that in an appropriate scaling limit the lower part of the entanglement spectrum exhibits ``universality''. In the scaling limit and at asymptotically long times the distribution of the entanglement spectrum depends on two parameters that can be determined from the R\'enyi entropies. We show that two typical scenarios occur. In the first one, the distribution of the entanglement spectrum levels is similar to the one describing the ground-state entanglement spectrum in Conformal Field Theories. In the second scenario, the lower levels of the entanglement spectrum are highly degenerate and their distribution is given by a series of Dirac deltas. We benchmark our analytical results in free-fermion chains, such as the transverse field Ising chain and the XX chain, in the rule 54 chain, and in Bethe ansatz solvable spin models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge-$4e$ superconductors are phases where quartets of electrons condense in the absence of Cooper pairing condensation. They exhibit distinctive signatures including fractional flux quantization and anomalous Josephson effects, and are actively being explored in strongly correlated systems, such as moir\'e materials. In this work we develop a general framework for \emph{topological} charge-$2ne$ superconductors based on both wavefunction and field theory approaches. In particular, we generate topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors from charge-$2e$ ingredients, and by breaking the charge $U(1)$ symmetry in certain classes of quantum Hall states. Via bulk-edge correspondence, we further construct the corresponding edge conformal field theory and bulk topological quantum field theory for topological charge-$2ne$ superconductors that suggests fermionic nonabelian topological orders. Our results provide a unified low energy description of the topological charge-$2ne$ superconductivity, offer a concrete platform for studying symmetry breaking and enrichment in interacting topological phases of matter, and have direct implications for experimental probes such as quasiparticle interferometry.</description>

      <title>When Geometry Radiates Review: Gravitational Waves in Theory, Cosmology, and Observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves provide a unique window into gravity, cosmology, and high-energy physics, enabling the exploration of fundamental phenomena across a wide range of scales. This review presents a coherent and pedagogical framework that bridges foundational theory with observational frontiers. We begin by developing the theory of gravitational radiation within linearized general relativity, deriving gravitational waves as solutions to the linearized Einstein equations and clarifying their physical interpretation, polarization states, and key properties. We then deepen the discussion through a geometric perspective, tracing the connection between gravitational radiation and the algebraic structure of the Weyl tensor and its role in defining energy and angular momentum in asymptotically flat spacetimes. Extending beyond flat backgrounds, we examine gravitational waves in an expanding universe, following their evolution across cosmological epochs and their generation during inflation. Within this setting, we discuss adiabatic modes and consistency relations that reveal universal properties of long-wavelength perturbations, and derive the inflationary spectrum of vacuum gravitational waves together with their contribution to the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect. We also survey the main observational strategies for detecting gravitational waves across a broad frequency range, including cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing arrays, ground- and space-based laser interferometers, and resonant cavity detectors. We then discuss the astrophysical and cosmological mechanisms responsible for generating gravitational radiation. We conclude by summarizing the current status of the field and outlining promising directions for future theoretical and observational developments.</description>

      <title>Gauged compact $Q$-balls and $Q$-shells in a multi-component $CP^N$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13076v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multicomponent $CP^N$ model's scalar electrodynamics. The model contains $Q$-balls and $Q$-shells, which are nontopological compact solitons with time dependency $e^{i\omega t}$. Two coupled $CP^N$ models can decouple locally if one of their $CP^N$ fields takes the vacuum value. Because of the compacton nature of solutions, $Q$-shells can shelter another compact $Q$-ball or $Q$-shell within their hollow region. Even if compactons do not overlap, they can interact through the electromagnetic field. We investigate how the size of multicompacton formations is affected by electric charge, with a focus on structures with nonzero or zero total net charge.</description>

      <title>Topological Gauge Theories with Sixteen Supercharges: Higher $A_\infty$-categorification of Floer Homologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20067v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is a sequel to [arXiv:2410.18575], and a third and final installment of the program initiated in [arXiv:2311.18302]. We show how, via a 3d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of certain topologically-twisted 5d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ and 8d $\mathcal{N} = 1$ gauge theories, one can derive novel Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories that 2-categorify the 3d-Haydys-Witten, Haydys-Witten, and holomorphic Donaldson-Thomas Floer homology of two, four, and five-manifolds, respectively. Via a 2d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the aforementioned twisted gauge theories, these Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-2-categories can be shown to be equivalent to corresponding Fukaya-Seidel type $A_{\infty}$-categories. In the 8d case, one can also derive higher $A_{\infty}$-categories, such as a novel Cauchy-Riemann-Fueter type $A_{\infty}$-3-category that 3-categorifies the Haydys-Witten Floer homology of four-manifolds via a 4d gauged Landau-Ginzburg model interpretation of the theory. Together with previous results from [arXiv:2410.18575] and [arXiv:2311.18302], our work furnishes purely physical proofs and generalizations of the mathematical conjectures by Bousseau [3], Doan-Rezchikov [4], and Cao [5].</description>

      <title>Wilson lines with endpoints in 3d CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Abelian gauge theories with dynamical matter, Wilson lines can end on the insertions of charged fields. We study the endpoints of Wilson lines in large $N$ bosonic QED$_3$. at its critical point. We first study the stability of an infinite Wilson line in the $\mathbb{CP}^{N-1}$ model by computing the appropriate functional determinant at large $N$. We also compute the conformal dimension of the lowest-dimension endpoint of the line to first order in $N^{-1}$. Along the way we calculate the field-strength tensor $F_{\mu\nu}$ in the presence of the line with endpoint and discuss a state-operator correspondence for the endpoints, as well as the existence of an OPE that allows two open-ended Wilson lines to be glued together into a single line.</description>

      <title>Extended AdS spacetime without boundaries and entanglement without holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We glue together two copies of pure AdS spacetime along their conformal boundaries creating a manifold without boundaries. The resulting space, which in dimension $d+2$ we denote by $AdS^{d+2}_\pm$, has the topology of $S^2\times\Sigma^d$, where $\Sigma^d$ is a $d$-manifold without boundary. Acting with $\mathbb Z_n$ on the $S^2$ factor amounts to coupling a pair of membranes at the north and south poles of the 2-sphere. Moreover, extending the domain of the 2-sphere polar coordinate from $[0, \pi]$ to the interval $[0, (2N-1)\pi]$, where $N&gt;1$, enables the coupling of one stack of $N$ coincident membranes at each pole of the 2-sphere ($2N$ membranes in total). Assuming the existence of a quantum gravity theory on the glued spacetime, we compute the classical approximation of the entanglement entropy across an entangling surface consisting of the two antipodal stacks of membranes. We find that the resulting entropy exhibits a boundary cutoff divergence that can be canceled by taking the limit of an infinite number of membranes. This large-$N$ cancellation -- possible only in the doubled, extended geometry without boundaries -- yields a finite, universal quarter-area law. The calculation does not require details of the quantum theory other than its infrared limit, which we assume to be Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>A Charge Constraint in BMN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I derive a new charge constraint in $\frac{1}{16}$-BPS sectors of the Berenstein, Maldacena, and Nastase (BMN) supersymmetric, gauged $U(N)$ matrix quantum mechanics. It was previously shown that the supersymmetric index of the model exhibits an exponential dependence on $N^2$ from the vacuum that preserves the full gauge group. I show that the reality of the associated entropy implies that the Cartan of $SO(3)$ vanishes for any $\frac{1}{16}$-BPS sector with $U(N)$ gauge symmetry. The BMN charge constraint could be useful to determine whether there exists a dual supersymmetric black hole solution asymptoting to a plane-wave background.</description>

      <title>The CFT of Sen's Formulation of Chiral Gauge Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sen's action for chiral bosons in 2 dimensions describes two chiral scalars, one of which couples to the physical metric and one of which couples to a flat metric. It has a generalisation in which the flat metric is replaced by an arbitrary second metric and so can be formulated on any curved world-sheet. When the two metrics are equal, the theory reduces to a $\beta \gamma$ system, giving a non-unitary $c=2$ conformal field theory. We argue that the relation between this and the theory of two chiral bosonic scalars of the same chirality can be viewed as a \lq bosonisation'. We show that the standard vertex operators for the chiral scalars are vertex operators and line operators in the Sen formulation and derive the formulation in the Sen theory of correlation functions in the chiral scalar theory. The flat space Sen theory can be coupled to two different world-sheet metrics in such a way that one scalar couples to one metric and the other to the other metric, so obtaining the general formulation with two metrics.
  In $d=4k+2$ dimensions, the bi-metric action for a $2k$-form gauge field with self-dual field strength reduces, when the two metrics are equal, to a conformal field theory with a $BF$-type action, except that $B$ is a self-dual $d/2$-form and $F$ is a $d/2$-form field strength, $F=dP$. The self-duality of $B$ means that this is not a topological theory but instead represents two self-dual gauge fields. This has a generalisation to a democratic action for $p$-form gauge fields in any dimension.</description>

      <title>A strong-weak duality for the 1d long-range Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the one-dimensional Ising model with long-range interactions decaying as $1/r^{1+s}$. In the critical regime, for $1/2 \leq s \leq 1$, this system realizes a family of nontrivial one-dimensional conformal field theories (CFTs), whose data vary continuously with $s$. For $s&gt;1$ the model has instead no phase transition at finite temperature, as in the short-range case. In the standard field-theoretic description, involving a generalized free field with quartic interactions, the critical model is weakly coupled near $s=1/2$ but strongly coupled in the vicinity of the short-range crossover at $s=1$. We introduce a dual formulation that becomes weakly coupled as $s \to 1$. Precisely at $s=1$, the dual description becomes an exactly solvable conformal boundary condition of the two-dimensional free scalar. We present a detailed study of the dual model and demonstrate its effectiveness by computing perturbatively the CFT data near $s=1$, up to next-to-next-to-leading order in $1-s$, by two independent approaches: (i) standard renormalization of our dual field-theoretic description and (ii) the analytic conformal bootstrap. The two methods yield complete agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Open effective field theories provide a systematic framework for describing systems coupled to an environment, where dissipation, noise, and modified conservation laws naturally arise. Working within the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we examine open extensions of three well-studied theories: the superfluid, Maxwell theory, and Einstein gravity. In gauge and gravitational theories, open terms that break advanced symmetries while preserving physical ones are not automatically consistent; they are allowed only if they lead to deformed identities among the equations of motion. We explicitly construct such a term in open gravity and show that it leads to a consistent deformation of the diffeomorphism identities.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Entropy and Complexity Growth in Horndeski Gravity within the AdS/BCFT Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the connection between quantum complexity and gravitational dynamics within the framework of Horndeski gravity, extending the AdS/BCFT correspondence to include scalar-tensor interactions. By refining the ``\(complexity = action\)'' conjecture we investigate how Horndeski gravity modifies the Wheeler-DeWitt patch and the causal structure of the black hole. Our analysis reveals that the linear growth of complexity, proportional to the product of black hole entropy and temperature, remains valid across various black hole configurations, including those of rotating and charged black holes. Moreover we study the impact of shock waves on the growth of complexity, which shows the appearance of the ``switchback effect''. These results show the universality of the complexity = action conjecture and its validity in modified gravitational theories.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum aspects of the conformal gravity in four dimensions, specifically addressing a known discrepancy in beta functions between general quadratic curvature theories and conformal gravity, which corresponds to two scalar degrees of freedom. We demonstrate that this mismatch is resolved by carefully introducing gauge-fixing and ghost terms via the BRST symmetry, which effectively adds the two scalar modes. Drawing lessons from two-dimensional quantum gravity and Liouville theory, we proceed to integrate the four-dimensional trace anomaly to derive a consistent Liouville action, which is given by a free-field action for the conformal mode with a consistent conformal anomaly. Finally we give the condition that the BRST transformation is anomaly free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02969v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $\alpha$-attractor models naturally appear in supergravity with hyperbolic geometry. The simplest versions of $\alpha$-attractors, T- and E-models, originate from theories with non-singular potentials. In canonical variables, these potentials have a plateau that is approached exponentially fast at large values of the inflaton field $\varphi$. In a closely related class of polynomial $\alpha$-attractors, or P-models, the potential is not singular, but its derivative is singular at the boundary. The resulting inflaton potential also has a plateau, but it is approached polynomially. In this paper, we will consider a more general class of potentials, which can be singular at the boundary of the moduli space, S-models. These potentials may have a short plateau, after which the potential may grow polynomially or exponentially at large values of the inflaton field. We will show that this class of models may provide a simple solution to the initial conditions problem for $\alpha$-attractors and may account for a very broad range of possible values of $n_{s}$ matching the recent ACT, SPT, and DESI data.</description>

      <title>Holographic Tensor Networks as Tessellations of Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic tensor networks serve as toy models for the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence, capturing many of its essential features in a concrete manner. However, existing holographic tensor network models remain far from a complete theory of quantum gravity. A key obstacle is their discrete structure, which only approximates the semi-classical geometry of gravity in a qualitative sense. In \cite{Lin:2024dho}, it was shown that a network of partial-entanglement-entropy (PEE) threads, which are bulk geodesics with a specific density distribution, generates a perfect tessellation of AdS space. Moreover, such PEE-network tessellations can be constructed for more general geometries using the Crofton formula. In this paper, we assign a quantum state to each vertex in the PEE network and develop two holographic tensor network models: the factorized PEE tensor network, which takes the form of a tensor product of EPR pairs, and the random PEE tensor network. In both models we reproduce the exact Ryu-Takayanagi formula by showing that the minimal number of cuts along a homologous surface in the network exactly computes the area of this surface.</description>

      <title>Overdamped quasibound states inside a Schwarzschild black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schwarzschild black-hole interiors, bounded by event horizons and terminated by spacelike singularities, are regions where all physical observers are inevitably destroyed. In the geometric optics approximation, waves follow null geodesics to the singularity. However, outside the geometric optics regime, the behavior of wave propagation can be rich and nuanced, even in such extreme habitats. In this work, we show that axial gravitational perturbations in the interior of a Schwarzschild black hole can form overdamped (non-oscillatory) quasibound states that decay before reaching the singularity. Using Kruskal-Szekeres coordinates to avoid coordinate ambiguities, we identify these modes and analyze their eigenfunctions. Contrary to earlier claims, we find that the Regge-Wheeler master function of these modes have non-zero amplitude at the future event horizon but decay before interacting with the singularity. We consider observations of the modes along timelike geodesics. This work suggests that certain gravitational fluctuations can hover transiently within the black-hole interior, challenging common assumptions about wave behavior in uncharted and extreme regions of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Is Dark Energy Dynamical in the DESI Era? A Critical Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether the recent DESI DR2 measurements provide or not evidences for dynamical dark energy by exploring the $\omega_0\omega_a$CDM model and its extensions with free $\sum m_{\nu}$ and $N_{\mathrm{eff}}$. Using a comprehensive MCMC analysis with a wide range of cosmological datasets including DESI~DR2 BAO and Ly$\alpha$ data, CMB compressed likelihoods, BBN, cosmic chronometers, and multiple Type~Ia supernova compilations, we assess the statistical preference for departures from $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian Formalism for Topological Recursion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a string field Hamiltonian formalism that associates a class of spectral curves and provides their quantization through the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion. As illustrative examples, we present Hamiltonians for the $(2,2m-1)$ minimal discrete and continuum dynamical triangulation (DT) models, the supersymmetric analogue of minimal continuum DT models, the Penner model, and 4D $\mathcal{N}=2$ $SU(2)$ gauge theories in the self-dual $\Omega$-background.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous instabilities in high-density QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20510v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: QCD at large densities exhibits a moat regime in the scalar-pseudoscalar sector. The resolution of its dynamics is pivotal for the access to the onset of new phases including the potential critical endpoint of QCD. In this work we present the first selfconsistent analysis of this regime with the functional renormalisation group approach to QCD. We map out the moat regime, including a first analysis of potential inhomogeneous instabilities at baryon chemical potential $\mu_B\gtrsim 600$ MeV on the chiral crossover line.</description>
