      <title>Dark Count Rate Stability of JUNO 20-inch PMTs in Mass Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO) is an ambitious multipurpose neutrino experiment designed to determine the neutrino mass ordering, with an impressive energy resolution goal of at least 3% at 1 MeV. To achieve a photon detection coverage of approximately 75%, JUNO will utilize two types of 20-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs): the large PMT (LPMT) and the microchannel plate PMT (MCP-PMT). A significant concern in high-precision neutrino measurements is the dark count rate (DCR) of PMTs, which introduces noise that can adversely affect energy measurement accuracy. During the mass testing phase of the JUNO 20-inch PMTs, comprehensive measurements of the DCR were undertaken. These measurements not only captured the DCR values of individual PMTs but also examined the stability and temperature dependence of the DCR at an operating gain of (1x10^7). This paper presents a detailed characterization of the DCR of the JUNO 20-inch PMTs, investigating factors such as cooling time, temperature variations, and long-term stability using the JUNO Pan-Asia PMT testing facilities. The results reveal distinct DCR characteristics between the two types of PMTs, providing valuable insights into the nature of DCR and its implications for JUNO's scientific objectives. In addition to performance characterization, we implemented a monitoring system to track DCR stability over time. Notably, several spikes in DCR were identified, prompting a preliminary investigation into their causes. Potential factors contributing to these spikes, such as flasher events, were explored using coincidence rate analysis and complementary imaging techniques. The findings from this study are crucial for optimizing the performance of PMTs in JUNO, ultimately aiding the experiment in achieving its goals related to neutrino physics.</description>

      <title>First Steps Toward the Development of a Straight-Line Reference Alignment System for Future Accelerators at CERN Using Pseudo-Nondiffracting Layer Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents experimental results that allow for the performance evaluation of a straight-line reference alignment system based on pseudo-nondiffracting Layer beams. Sensors, developed specifically for this system, feature four linear CMOS chips and a square aperture. This allows for simultaneous measurements along the beam path without disrupting the laser reference. Measurements, conducted over a distance of 2 m from the first to the last sensor, were compared with a laser tracker measurement to assess the sensor performance. The alignment reference generated by the Layer Beams exhibited a repeatability and reproducibility root-mean-square error (RMSE) of less than 30 ${\mu}$m. The relative alignment precision for a known displacement was validated with a standard deviation of 4.3 ${\mu}$m. The results highlight the underlying sources of noise, which are induced mainly by the cover glass, the protective film of the pixels, and the dark noise of the CMOS chips. Solutions to address these challenges are proposed. Additionally, a proof-of-concept for future development of a radiation-hard sensor utilizing optical fiber matrices is demonstrated. The RMSE of the reference position detection introduced by the fiber matrix remained below 1.3 ${\mu}$m. This would allow the sensor to be used reliably in high-radiation environments typical for accelerator facilities. This study serves as a foundational step toward developing a robust straight-line reference alignment system based on pseudo-nondiffracting Layer beams intended for deployment in the accelerator facilities.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength thermometry without a priori emissivity information: from promise to disillusionment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) thermography provides 2D radiance maps of the IR radiation leaving the surfaces of a scene, based on preliminary calibration. Then, to convert radiance maps into temperature maps, we need to know the emissivity of each element of the scene conjugated to each of the detector elements in the camera's focal plane. Compared to the single-band approach, can multispectral thermography help solve the inverse temperature-emissivity separation problem? Multiwavelength thermometry (MWT) is known to be an underdetermined problem having a continuous infinity of solutions. For this reason, and right from the origin of MWT, it appeared necessary to introduce information on emissivity to assess temperature, for example, by means of an analytical model. Overlooking these recommendations, a number of papers appeared in the early 2000s exploring the idea that we could do without any a priori knowledge of emissivity. Growth became exponential from 2020 onward, with the allegedly successful application of neural networks, genetic algorithms, and other novel optimization methods. The aim of the present work is to recall the consequences of MWT as an underdetermined inverse problem, to highlight the errors made by ignoring them, and to bring us back to harsh reality: we must introduce information on emissivity in order to evaluate temperature accurately. Furthermore, this information has to be fully consistent with the true spectral emissivity. To this end, we propose a new method for optimal selection of the emissivity model. A series of blind tests was set up to benchmark different inversion algorithms. The results confirm the failure of the temperature-emissivity separation when no emissivity information is available, despite the multiwavelength approach, which in any case comes as no surprise.</description>
