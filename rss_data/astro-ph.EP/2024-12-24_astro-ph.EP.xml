      <title>Correlation between planet formation rate and gas surface density: an analog of Kennicutt Schmidt law for planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficiency of planet formation is a fundamental question in planetary science, gaining increasing significance as observational data from planet-forming disks accumulates. Here we derive from first principles a correlation between the planet formation rate (PFR) and the gas surface density, i.e. $\rm{PFR}\propto \Sigma_g^n$. This relation serves as an analog for the well-established Kennicutt-Schmidt law for star-forming galaxies. We study the different planet formation mechanisms and the density dependence in each one of them, to finally formulate a simple relation. We find that the powerlaw ranges between $n\approx 4/3-2$, depending on the type of the forming planet, when we carry out different analyses for the formation rates of terrestrial planets, gas giants, and also planets formed by gravitational instability. We then compare our results with the available observational data. The relation we derive here aims to shed more light on the interpretation of observational data as well as analytical models, and give a new perspective on the properties of planet formation and its connection to gas.</description>

      <title>Stellar Contamination Correction Using Back-to-Back Transits of TRAPPIST-1 b and c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar surface heterogeneities, such as spots and faculae, often contaminate exoplanet transit spectra, hindering precise atmospheric characterization. We demonstrate a novel, epoch-based, model-independent method to mitigate stellar contamination, applicable to multi-planet systems with at least one airless planet. We apply this method using quasi-simultaneous transits of TRAPPIST-1 b and TRAPPIST-1 c observed on July 9, 2024, with JWST NIRSpec PRISM. These two planets, with nearly identical radii and impact parameters, are likely either bare rocks or possess thin, low-pressure atmospheres, making them ideal candidates for this technique, as variations in their transit spectra would be primarily attributed to stellar activity. Our observations reveal their transit spectra exhibit consistent features, indicating similar levels of stellar contamination. We use TRAPPIST-1 b to correct the transit spectrum of TRAPPIST-1 c, achieving a 2.5x reduction in stellar contamination at shorter wavelengths. At longer wavelengths, lower SNR prevents clear detection of contamination or full assessment of mitigation. Still, out-of-transit analysis reveals variations across the spectrum, suggesting contamination extends into the longer wavelengths. Based on the success of the correction at shorter wavelengths, we argue that contamination is also reduced at longer wavelengths to a similar extent. This shifts the challenge of detecting atmospheric features to a predominantly white noise issue, which can be addressed by stacking observations. This method enables epoch-specific stellar contamination corrections, allowing co-addition of planetary spectra for reliable searches of secondary atmospheres with signals of 60-250 ppm. Additionally, we identify small-scale cold (2000 K) and warm (2600 K) regions almost uniformly distributed on TRAPPIST-1, with overall covering fractions varying by 0.1% per hour.</description>

      <title>Transmission spectroscopy of WASP-52 b with JWST NIRISS: Water and helium atmospheric absorption, alongside prominent star-spot crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the era of exoplanet studies with JWST, the transiting, hot gas giant WASP-52 b provides an excellent target for atmospheric characterization through transit spectroscopy. WASP-52 b orbits an active K-type dwarf recognized for its surface heterogeneities, such as star-spots and faculae, which offers challenges to atmospheric characterization via transmission spectroscopy. Previous transit observations have detected active regions on WASP-52 through crossing events in transit light-curves and via the spectral imprint of unocculted magnetic regions on transmission spectra. Here, we present the first JWST observations of WASP-52 b. Our JWST NIRISS/SOSS transit observation, obtained through the GTO 1201 Program, detects two clear spot-crossing events that deform the 0.6-2.8 $\mu$m transit light-curves of WASP-52 b. We find that these two occulted spots combined cover about 2.4 % of the stellar surface and have temperatures about 400-500 K colder than the stellar photosphere. Our NIRISS/SOSS transmission spectrum is best-fit by an atmosphere with H$_2$O (10.8 $\sigma$), He (7.3 $\sigma$, with evidence of an escaping tail at $\sim$ 2.9 $\sigma$), hints of K (2.5 $\sigma$), and unocculted star-spots and faculae (3.6 $\sigma$). The retrieved H$_2$O abundance ($\log$ H$_2$O $\approx -4 \pm 1$) is consistent with a subsolar or solar atmospheric metallicity for two independent data reductions. Our results underscore the importance of simultaneously modelling planetary atmospheres and unocculted stellar heterogeneities when interpreting transmission spectra of planets orbiting active stars and demonstrate the necessity of considering different stellar contamination models that account for both cold and hot active regions.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Evolutionary Fits for Jupiter and Saturn Incorporating Fuzzy Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent realization that there likely are stably-stratified regions in the interiors of both Jupiter and Saturn, we construct new non-adiabatic, inhomogeneous evolutionary models with the same microphysics for each that result at the present time in respectable fits for all major bulk observables for both planets. These include the effective temperature, radius, atmospheric heavy-element and helium abundances (including helium rain), and the lower-order gravity moments J2 and J4. The models preserve from birth most of an extended "fuzzy" heavy-element core. Our predicted atmospheric helium mass fraction for Saturn is ~0.2, close to some measured estimates, but in disagreement with some published predictions. To preserve a fuzzy core from birth, the interiors of both planets must start out at lower entropies than would be used for traditional "hot start" adiabatic models, though the initial exterior mantle entropies can range from hot to warm start values. We do not see a helium ocean in Saturn's interior, and both models have inner envelopes with significant Brunt-Vaisala frequencies; this region for Saturn at the current epoch is more extended and in it, the Brunt is larger. The total heavy-element mass fraction in Jupiter and in Saturn is determined to be ~14% and ~26%, respectively, though there is some play in these determinations.</description>

      <title>Swing-By in Three Dimensions: Closed Form Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of the present research is to make a summary of analytical equations that can be found to calculate a swing-by maneuver in the three-dimensional space. Analytical equations based in the patched conics approximation are showed and they allow to calculate the variation in velocity, angular momentum, energy and inclination of the spacecraft that is involved in this maneuver. Based on that, it is possible to obtain expressions for particular cases, like the planar and the polar maneuver. The most important properties of this maneuver can demonstrated using thos equations, like: in the case of planar maneuver the variation in inclination can be only 180, 0, and -180 degrees; the variation in inclination is symmetric with respect to the out of plane angle; a passage by the poles changes only the y-component of the angular momentum, keeping the energy and the inclination of the trajectory unchanged. The results show several maneuvers.</description>

      <title>The Y Dwarf Population with HST: unlocking the secrets of our coolest neighbours -- II. Parallaxes and Proper Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present astrometric results from a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) campaign aimed at determining precise distances for cold Y-type brown dwarfs. Combining observations from a dedicated HST/WFC3 program with archival data, we derive astrometric solutions for 15 nearby Y dwarfs, by linking the high-precision relative astrometry from Hubble to the high-accuracy Gaia DR3 absolute reference system, using stars present in both to anchor the two frames of reference. We reach uncertainties on parallaxes below the 1-mas level for half of the sample, and down to 3 mas for two thirds of the targets, or relative precisions &lt;1% in most cases and 2-5x improvements over previous measurements. For the remaining targets, we achieved slightly lower precisions on parallaxes (5-12 mas, 5-10%), correlated with the lower signal-to-noise of the faintest targets. The precision reached in our derived proper motions is around 0.1-0.4 mas/yr for most targets, and up to 1-2 mas/yr for less precise cases. Our estimated parallaxes and proper motions are generally in good agreement with literature values, and consistent to 1-2 sigma with recent Spitzer-derived parallaxes in most cases. These new astrometric solutions provide important validation of these objects' distances and sky motions, especially given the large disparities seen in previous estimates. Our results demonstrate the power of HST combined with Gaia to measure highly-precise absolute astrometry for faint brown dwarfs, and highlights the limitations reached for the reddest and coldest objects, for which JWST will certainly provide a favourable platform to improve these results.</description>

      <title>Photometric Stellar Parameters for 195,478 Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16930v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stellar atmospheric parameters and physical properties of stars in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) are of great significance for the study of exoplanets, stellar activity, and asteroseismology. However, despite extensive effort over the past decades, accurate spectroscopic estimates of these parameters are available for only about half of the stars in the full KIC catalog. In our work, by training relationships between photometric colors and spectroscopic stellar parameters from Gaia DR3, the Kepler Issac-Newton Survey, LAMOST DR10, and APOGEE DR17, we have obtained atmospheric-parameter estimates for over 195,000 stars, accounting for 97% of the total sample of KIC stars. We obtain 1{\sigma} uncertainties of 0.1 dex on metallicity [Fe/H], 100 K on effective temperature $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ , and 0.2 dex on surface gravity log $g$. In addition, based on these atmospheric parameters, we estimated the ages, masses, radii, and surface gravities of these stars using the commonly adopted isochrone-fitting approach. The resulting precisions are 20% for ages, 0.1 $M_{\odot}$ for masses, 0.01 $R_{\odot}$ for radii and 0.1 dex for surface gravities. These accurate parameters are expected to provide valuable insights for future studies on various fields.</description>

      <title>Cleaning WASP-33 b transits from the host star photometric variability: analysis of TESS data from two sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on TESS observations of a $\delta$~Scuti variable WASP-33 obtained in 2019 and 2022, we thoroughly investigate the power spectrum of this target photometric flux and construct a statistically exhaustive model for its variability. This model contains $30$ robustly justified harmonics detected in the both TESS sectors simultaneously, $13$ less robust harmonics detected in a single TESS sector, a red noise and a quasiperiodic noise terms. This allowed us to greatly improve the accuracy of the exoplanet WASP-33\,\emph{b} transit timings, reducing the TTV residuals r.m.s. drastically, by a factor of $3.5$, from $63$~s to $18$~s. Finally, our analysis does not confirm existence of a detectable orbital phase variation claimed previously based on WASP-33 TESS photometry of 2019.</description>

      <title>C3PO III: On the Lithium Signatures Following Planet Engulfment by Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Planet engulfment has been identified as one of the mechanisms for enhancing lithium abundance in stars. However, comprehensive investigations into lithium signatures following such events remain limited. Stars born together, sharing a common origin and stellar characteristics, provide a unique opportunity to study these signatures and compare lithium abundances. We demonstrate that the distinctive signature of planet engulfment in lithium abundance is only discernible among highly similar stellar twins. We present lithium abundance measurements for 125 co-moving pairs of stars, representing the largest sample to date with a single, homogeneous assessment of high-precision lithium abundance. While lithium abundance enhancements in pairs showing planet engulfment signatures are within 0.35 dex, we find that even at fixed stellar parameters (temperature and age), the intrinsic scatter in lithium abundance is typically 0.35 dex for G/F dwarfs and can be as large as 0.6 dex for older and cooler stars due to internal stellar evolution processes. Since the planet engulfment signature from lithium can be masked by stellar intrinsic scatter, our findings raise questions about relying solely on lithium as an indicator for planet engulfment or attributing lithium-richness in stars primarily to planet engulfment events.</description>

      <title>Small and Close-In Planets are Uncommon Around A-type Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kepler and K2 missions enabled robust calculations of planet occurrence rates around FGKM-type stars. However, these missions observed too few stars with earlier spectral types to tightly constrain the occurrence rates of planets orbiting hotter stars. Using TESS, we calculate the occurrence rate of small ($1 \, R_\oplus &lt; R_{\rm p} &lt; 8 \, R_\oplus$), close-in ($P_{\rm orb} &lt; 10$ days) planets orbiting A-type stars for the first time. We search a sample of 20,257 bright ($6 &lt; T &lt; 10$) A-type stars for transiting planets using a custom pipeline and vet the detected signals, finding no reliable small planets. We characterize the pipeline completeness using injection/recovery tests and determine the $3\sigma$ upper limits of the occurrence rates of close-in sub-Saturns ($4 \, R_\oplus &lt; R_{\rm p} &lt; 8 \, R_\oplus$), sub-Neptunes ($2 \, R_\oplus &lt; R_{\rm p} &lt; 4 \, R_\oplus$), and super-Earths ($1 \, R_\oplus &lt; R_{\rm p} &lt; 2 \, R_\oplus$). We find upper limits of $2.2 \pm 0.4$ sub-Saturns and $9.1 \pm 1.8$ sub-Neptunes per 1000 A-type stars, which may be more than $3\times$ and $6\times$ lower than Kepler-era estimates for Sun-like stars. We calculate an upper limit of $186 \pm 34$ super-Earths per 1000 A-type stars, which may be more than $1.5\times$ lower than that for M dwarfs. Our results hint that small, close-in planets become rarer around early-type stars and that their occurrence rates decrease faster than that of hot Jupiters with increasing host star temperature. We discuss plausible explanations for these trends, including star-disk interactions and enhanced photoevaporation of planet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>PDS 70b Shows Stellar-like Carbon-to-oxygen Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\sim$5 Myr PDS 70 is the only known system with protoplanets residing in the cavity of the circumstellar disk from which they formed, ideal for studying exoplanet formation and evolution within its natal environment. Here we report the first spin constraint and C/O measurement of PDS 70b from Keck/KPIC high-resolution spectroscopy. We detected CO (3.8 $\sigma$) and H$_2$O (3.5 $\sigma$) molecules in the PDS 70b atmosphere via cross-correlation, with a combined CO and H$_2$O template detection significance of 4.2 $\sigma$. Our forward model fits, using BT-Settl model grids, provide an upper limit for the spin-rate of PDS 70b ($&lt;$29 km s$^{-1}$). The atmospheric retrievals constrain the PDS 70b C/O ratio to ${0.28}^{+0.20}_{-0.12}$ ($&lt;$0.63 under 95$\%$ confidence level) and a metallicity [C/H] of ${-0.2}^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$ dex, consistent with that of its host star. The following scenarios can explain our measured C/O of PDS 70b in contrast with that of the gas-rich outer disk (for which C/O $\gtrsim$ 1). First, the bulk composition of PDS 70b might be dominated by dust+ice aggregates rather than disk gas. Another possible explanation is that the disk became carbon-enriched $\textit{after}$ PDS 70b was formed, as predicted in models of disk chemical evolution and as observed in both very low mass star and older disk systems with $\textit{JWST}$/MIRI. Because PDS 70b continues to accrete and its chemical evolution is not yet complete, more sophisticated modeling of the planet and the disk, and higher quality observations of PDS 70b (and possibly PDS 70c), are necessary to validate these scenarios.</description>

Here, we present the first measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the warm sub-Neptune AU Mic c, using two transits observed simultaneously with the European Southern Observatory's (ESO's) Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO), CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS), and Next-Generation Transit Survey (NGTS). After correcting for flares and for the magnetic activity of the host star, and accounting for transit-timing variations, we find the sky-projected spin-orbit angle of planet c to be in the range $\lambda_c=67.8_{-49.0}^{+31.7}$\,degrees (1-$\sigma$). We examine the possibility that planet c is misaligned with respect to the orbit of the inner planet b ($\lambda_b=-2.96_{-10.30}^{+10.44}$\,degrees), and the equatorial plane of the host star, and discuss scenarios that could explain both this and the planet's high density, including secular interactions with other bodies in the system or a giant impact. We note that a significantly misaligned orbit for planet c is in some degree of tension with the dynamical stability of the system, and with the fact that we see both planets in transit, though these arguments alone do not preclude such an orbit. Further observations would be highly desirable to constrain the spin-orbit angle of planet c more precisely.</description>

      <title>Corotation-bounce resonance of ions in Jupiter's magnetosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Banded energy distributions of H$^{+}$, O$^{++}$, S$^{+++}$, and O$^+$ or S$^{++}$ ions between 100 eV to ~20 keV are consistently observed in Jupiter's magnetosphere mapping to M-shells between M=10-20. The bands correspond to flux enhancements at similar speeds for different ion species, providing the first evidence of simultaneous bounce-resonant acceleration of multiple ion species in Jupiter's magnetosphere. Ion enhancements occur for energies at which the bounce frequencies of the trapped ions matched integer harmonics of the System-III corotation frequency. The observations highlight a previously unknown interaction between corotation and bounce motion of &lt;10 keV energy ions that is a fundamental and persistent process occurring in Jupiter's magnetosphere.</description>

      <title>Planets Around Solar Twins/Analogs (PASTA) I.: High precision stellar chemical abundance for 17 planet-hosting stars and the condensation temperature trend</title>

Abstract: The Sun is depleted in refractory elements compared to nearby solar twins, which may be linked to the formation of giant or terrestrial planets. Here we present high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopic data for 17 solar-like stars hosting planets, obtained with Magellan II/MIKE, to investigate whether this depletion is related to planet formation. We derive stellar parameters, including stellar atmosphere, age, radius, mass, and chemical abundances for 22 elements from carbon to europium through line-by-line differential analysis. Our uncertainties range from 0.01 dex for Fe and Si to 0.08 dex for Sr, Y, and Eu. By comparing the solar abundances to those of the 17 stars, we investigate the differential abundance ([X/Fe]$_{\rm solar}$ - [X/Fe]$_{\rm star}$) versus condensation temperature ($T_c$) trend. In particular, we apply Galactic chemical evolution corrections to five solar twins within the full sample. Our results conform to previous studies that the Sun is relatively depleted in refractory compared to volatile elements. For both five solar twins and the rest of solar-like stars, we find that all stars hosting known gas giant planets exhibit negative $T_c$ trend slopes, suggesting that the Sun is relatively depleted in refractory elements compared to similar giant-planet-host stars. Additionally, we find no correlation between $T_c$ trend slopes and the total mass of detected terrestrial planets in each system, suggesting that terrestrial planet formation may not be the cause of refractory element depletion in the Sun.</description>
