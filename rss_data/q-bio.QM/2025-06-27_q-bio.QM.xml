      <title>Evaluating PDE discovery methods for multiscale modeling of biological signals</title>

Abstract: Biological systems are non-linear, include unobserved variables and the physical principles that govern their dynamics are partly unknown. This makes the characterization of their behavior very challenging. Notably, their activity occurs on multiple interdependent spatial and temporal scales that require linking mechanisms across scales. To address the challenge of bridging gaps between scales, we leverage partial differential equations (PDE) discovery. PDE discovery suggests meso-scale dynamics characteristics from micro-scale data. In this article, we present our framework combining particle-based simulations and PDE discovery and conduct preliminary experiments to assess equation discovery in controlled settings. We evaluate five state-of-the-art PDE discovery methods on particle-based simulations of calcium diffusion in astrocytes. The performances of the methods are evaluated on both the form of the discovered equation and the forecasted temporal variations of calcium concentration. Our results show that several methods accurately recover the diffusion term, highlighting the potential of PDE discovery for capturing macroscopic dynamics in biological systems from microscopic data.</description>

      <title>Balancing the cellular budget: lessons in metabolism from microbes to cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cancer cells are often seen to prefer glycolytic metabolism over oxidative phosphorylation even in the presence of oxygen-a phenomenon termed the Warburg effect. Despite significant strides in the decades since its discovery, a clear basis is yet to be established for the Warburg effect and why cancer cells show such a preference for aerobic glycolysis. In this review, we draw on what is known about similar metabolic shifts both in normal mammalian physiology and overflow metabolism in microbes to shed new light on whether aerobic glycolysis in cancer represents some form of optimisation of cellular metabolism. From microbes to cancer, we find that metabolic shifts favouring glycolysis are sometimes driven by the need for faster growth, but the growth rate is by no means a universal goal of optimal metabolism. Instead, optimisation goals at the cellular level are often multi-faceted and any given metabolic state must be considered in the context of both its energetic costs and benefits over a range of environmental contexts. For this purpose, we identify the conceptual framework of resource allocation as a potential testbed for the investigation of the cost-benefit balance of cellular metabolic strategies. Such a framework is also readily integrated with dynamical systems modelling, making it a promising avenue for new answers to the age-old question of why cells, from cancers to microbes, choose the metabolic strategies they do.</description>

      <title>Devising a solution to the problems of Cancer awareness in Telangana</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the data, the percent of women who underwent screening for cervical cancer, breast and oral cancer in Telangana in the year 2020 was 3.3 percent, 0.3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively. Although early detection is the only way to reduce morbidity and mortality, people have very low awareness about cervical and breast cancer signs and symptoms and screening practices. We developed an ML classification model to predict if a person is susceptible to breast or cervical cancer based on demographic factors. We devised a system to provide suggestions for the nearest hospital or Cancer treatment centres based on the users location or address. In addition to this, we can integrate the health card to maintain medical records of all individuals and conduct awareness drives and campaigns. For ML classification models, we used decision tree classification and support vector classification algorithms for cervical cancer susceptibility and breast cancer susceptibility respectively. Thus, by devising this solution we come one step closer to our goal which is spreading cancer awareness, thereby, decreasing the cancer mortality and increasing cancer literacy among the people of Telangana.</description>

      <title>Structural causal influence (SCI) captures the forces of social inequality in models of disease dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mathematical modeling has played a central role in understanding how infectious disease transmission manifests in populations. These models have demonstrated the importance of key community-level factors in structuring epidemic risk, and are now routinely used in public health for decision support. One barrier to their broader utility is that the existing canon does not often accommodate social inequalities as distinct formal drivers of variability in transmission dynamics. Given decades of evidence supporting the organizational effects of inequalities in structuring society more generally, and infectious disease risk more specifically, addressing this modeling gap is of critical importance. In this study, we build on previous efforts to integrate social forces into computational epidemiology by introducing a metric, the structural causal influence (SCI). The SCI uses causal analysis to provide a measure of the relative vulnerability of sub-communities within a susceptible population, shaped by differences in characteristics such as access to therapy, exposure to disease, and other determinants driven by social forces. We develop our metric in a simple case and apply it to a context of public health importance: Hepatitis C virus in a population of persons who inject drugs. In addition, we demonstrate the flexibility of the SCI using an agent-based model of an infectious disease. Our use of the SCI reveals that, under specific parameters in a multi-community model, the "less vulnerable" community may achieve a basic reproduction number below one, ensuring disease extinction. However, even minimal transmission between communities can increase this number, leading to sustained epidemics within both communities.</description>

      <title>Quantitative assessment of biological dynamics with aggregate data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and apply a learning framework for parameter estimation in initial value problems that are assessed only indirectly via aggregate data such as sample means and/or standard deviations. Our comprehensive framework follows Bayesian principles and consists of specialized Markov chain Monte Carlo computational schemes that rely on modified Hamiltonian Monte Carlo to align with constraints induced by summary statistics and a novel elliptical slice sampler adapted to the parameters of biological models. We benchmark our methods with synthetic data on microbial growth in batch culture and test them with real growth curve data from laboratory replication experiments on $\textit{Prochlorococcus}$ microbes. The results indicate that our learning framework can utilize experimental or historical data and lead to robust parameter estimation and data assimilation in ODE models that outperform least-squares fitting.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Tool to Analyse Spectroscopic Changes in High-Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06466v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into a biological solution, layers of biomolecules form on their surface, creating a corona. Understanding how the structure of the protein evolves into the corona is essential for evaluating the safety and toxicity of nanotechnology. However, the influence of NP properties on protein conformation is not well understood. In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen, a crucial protein in human blood plasma, at physiological concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method offers a quantitative analysis of protein structural changes upon adsorption and enhances the understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions.</description>
