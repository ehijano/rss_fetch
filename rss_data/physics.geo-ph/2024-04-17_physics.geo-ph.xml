      <title>Upscaling-based modified deep bed filtration model to match hyper-exponential retention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelling of colloidal and nano-suspension transport in porous media has garnered significant attention due to the prevalence of these processes in many engineering applications. A number of experimental studies have reported retention profiles after coreflooding that are hyper-exponential, a feature that the traditional models for deep bed filtration are unable to capture. The aim of this work is the development of a model for binary particle transport which can account for hyper-exponential retention profiles (HERPs). Averaging of the binary model results in a non-linear dependence of the capture rate on the suspended particle concentration. The averaged model demonstrates how nonlinear capture behaviour arises due to particle heterogeneity even when individual particle populations filter traditionally. The model establishes that nonlinear capture behaviour, including the prediction of HERPs, is possible even for dilute particle suspensions given that particle heterogeneity is significant. An exact solution of the colloidal transport equations is presented for any non-linear suspension function and any step-wise-constant injected concentration. The binary suspension function cannot be written explicitly, and so we present asymptotic expansions for several limiting cases where the suspension function can be expressed directly. The asymptotic expansions show good agreement with the binary model, and correctly capture the HERPs calculated with the exact solution. Several laboratory tests exhibiting HERPs have been matched by the traditional, binary, and asymptotic expansion models. The traditional model significantly deviates from the laboratory data due to its inability to capture the hyper-exponential behaviour, while both the binary and asymptotic models capture this behaviour well</description>

      <title>Multiple-Input Fourier Neural Operator (MIFNO) for source-dependent 3D elastodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations are essential tools to evaluate the solution of the wave equation in complex settings, such as three-dimensional (3D) domains with heterogeneous properties. However, their application is limited by high computational costs and existing surrogate models lack the flexibility of numerical solvers. This work introduces the Multiple-Input Fourier Neural Operator (MIFNO) to deal with structured 3D fields representing material properties as well as vectors describing the source characteristics. The MIFNO is applied to the problem of elastic wave propagation in the Earth's crust. It is trained on the HEMEW^S-3D database containing 30000 earthquake simulations in different heterogeneous domains with random source positions and orientations. Outputs are time- and space-dependent surface wavefields. The MIFNO predictions are assessed as good to excellent based on Goodness-Of-Fit (GOF) criteria. Wave arrival times and wave fronts' propagation are very accurate since 80% of the predictions have an excellent phase GOF. The fluctuations amplitudes are good for 87% of the predictions. The envelope score is hindered by the small-scale fluctuations that are challenging to capture due to the complex physical phenomena associated with high-frequency features. Nevertheless, the MIFNO can generalize to sources located outside the training domain and it shows good generalization ability to a real complex overthrust geology. When focusing on a region of interest, transfer learning improves the accuracy with limited additional costs, since GOF scores improved by more than 1 GOF unit with only 500 additional specific samples. The MIFNO is the first surrogate model offering the flexibility of an earthquake simulator with varying sources and material properties. Its good accuracy and massive speed-up offer new perspectives to replace numerical simulations in many-query problems.</description>

      <title>Predicting the Geothermal Gradient in Colombia: a Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate determination of the geothermal gradient is critical for assessing the geothermal energy potential of a given region. Of particular interest is the case of Colombia, a country with abundant geothermal resources. A history of active oil and gas exploration and production has left drilled boreholes in different geological settings, providing direct measurements of the geothermal gradient. Unfortunately, large regions of the country where geothermal resources might exist lack such measurements. Indirect geophysical measurements are costly and difficult to perform at regional scales. Computational thermal models could be constructed, but they require very detailed knowledge of the underlying geology and uniform sampling of subsurface temperatures to be well-constrained. We present an alternative approach that leverages recent advances in supervised machine learning and available direct measurements to predict the geothermal gradient in regions where only global-scale geophysical datasets and course geological knowledge are available. We find that a Gradient Boosted Regression Tree algorithm yields optimal predictions and extensively validate the trained model. We show that predictions of our model are within 12\% accuracy and that independent measurements performed by other authors agree well with our model. Finnally, we present a geothermal gradient map for Colombia that highlights regions where futher exploration and data collection should be performed.</description>
