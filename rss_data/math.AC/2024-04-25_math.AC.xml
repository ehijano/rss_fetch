      <title>The non-Lefschetz locus of conics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graded Artinian algebra $A$ has the Weak Lefschetz Property if there exists a linear form $\ell$ such that the multiplication map by $\ell:[A]_i\to [A]_{i+1}$ has maximum rank in every degree. The linear forms satisfying this property form a Zariski-open set; its complement is called the non-Lefschetz locus of $A$.
  In this paper, we investigate analogous questions for degree-two forms rather than lines. We prove that any complete intersection $A=k[x_1,x_2,x_3]/(f_1,f_2,f_3)$, with $\text{char } k=0$, has the Strong Lefschetz Property at range $2$, i.e. there exists a linear form $\ell\in [R]_1$, such that the multiplication map $\times \ell^2: [M]_i\to [M]_{i+2}$ has maximum rank in each degree.
  Then we focus on the forms of degree 2 such that $ \times C: [A]_i\to [A]_{i+2}$ fails to have maximum rank in some degree $i$. The main result shows that the non-Lefschetz locus of conics for a general complete intersection $A=k[x_1,x_2,x_3]/(f_1,f_2,f_3)$ has the expected codimension as a subscheme of $\mathbb{P}^5$. The hypothesis of generality is necessary. We include examples of monomial complete intersections in which the non-Lefschetz locus of conics has different codimension.
  To extend a similar result to the first cohomology modules of rank $2$ vector bundles over $\mathbb{P}^2$, we explore the connection between non-Lefschetz conics and jumping conics. The non-Lefschetz locus of conics is a subset of the jumping conics. Unlike the case of the lines, this can be proper when $\mathcal{E}$ is semistable with first Chern class even.</description>

      <title>Subadditivity of shifts, Eilenberg-Zilber shuffle products and homology of lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the maximal shifts in the minimal free resolution of the quotients of a polynomial ring by a monomial ideal are subadditive as a function of the homological degree. This answers a question that has received some attention in recent years. To do so, we define and study a new model for the homology of posets, given by the so called synor complex. We also introduce an Eilenberg-Zilber type shuffle product on the simplicial chain complex of lattices.
  Combining these concepts we prove that the existence of a non-zero homology class for a lattice forces certain non-zero homology classes in lower intervals. This result then translates into properties of the minimal free resolution. In particular, it implies a generalization of the original question.</description>

      <title>On Matlis reflexive modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matlis duality for modules over commutative rings gives rise to the notion of Matlis reflexivity. It is shown that Matlis reflexive modules form a Krull-Schmidt category. For noetherian rings the absence of infinite direct sums is a characteristic feature of Matlis reflexivity. This leads to a discussion of objects that are extensions of artinian by noetherian objects. Classifications of Matlis reflexive modules are provided for some small examples.</description>

      <title>SAGBI and Gr\"obner Bases Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a detection algorithm for SAGBI basis in polynomial rings, analogous to a Gr\"obner basis detection algorithm previously proposed by Gritzmann and Sturmfels. We also present two accompanying software packages named SagbiGbDetection for Macaulay2 and Julia. Both packages allow the user to find one or more term orders for which a set of input polynomials form either Gr\"obner basis for the ideal they generate or a SAGBI basis for the subalgebra. Additionally, we investigate the computational complexity of homogeneous SAGBI detection and apply our implementation to several novel examples.</description>

      <title>Finite generation of split F-regular monoid algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S$ be a submonoid of a free Abelian group of finite rank. We show that if $k$ is a field of prime characteristic such that the monoid $k$-algebra $k[S]$ is split $F$-regular, then $k[S]$ is a finitely generated $k$-algebra, or equivalently, that $S$ is a finitely generated monoid. Split $F$-regular rings are possibly non-Noetherian or non-$F$-finite rings that satisfy the defining property of strongly $F$-regular rings from the theories of tight closure and $F$-singularities. Our finite generation result provides evidence in favor of the conjecture that split $F$-regular rings in function fields over $k$ have to be Noetherian. The key tool is Diophantine approximation from convex geometry.</description>

      <title>On Stability and Denominators of F-pure thresholds in Families of Diagonal Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a prime number $p$ and a positive integer $m$, we provide a family of diagonal hypersurfaces $\{ f_n \}_{n = 1}^{\infty}$ in $m$ variables, for which the denominator of $\text{ fpt } (f_{n})$ (in lowest terms) is always $p$ and whose $F$-pure thresholds stabilize after a certain $n$. We also provide another family of diagonal hypersurfaces $\{ g_n \}_{n = 1}^{\infty}$ in $m$ variables, for which the power of $p$ in the denominator of $\text{ fpt } (g_{n})$ (in lowest terms) diverges to $\infty$ as $n \to \infty$. This behavior of the denominator of the $F$-pure thresholds is dependent on the congruence class of $p$ modulo the smallest two exponents of $\{ f_n \}$ and $\{ g_n \}$.</description>

      <title>On derived equivalence for Abuaf flop: mutation of non-commutative crepant resolutions and spherical twists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:1706.04417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Segal constructed a derived equivalence for an interesting 5-fold flop that was provided by Abuaf. The aim of this article is to add some results for the derived equivalence for Abuaf's flop. Concretely, we study the equivalence for Abuaf's flop by using Toda-Uehara's tilting bundles and Iyama-Wemyss's mutation functors. In addition, we observe a "flop-flop=twist" result and a "multi-mutation=twist" result for Abuaf's flop.</description>
