      <title>Collapsing dynamics of attractive Bose-Einstein condensates in random potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stationary and dynamical properties of three-dimensional trapped Bose-Einstein condensates with attractive interactions subjected to a random potential. To this end, a variational method is applied to solve the underlying Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We derive analytical predictions for the energy, the equilibrium width, and evolution laws of the condensate parameter. The breathing mode oscillations frequency of the condensate has been also calculated in terms of the gas and disorder parameters. We analyze in addition the dynamics of collapse from the Gaussian approximation. Surprisingly, we find that the intriguing interplay of the attractive interaction and disorder effects leads to prevent collapse of the condensate.</description>

      <title>The Atomic Superfluid Quantum Interference Device with tunable Josephson Junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The atomic superfluid quantum interference device (ASQUID) with tunable Josephson junctions is theoretically investigated. ASQUID is a device that can be used for the detection of rotation. In this work we establish an analytical theory for the ASQUID using the tunneling Hamiltonian method and find two physical quantities that can be used for the rotation sensing. The first one is the critical population bias, which characterizes the transition between the self-trapping and the Josephson oscillation regimes and demonstrates a periodic modulation behavior due to the rotation of the system. We discuss the variation of critical population bias when the tunneling strengths of the junctions are tuned in different values, and find that the symmetric junctions are better choice than the asymmetric ones in terms of rotation sensing. Furthermore, how the initial phase difference between the two condensates affects the measurement of rotation is also discussed. Finally, we investigate the case of time-dependent junctions and find there is another physical quantity, named critical time, that can be used to detect the rotation.</description>

      <title>Excitations of a supersolid annular stripe phase in a spin-orbital-angular-momentum-coupled spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the collective excitations of the supersolid annular stripe phase of a spin-orbital-angular-momentum-coupled (SOAM-coupled) spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. The annular stripe phase simultaneously breaks two continuous symmetries, namely rotational and $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, and is more probable in the condensates with a larger orbital angular momentum transfer imparted by a pair of Laguerre-Gaussian beams than what has been considered in the recent experiments. Accordingly, we consider a SOAM-coupled spin-1 condensate with a $4\hbar$ orbital angular momentum transferred by the lasers. Depending on the values of the Raman coupling strength and quadratic Zeeman term, the condensate with realistic antiferromagnetic interactions supports three ground-state phases: the annular stripe, the vortex necklace, and the zero angular momentum phase. We numerically calculate the collective excitations of the condensate as a function of coupling and quadratic Zeeman field strengths for a fixed ratio of spin-dependent and spin-independent interaction strengths. At low Raman coupling strengths, we observe a direct transition from the zero angular momentum to the annular stripe phase, characterized by the softening of a double symmetric roton mode, which serves as a precursor to supersolidity.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Quantum Anomaly Detection on Noisy Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether in fundamental physics, cybersecurity or finance, the detection of anomalies with machine learning techniques is a highly relevant and active field of research, as it potentially accelerates the discovery of novel physics or criminal activities. We provide a systematic analysis of the generalization properties of the One-Class Support Vector Machine (OCSVM) algorithm, using projected quantum kernels for a realistic dataset of the latter application. These results were both theoretically simulated and experimentally validated on trapped-ion and superconducting quantum processors, by leveraging partial state tomography to obtain precise approximations of the quantum states that are used to estimate the quantum kernels. Moreover, we analyzed both platforms respective hardware-efficient feature maps over a wide range of anomaly ratios and showed that for our financial dataset in all anomaly regimes, the quantum-enhanced OCSVMs lead to better generalization properties compared to the purely classical approach. As such our work bridges the gap between theory and practice in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era and paves the path towards useful quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Topological domain-wall pump with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A domain-wall pump by an extended cluster model of $S=1/2$ spins is proposed with local $U(1)$ gauge invariance. Its snapshot ground state is gapped and doubly degenerated due to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariance, which is broken by an infinitesimal boundary magnetic field. The ground state associated with the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) is still symmetry-protected with additional spatial inversion that is characterized by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Berry phase. We investigate the topological domain-wall pump with/without boundaries. The topological pump associated with the inversion symmetry-breaking path induces a non-trivial Chern number of bulk and a singular behavior of edge states of the domain-wall. Generalization to the multi-spin interaction is also explicitly given.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of non-Hermitian BCS superfluids in a dissipative asymmetric Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Fermi-Hubbard model with asymmetric hopping and complex-valued interactions, which can be realized by collective one-body loss and two-body loss. By means of the NH BCS theory, we find that the weak asymmetry of the hopping does not affect the BCS superfluidity since it only affects the imaginary part of the eigenvalues of the BdG Hamiltonian. Systematic analysis in the d-dimensional hypercubic lattices clarifies that the singularity in the density of states affects the phase boundary between the normal and dissipation-induced superfluid states. Our results can be tested in ultracold atoms by using the photoassociation techniques and a nonlocal Rabi coupling with local losses and postselecting null measurement outcomes with the use of the quantum-gas microscope.</description>

      <title>Unbalanced droplets of one-dimensional mixtures of fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By means of a diffusion Monte Carlo technique, we study one-dimensional unbalanced mixtures of fermionic Ytterbium atoms ($^{173}$Yb, $^{171}$Yb). This means clusters in which the total number of $^{173}$Yb particles is different from the sum of all the atoms belonging to the $^{171}$Yb isotope. Our aim will be to check the possibility of having self-bound arrangements beyond the balanced compositions reported in previous literature rather than exploring all the situations in which that could be possible. In that vein, we focused mainly on mixtures in which the atoms belonging to one isotope are spin-polarized, while the spins of the particles in the other isotope are evenly distributed in two sets. What we found was that, even tough self-bound droplets are possible for different compositions, the most stable ones are clusters with a slight excess of attractively interacting $^{171}$Yb particles with different spins with respect to the number of spin-polarized $^{173}$Yb atoms. Clusters in which the number of repulsively interacting unequal-spin $^{173}$Yb atoms are in excess with respect to the spin-polarized $^{171}$Yb particles have a very narrow stability range.</description>

      <title>Non-Bloch band theory for non-Hermitian continuum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most pronounced non-Hermitian phenomena is the non-Hermitian skin effect, which refers to the exponential localization of bulk eigenstates near the boundaries of non-Hermitian systems. Whereas non-Bloch band theory has been developed to describe the non-Hermitian skin effect in lattice systems, its counterpart in continuum systems still lacks a quantitative characterization. Here, we generalize the non-Bloch band theory to non-Hermitian continuum systems. In contrast to lattice systems for which the bulk Hamiltonian alone determines the non-Hermitian skin effect and energy spectrum, we find for continuum systems that the number of boundary conditions, i.e., the number of independent differential equations satisfied by wavefunctions at two boundaries, must also be included as essential information. We show that the appropriate discretization of continuum systems into lattice models requires matching the hopping range of the latter with the number of boundary conditions in the former. Furthermore, in periodic non-Hermitian continuum systems, we highlight the application of the transfer matrix in determining the generalized Brillouin zone. Our theory serves as a useful toolbox for investigating the rich non-Bloch physics in non-Hermitian continuum systems, such as photonic crystals, elastic media, and certain cold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical suppression of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect in Anyonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) is a fascinating phenomenon in nonequilibrium systems where eigenstates massively localize at the systems' boundaries, pumping (quasi-)particles loaded in these systems unidirectionally to the boundaries. Its interplay with many-body effects have been vigorously studied recently, and inter-particle repulsion or Fermi degeneracy pressure have been shown to limit the boundary accumulation induced by the NHSE both in their eigensolutions and dynamics. However, in this work we found that anyonic statistics can even more profoundly affect the NHSE dynamics, suppressing or even reversing the state dynamicss against the localizing direction of the NHSE. This phenomenon is found to be more pronounced when more particles are involved.The spreading of quantum information in this system shows even more exotic phenomena, where NHSE affects only the information dynamics for a thermal ensemble, but not that for a single initial state. Our results open up a new avenue on exploring novel non-Hermitian phenomena arisen from the interplay between NHSE and anyonic statistics, and can potentially be demonstrated in ultracold atomic quantum simulators and quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Exact eigenstates with off-diagonal long-range order for interacting bosonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermions and hardcore bosons share the same restriction: no more than one particle can occupy a single site in a lattice system. Specifically, in one dimension, two systems can share the same matrix representation. In this work, we investigate both the fermion and hardcore-boson models with nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction in a ring lattice. We construct the exact eigenstates of the hardcore-boson model with resonant NN interaction and show that they possess off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) in the thermodynamic limit. In comparison, the fermionic counterpart does not support such a feature due to the different particle statistics, although they share an identical energy spectrum. In addition, we examine the effect of the periodic boundary condition on the dynamics of the condensate states through numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a sequence of multi-site gates which transform an easily constructed product state into an approximation to the superfluid ground state of the Bose-Hubbard model. The mapping is exact in the one dimensional hard core limit, and for non-interacting particles in both one and two dimensions. The gate sequence has other applications, such as being used as part of a many-body interferometer which probes the existence of doublons.</description>
