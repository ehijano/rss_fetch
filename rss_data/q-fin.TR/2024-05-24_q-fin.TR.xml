      <title>Unlocking Profit Potential: Maximizing Returns with Bayesian Optimization of Supertrend Indicator Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the potential of Bayesian optimization (BO) to optimize the atr multiplier and atr period -the parameters of the Supertrend indicator for maximizing trading profits across diverse stock datasets. By employing BO, the thesis aims to automate the identification of optimal parameter settings, leading to a more data-driven and potentially more profitable trading strategy compared to relying on manually chosen parameters. The effectiveness of the BO-optimized Supertrend strategy will be evaluated through backtesting on a variety of stock datasets.</description>

      <title>Continuous-time Equilibrium Returns in Markets with Price Impact and Transaction Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an Ito-financial market at which the risky assets' returns are derived endogenously through a market-clearing condition amongst heterogeneous risk-averse investors with quadratic preferences and random endowments. Investors act strategically by taking into account the impact that their orders have on the assets' drift. A frictionless market and an one with quadratic transaction costs are analysed and compared. In the former, we derive the unique Nash equilibrium at which investors' demand processes reveal different hedging needs than their true ones, resulting in a deviation of the Nash equilibrium from its competitive counterpart. Under price impact and transaction costs, we characterize the Nash equilibrium as the (unique) solution of a system of FBSDEs and derive its closed-form expression. We furthermore show that under common risk aversion and absence of noise traders, transaction costs do not change the equilibrium returns. On the contrary, when noise traders are present, the effect of transaction costs on equilibrium returns is amplified due to price impact.</description>

      <title>FinRobot: An Open-Source AI Agent Platform for Financial Applications using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As financial institutions and professionals increasingly incorporate Large Language Models (LLMs) into their workflows, substantial barriers, including proprietary data and specialized knowledge, persist between the finance sector and the AI community. These challenges impede the AI community's ability to enhance financial tasks effectively. Acknowledging financial analysis's critical role, we aim to devise financial-specialized LLM-based toolchains and democratize access to them through open-source initiatives, promoting wider AI adoption in financial decision-making.
  In this paper, we introduce FinRobot, a novel open-source AI agent platform supporting multiple financially specialized AI agents, each powered by LLM. Specifically, the platform consists of four major layers: 1) the Financial AI Agents layer that formulates Financial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) by breaking sophisticated financial problems down into logical sequences; 2) the Financial LLM Algorithms layer dynamically configures appropriate model application strategies for specific tasks; 3) the LLMOps and DataOps layer produces accurate models by applying training/fine-tuning techniques and using task-relevant data; 4) the Multi-source LLM Foundation Models layer that integrates various LLMs and enables the above layers to access them directly. Finally, FinRobot provides hands-on for both professional-grade analysts and laypersons to utilize powerful AI techniques for advanced financial analysis. We open-source FinRobot at \url{https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinRobot}.</description>

      <title>am-AMM: An Auction-Managed Automated Market Maker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Automated market makers (AMMs) have emerged as the dominant market mechanism for trading on decentralized exchanges implemented on blockchains. This paper presents a single mechanism that targets two important unsolved problems for AMMs: reducing losses to informed orderflow, and maximizing revenue from uninformed orderflow. The ``auction-managed AMM'' works by running a censorship-resistant onchain auction for the right to temporarily act as ``pool manager'' for a constant-product AMM. The pool manager sets the swap fee rate on the pool, and also receives the accrued fees from swaps. The pool manager can exclusively capture some arbitrage by trading against the pool in response to small price movements, and also can set swap fees incorporating price sensitivity of retail orderflow and adapting to changing market conditions, with the benefits from both ultimately accruing to liquidity providers. Liquidity providers can enter and exit the pool freely in response to changing rent, though they must pay a small fee on withdrawal. We prove that under certain assumptions, this AMM should have higher liquidity in equilibrium than any standard, fixed-fee AMM.</description>
