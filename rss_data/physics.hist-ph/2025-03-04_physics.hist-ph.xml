      <title>A Short History of Rocks: or, How to Invent Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This essay gives a short, informal account of the development of digital logic from the Pleistocene to the Manhattan Project, the introduction of reversible circuits, and Richard Feynman's allied proposal for quantum computing. We argue that Feynman's state-based analogy is not the only way to arrive at quantum computing, nor indeed the simplest. To illustrate, we imagine an alternate timeline in which John von Neumann skipped Operation Crossroads to debug a military computer, got tickled by the problem, and discovered a completely different picture of quantum computing - in 1946.
  Feynman suggested we "quantize" state, and turn classically reversible circuits into quantum reversible, unitary ones. In contrast, we speculate that von Neumann, with his background in functional analysis and quantum logic, would seek to "quantize" the operators of Boolean algebra, and with tools made available in 1946 could successfully do so. This leads to a simpler, more flexible circuit calculus and beautiful parallels to classical logic, as we detail in a forthcoming companion paper.</description>

      <title>Technological Understanding: On the cognitive skill involved in the design and use of technological artefacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although several accounts of scientific understanding exist, the concept of understanding in relation to technology remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a philosophical account of technological understanding - the type of understanding that is required for and reflected by successfully designing and using technological artefacts. We develop this notion by building on the concept of scientific understanding. Drawing on parallels between science and technology, and specifically between scientific theories and technological artefacts, we extend the idea of scientific understanding into the realm of technology. We argue that, just as scientific understanding involves the ability to explain a phenomenon using a theory, technological understanding involves the ability to use a technological artefact to realise a practical aim. Technological understanding can thus be considered a specific application of knowledge: it encompasses the cognitive skill of recognising how a practical aim can be achieved by using a technological artefact. In a context of design, this general notion of technological understanding is specified as the ability to design an artefact that, by producing a phenomenon through its physical structure, achieves the intended aim. We illustrate our concept of technological understanding through two running examples: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and superconducting quantum computers. Our account highlights the epistemic dimension of engaging with technology and, by allowing for context-dependent specifications, provides guidance for testing and improving technological understanding in specific contexts.</description>

      <title>Reasoning across spacelike surfaces in the Frauchiger-Renner thought experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Frauchiger-Renner argument purports to show that the standard framework of quantum mechanics yields a contradiction when used to reason about systems containing agents who are themselves using quantum mechanics to perform deductions. This has been framed as an obstacle to taking quantum mechanics to be a complete theory. I formalize the argument in two closely related ways and elucidate the source of the paradox, clarifying the flaw in the original argument.</description>

      <title>Nouvelle theorie des taches du Soleil, by E. Pezenas (1692-1776). A fully annoted edition of a manuscript</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.00002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.00002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The manuscript New Theory of Sunspots was identified and attributed to the Jesuit astronomer and hydrographer from Marseille Esprit Pezenas (1692-1776) during the year 2002, during the systematic search for papers concerning him in the various French funds. The manuscript, in large part unpublished, New Theory of Sunspots was written by astronomer and professor of Marseilles Jesuit hydrography, Father Esprit Pezenas (1692-1776). The text was composed and revised between the years 1766 and 1772. In this manuscript, of which we are going to study the conditions of its composition, P. Pezenas gives one of the last geometric methods, related graphical methods, allowing the inclination of the Sun's equator to be deduced on ecliptic, using three observations of a sunspot, at given times, and in taking into account the movement of the Earth with respect to the Sun during the duration of observations. This text contains all the digital elements allowing to follow and understand the application of geometric processing methods of observations and observation techniques mentioned above in the introduction: passages of edges and Sun spots at the meridian, use of objective micrometers and wire micrometers. At detour of his calculations, Father Pezenas announces a duration of about 26 days and 9 hours for the rotation of the Sun around its axis, comments on and corrects some observation data published in Le Monnier's Heavenly History.</description>

      <title>Re(l)ality: The View From Nowhere vs. The View From Everywhere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20520v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the fiber bundle framework, this work investigates the conceptual and mathematical foundations of reference frames in General Relativity by contrasting two paradigms. The View from Nowhere interprets frame representations as perspectives on an invariant equivalence class, while the View from Everywhere posits each frame representation as constituting a complete reality itself. What emerges is a conception of reality that I term "Relality". The paper critically examines the philosophical and practical implications of these views, with a focus on reconciling theory with experimental practice. Central to the discussion is the challenge of providing a perspicuous characterisation of ontology. The View from Nowhere aligns with the so-called sophisticated approach on symmetries and it complicates the empirical grounding of theoretical constructs. In contrast, the View from Everywhere offers a relational ontology that avoids the abstraction of equivalence classes.</description>
