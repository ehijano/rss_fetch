      <title>Thermodynamics of surfactant-enriched binary-fluid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface-active agents (surfactants) release potential energy as they migrate from one of two adjacent fluids onto their fluid-fluid interface, a process that profoundly impacts the system's energy and entropy householding. The continuum thermodynamics underlying such a surfactant-enriched binary-fluid system has not yet been explored comprehensively. In this article, we present a mathematical description of such a system, in terms of balance laws, equations of state, and permissible constitutive relations and interface conditions, that satisfies the first and second law of thermodynamics. The interface conditions and permissible constitutive relations are revealed through a Coleman-Noll analysis. We characterize the system's equilibrium by defining equilibrium equivalences and study an example system. With our work, we aim to provide a systematically derived framework that combines and links various elements of existing literature, and that can serve as a thermodynamically consistent foundation for the (numerical) modeling of full surfactant-enriched binary-fluid systems.</description>

      <title>An experimental study of inflow stability in a falling soap film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inflow control is essential for most fluid mechanics experiments. Although vertically falling soap film flows have been extensively used in the last four decades to study two-dimensional flows, its inflow stability has not yet been discussed in detail. In this article, aiming to improve the inflow stability of the system, we discuss how flow driving systems dominate the inflow states and the statistics of soap film flow properties. We report experimental measurements of inflow rates using different flow driving methods, followed by soap film velocity measurements by Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). The widely-used method of a constant-pressure-head reservoir exhibits a continuous drop of inflow rate. In addition, even when the flow is not disturbed, the soap film displays high magnitudes of velocity fluctuations. The mean square of velocity fluctuation was measured at 4.6% of the mean. We also test other methods without the reservoir, where the flow is directly controlled by a pump; two staggered syringe pumps are able to maintain inflow stability over days and reduce the velocity fluctuation to 0.5% of the mean. From these measurements, we conclude that the drop of inflow rate might be caused by micro/milli-scale air bubbles, which cannot be completely removed in the system. A method to control the inflow actively is necessary in a soap film setup, when a stable and long standing film flow is needed.</description>

      <title>A note on the error analysis of data-driven closure models for large eddy simulations of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we provide a mathematical formulation for error propagation in flow trajectory prediction using data-driven turbulence closure modeling. Under the assumption that the predicted state of a large eddy simulation prediction must be close to that of a subsampled direct numerical simulation, we retrieve an upper bound for the prediction error when utilizing a data-driven closure model. We also demonstrate that this error is significantly affected by the time step size and the Jacobian which play a role in amplifying the initial one-step error made by using the closure. Our analysis also shows that the error propagates exponentially with rollout time and the upper bound of the system Jacobian which is itself influenced by the Jacobian of the closure formulation. These findings could enable the development of new regularization techniques for ML models based on the identified error-bound terms, improving their robustness and reducing error propagation.</description>

      <title>Active flow control for drag reduction through multi-agent reinforcement learning on a turbulent cylinder at $Re_D=3900$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents novel active-flow-control (AFC) strategies aimed at achieving drag reduction for a three-dimensional cylinder immersed in a flow at a Reynolds number based on freestream velocity and cylinder diameter of (Re_D=3900). The cylinder in this subcritical flow regime has been extensively studied in the literature and is considered a classic case of turbulent flow arising from a bluff body. The strategies presented are explored through the use of deep reinforcement learning. The cylinder is equipped with 10 independent zero-net-mass-flux jet pairs, distributed on the top and bottom surfaces, which define the AFC setup. The method is based on the coupling between a computational-fluid-dynamics solver and a multi-agent reinforcement-learning (MARL) framework using the proximal-policy-optimization algorithm. Thanks to the acceleration in training facilitated by exploiting the local invariants with MARL, a drag reduction of (8\%) was achieved, with a mass cost efficiency two orders of magnitude lower than those of the existing classical controls in the literature. This development represents a significant advancement in active flow control, particularly in turbulent regimes critical to industrial applications.</description>

      <title>High fidelity simulations of unstart phenomena in a scramjet inlet due to angle of attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the unsteady behavior of unstart phenomena within a scramjet inlet using advanced computational techniques. Scramjets and ramjets, with their reliance on inlet compression, offer promising airbreathing propulsion for hypersonic regimes. This research focuses on understanding and modeling the onset of unstart phenomena in supersonic inlets, a critical step towards developing mitigation strategies. These strategies have the potential to improve engine efficiency, range, and maneuverability of hypersonic vehicles. To achieve this, the state-of-the-art compressible flow solver, Eilmer, is used to simulate shockwave behavior within the inlet/isolator of a planar scramjet characterized experimentally at North Carolina State University (NCSU). Baseline comparisons are presented with the wind tunnel experiments via the shock structures present within the isolator section conducted at Mach 3.9 on a 3D scramjet inlet model. Simulations are then carried out at varying angles of attack (0 to 10 deg) and multiple pitch rates (10 deg/sec and 100 deg/sec) to demonstrate the shock train inertial response and to characterize unstart onset. In both cases the timing of inlet unstart is observed to correlate well with the rapid surge in exit pressure as well as shock detachment at the lower leading edge region. Lastly, exit pressures are significantly higher in the 10 deg/s case than in that of the 100 deg/s case at the same angle of attack. These observations suggest that unstart is not only dependent on angle of attack but also on AoA pitch rate. The findings provide valuable insights into the unsteady flow behavior during hypersonic inlet unstart, with potential applications for unstart detection at high angles of attack.</description>

      <title>Lateral migration and bouncing of a deformable bubble rising near a vertical wall. Part 1. Moderately inertial regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The buoyancy-driven motion of a deformable bubble rising near a vertical hydrophilic wall is studied numerically. We focus on moderately inertial regimes in which the bubble undergoes low-to-moderate deformations and would rise in a straight line in the absence of the wall. Three different types of near-wall motion are observed, depending on the buoyancy-to-viscous and buoyancy-to-capillary force ratios defining the Galilei ($Ga$) and Bond ($Bo$) numbers of the system, respectively. For low enough $Ga$ or large enough $Bo$, bubbles consistently migrate away from the wall. Conversely, for large enough $Ga$ and low enough $Bo$, they perform periodic near-wall bounces. At intermediate $Ga$ and $Bo$, they are first attracted to the wall down to a certain critical distance, and then perform bounces with a decreasing amplitude before stabilizing at this critical separation. Periodic bounces are accompanied by the shedding of a pair of streamwise vortices in the wake, the formation of which is governed by the near-wall shear resulting from the no-slip condition. These vortices provide a repulsive force that overcomes the viscous resistance of the fluid to the departing motion, making the bubble capable of returning to the region where it is attracted again to the wall. Although periodic, the shedding/regeneration cycle of these vortices is highly asymmetric with respect to the lateral bubble displacements, vortices being shed when the gap left between the bubble and the wall reaches its maximum, and reborn only when this gap comes back to its minimum.</description>

      <title>Unraveling friction forces of droplets on non-wetting surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the friction forces encountered by droplets on non-wetting surfaces, specifically focusing on superhydrophobic and superheated substrates. Employing a combination of experimental techniques, including inclined plane tests and cantilever force sensor measurements, we quantify friction forces across a broad range of velocities and surface types. Our results demonstrate that friction forces vary significantly with changes in droplet velocity and surface characteristics, transitioning from contact line pinning to viscous dissipation in the bulk of the droplet. We propose a universal scaling law that accounts for contact angle hysteresis, viscous dissipation, and aerodynamic drag, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding droplet dynamics on non-wetting surfaces. These findings offer valuable insights for optimizing surface designs in fluid transport and microfluidic applications, paving the way for enhanced efficiency and innovation in these technologies.</description>

      <title>A fully-implicit solving approach to an adaptive multi-scale model -- coupling a vertical-equilibrium and full-dimensional model for compressible, multi-phase flow in porous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertical equilibrium models have proven to be well suited for simulating fluid flow in subsurface porous media such as saline aquifers with caprocks. However, in most cases the dimensionally reduced model lacks the accuracy to capture the dynamics of a system. While conventional full-dimensional models have the ability to represent dynamics, they come at the cost of high computational effort. We aim to combine the efficiency of the vertical equilibrium model and the accuracy of the full-dimensional model by coupling the two models adaptively in a unified framework and solving the emerging system of equations in a monolithic, fully-implicit approach. The model domains are coupled via mass-conserving fluxes while the model adaptivity is ruled by adaption criteria. Overall, the adaptive model shows an excellent behaviour both in terms of accuracy as well as efficiency, especially for elongated geometries of storage systems with large aspect ratios.</description>

      <title>Velocity of viscous fingers in miscible displacement: Intermediate concentration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate one-phase flow in porous medium corresponding to a miscible displacement process in which the viscosity of the injected fluid is smaller than the viscosity in the reservoir fluid, which frequently leads to the formation of a mixing zone characterized by thin fingers. The mixing zone grows in time due to the difference in speed between its leading and trailing edges. The transverse flow equilibrium (TFE) model provides estimates of these speeds. We propose an enhancement for the TFE estimates, and provide its theoretical justification. It is based on the assumption that an intermediate concentration exists near the tip of the finger, which allows to reduce the integration interval in the speed estimate. Numerical simulations were conducted that corroborate the new estimates within the computational fluid dynamics model. The refined estimates offer greater accuracy than those provided by the original TFE model.</description>

      <title>Micromechanical Origin of Heat Transfer to Granular Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat transfer to a granular flow is comprised of two resistances in series: near the wall and within the bulk particle bed, neither of which is well understood due to the lack of experimental probes to separate their respective contribution. Here, we use a frequency modulated photothermal technique to separately quantify the thermal resistances in the near-wall and the bulk bed regions of particles in flowing states. Compared to the stationary state, the flowing leads to a higher near-wall resistance and a lower thermal conductivity of bulk beds. Coupled with discrete element method simulation, we show that the near-wall resistance can be explained by particle diffusion in granular flows.</description>

      <title>Drops of volatile binary mixtures on brush-covered substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a mesoscopic hydrodynamic model for drops of binary mixtures of volatile partially wetting liquids on brush-covered substrates, i.e., we model the coupled dynamics of spreading, evaporation, imbibition, diffusion and partial demixing of the two volatile components across the three phases - brush, drop and gas. The formulation of the model as gradient dynamics on an underlying free energy functional allows us to systematically account for cross-couplings between the six scalar fields needed to describe the dynamics of both components within each of the three phases. The energy accounts for concentration- and brush state-dependent capillarity and wettability, miscibility of the two components within drop and brush, and entropy in the gas. Finally, the usage of the model is illustrated by employing numerical time simulations to study the dynamics of a sessile drop.</description>
