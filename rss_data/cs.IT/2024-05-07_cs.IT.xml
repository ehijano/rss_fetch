      <title>A geometric framework for interstellar discourse on fundamental physical structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the possibility that abstract thinking and advanced synthesis skills might encourage extraterrestrial civilizations to accept communication with mankind on Earth. For this purpose, a notation not relying upon the use of alphabet and numbers is proposed, in order to denote just some basic geometric structures of current physical theories: vector fields, one-form fields, and tensor fields of arbitrary order. An advanced civilization might appreciate the way here proposed to achieve a concise description of electromagnetism and general relativity, and hence it might accept the challenge of responding to our signals. The abstract symbols introduced in this paper to describe the basic structures of physical theories are encoded into black and white bitmap images that can be easily converted into short bit sequences and modulated on a carrier wave for radio transmission.</description>

      <title>A SER-based Device Selection Mechanism in Multi-bits Quantization Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quality of wireless communication will directly affect the performance of federated learning (FL), so this paper analyze the influence of wireless communication on FL through symbol error rate (SER). In FL system, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can be used as the basic communication framework to reduce the communication congestion and interference caused by multiple users, which takes advantage of the superposition characteristics of wireless channels. The Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE) based serial interference cancellation (SIC) technology is used to recover the gradient of each terminal node one by one at the receiving end. In this paper, the gradient parameters are quantized into multiple bits to retain more gradient information to the maximum extent and to improve the tolerance of transmission errors. On this basis, we designed the SER-based device selection mechanism (SER-DSM) to ensure that the learning performance is not affected by users with bad communication conditions, while accommodating as many users as possible to participate in the learning process, which is inclusive to a certain extent. The experiments show the influence of multi-bit quantization of gradient on FL and the necessity and superiority of the proposed SER-based device selection mechanism.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Semantic Token Selection for AI-native Goal-oriented Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel design for AI-native goal-oriented communications, exploiting transformer neural networks under dynamic inference constraints on bandwidth and computation. Transformers have become the standard architecture for pretraining large-scale vision and text models, and preliminary results have shown promising performance also in deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC). Here, we consider a dynamic model where communication happens over a channel with variable latency and bandwidth constraints. Leveraging recent works on conditional computation, we exploit the structure of the transformer blocks and the multihead attention operator to design a trainable semantic token selection mechanism that learns to select relevant tokens (e.g., image patches) from the input signal. This is done dynamically, on a per-input basis, with a rate that can be chosen as an additional input by the user. We show that our model improves over state-of-the-art token selection mechanisms, exhibiting high accuracy for a wide range of latency and bandwidth constraints, without the need for deploying multiple architectures tailored to each constraint. Last, but not least, the proposed token selection mechanism helps extract powerful semantics that are easy to understand and explain, paving the way for interpretable-by-design models for the next generation of AI-native communication systems.</description>

      <title>sDAC -- Semantic Digital Analog Converter for Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel semantic digital analog converter (sDAC) for the compatibility of semantic communications and digital communications. Most of the current semantic communication systems are based on the analog modulations, ignoring their incorporation with digital communication systems, which are more common in practice. In fact, quantization methods in traditional communication systems are not appropriate for use in the era of semantic communication as these methods do not consider the semantic information inside symbols. In this case, any bit flip caused by channel noise can lead to a great performance drop. To address this challenge, sDAC is proposed. It is a simple yet efficient and generative module used to realize digital and analog bi-directional conversion. On the transmitter side, continuous values from the encoder are converted to binary bits and then can be modulated by any existing methods. After transmitting through the noisy channel, these bits get demodulated by paired methods and converted back to continuous values for further semantic decoding. The whole progress does not depend on any specific semantic model, modulation methods, or channel conditions. In the experiment section, the performance of sDAC is tested across different semantic models, semantic tasks, modulation methods, channel conditions and quantization orders. Test results show that the proposed sDAC has great generative properties and channel robustness.</description>

      <title>Maximal Guesswork Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the study of information leakage through \emph{guesswork}, the minimum expected number of guesses required to guess a random variable. In particular, we define \emph{maximal guesswork leakage} as the multiplicative decrease, upon observing $Y$, of the guesswork of a randomized function of $X$, maximized over all such randomized functions. We also study a pointwise form of the leakage which captures the leakage due to the release of a single realization of $Y$. We also study these two notions of leakage with oblivious (or memoryless) guessing. We obtain closed-form expressions for all these leakage measures, with the exception of one. Specifically, we are able to obtain closed-form expression for maximal guesswork leakage for the binary erasure source only; deriving expressions for arbitrary sources appears challenging. Some of the consequences of our results are -- a connection between guesswork and differential privacy and a new operational interpretation to maximal $\alpha$-leakage in terms of guesswork.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of PAC Decoding with Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By concatenating a polar transform with a convolutional transform, polarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes can reach the dispersion approximation bound in certain rate cases. However, the sequential decoding nature of traditional PAC decoding algorithms results in high decoding latency. Due to the parallel computing capability, deep neural network (DNN) decoders have emerged as a promising solution. In this paper, we propose three types of DNN decoders for PAC codes: multi-layer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN). The performance of these DNN decoders is evaluated through extensive simulation. Numerical results show that the MLP decoder has the best error-correction performance under a similar model parameter number.</description>

      <title>Interleave Frequency Division Multiplexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we study interleave frequency division multiplexing (IFDM) for multicarrier modulation in static multipath and mobile time-varying channels, which outperforms orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) by considering practical advanced detectors. The fundamental principle underlying existing modulation techniques is to establish sparse equivalent channel matrices in order to facilitate the design of low-complexity detection algorithms for signal recovery, making a trade-off between performance and implementation complexity. In contrast, the proposed IFDM establishes an equivalent fully dense and right-unitarily invariant channel matrix with the goal of achieving channel capacity, ensuring that the signals undergo sufficient statistical channel fading. Meanwhile, a low-complexity and replica maximum a posteriori (MAP)-optimal cross-domain memory approximate message passing (CD-MAMP) detector is proposed for IFDM by exploiting the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the unitary invariance in interleave-frequency-domain channel. Numerical results show that IFDM with extremely low-complexity CD-MAMP outperforms OFDM, OTFS, and AFDM with state-of-the-art orthogonal approximate message passing detectors, particularly at low velocities.</description>

      <title>Fast Online Movement Optimization of Aerial Base Stations Based on Global Connectivity Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can serve as aerial base stations (ABSs) to provide wireless connectivity for ground users (GUs) in diverse scenarios. However, it is an NP-hard problem with exponential complexity in $M$ and $N$, in order to maximize the coverage rate (CR) of $M$ GUs by jointly placing $N$ ABSs with limited coverage range. This problem becomes even more intricate when the coverage range becomes irregular due to site-specific obstructions (e.g., buildings) on the air-ground channel, and/or when the GUs are in motion. To address the above challenges, we study a multi-ABS movement optimization problem to maximize the average coverage rate of mobile GUs within a site-specific environment. We tackle this challenging problem by 1) constructing the global connectivity map (GCM) which contains the connectivity information between given pairs of ABS/GU locations; 2) partitioning the ABS movement problem into ABS placement sub-problems and formulate each sub-problem into a binary integer linear programing (BILP) problem based on GCM; 3) proposing a fast online algorithm to execute (one-pass) projected stochastic subgradient descent within the dual space to rapidly solve the BILP problem with near-optimal performance. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves a high CR performance close to that obtained by the open source solver (SCIP), yet with significantly reduced running time. In addition, the algorithm also notably outperforms one of the state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods and the K-means initiated evolutionary algorithm in terms of CR performance and/or time efficiency.</description>

      <title>AFDM Channel Estimation in Multi-Scale Multi-Lag Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) is a brand new chirp-based multi-carrier (MC) waveform for high mobility communications, with promising advantages over Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) and other MC waveforms. Existing AFDM research focuses on wireless communication at high carrier frequency (CF), which typically considers only Doppler frequency shift (DFS) as a result of mobility, while ignoring the accompanied Doppler time scaling (DTS) on waveform. However, for underwater acoustic (UWA) communication at much lower CF and propagating at speed of sound, the DTS effect could not be ignored and poses significant challenges for channel estimation. This paper analyzes the channel frequency response (CFR) of AFDM under multi-scale multi-lag (MSML) channels, where each propagating path could have different delay and DFS/DTS. Based on the newly derived input-output formula and its characteristics, two new channel estimation methods are proposed, i.e., AFDM with iterative multi-index (AFDM-IMI) estimation under low to moderate DTS, and AFDM with orthogonal matching pursuit (AFDM-OMP) estimation under high DTS. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods against the original AFDM channel estimation method. Moreover, the resulted AFDM system outperforms OFDM as well as Orthogonal Chirp Division Multiplexing (OCDM) in terms of channel estimation accuracy and bit error rate (BER), which is consistent with our theoretical analysis based on CFR overlap probability (COP), mutual incoherent property (MIP) and channel diversity gain under MSML channels.</description>

      <title>Spider RIS: Mobilizing Intelligent Surfaces for Enhanced Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce Spider RIS technology, which offers an innovative solution to the challenges encountered in movable antennas (MAs) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication systems. By combining the dynamic adaptation capability of MAs and the flexible location advantages of UAVs, this technology offers a dynamic and movable RIS, which can flexibly optimize physical locations within the two-dimensional movement platform. Spider RIS aims to enhance the communication efficiency and reliability of wireless networks, particularly in obstructive environments, by elevating the signal quality and achievable rate. The motivation of Spider RIS is based on the ability to fully exploit the spatial variability of wireless channels and maximize channel capacity even with a limited number of reflecting elements by overcoming the limitations of traditional fixed RIS and energy-intensive UAV systems. Considering the geometry-based millimeter wave channel model, we present the design of a three-stage angular-based hybrid beamforming system empowered by Spider RIS: First, analog beamformers are designed using angular information, followed by the generation of digital precoder/combiner based on the effective channel observed from baseband stage. Subsequently, the joint dynamic positioning with phase shift design of the Spider RIS is optimized using particle swarm optimization, maximizing the achievable rate of the systems.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Multi-Access Coded Caching with Multiple Transmit Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a multi-antenna coded caching problem in a two-dimensional multi-access network, where a server with $L$ transmit antennas and $N$ files communicates to $K_1K_2$ users, each with a single receive antenna, through a wireless broadcast link. The network consists of $K_1K_2$ cache nodes and $K_1K_2$ users. The cache nodes, each with capacity $M$, are placed on a rectangular grid with $K_1$ rows and $K_2$ columns, and the users are placed regularly on the square grid such that a user can access $r^2$ neighbouring caches in a cyclic wrap-around fashion. For a given cache memory $M$, the goal of the coded caching problem is to serve the user demands with a minimum delivery time. We propose a solution for the aforementioned coded caching problem by designing two arrays: a caching array and a delivery array. Further, we present two classes of caching and delivery arrays and obtain corresponding multi-access coded caching schemes. The first scheme achieves a normalized delivery time (NDT) $\frac{K_1K_2(1-r^2\frac{M}{N})}{L+K_1K_2\frac{M}{N}}$. The second scheme achieves an NDT $\frac{K_1K_2(1-r^2\frac{M}{N})}{L+K_1K_2r^2\frac{M}{N}}$ when $M/N=1/K_1K_2$ and $L=K_1K_2-r^2$, which is optimal under uncoded placement and one-shot delivery.</description>

      <title>Placement Delivery Arrays for Coded Caching with Shared and Private Caches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a coded caching network consisting of a server with a library of $N$ files connected to $K$ users, where each user is equipped with a dedicated cache of size $M_p$ units. In addition to that, the network consists of $\Lambda\leq K$ helper caches, each with a size $M_h$ units. Each helper cache can serve an arbitrary number of users; however, each user can access only a single helper cache. Also, we assume that the server knows the user-to-helper cache association, defined as the sets of users connected to each helper cache, during the cache placement phase. We propose a solution for the aforementioned coded caching problem by introducing a combinatorial structure called a Shared and Private Placement Delivery Array (SP-PDA). These SP-PDAs describe the helper cache placement, private cache placement, and the server transmissions in a single array. Further, we propose a novel construction of SP-PDAs using two Placement Delivery Arrays (PDAs). Interestingly, we observe that the permutations of the columns of the two chosen PDAs result in SP-PDAs with different performances. Moreover, we characterize the conditions for selecting the best column permutations of the chosen PDAs. Furthermore, the coded caching schemes resulting from SP-PDAs subsume two existing coded caching schemes as special cases. Additionally, SP-PDAs enable the construction of coded caching schemes with much smaller subpacketization numbers -subpacketization number is defined as the number of subfiles to which a file is divided- compared to the existing schemes, without paying much in terms of rate (the size of the transmission in the delivery phase).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a communication system where a source sends time-sensitive information to its destination via queues in tandem. We assume that the arrival process as well as the service process (of each server) are memoryless, and each of the servers has no buffer. For this setup, we develop a recursive framework to characterize the mean peak age of information (PAoI) under preemptive and non-preemptive policies with $N$ servers having different service rates. For the preemptive case, the proposed framework also allows to obtain mean age of information (AoI).</description>

      <title>Set Transformation: Trade-off Between Repair Bandwidth and Sub-packetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum distance separable (MDS) codes facilitate the achievement of elevated levels of fault tolerance in storage systems while incurring minimal redundancy overhead. Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are typical MDS codes with the sub-packetization level being one, however, they require large repair bandwidth defined as the total amount of symbols downloaded from other surviving nodes during single-node failure/repair. In this paper, we present the {\em set transformation}, which can transform any MDS code into set transformed code such that (i) the sub-packetization level is flexible and ranges from 2 to $(n-k)^{\lfloor\frac{n}{n-k}\rfloor}$ in which $n$ is the number of nodes and $k$ is the number of data nodes, (ii) the new code is MDS code, (iii) the new code has lower repair bandwidth for any single-node failure. We show that our set transformed codes have both lower repair bandwidth and lower field size than the existing related MDS array codes, such as elastic transformed codes \cite{10228984}. Specifically, our set transformed codes have $2\%-6.6\%$ repair bandwidth reduction compared with elastic transformed codes \cite{10228984} for the evaluated typical parameters.</description>

      <title>Site-Specific Deployment Optimization of Intelligent Reflecting Surface for Coverage Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) is a promising technology for next generation wireless networks. Despite substantial research in IRS-aided communications, the assumed antenna and channel models are typically simplified without considering site-specific characteristics, which in turn critically affect the IRS deployment and performance in a given environment. In this paper, we first investigate the link-level performance of active or passive IRS taking into account the IRS element radiation pattern (ERP) as well as the antenna radiation pattern of the access point (AP). Then the network-level coverage performance is evaluated/optimized in site-specific multi-building scenarios, by properly deploying multiple IRSs on candidate building facets to serve a given set of users or Points of Interests (PoIs). The problem is reduced to an integer linear programming (ILP) based on given link-level metrics, which is then solved efficiently under moderate network sizes. Numerical results confirm the impact of AP antenna/IRS element pattern on the link-level performance. In addition, it is found that active IRSs, though associated with higher hardware complexity and cost, significantly improve the site-specific network coverage performance in terms of average ergodic rate and fairness among the PoIs as well as the range of serving area, compared with passive IRSs that have a much larger number of elements.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Massive MIMO: Precoding Design and Channel Estimation in the Electromagnetic Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable massive multiple-input multiple-output (RmMIMO) technology offers increased flexibility for future communication systems by exploiting previously untapped degrees of freedom in the electromagnetic (EM) domain. The representation of the traditional spatial domain channel state information (sCSI) limits the insights into the potential of EM domain channel properties, constraining the base station's (BS) utmost capability for precoding design. This paper leverages the EM domain channel state information (eCSI) for radiation pattern design at the BS. We develop an orthogonal decomposition method based on spherical harmonic functions to decompose the radiation pattern into a linear combination of orthogonal bases. By formulating the radiation pattern design as an optimization problem for the projection coefficients over these bases, we develop a manifold optimization-based method for iterative radiation pattern and digital precoder design. To address the eCSI estimation problem, we capitalize on the inherent structure of the channel. Specifically, we propose a subspace-based scheme to reduce the pilot overhead for wideband sCSI estimation. Given the estimated full-band sCSI, we further employ parameterized methods for angle of arrival estimation. Subsequently, the complete eCSI can be reconstructed after estimating the equivalent channel gain via the least squares method. Simulation results demonstrate that, in comparison to traditional mMIMO systems with fixed antenna radiation patterns, the proposed RmMIMO architecture offers significant throughput gains for multi-user transmission at a low channel estimation overhead.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-weight linear codes are linear codes in which any nonzero codeword can have only two possible distinct weights. Those in the Hamming metric have proven to be very interesting for their connections with authentication codes, association schemes, strongly regular graphs, and secret sharing schemes. In this paper, we characterize two-weight codes in the rank metric, answering a recent question posed by Pratihar and Randrianarisoa.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We devise achievable encoding schemes for distributed source compression for computing inner products, symmetric matrix products, and more generally, square matrix products, which are a class of nonlinear transformations. To that end, our approach relies on devising nonlinear mappings of distributed sources, which are then followed by the structured linear encoding scheme, introduced by K\"orner and Marton. For different computation scenarios, we contrast our findings on the achievable sum rate with the state of the art to demonstrate the possible savings in compression rate. When the sources have special correlation structures, it is possible to achieve unbounded gains, as demonstrated by the analysis and numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the multi-node failure repair challenges for MDS array codes. Presently, two primary models are employed for multi-node repairs: the centralized model where all failed nodes are restored in a singular data center, and the cooperative model where failed nodes acquire data from auxiliary nodes and collaborate amongst themselves for the repair process.This paper focuses on the cooperative model, and we provide explicit constructions of optimal MDS array codes with $d$ helper nodes under this model. The sub-packetization level of our new codes is $(d-k+h)(d-k+1)^{\lceil n/2 \rceil}$ where $h$ is the number of failed nodes, $k$ the number of information nodes and $n$ the code length. This improves upon recent constructions given by Liu \emph{et al.} (IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, Vol. 69, 2023).</description>

      <title>Optimal Sampling for Uncertainty-of-Information Minimization in a Remote Monitoring System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a remote monitoring system where a receiver observes a remote binary Markov source and decides whether to sample and fetch the source's state over a randomly delayed channel. Due to transmission delay, the observation of the source is imperfect, resulting in the uncertainty of the source's state at the receiver. We thus use uncertainty of information as the metric to characterize the performance of the system. Measured by Shannon's entropy, uncertainty of information reflects how much we do not know about the latest source's state in the absence of new information. The current research for uncertainty of information idealizes the transmission delay as one time slot, but not under random delay. Moreover, uncertainty of information varies with the latest observation of the source's state, making it different from other age of information related functions. Motivated by the above reasons, we formulate a uncertainty of information minimization problem under random delay. Typically, such a problem which takes actions based on the imperfect observations can be modeled as a partially observed Markov decision process. By introducing belief state, we transform this process into a semi-Markov decision process. To solve this problem, we first provide an optimal sampling policy employing a two layered bisection relative value iteration algorithm. Furthermore, we propose a sub-optimal index policy with low complexity based on the special properties of belief state. Numerical simulations illustrate that both of the proposed sampling policies outperforms two other benchmarks. Moreover, the performance of the sub-optimal policy approaches to that of the optimal policy, particularly under large delay.</description>

      <title>Optimal Signals and Detectors Based on Correlation and Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In continuation of an earlier study, we explore a Neymann-Pearson hypothesis testing scenario where, under the null hypothesis ($\cal{H}_0$), the received signal is a white noise process $N_t$, which is not Gaussian in general, and under the alternative hypothesis ($\cal{H}_1$), the received signal comprises a deterministic transmitted signal $s_t$ corrupted by additive white noise, the sum of $N_t$ and another noise process originating from the transmitter, denoted as $Z_t$, which is not necessarily Gaussian either. Our approach focuses on detectors that are based on the correlation and energy of the received signal, which are motivated by implementation simplicity. We optimize the detector parameters to achieve the best trade-off between missed-detection and false-alarm error exponents. First, we optimize the detectors for a given signal, resulting in a non-linear relation between the signal and correlator weights to be optimized. Subsequently, we optimize the transmitted signal and the detector parameters jointly, revealing that the optimal signal is a balanced ternary signal and the correlator has at most three different coefficients, thus facilitating a computationally feasible solution.</description>

      <title>Over-the-Air Majority Vote Computation with Modulation on Conjugate-Reciprocal Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new approach to compute the majority vote (MV) function based on modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (MOCZ) and introduce three different methods. The proposed methods rely on the fact that when a linear combination of polynomials is evaluated at one of the roots of a polynomial in the combination, that polynomial does contribute to the evaluation. To utilize this property, each transmitter maps the votes to the zeros of a Huffman polynomial, and the corresponding polynomial coefficients are transmitted. The receiver evaluates the polynomial constructed by the elements of the superposed sequence at conjugate-reciprocal zero pairs and detects the MV with a direct zero-testing (DiZeT) decoder. With differential and index-based encoders, we eliminate the need for power-delay information at the receiver while improving the computation error rate (CER) performance. The proposed methods do not use instantaneous channel state information at the transmitters and receiver. Thus, they provide robustness against phase and time synchronization errors. We theoretically analyze the CERs of the proposed methods. Finally, we demonstrate their efficacy in a distributed median computation scenario in a fading channel.</description>

      <title>Double Self-Sustainable Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces Aided Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A double self-sustainable reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) assisted multi-user multiple input multiple output (MIMO) system is investigated. Two RISs are equipped with energy harvesting circuit to achieve self-sustainable transmission. The aim is to minimize the transmission power at the base station (BS), while guaranteeing the quality of service (QoS) requirements of the users and meeting the power consumption requirements of the RISs. A block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm based on the penalty-based method and successive convex approximation (SCA) is employed to alternatively optimize the active beamforming at the BS and the phase shifts, as well as amplitude coefficients of two RISs. Simulation results show that the required power consumption at the BS for the proposed double self-sustainable RISs system is significantly reduced compared to conventional RIS systems.</description>

      <title>DAFT-Spread Affine Frequency Division Multiple Access for Downlink Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal AFDM access (O-AFDMA) are promising techniques based on chirp signals, which are able to suppress the performance deterioration caused by Doppler shifts in high-mobility scenarios. However, the high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in AFDM or O-AFDMA is still a crucial problem, which severely limits their practical applications. In this paper, we propose a discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT)-spread AFDMA scheme based on the properties of the AFDM systems, named DAFT-s-AFDMA to significantly reduce the PAPR by resorting to the DAFT. We formulate the transmitted time-domain signals of the proposed DAFT-s-AFDMA schemes with localized and interleaved chirp subcarrier allocation strategies. Accordingly, we derive the guidelines for setting the DAFT parameters, revealing the insights of PAPR reduction. Finally, simulation results of PAPR comparison in terms of the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) show that the proposed DAFT-s-AFDMA schemes with localized and interleaved strategies can both attain better PAPR performances than the conventional O-AFDMA scheme.</description>

      <title>MambaJSCC: Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding with Visual State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lightweight and efficient deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) is a key technology for semantic communications. In this paper, we design a novel JSCC scheme named MambaJSCC, which utilizes a visual state space model with channel adaptation (VSSM-CA) block as its backbone for transmitting images over wireless channels. The VSSM-CA block utilizes VSSM to integrate two-dimensional images with the state space, enabling feature extraction and encoding processes to operate with linear complexity. It also incorporates channel state information (CSI) via a newly proposed CSI embedding method. This method deploys a shared CSI encoding module within both the encoder and decoder to encode and inject the CSI into each VSSM-CA block, improving the adaptability of a single model to varying channel conditions. Experimental results show that MambaJSCC not only outperforms Swin Transformer based JSCC (SwinJSCC) but also significantly reduces parameter size, computational overhead, and inference delay (ID). For example, with employing an equal number of the VSSM-CA blocks and the Swin Transformer blocks, MambaJSCC achieves a 0.48 dB gain in peak-signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) over SwinJSCC while requiring only 53.3% multiply-accumulate operations, 53.8% of the parameters, and 44.9% of ID.</description>

      <title>WDMoE: Wireless Distributed Large Language Models with Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success in various natural language processing tasks, but how wireless communications can support LLMs has not been extensively studied. In this paper, we propose a wireless distributed LLMs paradigm based on Mixture of Experts (MoE), named WDMoE, deploying LLMs collaboratively across edge servers of base station (BS) and mobile devices in the wireless communications system. Specifically, we decompose the MoE layer in LLMs by deploying the gating network and the preceding neural network layer at BS, while distributing the expert networks across the devices. This arrangement leverages the parallel capabilities of expert networks on distributed devices. Moreover, to overcome the instability of wireless communications, we design an expert selection policy by taking into account both the performance of the model and the end-to-end latency, which includes both transmission delay and inference delay. Evaluations conducted across various LLMs and multiple datasets demonstrate that WDMoE not only outperforms existing models, such as Llama 2 with 70 billion parameters, but also significantly reduces end-to-end latency.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Matrix Information Geometry for Integrated Decoding of Massive Uncoupled Unsourced Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore an efficient uncoupled unsourced random access (UURA) scheme for 6G massive communication. UURA is a typical framework of unsourced random access that addresses the problems of codeword detection and message stitching, without the use of check bits. Firstly, we establish a framework for UURA, allowing for immediate decoding of sub-messages upon arrival. Thus, the processing delay is effectively reduced due to the decreasing waiting time. Next, we propose an integrated decoding algorithm for sub-messages by leveraging matrix information geometry (MIG) theory. Specifically, MIG is applied to measure the feature similarities of codewords belonging to the same user equipment, and thus sub-message can be stitched once it is received. This enables the timely recovery of a portion of the original message by simultaneously detecting and stitching codewords within the current sub-slot. Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the proposed integrated decoding-based UURA scheme in terms of computational complexity and convergence rate. Finally, we present extensive simulation results to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in 6G wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Design and Analysis of Massive Uncoupled Unsourced Random Access with Bayesian Joint Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate unsourced random access for massive machine-type communications (mMTC) in the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. Firstly, we establish a high-efficiency uncoupled framework for massive unsourced random access without extra parity check bits. Then, we design a low-complexity Bayesian joint decoding algorithm, including codeword detection and stitching. In particular, we present a Bayesian codeword detection approach by exploiting Bayes-optimal divergence-free orthogonal approximate message passing in the case of unknown priors. The output long-term channel statistic information is well leveraged to stitch codewords for recovering the original message. Thus, the spectral efficiency is improved by avoiding the use of parity bits. Moreover, we analyze the performance of the proposed Bayesian joint decoding-based massive uncoupled unsourced random access scheme in terms of computational complexity and error probability of decoding. Furthermore, by asymptotic analysis, we obtain some useful insights for the design of massive unsourced random access. Finally, extensive simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in 6G wireless networks.</description>

      <title>A Universal List Decoding Algorithm with Application to Decoding of Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a guessing codeword decoding (GCD) of linear block codes. Compared with the guessing noise decoding (GND), which is only efficient for high-rate codes, the GCD is efficient for not only high-rate codes but also low-rate codes. We prove that the GCD typically requires a fewer number of queries than the GND. Compared with the ordered statistics decoding (OSD), the GCD does not require the online Gaussian elimination (GE). In addition to limiting the maximum number of searches, we suggest limiting the radius of searches in terms of soft weights or tolerated performance loss to further reduce the decoding complexity, resulting in the so-called truncated GCD. The performance gap between the truncated GCD and the optimal decoding can be upper bounded approximately by the saddlepoint approach or other numerical approaches. The derived upper bound captures the relationship between the performance and the decoding parameters, enabling us to balance the performance and the complexity by optimizing the decoding parameters of the truncated GCD. We also introduce a parallel implementation of the (truncated) GCD algorithm to reduce decoding latency without compromising performance. Another contribution of this paper is the application of the GCD to the polar codes. We propose a multiple-bit-wise decoding algorithm over a pruned tree for the polar codes, referred to as the successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding algorithm by GCD. First, we present a strategy for pruning the conventional polar decoding tree based on the complexity analysis rather than the specific bit patterns. Then we apply the GCD algorithm in parallel aided by the early stopping criteria to the leaves of the pruned tree. Simulation results show that, without any performance loss as justified by analysis, the proposed decoding algorithm can significantly reduce the decoding latency of the polar codes.</description>

Abstract: Unequal error protection (UEP) codes can facilitate the transmission of messages with different protection levels. In this paper, we study the achievability bounds on UEP by the generalization of Gilbert-Varshamov (GV) bound. For the first time, we show that under certain conditions, UEP enhances the code rate comparing with time-sharing (TS) strategies asymptotically.</description>

      <title>Active RIS-Aided Massive MIMO With Imperfect CSI and Phase Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has attracted significant attention as a recently proposed RIS architecture. Owing to its capability to amplify the incident signals, active RIS can mitigate the multiplicative fading effect inherent in the passive RIS-aided system. In this paper, we consider an active RIS-aided uplink multi-user massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system in the presence of phase noise at the active RIS. Specifically, we employ a two-timescale scheme, where the beamforming at the base station (BS) is adjusted based on the instantaneous aggregated channel state information (CSI) and the statistical CSI serves as the basis for designing the phase shifts at the active RIS, so that the feedback overhead and computational complexity can be significantly reduced. The aggregated channel composed of the cascaded and direct channels is estimated by utilizing the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) technique. Based on the estimated channel, we derive the analytical closed-form expression of a lower bound of the achievable rate. The power scaling laws in the active RIS-aided system are investigated based on the theoretical expressions. When the transmit power of each user is scaled down by the number of BS antennas M or reflecting elements N, we find that the thermal noise will cause the lower bound of the achievable rate to approach zero, as the number of M or N increases to infinity. Moreover, an optimization approach based on genetic algorithms (GA) is introduced to tackle the phase shift optimization problem. Numerical results reveal that the active RIS can greatly enhance the performance of the considered system under various settings.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the 5G New Radio Two-Step Random Access towards 6G Unsourced MAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report summarizes some considerations on possible evolutions of grant-free random access in the next generation of the 3GPP wireless cellular standard. The analysis is carried out by mapping the problem to the recently-introduced unsourced multiple access channel (UMAC) setup. By doing so, the performance of existing solutions can be benchmarked with information-theoretic bounds, assessing the potential gains that can be achieved over legacy 3GPP schemes. The study focuses on the two-step random access (2SRA) protocol introduced by Release 16 of the 5G New Radio standard, investigating its applicability to support large MTC / IoT terminal populations in a grant-free fashion. The analysis shows that the existing 2SRA scheme may not succeed in providing energy-efficient support to large user populations. Modifications to the protocol are proposed that enable remarkable gains in both energy and spectral efficiency while retaining a strong resemblance to the legacy protocol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication, an emerging feature for future networks like 6G, emphasizes message meaning. Yet, the open nature of a wireless channel poses security risks for semantic communications. In this paper we derive information-theoretic limits, considering the semantic source model within a wiretap channel framework. Under separate equivocation and distortion conditions for semantics and observed data, we present the general outer and inner bounds of the region. We also reduce the general region to a case of Gaussian source and channel and provide numerical evaluation.</description>

      <title>State-Aware Timeliness in Energy Harvesting IoT Systems Monitoring a Markovian Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the optimal transmission policies within an energy harvesting status update system, where the demand for status updates depends on the state of the source. The system monitors a two-state Markovian source that characterizes a stochastic process, which can be in either a normal state or an alarm state, with a higher demand for fresh updates when the source is in the alarm state. We propose a metric to capture the freshness of status updates for each state of the stochastic process by introducing two Age of Information (AoI) variables, extending the definition of AoI to account for the state changes of the stochastic process. We formulate the problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), utilizing a transition cost function that applies linear and non-linear penalties based on AoI and the state of the stochastic process. Through analytical investigation, we delve into the structure of the optimal transmission policy for the resulting MDP problem. Furthermore, we evaluate the derived policies via numerical results and demonstrate their effectiveness in reserving energy in anticipation of forthcoming alarm states.</description>

      <title>Cosine Annealing Optimized Denoising Diffusion Error Correction Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address the issue of increased bit error rates during the later stages of linear search in denoising diffusion error correction codes, we propose a novel method that optimizes denoising diffusion error correction codes (ECC) using cosine annealing. In response to the challenge of decoding long codewords, the proposed method employs a variance adjustment strategy during the reverse diffusion process, rather than maintaining a constant variance. By leveraging cosine annealing, this method effectively lowers the bit error rate and enhances decoding effciency. This letter extensively validates the approach through experiments and demonstrates signifcant improvements in bit error rate reduction and iteration effciency compared to existing methods. This advancement offers a promising solution for improving ECC decoding performance, potentially impacting secure digital communication practices.</description>

      <title>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)-Native Wireless Systems: A Journey Beyond 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02336v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building future wireless systems that support services like digital twins (DTs) is challenging to achieve through advances to conventional technologies like meta-surfaces. While artificial intelligence (AI)-native networks promise to overcome some limitations of wireless technologies, developments still rely on AI tools like neural networks. Such tools struggle to cope with the non-trivial challenges of the network environment and the growing demands of emerging use cases. In this paper, we revisit the concept of AI-native wireless systems, equipping them with the common sense necessary to transform them into artificial general intelligence (AGI)-native systems. These systems acquire common sense by exploiting different cognitive abilities such as perception, analogy, and reasoning, that enable them to generalize and deal with unforeseen scenarios. Towards developing the components of such a system, we start by showing how the perception module can be built through abstracting real-world elements into generalizable representations. These representations are then used to create a world model, founded on principles of causality and hyper-dimensional (HD) computing, that aligns with intuitive physics and enables analogical reasoning, that define common sense. Then, we explain how methods such as integrated information theory play a role in the proposed intent-driven and objective-driven planning methods that maneuver the AGI-native network to take actions. Next, we discuss how an AGI-native network can enable use cases related to human and autonomous agents: a) analogical reasoning for next-generation DTs, b) synchronized and resilient experiences for cognitive avatars, and c) brain-level metaverse experiences like holographic teleportation. Finally, we conclude with a set of recommendations to build AGI-native systems. Ultimately, we envision this paper as a roadmap for the beyond 6G era.</description>

      <title>Astro-NER -- Astronomy Named Entity Recognition: Is GPT a Good Domain Expert Annotator?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we address one of the challenges of developing NER models for scholarly domains, namely the scarcity of suitable labeled data. We experiment with an approach using predictions from a fine-tuned LLM model to aid non-domain experts in annotating scientific entities within astronomy literature, with the goal of uncovering whether such a collaborative process can approximate domain expertise. Our results reveal moderate agreement between a domain expert and the LLM-assisted non-experts, as well as fair agreement between the domain expert and the LLM model's predictions. In an additional experiment, we compare the performance of finetuned and default LLMs on this task. We have also introduced a specialized scientific entity annotation scheme for astronomy, validated by a domain expert. Our approach adopts a scholarly research contribution-centric perspective, focusing exclusively on scientific entities relevant to the research theme. The resultant dataset, containing 5,000 annotated astronomy article titles, is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS: Pulse Shaping and the Tradeoff between Time/Bandwidth Expansion and Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Zak-OTFS input/output (I/O) relation is predictable and non-fading when the delay and Doppler periods are greater than the effective channel delay and Doppler spreads, a condition which we refer to as the crystallization condition. When the crystallization condition is satisfied, we describe how to integrate sensing and communication within a single Zak-OTFS subframe by transmitting a pilot in the center of the subframe and surrounding the pilot with a pilot region and guard band to mitigate interference between data symbols and pilot. At the receiver we first read off the effective channel taps within the pilot region, and then use the estimated channel taps to recover the data from the symbols received outside the pilot region. We introduce a framework for filter design in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain where the symplectic Fourier transform connects aliasing in the DD domain (predictability of the I/O relation) with time/bandwidth expansion. The choice of pulse shaping filter determines the fraction of pilot energy that lies outside the pilot region and the degradation in BER performance that results from the interference to data symbols. We demonstrate that Gaussian filters in the DD domain provide significant improvements in BER performance over the sinc and root raised cosine filters considered in previous work. We also demonstrate that, by limiting DD domain aliasing, Gaussian filters extend the region where the crystallization condition is satisfied. The Gaussian filters considered in this paper are a particular case of factorizable pulse shaping filters in the DD domain, and this family of filters may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Stability of a Generalized Debiased Lasso with Applications to Resampling-Based Variable Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03063v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose that we first apply the Lasso to a design matrix, and then update one of its columns. In general, the signs of the Lasso coefficients may change, and there is no closed-form expression for updating the Lasso solution exactly. In this work, we propose an approximate formula for updating a debiased Lasso coefficient. We provide general nonasymptotic error bounds in terms of the norms and correlations of a given design matrix's columns, and then prove asymptotic convergence results for the case of a random design matrix with i.i.d.\ sub-Gaussian row vectors and i.i.d.\ Gaussian noise. Notably, the approximate formula is asymptotically correct for most coordinates in the proportional growth regime, under the mild assumption that each row of the design matrix is sub-Gaussian with a covariance matrix having a bounded condition number. Our proof only requires certain concentration and anti-concentration properties to control various error terms and the number of sign changes. In contrast, rigorously establishing distributional limit properties (e.g.\ Gaussian limits for the debiased Lasso) under similarly general assumptions has been considered open problem in the universality theory. As applications, we show that the approximate formula allows us to reduce the computation complexity of variable selection algorithms that require solving multiple Lasso problems, such as the conditional randomization test and a variant of the knockoff filter.</description>

      <title>Active Sensing for Multiuser Beam Tracking with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03129v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a beam tracking problem in which an access point (AP), in collaboration with a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), dynamically adjusts its downlink beamformers and the reflection pattern at the RIS in order to maintain reliable communications with multiple mobile user equipments (UEs). Specifically, the mobile UEs send uplink pilots to the AP periodically during the channel sensing intervals, the AP then adaptively configures the beamformers and the RIS reflection coefficients for subsequent data transmission based on the received pilots. This is an active sensing problem, because channel sensing involves configuring the RIS coefficients during the pilot stage and the optimal sensing strategy should exploit the trajectory of channel state information (CSI) from previously received pilots. Analytical solution to such an active sensing problem is very challenging. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework utilizing a recurrent neural network (RNN) to automatically summarize the time-varying CSI obtained from the periodically received pilots into state vectors. These state vectors are then mapped to the AP beamformers and RIS reflection coefficients for subsequent downlink data transmissions, as well as the RIS reflection coefficients for the next round of uplink channel sensing. The mappings from the state vectors to the downlink beamformers and the RIS reflection coefficients for both channel sensing and downlink data transmission are performed using graph neural networks (GNNs) to account for the interference among the UEs. Simulations demonstrate significant and interpretable performance improvement of the proposed approach over the existing data-driven methods with nonadaptive channel sensing schemes.</description>

In this paper, we show non-existence of perfect $2-$error correcting codes over $q-$ary alphabets for more than 170 new values of $q$. Our methods rely on techniques from the resolution of generalised Ramanujan--Nagell equations and from computational number theory.</description>

      <title>A Rate-Distortion-Classification Approach for Lossy Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In lossy image compression, the objective is to achieve minimal signal distortion while compressing images to a specified bit rate. The increasing demand for visual analysis applications, particularly in classification tasks, has emphasized the significance of considering semantic distortion in compressed images. To bridge the gap between image compression and visual analysis, we propose a Rate-Distortion-Classification (RDC) model for lossy image compression, offering a unified framework to optimize the trade-off between rate, distortion, and classification accuracy. The RDC model is extensively analyzed both statistically on a multi-distribution source and experimentally on the widely used MNIST dataset. The findings reveal that the RDC model exhibits desirable properties, including monotonic non-increasing and convex functions, under certain conditions. This work provides insights into the development of human-machine friendly compression methods and Video Coding for Machine (VCM) approaches, paving the way for end-to-end image compression techniques in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Channel Estimation in Quantized Systems with a Generative Prior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel estimation in quantized systems is challenging, particularly in low-resolution systems. In this work, we propose to leverage a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) as generative prior, capturing the channel distribution of the propagation environment, to enhance a classical estimation technique based on the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for one-bit quantization. Thereby, a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the most responsible mixture component is inferred for a quantized received signal, which is subsequently utilized in the EM algorithm as side information. Numerical results demonstrate the significant performance improvement of our proposed approach over both a simplistic Gaussian prior and current state-of-the-art channel estimators. Furthermore, the proposed estimation framework exhibits adaptability to higher resolution systems and alternative generative priors.</description>

      <title>Fault Detection and Monitoring using an Information-Driven Strategy: Method, Theory, and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to detect when a system undergoes an incipient fault is of paramount importance in preventing a critical failure. In this work, we propose an information-driven fault detection method based on a novel concept drift detector. The method is tailored to identifying drifts in input-output relationships of additive noise models (i.e., model drifts) and is based on a distribution-free mutual information (MI) estimator. Our scheme does not require prior faulty examples and can be applied distribution-free over a large class of system models. Our core contributions are twofold. First, we demonstrate the connection between fault detection, model drift detection, and testing independence between two random variables. Second, we prove several theoretical properties of the proposed MI-based fault detection scheme: (i) strong consistency, (ii) exponentially fast detection of the non-faulty case, and (iii) control of both significance levels and power of the test. To conclude, we validate our theory with synthetic data and the benchmark dataset N-CMAPSS of aircraft turbofan engines. These empirical results support the usefulness of our methodology in many practical and realistic settings, and the theoretical results show performance guarantees that other methods cannot offer.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider the separate coding problem for $L+1$ correlated Gaussian memoryless sources. We deal with the case where $L$ separately encoded data of sources work as side information at the decoder for the reconstruction of the remaining source. The determination problem of the rate distortion region for this system is the so called many-help-one problem and has been known as a highly challenging problem. The author determined the rate distortion region in the case where the $L$ sources working as partial side information are conditionally independent if the remaining source we wish to reconstruct is given. This condition on the correlation is called the CI condition. In this paper we extend the author's previous result to the case where $L+1$ sources satisfy a kind of tree structure on their correlation. We call this tree structure of information sources the TS condition, which contains the CI condition as a special case. In this paper we derive an explicit outer bound of the rate distortion region when information sources satisfy the TS condition. We further derive an explicit sufficient condtion for this outer bound to be tight. In particular, we determine the sum rate part of the rate distortion region for the case where information sources satisfy the TS condition. For some class of Gaussian sources with the TS condition we derive an explicit recursive formula of this sum rate part.</description>

      <title>The Capacity of 3 User Linear Computation Broadcast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.10049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.10049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $K$ User Linear Computation Broadcast (LCBC) problem is comprised of $d$ dimensional data (from $\mathbb{F}_q$), that is fully available to a central server, and $K$ users, who require various linear computations of the data, and have prior knowledge of various linear functions of the data as side-information. The optimal broadcast cost is the minimum number of $q$-ary symbols to be broadcast by the server per computation instance, for every user to retrieve its desired computation. The reciprocal of the optimal broadcast cost is called the capacity. The main contribution of this paper is the exact capacity characterization for the $K=3$ user LCBC for all cases, i.e., for arbitrary finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$, arbitrary data dimension $d$, and arbitrary linear side-informations and demands at each user. A remarkable aspect of the converse is that unlike the $2$ user LCBC whose capacity was determined previously, the entropic formulation (where the entropies of demands and side-informations are specified, but not their functional forms) is insufficient to obtain a tight converse for the $3$ user LCBC. Instead, the converse exploits functional submodularity. Notable aspects of achievability include a decomposition of the users' collective signal space into subspaces that allow different degrees of efficiency in broadcast cost, revealing a tradeoff that leads to a constrained water-filling solution. Random coding arguments are invoked to resolve compatibility issues that arise as each user has a different view of these subspaces, conditioned on its own side-information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.05728v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new decomposition of transfer entropy to characterize the degree of synergy- and redundancy-dominated influence a time series has upon the interaction between other time series. We prove the existence of a class of time series, where the early past of the conditioning time series yields a synergistic effect upon the interaction, whereas the late past has a redundancy-dominated effect. In general, different parts of the past can have different effects. Our information theoretic quantities are easy to compute in practice, and we demonstrate their usage on real-world brain data.</description>

      <title>The (r, {\delta})-Locality of Repeated-Root Cyclic Codes with Prime Power Lengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Locally repairable codes (LRCs) are designed for distributed storage systems to reduce the repair bandwidth and disk I/O complexity during the storage node repair process. A code with $(r,\delta)$-locality (also called an $(r,\delta)$-LRC) can simultaneously repair up to $\delta-1$ symbols in a codeword by accessing at most $r$ other symbols in the codeword. In this paper, we propose a new method to calculate the $(r,\delta)$-locality of cyclic codes. Initially, we give a description of the algebraic structure of repeated-root cyclic codes of prime power lengths. Using this result, we derive a formula of $(r,\delta)$-locality of these cyclic codes for a wide range of $\delta$ values. Furthermore, we calculate the parameters of repeated-root cyclic codes of prime power lengths and obtain several infinite families of optimal cyclic $(r,\delta)$-LRCs, which exhibit new parameters compared with existing research on optimal $(r,\delta)$-LRCs with a cyclic structure. For the specific case of $\delta=2$, we have comprehensively identified all potential optimal cyclic $(r,2)$-LRCs of prime power lengths.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided Wireless Communication Systems: Joint Location and Passive Beamforming Design</title>

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been widely studied in recent years, it has emerged as a new technology which can reflect the incident signal by intelligently configuring the reflection elements, thus changing the signal propagation environment, enhancing the signals users desire and suppressing the interference between users. In this paper, we study an IRS aided multi-users wireless communication where the base station (BS) sends a variety of signals, each user receives desired signals. In order to guarantee the fairness of wireless communications, we need to maximize the minimum rates of users, subject to the power constraint of BS and the phase constraint of IRS. Prior works on IRS mainly consider optimizing BS beamforming and IRS passive beamforming, this paper also aims to optimize the IRS location. The considered problem is shown to be non-convex, we decompose the problem into two subproblems, transforming the two subproblems into a lower bound problem and using alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) to solve them, respectively. Finally, the two subproblems are optimized alternately to make the objective function value converge in an acceptable range. Simulation results verify the convergence results of our proposed algorithm, and the performance improvement compared with the benchmark scheme in wireless communication system.</description>

      <title>The Capacity of Classical Summation over a Quantum MAC with Arbitrarily Distributed Inputs and Entanglements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03122v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $\Sigma$-QMAC problem is introduced, involving $S$ servers, $K$ classical ($\mathbb{F}_d$) data streams, and $T$ independent quantum systems. Data stream ${\sf W}_k, k\in[K]$ is replicated at a subset of servers $\mathcal{W}(k)\subset[S]$, and quantum system $\mathcal{Q}_t, t\in[T]$ is distributed among a subset of servers $\mathcal{E}(t)\subset[S]$ such that Server $s\in\mathcal{E}(t)$ receives subsystem $\mathcal{Q}_{t,s}$ of $\mathcal{Q}_t=(\mathcal{Q}_{t,s})_{s\in\mathcal{E}(t)}$. Servers manipulate their quantum subsystems according to their data and send the subsystems to a receiver. The total download cost is $\sum_{t\in[T]}\sum_{s\in\mathcal{E}(t)}\log_d|\mathcal{Q}_{t,s}|$ qudits, where $|\mathcal{Q}|$ is the dimension of $\mathcal{Q}$. The states and measurements of $(\mathcal{Q}_t)_{t\in[T]}$ are required to be separable across $t\in[T]$ throughout, but for each $t\in[T]$, the subsystems of $\mathcal{Q}_{t}$ can be prepared initially in an arbitrary (independent of data) entangled state, manipulated arbitrarily by the respective servers, and measured jointly by the receiver. From the measurements, the receiver must recover the sum of all data streams. Rate is defined as the number of dits ($\mathbb{F}_d$ symbols) of the desired sum computed per qudit of download. The capacity of $\Sigma$-QMAC, i.e., the supremum of achievable rates is characterized for arbitrary data replication and entanglement distribution maps $\mathcal{W}, \mathcal{E}$. Coding based on the $N$-sum box abstraction is optimal in every case. Notably, for every $S\neq 3$ there exists an instance of the $\Sigma$-QMAC where $S$-party entanglement is necessary to achieve the fully entangled capacity.</description>

      <title>Cache-Aided Communications in MISO Networks with Dynamic User Behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coded caching (CC) can substantially enhance network performance by leveraging memory as an additional communication resource. However, the use of CC is challenging in various practical applications due to dynamic user behavior. The existing solutions, based on shared caching, cannot directly handle all scenarios where users freely enter and depart the network at any time as they are constrained by specific conditions on network parameters. This paper proposes a universally applicable shared-caching scheme for dynamic setups without any restriction on network parameters. The closed-form expressions for the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) are computed for the resulting generalized scheme, and are shown to achieve the existing optimal bounds of the shared-cache model. Furthermore, a successive-interference-cancellation-free extension based on a fast iterative optimized beamformer design is devised to optimize the use of excess spatial dimensions freed by cache-aided interference cancellation. Extensive numerical experiments are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed scheme. In particular, the results demonstrate that while a dynamic setup may achieve a DoF substantially lower than the optimal DoF of shared caching, our proposed scheme significantly improves the performance at the finite signal-to-noise ratio compared to unicasting, which only benefits from the local caching gain.</description>

Abstract: Pseudo-random arrays and perfect maps are the two-dimensional analogs of M-sequences and de Bruijn sequences, respectively. We modify the definitions to be applied to codes. These codes are also the two-dimensional analogs of certain factors in the de Bruijn graph. These factors are called zero factors and perfect factors in the de Bruijn graph. We apply a folding technique to construct pseudo-random array codes and examine the minimum distance of the constructed codes. The folding is applied on sequences generated from irreducible polynomials or a product of irreducible polynomials with the same degree and the same exponent. Direct and recursive constructions for de Bruijn array codes are presented and discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the frozen set design for precoded polar codes decoded by the successive cancellation list (SCL) algorithm. We propose a novel frozen set design method, whose computational complexity is low due to the use of analytical bounds and constrained frozen set structure. We derive new bounds based on the recently published complexity analysis of SCL decoding with near maximum-likelihood (ML) performance. To predict the ML performance, we employ the state-of-the-art bounds relying on the code weight distribution. The bounds and constrained frozen set structure are incorporated into the genetic algorithm to generate optimized frozen sets with low complexity. Our simulation results show that the constructed precoded polar codes of length 512 have a superior frame error rate (FER) performance compared to the state-of-the-art codes under SCL decoding with various list sizes.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Near-Optimal Design of Zero-Delay Codes for Markov Sources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the classical lossy source coding problem, one encodes long blocks of source symbols that enables the distortion to approach the ultimate Shannon limit. Such a block-coding approach introduces large delays, which is undesirable in many delay-sensitive applications. We consider the zero-delay case, where the goal is to encode and decode a finite-alphabet Markov source without any delay. It has been shown that this problem lends itself to stochastic control techniques, which lead to existence, structural, and general structural approximation results. However, these techniques so far have resulted only in computationally prohibitive algorithmic implementations for code design. To address this problem, we present a reinforcement learning design algorithm and rigorously prove its asymptotic optimality. In particular, we show that a quantized Q-learning algorithm can be used to obtain a near-optimal coding policy for this problem. The proof builds on recent results on quantized Q-learning for weakly Feller controlled Markov chains whose application necessitates the development of supporting technical results on regularity and stability properties, and relating the optimal solutions for discounted and average cost infinite horizon criteria problems. These theoretical results are supported by simulations.</description>

      <title>A Joint Code and Belief Propagation Decoder Design for Quantum LDPC Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes are among the most promising candidates for future quantum error correction schemes. However, a limited number of short to moderate-length QLDPC codes have been designed and their decoding performance is sub-optimal with a quaternary belief propagation (BP) decoder due to unavoidable short cycles in their Tanner graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel joint code and decoder design for QLDPC codes. The constructed codes have a minimum distance of about the square root of the block length. In addition, it is, to the best of our knowledge, the first QLDPC code family where BP decoding is not impaired by short cycles of length 4. This is achieved by using an ensemble BP decoder mitigating the influence of assembled short cycles. We outline two code construction methods based on classical quasi-cyclic codes and finite geometry codes. Numerical results demonstrate outstanding decoding performance over depolarizing channels.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) is a cutting-edge concept for the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a novel system that incorporates STAR-RIS with simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) using rate splitting multiple access (RSMA). The proposed system facilitates communication from a multi-antenna base station (BS) to single-antenna users in a downlink transmission. The BS concurrently sends energy and information signals to multiple energy harvesting receivers (EHRs) and information data receivers (IDRs) with the support of a deployed STAR-RIS. Furthermore, an optimization is introduced to strike a balance between users' sum rate and the total harvested energy. To achieve this, an optimization problem is formulated to optimize the energy/information beamforming vectors at the BS, the phase shifts at the STAR-RIS, and the common message rate. Subsequently, we employ a meta deep deterministic policy gradient (Meta-DDPG) approach to solve the complex problem. Simulation results validate that the proposed algorithm significantly enhances both data rate and harvested energy in comparison to conventional DDPG.</description>

Abstract: We consider channel coding for discrete memoryless channels (DMCs) with a novel cost constraint that constrains both the mean and the variance of the cost of the codewords. We show that the maximum (asymptotically) achievable rate under the new cost formulation is equal to the capacity-cost function; in particular, the strong converse holds. We further characterize the optimal second-order coding rate of these cost-constrained codes; in particular, the optimal second-order coding rate is finite. We then show that the second-order coding performance is strictly improved with feedback using a new variation of timid/bold coding, significantly broadening the applicability of timid/bold coding schemes from unconstrained compound-dispersion channels to all cost-constrained channels. Equivalent results on the minimum average probability of error are also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-shot channel simulation has recently emerged as a promising alternative to quantization and entropy coding in machine-learning-based lossy data compression schemes. However, while there are several potential applications of channel simulation - lossy compression with realism constraints or differential privacy, to name a few - little is known about its fundamental limitations. In this paper, we restrict our attention to a subclass of channel simulation protocols called causal rejection samplers (CRS), establish new, tighter lower bounds on their expected runtime and codelength, and demonstrate the bounds' achievability. Concretely, for an arbitrary CRS, let $Q$ and $P$ denote a target and proposal distribution supplied as input, and let $K$ be the number of samples examined by the algorithm. We show that the expected runtime $\mathbb{E}[K]$ of any CRS scales at least as $\exp_2(D_\infty[Q || P])$, where $D_\infty[Q || P]$ is the R\'enyi $\infty$-divergence. Regarding the codelength, we show that $D_{KL}[Q || P] \leq D_{CS}[Q || P] \leq \mathbb{H}[K]$, where $D_{CS}[Q || P]$ is a new quantity we call the channel simulation divergence. Furthermore, we prove that our new lower bound, unlike the $D_{KL}[Q || P]$ lower bound, is achievable tightly, i.e. there is a CRS such that $\mathbb{H}[K] \leq D_{CS}[Q || P] + \log_2 (e + 1)$. Finally, we conduct numerical studies of the asymptotic scaling of the codelength of Gaussian and Laplace channel simulation algorithms.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the theoretical analysis of intrinsic message passing decoding for generalized product codes (GPCs) with irregular degree distributions, a generalization of product codes that allows every code bit to be protected by a minimum of two and potentially more component codes. We derive a random hypergraph-based asymptotic performance analysis for GPCs, extending previous work that considered the case where every bit is protected by exactly two component codes. The analysis offers a new tool to guide the code design of GPCs by providing insights into the influence of degree distributions on the performance of GPCs.</description>

      <title>Explicit Formula for Partial Information Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mutual information between two random variables is a well-studied notion, whose understanding is fairly complete. Mutual information between one random variable and a pair of other random variables, however, is a far more involved notion. Specifically, Shannon's mutual information does not capture fine-grained interactions between those three variables, resulting in limited insights in complex systems. To capture these fine-grained interactions, in 2010 Williams and Beer proposed to decompose this mutual information to information atoms, called unique, redundant, and synergistic, and proposed several operational axioms that these atoms must satisfy. In spite of numerous efforts, a general formula which satisfies these axioms has yet to be found. Inspired by Judea Pearl's do-calculus, we resolve this open problem by introducing the do-operation, an operation over the variable system which sets a certain marginal to a desired value, which is distinct from any existing approaches. Using this operation, we provide the first explicit formula for calculating the information atoms so that Williams and Beer's axioms are satisfied, as well as additional properties from subsequent studies in the field.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the shuffling phase in a distributed computing model with rate-limited links between nodes. Each node is connected to all other nodes via a noiseless broadcast link with a finite capacity. For this network, the shuffling phase is described as a distributed index-coding problem to extend an outer bound for the latter to the distributed computing problem. An inner bound on the capacity region is also established by using the distributed composite-coding scheme introduced for the distributed index-coding problem. We consider some special cases of the distributed computing problem through two examples for which we prove that the inner and outer bounds agree, thereby establishing the capacity regions. We, then, generalize the special cases to any number of nodes and computation loads under certain constraints.</description>

      <title>Demand Private Coded Caching: the Two-File Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the demand private coded caching problem, which is an $(N,K)$ coded caching problem with $N$ files, $K$ users, each equipped with a cache of size $M$, and an additional privacy constraint on user demands. We first present a new virtual-user-based achievable scheme for arbitrary number of users and files. Then, for the case of 2 files and arbitrary number of users, we derive some new converse bounds. As a result, we obtain the exact memory-rate tradeoff of the demand private coded caching problem for 2 files and 3 users. As for the case of 2 files and arbitrary number of users, the exact memory-rate tradeoff is characterized for $M\in [0,\frac{2}{K}] \cup [\frac{2(K-1)}{K+1},2]$.</description>

      <title>Goppa Codes: Key to High Efficiency and Reliability in Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study some codes of algebraic geometry related to certain maximal curves. Quantum stabilizer codes obtained through the self orthogonality of Hermitian codes of this error correcting do not always have good parameters. However, appropriate parameters found that the Hermitian self-orthogonal code quantum stabilizer code has good parameters. Therefore, we investigated the quantum stabilizer code at a certain maximum curve and modified its parameters. Algebraic geometry codes show promise for enabling high data rate transmission over noisy power line communication channels.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Capacity-Achieving Private Information Retrieval with Non-Colluding and Colluding Servers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13624v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Private Information Retrieval (PIR) is a mechanism for efficiently downloading messages while keeping the index secret. Here, PIRs in which servers do not communicate with each other are called standard PIRs, and PIRs in which some servers communicate with each other are called colluding PIRs. The information-theoretic upper bound on efficiency has been given in previous studies. However, the conditions for PIRs to keep privacy, to decode the desired message, and to achieve that upper bound have not been clarified in matrix form. In this paper, we prove the necessary and sufficient conditions for the properties of standard PIR and colluding PIR. Further, we represent the properties in matrix form.</description>

      <title>Linear-Function Correcting Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study linear-function correcting codes, a class of codes designed to protect linear function evaluations of a message against errors. The work "Function-Correcting Codes" by Lenz et al. 2023 provides a graphical representation for the problem of constructing function-correcting codes. We use this graph to get a lower bound the on redundancy required for function correction. By considering the function to be a bijection, such an approach also provides a lower bound on the redundancy required for classical systematic error correcting codes. For linear-function correction, we characterise the spectrum of the adjacency matrix of this graph, which gives rise to lower bounds on redundancy. The work "Function-Correcting Codes" gives an equivalence between function-correcting codes and irregular-distance codes. We identify a structure imposed by linearity on the distance requirement of the equivalent irregular-distance code which provides a simplified Plotkin-like bound. We propose a version of the sphere packing bound for linear-function correcting codes. We identify a class of linear functions for which an upper bound proposed by Lenz et al., is tight. We also identify a class of functions for which coset-wise coding is equivalent to a lower dimensional classical error correction problem.</description>

      <title>The Economy and Public Diplomacy: An Analysis of RT's Economic Content and Context on Facebook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With globalization's rise, economic interdependence's impacts have become a prominent factor affecting personal lives, as well as national and international dynamics. This study examines RT's public diplomacy efforts on its non-Russian Facebook accounts over the past five years to identify the prominence of economic topics across language accounts. Computational analysis, including word embeddings and statistical methods, investigates how offline economic indicators, like currency values and oil prices, correspond to RT's online economic content changes. The results demonstrate that RT uses message reinforcement associated economic topics as an audience targeting strategy and differentiates their use with changing currency and oil values.</description>

      <title>Joint AP-UE Association and Power Factor Optimization for Distributed Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14693v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uplink sum-throughput of distributed massive multiple-input-multiple-output (mMIMO) networks depends majorly on Access point (AP)-User Equipment (UE) association and power control. The AP-UE association and power control both are important problems in their own right in distributed mMIMO networks to improve scalability and reduce front-haul load of the network, and to enhance the system performance by mitigating the interference and boosting the desired signals, respectively. Unlike previous studies, which focused primarily on addressing these two problems separately, this work addresses the uplink sum-throughput maximization problem in distributed mMIMO networks by solving the joint AP-UE association and power control problem, while maintaining Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements for each UE. To improve scalability, we present an l1-penalty function that delicately balances the trade-off between spectral efficiency (SE) and front-haul signaling load. Our proposed methodology leverages fractional programming, Lagrangian dual formation, and penalty functions to provide an elegant and effective iterative solution with guaranteed convergence. Extensive numerical simulations validate the efficacy of the proposed technique for maximizing sum-throughput while considering the joint AP-UE association and power control problem, demonstrating its superiority over approaches that address these problems individually. Furthermore, the results show that the introduced penalty function can help us effectively control the maximum front-haul load.</description>

      <title>Finding Super-spreaders in Network Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03205v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suppose that a cascade (e.g., an epidemic) spreads on an unknown graph, and only the infection times of vertices are observed. What can be learned about the graph from the infection times caused by multiple distinct cascades? Most of the literature on this topic focuses on the task of recovering the entire graph, which requires $\Omega ( \log n)$ cascades for an $n$-vertex bounded degree graph. Here we ask a different question: can the important parts of the graph be estimated from just a few (i.e., constant number) of cascades, even as $n$ grows large?
  In this work, we focus on identifying super-spreaders (i.e., high-degree vertices) from infection times caused by a Susceptible-Infected process on a graph. Our first main result shows that vertices of degree greater than $n^{3/4}$ can indeed be estimated from a constant number of cascades. Our algorithm for doing so leverages a novel connection between vertex degrees and the second derivative of the cumulative infection curve. Conversely, we show that estimating vertices of degree smaller than $n^{1/2}$ requires at least $\log(n) / \log \log (n)$ cascades. Surprisingly, this matches (up to $\log \log n$ factors) the number of cascades needed to learn the \emph{entire} graph if it is a tree.</description>
