      <title>Grothendieck-Verdier module categories, Frobenius algebras and relative Serre functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop the theory of module categories over a Grothendieck-Verdier category, i.e. a monoidal category with a dualizing object and hence a duality structure more general than rigidity. Such a category C comes with two monoidal structures which are related by non-invertible morphisms and which we treat on an equal footing. Quite generally, non-invertible structure morphisms play a dominant role in this theory.
  In any Grothendieck-Verdier module category M we find two important subcategories M' and M''. The internal End of an object in M' that is a C-generator is an algebra such that its category of modules is equivalent to M as a module category. We also introduce a partially defined relative Serre functor S which furnishes an equivalence between M' and M''. Any isomorphism between an object m of M' and S(m) in M'' endows the internal End of m with the structure of a Grothendieck-Verdier Frobenius algebra.</description>

      <title>Double Glueing over Free Exponential: with Measure Theoretic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.07726v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a compact method to lift the free exponential construction of Mellies-Tabareau-Tasson over the Hyland-Schalk double glueing for orthogonality categories. A condition ``reciprocity of orthogonality'' is presented simply enough to lift the free exponential over the double glueing in terms of the orthogonality. Our general method applies to the monoidal category TsK of the s-finite transition kernels with countable biproducts. We show (i) TsK^op has the free exponential, which is shown to be describable in terms of measure theory. (ii) The s-finite transition kernels have an orthogonality between measures and measurable functions in terms of Lebesgue integrals. The orthogonality is reciprocal, hence the free exponential of (i) lifts to the orthogonality category O_I(TsK^op), which subsumes Ehrhard et al's probabilistic coherent spaces as the full subcategory of countable measurable spaces. To lift the free exponential, the measure-theoretic uniform convergence theorem commuting Lebesgue integral and limit plays a crucial role as well as Fubini-Tonelli theorem for double integral in s-finiteness. Our measure-theoretic orthogonality is considered as a continuous version of the orthogonality of the probabilistic coherent spaces for linear logic, and in particular provides a two layered decomposition of Crubille et al's direct free exponential for these spaces.</description>

      <title>Global homotopy theory via partially lax limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.01556v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide new $\infty$-categorical models for unstable and stable global homotopy theory. We use the notion of partially lax limits to formalize the idea that a global object is a collection of $G$-objects, one for each compact Lie group $G$, which are compatible with the restriction-inflation functors. More precisely, we show that the $\infty$-category of global spaces is equivalent to a partially lax limit of the functor sending a compact Lie group $G$ to the $\infty$-category of $G$-spaces. We also prove the stable version of this result, showing that the $\infty$-category of global spectra is equivalent to the partially lax limit of a diagram of $G$-spectra. Finally, the techniques employed in the previous cases allow us to describe the $\infty$-category of proper $G$-spectra for a Lie group $G$, as a limit of a diagram of $H$-spectra for $H$ running over all compact subgroups of $G$.</description>
