      <title>Optimization and the Topology of Spaces of Parseval Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Parseval frame is a spanning set for a Hilbert space which satisfies the Parseval identity: a vector can be expressed as a linear combination of the frame whose coefficients are inner products with the frame vectors. There is considerable interest within the signal processing community in the structural properties of the space of finite-dimensional Parseval frames whose vectors all have the same norm, or which satisfy more general prescribed norm constraints. In this paper, we introduce a function on the space of arbitrary spanning sets that jointly measures the failure of a spanning set to satisfy both the Parseval identity and given norm constraints. We show that, despite its nonconvexity, this function has no spurious local minimizers, thereby extending the Benedetto--Fickus theorem to this non-compact setting. In particular, this shows that gradient descent converges to an equal norm Parseval frame when initialized within a dense open set in the associated matrix space. We then apply this result to study the topology of frame spaces. Using our Benedetto--Fickus-type result, we realize spaces of Parseval frames with prescribed norms as deformation retracts of simpler spaces, leading to explicit conditions which guarantee the vanishing of their homotopy groups. These conditions yield new path-connectedness results for spaces of real Parseval frames, generalizing the Frame Homotopy Theorem, which has seen significant interest in recent years.</description>

      <title>A JSJ-type decomposition theorem for symplectic fillings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:1807.03420v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a JSJ-type decomposition theorem for splitting exact symplectic fillings of contact 3-manifolds along \emph{mixed tori} -- these are convex tori satisfying a particular geometric condition. As an application, we show that if $(M,\xi)$ is obtained from $(S^3,\xi_{\mathrm{std}})$ via Legendrian surgery along a knot which has been stabilized both positively and negatively, then $(M,\xi)$ has a unique exact filling.</description>

      <title>K-contact manifolds with minimal closed Reeb orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10866v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Boothby-Wang fibration to construct certain simply connected K-contact manifolds and we give sufficient and necessary conditions on when such K-contact manifolds are homeomorphic to the odd dimensional spheres. If the symplectic base manifold of the fibration admits a Hamiltonian torus action, we show that on the total space of the fibration, other than the regular K-contact structures which have infinitely many closed Reeb orbits, there are K-contact structures whose closed Reeb orbits correspond exactly to the fixed points of the Hamiltonian torus action on the base manifold. Then we give a collection of examples of compact simply connected K-contact manifolds with minimal number of closed Reeb orbits which are not homeomorphic to the odd dimensional spheres, while having the real cohomology ring of the spheres. Finally, we give a family of examples of simply connected K-contact manifolds which have one more than the minimal number of closed Reeb orbits and which do not have the real cohomology ring of the spheres.</description>

      <title>From curve shortening to flat link stability and Birkhoff sections of geodesic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the curve shortening flow to establish three new results on the dynamics of geodesic flows of closed Riemannian surfaces. The first one is the stability, under $C^0$-small perturbations of the Riemannian metric, of certain flat links of closed geodesics. The second one is a forced existence theorem for closed connected orientable Riemannian surfaces: for surfaces of positive genus, the existence of a contractible simple closed geodesic $\gamma$ forces the existence of infinitely many closed geodesics intersecting $\gamma$ in every primitive free homotopy class of loops; for the 2-sphere, the existence of two disjoint simple closed geodesics forces the existence of a third one intersecting both. The final result asserts the existence of Birkhoff sections for the geodesic flow of any closed connected orientable Riemannian surface.</description>

      <title>Butcher series for Hamiltonian Poisson integrators through symplectic groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We exhibit a new pre-Lie algebra in the framework of symplectic groupoids and, in turn, introduce a pre-Lie formalism of Butcher trees for the approximation of Hamilton-Jacobi solutions on any symplectic groupoid $\mathcal{G} \rightrightarrows M.$ The impact of this new algebraic approach is twofold. On the geometric side, it yields algebraic operations to approximate Lagrangian bisections of $\mathcal{G}$ using the Butcher-Connes-Kreimer Hopf algebra and, in turn, aims at a better understanding of the group of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms of $M.$ On the computational side, we define a new class of Poisson integrators for Hamiltonian dynamics on Poisson manifolds.</description>

      <title>Nakai-Moishezon criteria and the toric Thomas-Yau conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of Lagrangian sections $L$ contained in certain Calabi-Yau Lagrangian fibrations (mirrors of toric weak Fano manifolds). We prove that a form of the Thomas-Yau conjecture holds in this case: $L$ is Hamiltonian isotopic to a special Lagrangian section in this class if and only if a stability condition holds, in the sense of a slope inequality on objects in a set of exact triangles in the Fukaya-Seidel category. This agrees with general proposals by Li. We use the SYZ transform, the toric gamma theorem, and toric homological mirror symmetry in order to reduce the statement to one about supercritical deformed Hermitian Yang-Mills connections, known as the Nakai-Moishezon criterion. As an application, we prove that, on the mirror of a toric weak del Pezzo surface, if $L$ defines a Bridgeland stable object in the Fukaya-Seidel category in a natural sense, then it is Hamiltonian isotopic to a special Lagrangian section in the class. The converse also holds for the mirror of the projective plane blown-up at one or two points, and always holds assuming a conjecture of Arcara and Miles. When $L$ is Bridgeland unstable, we obtain a morphism from $L$ to a weak solution of the special Lagrangian equation with phase angle satisfying a minimality condition. These results are consistent with general conjectures due to Joyce. We discuss some generalisations, including a weaker analogue of our main result for general projective toric manifolds, and a similar obstruction, related to Lagrangian multi-sections, in a special case.</description>
