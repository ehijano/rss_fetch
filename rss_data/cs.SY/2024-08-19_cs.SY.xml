      <title>Timing Analysis and Priority-driven Enhancements of ROS 2 Multi-threaded Executors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second generation of Robotic Operating System, ROS 2, has gained much attention for its potential to be used for safety-critical robotic applications. The need to provide a solid foundation for timing correctness and scheduling mechanisms is therefore growing rapidly. Although there are some pioneering studies conducted on formally analyzing the response time of processing chains in ROS 2, the focus has been limited to single-threaded executors, and multi-threaded executors, despite their advantages, have not been studied well. To fill this knowledge gap, in this paper, we propose a comprehensive response-time analysis framework for chains running on ROS 2 multi-threaded executors. We first analyze the timing behavior of the default scheduling scheme in ROS 2 multi-threaded executors, and then present priority-driven scheduling enhancements to address the limitations of the default scheme. Our framework can analyze chains with both arbitrary and constrained deadlines and also the effect of mutually-exclusive callback groups. Evaluation is conducted by a case study on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and schedulability experiments using randomly-generated chains. The results demonstrate that our analysis framework can safely upper-bound response times under various conditions and the priority-driven scheduling enhancements not only reduce the response time of critical chains but also improve analytical bounds.</description>

      <title>A semi-centralized multi-agent RL framework for efficient irrigation scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Semi-Centralized Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (SCMARL) approach for irrigation scheduling in spatially variable agricultural fields, where management zones address spatial variability. The SCMARL framework is hierarchical in nature, with a centralized coordinator agent at the top level and decentralized local agents at the second level. The coordinator agent makes daily binary irrigation decisions based on field-wide conditions, which are communicated to the local agents. Local agents determine appropriate irrigation amounts for specific management zones using local conditions. The framework employs state augmentation approach to handle non-stationarity in the local agents' environments. An extensive evaluation on a large-scale field in Lethbridge, Canada, compares the SCMARL approach with a learning-based multi-agent model predictive control scheduling approach, highlighting its enhanced performance, resulting in water conservation and improved Irrigation Water Use Efficiency (IWUE). Notably, the proposed approach achieved a 4.0% savings in irrigation water while enhancing the IWUE by 6.3%.</description>

      <title>A New Control Law for TS Fuzzy Models: Less Conservative LMI Conditions by Using Membership Functions Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note proposes a new type of Parallel Distributed Controller (PDC) for Takagi-Sugeno (TS) fuzzy models. Our idea consists of using two control terms based on state feedback, one composed of a convex combination of linear gains weighted by the normalized membership grade, as in traditional PDC, and the other composed of linear gains weighted by the time-derivatives of the membership functions. We present the design conditions as Linear Matrix Inequalities, solvable through numerical optimization tools. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the advantages of the proposed approach, which contains the the traditional PDC as a special case.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Construction of Finite Abstractions for Interconnected Systems: A Compositional Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite-state abstractions (a.k.a. symbolic models) present a promising avenue for the formal verification and synthesis of controllers in continuous-space control systems. These abstractions provide simplified models that capture the fundamental behaviors of the original systems. However, the creation of such abstractions typically relies on the availability of precise knowledge concerning system dynamics, which might not be available in many real-world applications. In this work, we introduce an innovative, data-driven, and compositional approach to generate finite abstractions for interconnected systems that consist of discrete-time control subsystems with unknown dynamics. These subsystems interact through an unknown static interconnection map. Our methodology for abstracting the interconnected system involves constructing abstractions for individual subsystems and incorporating an abstraction of the interconnection map.</description>

      <title>Study on Human-Variability-Respecting Optimal Control Affecting Human Interaction Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broad application of human-machine interaction (HMI) demands advanced and human-centered control designs for the machine's automation. Human natural motor action shows stochastic behavior, which has so far not been respected in HMI control designs. Using a previously presented novel human-variability-respecting optimal controller we present a study design which allows the investigation of respecting human natural variability and its effect on human interaction experience. Our approach is tested in simulation based on an identified real human subject and presents a promising approach to be used for a larger subject study.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Processes with Noisy Regression Inputs for Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is centered around the approximation of dynamical systems by means of Gaussian processes. To this end, trajectories of such systems must be collected to be used as training data. The measurements of these trajectories are typically noisy, which implies that both the regression inputs and outputs are corrupted by noise. However, most of the literature considers only noise in the regression outputs. In this paper, we show how to account for the noise in the regression inputs in an extended Gaussian process framework to approximate scalar and multidimensional systems. We demonstrate the potential of our framework by comparing it to different state-of-the-art methods in several simulation examples.</description>

      <title>Spin Hall Nano-Antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin Hall effect is a celebrated phenomenon in spintronics and magnetism that has found numerous applications in digital electronics (memory and logic), but very few in analog electronics. Practically, the only analog application in widespread use is the spin Hall nano-oscillator (SHNO) that delivers a high frequency alternating current or voltage to a load. Here, we report its analogue - a spin Hall nano-antenna (SHNA) that radiates a high frequency electromagnetic wave (alternating electric/magnetic fields) into the surrounding medium. It can also radiate an acoustic wave in an underlying substrate if the nanomagnets are made of a magnetostrictive material. That makes it a dual electromagnetic/acoustic antenna. The SHNA is made of an array of ledged magnetostrictive nanomagnets deposited on a substrate, with a heavy metal nanostrip underlying/overlying the ledges. An alternating charge current passed through the nanostrip generates an alternating spin-orbit torque in the nanomagnets via the spin Hall effect which makes their magnetizations oscillate in time with the frequency of the current, producing confined spin waves (magnons), which radiate electromagnetic waves (photons) in space with the same frequency as the ac current. Despite being much smaller than the radiated wavelength, the SHNA surprisingly does not act as a point source which would radiate isotropically. Instead, there is clear directionality (anisotropy) in the radiation pattern, which is frequency-dependent. This is due to the (frequency-dependent) intrinsic anisotropy in the confined spin wave patterns generated within the nanomagnets, which effectively endows the "point source" with internal anisotropy.</description>

      <title>An Implicit Function Method for Computing the Stability Boundaries of Hill's Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hill's equation is a common model of a time-periodic system that can undergo parametric resonance for certain choices of system parameters. For most kinds of parametric forcing, stable regions in its two-dimensional parameter space need to be identified numerically, typically by applying a matrix trace criterion. By integrating ODEs derived from the stability criterion, we present an alternative, more accurate and computationally efficient numerical method for determining the stability boundaries of Hill's equation in parameter space. This method works similarly to determine stability boundaries for the closely related problem of vibrational stabilization of the linearized Katpiza pendulum. Additionally, we derive a stability criterion for the damped Hill's equation in terms of a matrix trace criterion on an equivalent undamped system. In doing so we generalize the method of this paper to compute stability boundaries for parametric resonance in the presence of damping.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of Nonlinear Systems through Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a control design approach for stabilizing nonlinear control systems. Our key observation is that the set of points where the decrease condition of a control Lyapunov function (CLF) is feasible can be regarded as a safe set. By leveraging a nonsmooth version of control barrier functions (CBFs) and a weaker notion of CLF, we develop a control design that forces the system to converge to and remain in the region where the CLF decrease condition is feasible. We characterize the conditions under which our controller asymptotically stabilizes the origin or a small neighborhood around it, even in the cases where it is discontinuous. We illustrate our design in various examples.</description>

      <title>An Efficient and Explainable Transformer-Based Few-Shot Learning for Modeling Electricity Consumption Profiles Across Thousands of Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electricity Consumption Profiles (ECPs) are crucial for operating and planning power distribution systems, especially with the increasing numbers of various low-carbon technologies such as solar panels and electric vehicles. Traditional ECP modeling methods typically assume the availability of sufficient ECP data. However, in practice, the accessibility of ECP data is limited due to privacy issues or the absence of metering devices. Few-shot learning (FSL) has emerged as a promising solution for ECP modeling in data-scarce scenarios. Nevertheless, standard FSL methods, such as those used for images, are unsuitable for ECP modeling because (1) these methods usually assume several source domains with sufficient data and several target domains. However, in the context of ECP modeling, there may be thousands of source domains with a moderate amount of data and thousands of target domains. (2) Standard FSL methods usually involve cumbersome knowledge transfer mechanisms, such as pre-training and fine-tuning, whereas ECP modeling requires more lightweight methods. (3) Deep learning models often lack explainability, hindering their application in industry. This paper proposes a novel FSL method that exploits Transformers and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) for ECP modeling to address the above-described issues. Results show that our method can accurately restore the complex ECP distribution with a minimal amount of ECP data (e.g., only 1.6\% of the complete domain dataset) while it outperforms state-of-the-art time series modeling methods, maintaining the advantages of being both lightweight and interpretable.

      <title>Physics-Guided Reinforcement Learning System for Realistic Vehicle Active Suspension Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The suspension system is a crucial part of the automotive chassis, improving vehicle ride comfort and isolating passengers from rough road excitation. Unlike passive suspension, which has constant spring and damping coefficients, active suspension incorporates electronic actuators into the system to dynamically control stiffness and damping variables. However, effectively controlling the suspension system poses a challenging task that necessitates real-time adaptability to various road conditions. This paper presents the Physics-Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) for adjusting an active suspension system's variable kinematics and compliance properties for a quarter-car model in real time. Specifically, the outputs of the model are defined as actuator stiffness and damping control, which are bound within physically realistic ranges to maintain the system's physical compliance. The proposed model was trained on stochastic road profiles according to ISO 8608 standards to optimize the actuator's control policy. According to qualitative results on simulations, the vehicle body reacts smoothly to various novel real-world road conditions, having a much lower degree of oscillation. These observations mean a higher level of passenger comfort and better vehicle stability. Quantitatively, DRL outperforms passive systems in reducing the average vehicle body velocity and acceleration by 43.58% and 17.22%, respectively, minimizing the vertical movement impacts on the passengers. The code is publicly available at github.com/anh-nn01/RL4Suspension-ICMLA23.</description>

      <title>RadioDiff: An Effective Generative Diffusion Model for Sampling-Free Dynamic Radio Map Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio map (RM) is a promising technology that can obtain pathloss based on only location, which is significant for 6G network applications to reduce the communication costs for pathloss estimation. However, the construction of RM in traditional is either computationally intensive or depends on costly sampling-based pathloss measurements. Although the neural network (NN)-based method can efficiently construct the RM without sampling, its performance is still suboptimal. This is primarily due to the misalignment between the generative characteristics of the RM construction problem and the discrimination modeling exploited by existing NN-based methods. Thus, to enhance RM construction performance, in this paper, the sampling-free RM construction is modeled as a conditional generative problem, where a denoised diffusion-based method, named RadioDiff, is proposed to achieve high-quality RM construction. In addition, to enhance the diffusion model's capability of extracting features from dynamic environments, an attention U-Net with an adaptive fast Fourier transform module is employed as the backbone network to improve the dynamic environmental features extracting capability. Meanwhile, the decoupled diffusion model is utilized to further enhance the construction performance of RMs. Moreover, a comprehensive theoretical analysis of why the RM construction is a generative problem is provided for the first time, from both perspectives of data features and NN training methods. Experimental results show that the proposed RadioDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in all three metrics of accuracy, structural similarity, and peak signal-to-noise ratio.

      <title>Discrete-time SIS Social Contagion Processes on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research on social contagion processes has revealed the limitations of traditional networks, which capture only pairwise relationships, to characterize complex multiparty relationships and group influences properly. Social contagion processes on higher-order networks (simplicial complexes and general hypergraphs) have therefore emerged as a novel frontier. In this work, we investigate discrete-time Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) social contagion processes occurring on weighted and directed hypergraphs and their extensions to bivirus cases and general higher-order SIS processes with the aid of tensor algebra. Our focus lies in comprehensively characterizing the healthy state and endemic equilibria within this framework. The emergence of bistability or multistability behavior phenomena, where multiple equilibria coexist and are simultaneously locally asymptotically stable, is demonstrated in view of the presence of the higher-order interaction. The novel sufficient conditions of the appearance for system behaviors, which are determined by both (higher-order) network topology and transition rates, are provided to assess the likelihood of the SIS social contagion processes causing an outbreak. More importantly, given the equilibrium is locally stable, an explicit domain of attraction associated with the system parameters is constructed. Moreover, a learning method to estimate the transition rates is presented. In the end, the attained theoretical results are supplemented via numerical examples. Specifically, we evaluate the effectiveness of the networked SIS social contagion process by comparing it with the $2^n$-state Markov chain model. These numerical examples are given to highlight the performance of parameter learning algorithms and the system behaviors of the discrete-time SIS social contagion process.</description>

      <title>Cross-Chip Partial Reconfiguration for the Initialisation of Modular and Scalable Heterogeneous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The almost unlimited possibilities to customize the logic in an FPGA are one of the main reasons for the versatility of these devices. Partial reconfiguration exploits this capability even further by allowing to replace logic in predefined FPGA regions at runtime. This is especially relevant in heterogeneous SoCs, combining FPGA fabric with conventional processors on a single die. Tight integration and supporting frameworks like the FPGA subsystem in Linux facilitate use, for example, to dynamically load custom hardware accelerators. Although this example is one of the most common use cases for partial reconfiguration, the possible applications go far beyond. We propose to use partial reconfiguration in combination with the AXI C2C cross-chip bus to extend the resources of heterogeneous MPSoC and RFSoC devices by connecting peripheral FPGAs. With AXI C2C it is easily possible to link the programmable logic of the individual devices, but partial reconfiguration on peripheral FPGAs utilising the same channel is not officially supported. By using an AXI ICAP controller in combination with custom Linux drivers, we show that it is possible to enable the PS of the heterogeneous SoC to perform partial reconfiguration on peripheral FPGAs, and thus to seamlessly access and manage the entire multi-device system. As a result, software and FPGA firmware updates can be applied to the entire system at runtime, and peripheral FPGAs can be added and removed during operation.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on Bayesian Operational Modal Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08664v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of operational modal analysis (OMA), obtained modal information is frequently used to assess the current state of aerospace, mechanical, offshore and civil structures. However, the stochasticity of operational systems and the lack of forcing information can lead to inconsistent results. Quantifying the uncertainty of the recovered modal parameters through OMA is therefore of significant value. In this article, a new perspective on Bayesian OMA is proposed: a Bayesian stochastic subspace identification (SSI) algorithm. Distinct from existing approaches to Bayesian OMA, a hierarchical probabilistic model is embedded at the core of covariance-driven SSI. Through substitution of canonical correlation analysis with a Bayesian equivalent, posterior distributions over the modal properties are obtained. Two inference schemes are presented for the proposed Bayesian formulation: Markov Chain Monte Carlo and variational Bayes. Two case studies are then explored. The first is benchmark study using data from a simulated, multi degree-of-freedom, linear system. Following application of Bayesian SSI, it is shown that the same posterior is targeted and recovered by both inference schemes, with good agreement between the posterior mean and the conventional SSI result. The second study applies the variational form to data obtained from an in-service structure: The Z24 bridge. The results of this study are presented at single model orders, and then using a stabilisation diagram. The recovered posterior uncertainty is presented and compared to the classic SSI result. It is observed that the posterior distributions with mean values coinciding with the natural frequencies exhibit lower variance than values situated away from the natural frequencies.</description>

      <title>Robust Stochastic Shortest-Path Planning via Risk-Sensitive Incremental Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the pervasiveness of Stochastic Shortest-Path (SSP) problems in high-risk industries, such as last-mile autonomous delivery and supply chain management, robust planning algorithms are crucial for ensuring successful task completion while mitigating hazardous outcomes. Mainstream chance-constrained incremental sampling techniques for solving SSP problems tend to be overly conservative and typically do not consider the likelihood of undesirable tail events. We propose an alternative risk-aware approach inspired by the asymptotically-optimal Rapidly-Exploring Random Trees (RRT*) planning algorithm, which selects nodes along path segments with minimal Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR). Our motivation rests on the step-wise coherence of the CVaR risk measure and the optimal substructure of the SSP problem. Thus, optimizing with respect to the CVaR at each sampling iteration necessarily leads to an optimal path in the limit of the sample size. We validate our approach via numerical path planning experiments in a two-dimensional grid world with obstacles and stochastic path-segment lengths. Our simulation results show that incorporating risk into the tree growth process yields paths with lengths that are significantly less sensitive to variations in the noise parameter, or equivalently, paths that are more robust to environmental uncertainty. Algorithmic analyses reveal similar query time and memory space complexity to the baseline RRT* procedure, with only a marginal increase in processing time. This increase is offset by significantly lower noise sensitivity and reduced planner failure rates.</description>

      <title>Parallelized Robust Distributed Model Predictive Control in the Presence of Coupled State Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.05965v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a robust distributed model predictive control (DMPC) scheme for dynamically decoupled nonlinear systems which are subject to state constraints, coupled state constraints and input constraints. In the proposed control scheme, all subsystems solve their local optimization problem in parallel and neighbor-to-neighbor communication suffices. The approach relies on consistency constraints which define a neighborhood around each subsystem's reference trajectory where the state of the subsystem is guaranteed to stay in. Reference trajectories and consistency constraints are known to neighboring subsystems. Contrary to other relevant approaches, the reference trajectories are improved consecutively. The presented approach allows the formulation of convex optimization problems for systems with linear dynamics even in the presence of non-convex state constraints. Additionally, we employ tubes in order to ensure the controller's robustness against bounded uncertainties. In the end, we briefly comment on an iterative extension of the DMPC scheme. The effectiveness of the proposed DMPC scheme and its iterative extension are demonstrated with simulations.</description>

      <title>A Synthetic Texas Power System with Time-Series High-Resolution Weather-Dependent Spatio-Temporally Correlated Grid Profiles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduced a synthetic power system with spatio-temporally correlated profiles of solar power, wind power, dynamic line ratings and loads at one-hour resolution for five continuous years, referred to as the Texas 123-bus backbone transmission (TX-123BT) system. Unlike conventional test cases that offer a static snapshot of system profile, the designed TX-123BT system incorporates weather-dependent profiles for renewable generation and transmission thermal limits, mimicking the actual Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) system characteristics. Three weather-dependent models are used for the creation of wind and solar power production, and dynamic line rating (DLR) separately. Security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) is conducted on TX-123BT daily profiles and numerical results are compared with the actual ERCOT system for validation. The long-term spatio-temporal profiles can greatly capture the renewable production versatility due to the environmental conditions. An example of hydrogen facilities integration studies is presented to illustrate the advantage of utilizing detailed spatio-temporal profiles of TX-123BT.</description>

      <title>Transmission Expansion Planning for Renewable-energy-dominated Power Grids Considering Climate Impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As renewable energy is becoming the major resource in future grids, the weather and climate can have a higher impact on grid reliability. Transmission expansion planning (TEP) has the potential to reinforce a transmission network that is suitable for climate-impacted grids. In this paper, we propose a systematic TEP procedure for climate-impacted renewable energy-enriched grids. Particularly, this work developed an improved model for TEP considering climate impact (TEP-CI) and evaluated the system reliability with the obtained transmission investment plan. Firstly, we created climate-impacted spatio-temporal future grid data to facilitate the TEP-CI study, which includes the future climate-dependent renewable production as well as the dynamic rating profiles of the Texas 123-bus backbone transmission system (TX-123BT). Secondly, we proposed the TEP-CI which considers the variation in renewable production and dynamic line rating, and obtained the investment plan for future TX-123BT. Thirdly, we presented a customized security-constrained unit commitment (SCUC) specifically for climate-impacted grids. The future grid reliability under various investment scenarios is analyzed based on the daily operation conditions from SCUC simulations. The whole procedure presented in this paper enables numerical studies on grid planning considering climate impacts. It can also serve as a benchmark for other TEP-CI research and performance evaluation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Data-Driven MPC for Demand Response of Commercial Buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15742v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) has been shown to significantly improve the energy efficiency of buildings while maintaining thermal comfort. Data-driven approaches based on neural networks have been proposed to facilitate system modelling. However, such approaches are generally nonconvex and result in computationally intractable optimization problems. In this work, we design a readily implementable energy management method for small commercial buildings. We then leverage our approach to formulate a real-time demand bidding strategy. We propose a data-driven and mixed-integer convex MPC which is solved via derivative-free optimization given a limited computational time of 5 minutes to respect operational constraints. We consider rooftop unit heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems with discrete controls to accurately model the operation of most commercial buildings. Our approach uses an input convex recurrent neural network to model the thermal dynamics. We apply our approach in several demand response (DR) settings, including a demand bidding, a time-of-use, and a critical peak rebate program. Controller performance is evaluated on a state-of-the-art building simulation. The proposed approach improves thermal comfort while reducing energy consumption and cost through DR participation, when compared to other data-driven approaches or a set-point controller.</description>

      <title>Optimization of the Energy-Comfort Trade-Off of HVAC Systems in Electric City Buses Based on a Steady-State Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrification of public transport vehicles offers the potential to relieve city centers of pollutant and noise emissions. Furthermore, electric buses have lower life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions than diesel buses, particularly when operated with sustainably produced electricity. However, the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system can consume a significant amount of energy, thus limiting the achievable driving range. In this paper, we address the HVAC system in an electric city bus by analyzing the trade-off between the energy consumption and the thermal comfort of the passengers. We do this by developing a dynamic thermal model for the bus, which we simplify by considering it to be in steady state. We introduce a method that is able to quickly optimize the steady-state HVAC system inputs for a large number of samples representative of a year-round operation. A comparison between the results from the steady-state optimization approach and a dynamic simulation reveals small deviations in both the HVAC system power demand and achieved thermal comfort. Thus, the approximation of the system performance with a steady-state model is justified. We present two case studies to demonstrate the practical relevance of the approach. First, we show how the method can be used to compare different HVAC system designs based on a year-round performance evaluation. Second, we show how the method can be used to extract setpoints for online controllers that achieve close-to-optimal performance without any predictive information. In conclusion, this study shows that a steady-state analysis of the HVAC systems of an electric city bus is a valuable approach to evaluate and optimize its performance.</description>

      <title>Self-organizing Multiagent Target Enclosing under Limited Information and Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an approach to address the target enclosing problem using non-holonomic multiagent systems, where agents self-organize on the enclosing shape around a fixed target. In our approach, agents independently move toward the desired enclosing geometry when apart and activate the collision avoidance mechanism when a collision is imminent, thereby guaranteeing inter-agent safety. Our approach combines global enclosing behavior and local collision avoidance mechanisms by devising a special potential function and sliding manifold. We rigorously show that an agent does not need to ensure safety with every other agent and put forth a concept of the nearest colliding agent (for any arbitrary agent) with whom ensuring safety is sufficient to avoid collisions in the entire swarm. The proposed control eliminates the need for a fixed or pre-established agent arrangement around the target and requires only relative information between an agent and the target. This makes our design particularly appealing for scenarios with limited global information, hence significantly reducing communication requirements. We finally present simulation results to vindicate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Estimation of Real Valued Function by Two Agents and a Fusion Center with Knowledge Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a collaborative iterative algorithm with two agents and a fusion center for estimation of a real valued function (or ``model") on the set of real numbers. While the data collected by the agents is private, in every iteration of the algorithm, the models estimated by the agents are uploaded to the fusion center, fused, and, subsequently downloaded by the agents. We consider the estimation spaces at the agents and the fusion center to be Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). Under suitable assumptions on these spaces, we prove that the algorithm is consistent, i.e., there exists a subsequence of the estimated models which converges to a model in the strong topology. To this end, we define estimation operators for the agents, fusion center, and, for every iteration of the algorithm constructively. We define valid input data sequences, study the asymptotic properties of the norm of the estimation operators, and, find sufficient conditions under which the estimation operator until any iteration is uniformly bounded. Using these results, we prove the existence of an estimation operator for the algorithm which implies the consistency of the considered estimation algorithm.</description>

Abstract: In this short paper, we characterize symmetric locality. In designing algorithms, compilers, and systems, data movement is a common bottleneck in high-performance computation, in which we improve cache and memory performance. We study a special type of data reuse in the form of repeated traversals, or re-traversals, which are based on the symmetric group. The cyclic and sawtooth traces are previously known results in symmetric locality, and in this work, we would like to generalize this result for any re-traversal. Then, we also provide an abstract framework for applications in compiler design and machine learning models to improve the memory performance of certain programs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the dynamical properties of closed-loop systems obtained from control barrier function-based safety filters. We provide a sufficient and necessary condition for the existence of undesirable equilibria and show that the Jacobian matrix of the closed-loop system evaluated at an undesirable equilibrium always has a nonpositive eigenvalue. In the special case of linear planar systems and ellipsoidal obstacles, we give a complete characterization of the dynamical properties of the corresponding closed-loop system. We show that for underactuated systems, the safety filter always introduces a single undesirable equilibrium, which is a saddle-point. We prove that all trajectories outside the global stable manifold of such equilibrium converge to the origin. In the fully actuated case, we discuss how the choice of nominal controller affects the stability properties of the closed-loop system. Various simulations illustrate our results.</description>

Abstract: State space subspace algorithms for input-output systems have been widely applied but also have a reasonably well-developedasymptotic theory dealing with consistency. However, guaranteeing the stability of the estimated system matrix is a major issue. Existing stability-guaranteed algorithms are computationally expensive, require several tuning parameters, and scale badly to high state dimensions. Here, we develop a new algorithm that is closed-form and requires no tuning parameters. It is thus computationally cheap and scales easily to high state dimensions. We also prove its consistency under reasonable conditions.</description>

      <title>Geometric Tracking Control of Omnidirectional Multirotors for Aggressive Maneuvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.10024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An omnidirectional multirotor has the maneuverability of decoupled translational and rotational motions, superseding the traditional multirotors' motion capability. Such maneuverability is achieved due to the ability of the omnidirectional multirotor to frequently alter the thrust amplitude and direction. In doing so, the rotors' settling time, which is induced by inherent rotor dynamics, significantly affects the omnidirectional multirotor's tracking performance, especially in aggressive flights. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel tracking controller that takes the rotor dynamics into account and does not require additional rotor state measurement. We prove that the proposed controller yields almost global exponential stability. The proposed controller is validated in experiments, where we demonstrate significantly improved tracking performance in multiple aggressive maneuvers compared with a baseline geometric PD controller.</description>

      <title>Battlefield transfers in coalitional Blotto games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In competitive resource allocation environments, agents often choose to form alliances; however, for some agents, doing so may not always be beneficial. Is there a method of forming alliances that always reward each of their members? We study this question using the framework of the coalitional Blotto game, in which two players compete against a common adversary by allocating their budgeted resources across disjoint sets of valued battlefields. On any given battlefield, the agent that allocates a greater amount of resources wins the corresponding battlefield value. Existing work has shown the surprising result that in certain game instances, if one player donates a portion of their budget to the other player, then both players win larger amounts in their separate competitions against the adversary. However, this transfer-based method of alliance formation is not always mutually beneficial, which motivates the search for alternate strategies. In this vein, we study a new method of alliance formation referred to as a joint transfer, whereby players publicly transfer battlefields and budgets between one another before they engage in their separate competitions against the adversary. We show that in almost all game instances, there exists a mutually beneficial joint transfer that strictly increases the payoff of each player.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17157v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider direct policy optimization for the linear-quadratic Gaussian (LQG) setting. Over the past few years, it has been recognized that the landscape of dynamic output-feedback controllers of relevance to LQG has an intricate geometry, particularly pertaining to the existence of degenerate stationary points, that hinders gradient methods. In order to address these challenges, in this paper, we adopt a system-theoretic coordinate-invariant Riemannian metric for the space of dynamic output-feedback controllers and develop a Riemannian gradient descent for direct LQG policy optimization. We then proceed to prove that the orbit space of such controllers, modulo the coordinate transformation, admits a Riemannian quotient manifold structure. This geometric structure--that is of independent interest--provides an effective approach to derive direct policy optimization algorithms for LQG with a local linear rate convergence guarantee. Subsequently, we show that the proposed approach exhibits significantly faster and more robust numerical performance as compared with ordinary gradient descent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigation precision, speed and stability are crucial for safe UAV flight maneuvers and effective flight mission executions in dynamic environments. Different flight missions may have varying objectives, such as minimizing energy consumption, achieving precise positioning, or maximizing speed. A controller that can adapt to different objectives on the fly is highly valuable. Proportional Integral Derivative controllers are one of the most popular and widely used control algorithms for drones control systems, but their linear control algorithm fails to capture the nonlinear nature of the dynamic wind conditions and complex drone system. Manually tuning the PID gains for various missions can be time-consuming and requires significant expertise. This paper aims to revolutionize drone flight control by presenting the AirPilot, a nonlinear Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) - enhanced PID drone controller using Proximal Policy Optimization. AirPilot controller combines the simplicity and effectiveness of traditional PID control with the adaptability, learning capability, and optimization potential of DRL. This makes it better suited for modern drone applications where the environment is dynamic, and mission-specific performance demands are high. We employed a COEX Clover autonomous drone for training the DRL agent within the Gazebo simulator and subsequently implemented it in a real-world lab setting, which marks a significant milestone as one of the first attempts to apply a DRL-based flight controller on an actual drone. Airpilot is capable of reducing the navigation error by more than 82% and improving overshoot, speed and settling time significantly.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the computational speed and accuracy of two numerical integration methods, cubature and sampling-based, for integrating an integrand over a 2D polygon. Using a group of rovers searching the Martian surface with a limited sensor footprint as a test bed, the relative error and computational time are compared as the area was subdivided to improve accuracy in the sampling-based approach. The results show that the sampling-based approach exhibits a $14.75\%$ deviation in relative error compared to cubature when it matches the computational performance at $100\%$. Furthermore, achieving a relative error below $1\%$ necessitates a $10000\%$ increase in relative time to calculate due to the $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity of the sampling-based method. It is concluded that for enhancing reinforcement learning capabilities and other high iteration algorithms, the cubature method is preferred over the sampling-based method.</description>

      <title>Memory-optimised Cubic Splines for High-fidelity Quantum Operations</title>

Abstract: Radio-frequency pulses are widespread for the control of quantum bits and the execution of operations in quantum computers. The ability to tune key pulse parameters such as time-dependent amplitude, phase, and frequency is essential to achieve maximal gate fidelity and mitigate errors. As systems scale, a larger fraction of the control electronic processing will move closer to the qubits, to enhance integration and minimise latency in operations requiring fast feedback. This will constrain the space available in the memory of the control electronics to load time-resolved pulse parameters at high sampling rates. Cubic spline interpolation is a powerful and widespread technique that divides the pulse into segments of cubic polynomials. We show an optimised implementation of this strategy, using a two-stage curve fitting process and additional symmetry operations to load a high-sampling pulse output on an FPGA. This results in a favourable accuracy versus memory footprint trade-off. By simulating single-qubit population transfer and atom transport on a neutral atom device, we show that we can achieve high fidelities with low memory requirements. This is instrumental for scaling up the number of qubits and gate operations in environments where memory is a limited resource.</description>
