      <title>Limit Sketches and the Universal Realization of a Limit Sketch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a construction of the universal realized limit sketch from a limit sketch. Moreover, we show that the universal realization extends to a functor that is the left adjoint to the forgetful functor that forgets limits. We finish by showing that models over a limit sketch are in one-to-one correspondance to models over the universal realization.</description>

      <title>Poset-enriched categories and free exact completions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an elementary construction of the exact completion of a weakly lex category for categories enriched in the cartesian closed category $\mathsf{Pos}$ of partially ordered sets. Paralleling the ordinary case, we characterize categories which arise as such completions in terms of projective objects. We then apply the results to categories of Eilenberg-Moore algebras for monads on $\mathsf{Pos}$. In particular, we show that every variety of ordered algebras is the exact completion of a subcategory on certain free algebras, thereby answering a question of A. Kurz and J. Velebil.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Abstraction of the Localic Sheafification via the Tripos-to-Topos Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localic and realizability toposes are two central classes of toposes in categorical logic, both arising through the Hyland-Johnstone-Pitts tripos-to-topos construction. We investigate their shared geometric features by providing an algebraic abstraction of the notions of localic presheaves, sheafification and their connection to supercompactification of a locale via an instance of the Comparison Lemma. This can be applied to a broad class of toposes obtained to the tripos-to-topos constructions, including all those generated from a tripos based on the classical category of ZFC-sets. These results provide a unified geometric framework for understanding localic and realizability toposes.</description>

      <title>Quasi-resolving subcategories and dimensions in extriangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}=(\mathcal{C},\mathbb{E},\mathfrak{s})$ be an extriangulated category with a proper class $\xi$ of $\mathbb{E}$-triangles. In this paper, we introduce and study quasi-resolving subcategories in $\mathcal{C}$. More precisely, we first introduce the notion of $\mathcal{X}$-resolution dimensions for a quasi-resolving subcategory $\mathcal{X}$ of $\mathcal{C}$ and then give some equivalent characterizations of objects which have finite $\mathcal{X}$-resolution dimensions. As an application, we introduce Gorenstein quasi-resolving subcategories, denoted by $\mathcal{GQP}_{\mathcal{X}}(\xi)$, in term of a quasi-resolving subcategory $\mathcal{X}$, and prove that $\mathcal{GQP}_{\mathcal{X}}(\xi)$ is also a quasi-resolving subcategory of $\mathcal{C}$. Moreover, some classical known results are generalized in $\mathcal{GQP}_{\mathcal{X}}(\xi)$.</description>

      <title>The free bifibration on a functor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of constructing the free bifibration generated by a functor of categories $p : D \to C$. This problem was previously considered by Lamarche, and is closely related to the problem, considered by Dawson, Par\'e, and Pronk, of "freely adjoining adjoints" to a category. We develop a proof-theoretic approach to the problem, beginning with a construction of the free bifibration $\Lambda_p : \mathcal{B}\mathrm{if}(p)\to C$ in which objects of $\mathcal{B}\mathrm{if}(p)$ are formulas of a primitive "bifibrational logic", and arrows are derivations in a cut-free sequent calculus modulo a notion of permutation equivalence. We show that instantiating the construction to the identity functor generates a _zigzag double category_ $\mathbb{Z}(C)$, which is also the free double category with companions and conjoints (or fibrant double category) on $C$. The approach adapts smoothly to the more general task of building $(P,N)$-fibrations, where one only asks for pushforwards along arrows in $P$ and pullbacks along arrows in $N$ for some subsets of arrows, which encompasses Kock and Joyal's notion of _ambifibration_ when $(P,N)$ form a factorization system. We establish a series of progressively stronger normal forms, guided by ideas of _focusing_ from proof theory, and obtain a canonicity result under assumption that the base category is factorization preordered relative to $P$ and $N$. This canonicity result allows us to decide the word problem and to enumerate relative homsets without duplicates. Finally, we describe several examples of a combinatorial nature, including a category of plane trees generated as a free bifibration over $\omega$, and a category of increasing forests generated as a free ambifibration over $\Delta$, which contains the lattices of noncrossing partitions as quotients of its fibers by the Beck-Chevalley condition.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck--Teichm\"uller Symmetries of Cyclic Operads and Tangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterise the profinite Grothendieck--Teichm\"uller group $\widehat{\mathsf{GT}}$ as the group of automorphisms of the profinite completion of the cyclic operad of parenthesised ribbon braids. This operad admits a metric envelope identified with the category of framed, oriented tangles, thereby providing an operadic model for profinite tangles and their arithmetic symmetries. As applications, we show that $\widehat{\mathsf{GT}}$ acts naturally on tangles and provide an alternative proof of the formality of the cyclic framed little disks operad.</description>

      <title>On the tensor-triangular geometry of isotropic motives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tensor-triangular geometry of the categories of isotropic Tate motives, isotropic Artin motives and isotropic Artin--Tate motives. In particular, we study the categories $DTM_{gm}(k/k;\mathbb{F}_2)$, $DAM_{gm}(k/k;\mathbb{F}_2)$ and $DATM_{gm}(k/k;\mathbb{F}_2)$ where $k$ is a flexible field and we fix $\mathbb{F}_2$-coefficients. In this case, we prove their Balmer spectra are singletons. The proof of this relies on the fact that the categories in question are generated by objects whose morphisms are `nilpotent enough.' Furthermore, we investigate their homological spectra, and verify Balmer's Nerves of Steel conjecture in these cases by showing these spaces are also singletons, and we give an explicit description of the homological primes. We also investigate stratification, and we conclude by studying generation properties of these categories -- the latter results we see also apply to global (i.e. non-isotropic) motives.</description>

      <title>Characterizing model structures on finite posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transfer systems on finite posets have recently been gaining traction as a key ingredient in equivariant homotopy theory. Additionally, they also naturally occur in the data of a model structure. We give a complete characterization of all model category structures on a finite lattice, using transfer systems as our main tool, resulting in new connections between abstract homotopy theory and equivariant methods.</description>

      <title>A comparison between weakly protomodular and protomodular objects in unital categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare the concepts of protomodular and weakly protomodular objects within the context of unital categories. Our analysis demonstrates that these two notions are generally distinct. To establish this, we introduce left pseudocancellative unital magmas and characterise weakly protomodular objects within the variety of algebras they constitute. Subsequently, we present an example of a weakly protomodular object that is not protomodular in this category.</description>

      <title>Infinitely ludic categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pursuing a new approach to the study of infinite games in combinatorics, we introduce the categories $\mathbf{Game}_{A}$ and $\mathbf{Game}_{B}$ and improve some classical results concerning topological games related to the duality between covering properties of $X$ and convergence properties of $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm {p}}(X)$ by establishing the existence and key role of certain natural transformations. We then describe these ludic categories in various equivalent forms, viewing their objects as certain structured trees, presheaves, or metric spaces, and we thereby obtain their arboreal, functorial and metrical appearances. We use their metrical disguise to demonstrate a universality property of the Banach-Mazur game. The various equivalent descriptions come with underlying functors to more familiar categories which help establishing some important properties of the game categories: they are complete, cocomplete, extensive, cartesian closed, and coregular, but neither regular nor locally cartesian closed. We prove that their classes of strong epimorphisms, of regular epimorphisms, and of descent morphisms, are all distinct, and we show that these categories have weak classifiers for strong partial maps. Some of the categorical constructions have interesting game-theoretic interpretations.</description>

      <title>Positselski duality in $\infty$-categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a contramodule over a cocommutative coalgebra in a presentably symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, and prove a symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categorical version of Positselski's comodule-contramodule correspondence when the coalgebra is coidempotent. This gives a new perspective on, and a new proof of local duality -- in the sense of Hovey--Palmieri--Strickland and Dwyer--Greenlees -- whenever $\mathcal{C}$ is stable and compactly generated. We further consider an analog of Positselski's definition of contramodules over topological rings in the $\infty$-categorical setting, and show that the two perspectives on contramodules are equivalent. As examples we describe the categories of $K(n)$-local spectra, $T(n)$-local spectra and the derived complete category of a ring $R$, as categories of contramodules.</description>

      <title>Growth Problems for Representations of Finite Monoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a conjecture for the asymptotic growth rate of the number of indecomposable summands in the tensor powers of representations of finite monoids, expressing it in terms of the (Brauer) character table of the monoid's group of units. We prove it under an additional hypothesis. We also give (exact and asymptotic) formulas for the growth rate of the length of the tensor powers when working over a good characteristic. As examples, we compute the growth rates for the full transformation monoid, the symmetric inverse monoid, and the monoid of 2 by 2 matrices. We also provide code used for our calculation.</description>

      <title>Finite symmetric algebras in tensor categories and Verlinde categories of algebraic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate objects in symmetric tensor categories that have simultaneously finite symmetric and finite exterior algebra. This forces the characteristic of the base field to be $p&gt;0$, and the maximal degree of non-vanishing symmetric and exterior powers to add up to a multiple of $p$. We give a complete classification of objects in tensor categories for which this sum equals $p$. All resulting tensor categories are Verlinde categories of reductive groups and we fill in some gaps in the literature on these categories.</description>

      <title>Generalized Rank via Minimal Subposet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a small, connected category with finite hom-sets. We show that if the embedding of a connected subcategory $\mathcal{J}$ is both initial and final, then the restriction of any $\mathcal{C}$-module along $\mathcal{J}$ preserves the generalized rank-or equivalently, the multiplicity of the ``entire" interval modules for $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{J}$. Conversely, we prove that this property characterizes initial and final embeddings when both $\mathcal{C}$ and $\mathcal{J}$ are posets satisfying certain mild constraints and the embedding is full. For $\mathcal{C}$ a poset under these conditions, we describe the minimal full subposet whose embedding is initial or final. We also extend a result of Kinser on the generalized rank invariant to small categories.</description>
