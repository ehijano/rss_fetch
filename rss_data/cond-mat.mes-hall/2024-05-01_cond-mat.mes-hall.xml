      <title>A momentum-space theory for topological magnons in 2D ferromagnetic skyrmion lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnon dynamics in skyrmion lattices have garnered significant interest due to their potential applications in topological magnonics. Existing theories often follow a single-momentum approach, assuming significant Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI) to minimize the skyrmion's dimensions, which can lead to oversimplification in describing magnon behavior. This study introduces a multi-momentum operator theory for magnons in large 2D skyrmions, where each skyrmion encompasses several thousand spins. The proposed theory fully transforms the magnon Hamiltonian into momentum space, incorporating off-diagonal terms to capture umklapp scattering caused by the skyrmion wave vectors. Our results reveal deviations from single-momentum theories, demonstrating that flat bands are not universal features of the skyrmionic magnon spectrum. Additionally, we find that manipulating the skyrmion size with an external magnetic field induces multiple topological phase transitions. At high magnetic fields, the low-energy magnon spectrum becomes densely packed and entirely topological, resembling a topological band continuum.</description>

      <title>Noise reduction by bias cooling in gated Si/SixGe1-x qunatum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon-Germanium heterostructures are a promising quantum circuit platform, but crucial aspects as the long-term charge dynamics and cooldown-to-cooldown variations are still widely unexplored quantitatively. In this letter we present the results of an extensive bias cooling study performed on gated silicon-germanium quantum dots with an Al2O3-dielectric. Over 80 cooldowns were performed in the course of our investigations. The performance of the devices is assessed by low-frequency charge noise measurements in the band of 200 micro Hertz to 10 milli Hertz. We measure the total noise power as a function of the applied voltage during cooldown in four different devices and find a minimum in noise at 0.7V bias cooling voltage for all observed samples. We manage to decrease the total noise power median by a factor of 6 and compute a reduced tunneling current density using Schr\"odinger-Poisson simulations. Furthermore, we show the variation in noise from the same device in the course of eleven different cooldowns performed under the nominally same conditions.</description>

      <title>Phase shifts, band geometry and responses in triple-Q charge and spin density waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in the impacts of phase shifts within the triple-Q spin density wave (SDW) order parameters. Concurrently, it is widely recognized that incommensurate triple-Q charge density waves (CDW) are also prevalent in low-dimensional materials, where the phase degrees of freedom in the order parameters are generally allowed. In this study, we systematically investigate the pivotal effects arising from both triple-Q CDW and SDW order parameters, with particular consideration given to possible phase shifts. We show that the phase shifts play a crucial role in determining the real-space topology of triple-Q density waves. More importantly, we show that the triple-Q CDW and SDW order parameters would influence the band geometry in the momentum space, where multiband Dirac-like fermions are induced by the triple-Q density wave order parameters near the Fermi energy. Furthermore, we explicitly establish that such nontrivial band geometry, combined with symmetry-breaking induced by phase shifts, leads to a variety of intriguing linear and nonlinear responses.</description>

      <title>Planar Hall Effect in Quasi-Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The planar Hall effect in 3D systems is an effective probe for their Berry curvature, topology, and electronic properties. However, the Berry curvature-induced conventional planar Hall effect is forbidden in 2D systems as the out-of-plane Berry curvature cannot couple to the band velocity of the electrons moving in the 2D plane. Here, we demonstrate a unique 2D planar Hall effect (2DPHE) originating from the hidden planar components of the Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment in quasi-2D materials. We identify all planar band geometric contributions to 2DPHE and classify their crystalline symmetry restrictions. Using gated bilayer graphene as an example, we show that in addition to capturing the hidden band geometric effects, 2DPHE is also sensitive to the Lifshitz transitions. Our work motivates further exploration of hidden planar band geometry-induced 2DPHE and related transport phenomena for innovative applications.</description>

      <title>Tunable viscous layers in Corbino geometry using density junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In sufficiently clean materials where electron-electron interactions are strong compared to momentum-relaxing scattering processes, electron transport resembles the flow of a viscous fluid. We study hydrodynamic electron transport across density interfaces (n-n junctions) in a 2DEG in the Corbino geometry. From numerical simulations in COMSOL using realistic parameters, we show that we can produce tunable viscous layers at the density interface by varying the density ratio of charge carriers. We quantitatively explain this observation with simple analytic expressions together with boundary conditions at the interface. We also show signatures of these viscous layers in the magnetoresistance. Breaking down viscous and ohmic contributions, we find that when outer radial region of the Corbino has higher charge density compared to the inner region, the viscous layers at the interface serve to suppress the magneto-resistance produced by momentum-relaxing scattering. Conversely, the magneto-resistance is enhanced when the inner region has higher density than the outer. Our results add to the repertoire of techniques for engineering viscous electron flows, which hold a promise for applications in future electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature thermal transport in moir\'e superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the thermal conductivity of various moir\'e bilayer systems using a continuum approach and the semiclassical transport theory. When the twist angle is close to 0, we observe a significant reduction of thermal conductivity in a particular low-temperature regime. This reduction is attributed to a moir\'e-induced reconstruction of acoustic phonon bands and associated decrease of the group velocity. Conversely, in the zero temperature limit, the thermal conductivity is enhanced by moir\'e effect, surpassing the original values in non-moir\'e counterparts. These changes result in a characteristic temperature dependence which deviates from the quadratic behavior in intrinsic two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Direct detection of down-converted photons spontaneously produced at a single Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spontaneous photon decay into multiple photons triggered by strong non-linearities in a superconducting quantum simulator of the boundary sine-Gordon impurity model. Previously, spectroscopic signatures of photon-conversion were reported and evidenced as resonances in the many-body spectrum of these systems. Here, we report on the observation of multi-mode fluorescence of a small Josephson junction embedded in a high impedance superconducting transmission line. Measurement of the down-converted photons is achieved using state-of-the-art broadband parametric amplifiers. Photon triplet emission is explicitly demonstrated at a given frequency as the counterpart of inelastic photon decay at three-times the emission frequency. These results open exciting prospects for the burgeoning field of many-body quantum optics and offer a direct signature of the ultra-strong light-matter coupling.</description>

      <title>Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in Ergodic and Nonergodic One-Dimensional Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bulk-boundary correspondence is a fundamental principle in topological physics. In recent years, there have been considerable efforts in extending the idea of geometry and topology to classical stochastic systems far from equilibrium. However, it has been unknown whether or not the bulk-boundary correspondence can be extended to the steady states of stochastic processes accompanied by additional constraints such as the conservation of probability. The present study reveals the general form of bulk-boundary correspondence in classical stochastic processes. Specifically, we prove a correspondence between the winding number and the number of localized steady states in both ergodic and nonergodic systems. Furthermore, we extend the argument of the bulk-boundary correspondence to a many-body stochastic model called the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP). These results would provide a guiding principle for exploring topological origin of localization in various stochastic processes including biological systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian line graph: A generalized approach to flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Line graph (LG) lattices are well known to host flat bands (FBs) with isotropic hoppings in $s$-orbital models. Yet, higher-angular-momentum orbitals with spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which are more common in real materials, lack a general approach for their inclusion in LG to achieve FBs. Here, we introduce a non-Abelian LG theory to construct FBs in realistic systems, which incorporates internal degrees of freedom and goes beyond real-valued isotropic hoppings. The lattice edges and sites in the LG are modified to be associated with arbitrary Hermitian matrices, refereed to as multiple LG. A crucial step is to map the multiple LG Hamiltonian to a tight-binding (TB) model that respects the lattice symmetry through appropriate local non-Abelian transformations in the internal space. We find the general conditions to determine the local transformation. Based on this mechanism, we discuss the realization of $d$-orbital FBs in the Kagome lattice, which may serve as a minimal model for understanding the high-orbital FBs with SOC in Kagome materials. Our approach bridges the known FBs in pure lattice models and the realization in multi-orbital systems.</description>

      <title>Probing valley phenomena with gate-defined valley splitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite many reports of valley-related phenomena in graphene and its multilayers, current transport experiments cannot probe valley phenomena without the application of external fields. Here we propose a gate-defined valley splitter as a direct transport probe for valley phenomenon in graphene multilayers. First, we show how the device works, its magnetotransport response, and its robustness against fabrication errors. Secondly, we present two applications for valley splitters: (i) resonant tunneling of quantum dots probed by a valley splitter shows the valley polarization of dot levels; (ii) a combination of two valley splitters resolves the nature of order parameters in mesoscopic samples.</description>

      <title>Interplay between domain walls and magnetization curling induced by chemical modulations in cylindrical nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cylindrical magnetic nanowires have been proposed as a means of storing and processing information in a 3D medium, based on the motion of domain walls~(DWs). Introducing short chemical modulations in such wires would allow for reliable digital control of DWs. Here, we outline the intricate physics of the interaction of domain walls with modulations to control their motion, combining micromagnetic simulations and experimental evidence. This interaction combines a long-range moderate magnetostatic repulsion with a local energy well. The latter depends on the respective circulation sense of magnetization in the domain wall and modulation. We also show that a modulation has the ability to switch the internal circulation of a DW upon its propagation, thereby acting as a polarizing component and opening the possibility to exploit not only the position of walls, but also their internal structure.</description>

      <title>Dipole-Obstructed Cooper Pairing: Theory and Application to $j=3/2$ Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Like electrons, Cooper pairs can carry a monopole charge if the pairing electrons come from two or more Fermi surfaces with different Chern numbers. In such an instance, a superconductor is necessarily nodal due to an inherent topological pairing obstruction. In this work, we show that a similar obstruction is also possible when there is only one Fermi surface involved in the pairing process. By developing a Chern-vorticity theorem, we have identified a class of Fermi surfaces with a quantized dipolar Berry flux pattern, where all intra-Fermi-surface Cooper pairings are ``dipole-obstructed" and nodal. As a real-world application, we find that the dipole obstruction plays a crucial role in stabilizing the superconducting nodal structure for $j=3/2$ half-Heusler compounds.</description>

      <title>Near Infrared Diffuse Interstellar Bands Characterized by Fullerene and Graphene Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astronomical near-infrared Diffuse-Interstellar-Bands (DIBs) were characterized by pure carbon Fullerene and Graphene molecules comparing with laboratory experiment and with Time-Dependent Density-Functional-Theory (TD-DFT) analysis. It is well known that two large DIBs of Fullerene cation (C60)+ at 9577A and 9632A coincide well with laboratory experiments. Those are thought to be split bands by the Jahn-Teller molecular deformation. In our TD-DFT calculation, those are reproduced by degenerated bands at 9549A and 9552A before deformation. Cation enriching experiment by Strelnikov et al. suggested longer wavelength two bands of DIB10542 and DIB10610 (observed by Hamano et al.), which may split from calculated 10410A and 10411A. Also, we noticed shorter wavelength experimental band around 8550A, which may relate to calculated 8677A and 8686A. We challenged such analysis on Graphene molecules as like (C54) (C53) (C52) and (C51), which are carbon hexagon and pentagon combined molecules. Calculation could reproduce many near-infrared bands. Calculated bands of (C54) suggest that one DIB among (DIB9577, DIB9632, or DIB9673) may correspond to one of (DIB10361, DIB10394, or DIB10439). Calculated bands of (C51) suggest that one of (DIB9686, DIB9987, or DIB10006) may relate to one of (DIB10262 or DIB10288). Combining astronomical observation, laboratory experiment, and quantum chemical analysis, we could suggest carrier candidates of DIBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interplay between topology and interaction always plays an important role in condensed matter physics and induces many exotic quantum phases, while rare transition metal layered material (TMLM) has been proved to possess both. Here we report a TMLM Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ has the two-dimensional second-order topology (also a quadrupole topological insulator) with correlated edge states - Luttinger liquid. It is ascribed to the unconventional nature of the mismatch between charge- and atomic- centers induced by a remarkable double-band inversion. This one-dimensional protected edge state preserves the Luttinger liquid behavior with robustness and universality in scale from micro- to macro- size, leading to a significant anisotropic electrical transport through two-dimensional sides of bulk materials. Moreover, the bulk gap can be modulated by the thickness, resulting in an extensive-range phase diagram for Luttinger liquid. These provide an attractive model to study the interaction and quantum phases in correlated topological systems.</description>

      <title>Amoeba Formulation of Non-Bloch Band Theory in Arbitrary Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect dramatically reshapes the energy bands of non-Hermitian systems, meaning that the usual Bloch band theory is fundamentally inadequate as their characterization. The non-Bloch band theory, in which the concept of Brillouin zone is generalized, has been widely applied to investigate non-Hermitian systems in one spatial dimension. However, its generalization to higher dimensions has been challenging. Here, we develop a formulation of the non-Hermitian skin effect and non-Bloch band theory in arbitrary spatial dimensions, which is based on a natural geometrical object known as the amoeba. Our theory provides a general framework for studying non-Hermitian bands beyond one dimension. Key quantities of non-Hermitian bands, including the energy spectrum, eigenstates profiles, and the generalized Brillouin zone, can be efficiently obtained from this approach.</description>

      <title>In-plane magnetic field driven conductance modulations in topological insulator kinks</title>

Abstract: We present low-temperature magnetoconductance measurements on Bi$_{1.5}$Sb$_{0.5}$Te$_{1.8}$Se$_{1.2}$ kinks with ribbon-shaped legs. The conductance displays a clear dependence on the in-plane magnetic field orientation. The conductance modulation is consistent with orbital effect-driven trapping of the topological surface states on different side facets of the legs of the kink, which affects their transmission across the kink. This magnetic field-driven trapping and conductance pattern can be explained with a semiclassical picture and is supported by quantum transport simulations. The interpretation is corroborated by varying the angle of the kink and analyzing the temperature dependence of the observed magnetoconductance pattern, indicating the importance of phase coherence along the cross section perimeter of the kink legs.</description>

      <title>Gain-compensated metal cavity modes and a million-fold improvement of Purcell factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a rigorous mode theory for gain-compensated plasmonic dimers, we demonstrate how quality factors and Purcell factors can be dramatically increased, improving the quality factors from 10 to over 26,000 and the peak Purcell factors from around 3000 to over 10 billion. Full three-dimensional calculations are presented for gold dimers in a finite-size gain medium, which allows one to easily surpass fundamental Purcell factor limits of lossy media. Within a regime of linear system response, we show how the Purcell factors are modified from the contributions from the projected local density of states as well as a non-local gain. Further, we show that the effective mode volume and radiative beta factors remain relatively constant, despite the significant enhancement of the Purcell factors.</description>

      <title>Percolative supercurrent in superconductor-ferromagnetic insulator bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report tunneling spectroscopy and transport measurements in superconducting Al and ferromagnetic-insulator EuS bilayers. The samples display remanent spin-splitting, roughly half the superconducting gap, and supercurrent transport above the average paramagnetic limit. We interpret this behavior as arising from the interplay between two characteristic length scales: the superconducting coherence length, $\xi$, and the magnetic domain size, $d$. By comparing experimental results to a theoretical model, we find $\xi/d \approx 10$. In this regime, spin-averaging across the micromagnetic configuration can locally suppress superconductivity, resulting in percolative supercurrent flow.</description>
