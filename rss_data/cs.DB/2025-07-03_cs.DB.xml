      <title>Template-Based Schema Matching of Multi-Layout Tenancy Schedules:A Comparative Study of a Template-Based Hybrid Matcher and the ALITE Full Disjunction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lack of standardized tabular formats for tenancy schedules across real estate firms creates significant inefficiencies in data integration. Existing automated integration methods, such as Full Disjunction (FD)-based models like ALITE, prioritize completeness but result in schema bloat, sparse attributes and limited business usability. We propose a novel hybrid, template-based schema matcher that aligns multi-layout tenancy schedules to a predefined target schema. The matcher combines schema (Jaccard, Levenshtein) and instance-based metrics (data types, distributions) with globally optimal assignments determined via the Hungarian Algorithm. Evaluation against a manually labeled ground truth demonstrates substantial improvements, with grid search optimization yielding a peak F1-score of 0.881 and an overall null percentage of 45.7%. On a separate ground truth of 20 semantically similar column sets, ALITE achieves an F1-score of 0.712 and 75.6% nulls. These results suggest that combining structured business knowledge with hybrid matching can yield more usable and business-aligned schema mappings. The approach assumes cleanly extracted tabular input, future work could explore extending the matcher to support complex, composite tables.</description>

      <title>SAT-BO: Verification Rule Learning and Optimization for FraudTransaction Detection</title>

Abstract: Electronic payment platforms are estimated to process billions oftransactions daily, with the cumulative value of these transactionspotentially reaching into the trillions. Even a minor error within thishigh-volume environment could precipitate substantial financiallosses. To mitigate this risk, manually constructed verification rules,developed by domain experts, are typically employed to identifyand scrutinize transactions in production environments. However,due to the absence of a systematic approach to ensure the robust-ness of these verification rules against vulnerabilities, they remainsusceptible to exploitation.To mitigate this risk, manually constructed verification rules, de-veloped by domain experts, are typically employed to identify andscrutinize transactions in production environments. However, dueto the absence of a systematic approach to ensure the robustness ofthese verification rules against vulnerabilities, they remain suscep-tible to exploitation. To ensure data security, database maintainersusually compose complex verification rules to check whether aquery/update request is valid. However, the rules written by ex-perts are usually imperfect, and malicious requests may bypassthese rules. As a result, the demand for identifying the defects ofthe rules systematically emerges.</description>

      <title>PathDB: A system for evaluating regular path queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PathDB is a Java-based graph database designed for in-memory data loading and querying. By utilizing Regular Path Queries (RPQ) and a closed path algebra, PathDB processes paths through its three main components: the parser, the logical plan, and the physical plan. This modular design allows for targeted optimizations and modifications without impacting overall functionality. Benchmark experiments illustrate PathDB's execution times and flexibility in handling dynamic and complex path queries, compared to baseline methods like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) guided by an automaton, highlighting PathDB optimizations that contribute to its performance. PathDB was also evaluated against leading commercial graph systems, including Neo4j, Memgraph, and K\`uzu. Benchmark experiments demonstrated PathDB competitive execution times and its ability to support a wide range of path query types.</description>

      <title>Down with the Hierarchy: The 'H' in HNSW Stands for "Hubs"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01940v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven by recent breakthrough advances in neural representation learning, approximate near-neighbor (ANN) search over vector embeddings has emerged as a critical computational workload. With the introduction of the seminal Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm, graph-based indexes have established themselves as the overwhelmingly dominant paradigm for efficient and scalable ANN search. As the name suggests, HNSW searches a layered hierarchical graph to quickly identify neighborhoods of similar points to a given query vector. But is this hierarchy even necessary? A rigorous experimental analysis to answer this question would provide valuable insights into the nature of algorithm design for ANN search and motivate directions for future work in this increasingly crucial domain. We conduct an extensive benchmarking study covering more large-scale datasets than prior investigations of this question. We ultimately find that a flat navigable small world graph graph retains all of the benefits of HNSW on high-dimensional datasets, with latency and recall performance essentially \emph{identical} to the original algorithm but with less memory overhead. Furthermore, we go a step further and study \emph{why} the hierarchy of HNSW provides no benefit in high dimensions, hypothesizing that navigable small world graphs contain a well-connected, frequently traversed ``highway" of hub nodes that maintain the same purported function as the hierarchical layers. We present compelling empirical evidence that the \emph{Hub Highway Hypothesis} holds for real datasets and investigate the mechanisms by which the highway forms. The implications of this hypothesis may also provide future research directions in developing enhancements to graph-based ANN search.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Graph Inference with Skyline Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inference queries have been routinely issued to graph machine learning models such as graph neural networks (GNNs) for various network analytical tasks. Nevertheless, GNNs outputs are often hard to interpret comprehensively. Existing methods typically compromise to individual pre-defined explainability measures (such as fidelity), which often leads to biased, ``one-sided'' interpretations. This paper introduces skyline explanation, a new paradigm that interprets GNN output by simultaneously optimizing multiple explainability measures of users' interests. (1) We propose skyline explanations as a Pareto set of explanatory subgraphs that dominate others over multiple explanatory measures. We formulate skyline explanation as a multi-criteria optimization problem, and establish its hardness results. (2) We design efficient algorithms with an onion-peeling approach, which strategically prioritizes nodes and removes unpromising edges to incrementally assemble skyline explanations. (3) We also develop an algorithm to diversify the skyline explanations to enrich the comprehensive interpretation. (4) We introduce efficient parallel algorithms with load-balancing strategies to scale skyline explanation for large-scale GNN-based inference. Using real-world and synthetic graphs, we experimentally verify our algorithms' effectiveness and scalability.</description>
