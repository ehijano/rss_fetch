      <title>Estimating energy levels from lattice QCD correlation functions using a transfer matrix formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient method for estimating energy levels from lattice QCD correlation functions by computing the eigenvalues of the transfer matrix of the corresponding lattice QCD Hamiltonian. This method is equivalent to the Lanczos procedure introduced recently (Wagman-2024), but more general and simpler to implement. We demonstrate the efficacy of the method by calculating the two lowest energy levels of a large number of hadrons including a few nuclei. While the signal-to-noise problem does not improve significantly, the extracted energy levels are found to be more reliable, compared to those extracted by conventional methods. Within a given statistical dataset the proposed method can effectively account for both statistical uncertainties and systematic errors, including those arising from the fitting window, and hence can reliably be employed in lattice QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Diffusion models learn distributions generated by complex Langevin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probability distribution effectively sampled by a complex Langevin process for theories with a sign problem is not known a priori and notoriously hard to understand. Diffusion models, a class of generative AI, can learn distributions from data. In this contribution, we explore the ability of diffusion models to learn the distributions created by a complex Langevin process.</description>

      <title>Regulating chiral gauge theory at $\theta=0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has recently been argued that a proposal to nonperturbatively regulate chiral gauge theories on the boundary of a five-dimensional lattice will fail due to the existence of exact $U(1)$ symmetries not present in the target theories. A related observation is that in the presence of gauge fields with nontrivial topology, fermion zeromodes will appear embedded in the extra dimension which do not decouple from the four-dimensional world. Here we show that these problems can be evaded by simulating the theory in the trivial topological sector of the boundary gauge fields. A regulated version of the Standard Model using this approach in the continuum and large volume limits is expected to appear as if it possessed a Peccei-Quinn mechanism for relaxing $\theta_\text{QCD}$ to zero, without there being an axion in the spectrum.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a first-principles non-perturbative determination of the mass of the lightest gluino-gluon bound state (gluino-glue) in large-$N$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ Supersymmetric Yang--Mills theory by means of numerical Monte Carlo simulations of the lattice-discretized theory, and exploiting large-$N$ twisted volume reduction. Our large-$N$ determination is consistent with naive extrapolation of previously-known $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ results.</description>

      <title>Lefschetz thimble-inspired weight regularizations for complex Langevin simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex Langevin (CL) is a computational method to circumvent the numerical sign problem with applications in finite-density quantum chromodynamics and the real-time dynamics of quantum field theories. It has long been known that, depending on the simulated system, CL does not always converge correctly. In this work, we provide numerical evidence that the success or failure of the complex Langevin method is deeply tied to the Lefschetz thimble structure of the simulated system. This is demonstrated by constructing weight function regularizations that deform the thimbles of systems with compact domains. Our results indicate that CL converges correctly when the regularized system exhibits a single relevant compact thimble. We introduce a bias correction to retrieve the values of the original theory for parameter sets where a direct complex Langevin approach fails. The effectiveness of this method is illustrated using several toy models, including the cosine model and the SU(2) and SU(3) Polyakov chains. Finally, we discuss the opportunities and limitations of this regularization approach for lattice field theories.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Dirac spectrum from chiral symmetry restoration and the fate of $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I discuss chiral symmetry restoration in the chiral limit $m\to 0$ of QCD with two light quark flavours of mass $m$, focussing on its consequences for scalar and pseudoscalar susceptibilities, and on the resulting constraints on the Dirac spectrum. I show that $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry remains broken in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ symmetric phase if the spectral density $\rho(\lambda;m)$ develops a singular near-zero peak, tending to $O(m^4)/\lambda$ in the chiral limit. Moreover, $\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ restoration requires that the number of modes in the peak be proportional to the topological susceptibility, indicating that such a peak must be of topological origin.</description>

      <title>Taming NSPT fluctuations in $O(N)$ Non-Linear Sigma Model: simulations in the large $N$ regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Non-Linear Sigma Model (NLSM) is an example of a field theory on a target space exhibiting intricate geometry. One remarkable characteristic of the NLSM is asymptotic freedom, which triggers interest in perturbative calculations. In the lattice formulation of NLSM, one would naturally rely on Numerical Stochastic Perturbation Theory (NSPT) to conduct high-order computations. However, when dealing with low-dimensional systems, NSPT reveals increasing statistical fluctuations with higher and higher orders. This of course does not come as a surprise and one is ready to live with this, as long as the noise is not going to completely kill the signal, which unfortunately in some models does take place. We investigate how, in the $O(N)$ context, this behaviour strongly depends on $N$. As expected, larger $N$ values make higher-order computations feasible.</description>

      <title>Precision study of the massive Schwinger model near quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a numerical analysis of the massive Schwinger model in the presence of a background electric field. Using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) approach, we efficiently compute the spectrum of the Schwinger model on a staggered lattice with up to 3000 qubits. As a result, we achieve a precise computation of the critical mass of the massive Schwinger model to five digits using four different 'criticality criteria', observing perfect agreement among them. Additionally, we discuss the effect of a four-fermion operator deformation of the Schwinger model and compute the critical mass for various values of the deformation parameter.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic polarizabilities of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ singly heavy baryons in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the electromagnetic polarizabilities of the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ singly heavy baryons in the heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory up to $\mathcal{O}(p^3)$. We estimate the low-energy constants using the magnetic moments of singly charmed baryons from lattice QCD simulations and the experimental decay widths of $\Sigma_c$ and $\Sigma_c^*$. Our results indicate that the long-range chiral corrections make significant contributions to the polarizabilities. Additionally, the magnetic dipole transitions $\mathcal{B}_6^* \to \mathcal{B}_6 +\gamma $ also provide large contribution to the magnetic polarizabilities.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative constraints on perturbation theory at finite temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has long been understood that the inclusion of temperature in the perturbative treatment of quantum field theories leads to complications that are not present at zero temperature. In these proceedings we report on the non-perturbative obstructions that arise, and how these lead to deviations in the predictions of lattice scalar correlation functions in massive $\phi^{4}$ theory. Using the known non-perturbative spectral constraints satisfied by finite-temperature correlation functions we outline why the presence of distinct particle-like excitations could provide a resolution to these issues.</description>

      <title>Transverse Momentum Distributions from Lattice QCD without Wilson Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01391v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs), which are defined by gauge-invariant 3D parton correlators with staple-shaped lightlike Wilson lines, can be calculated from quark and gluon correlators fixed in the Coulomb gauge on a Euclidean lattice. These quantities can be expressed gauge-invariantly as the correlators of Coulomb-gauge-dressed fields, which reduce to the standard TMD correlators under principal-value prescription in the infinite boost limit. In the framework of Large-Momentum Effective Theory, a quasi-TMD defined from such correlators in a large-momentum hadron state can be matched to the TMD via a factorization formula, whose exact form is derived using Soft Collinear Effective Theory and verified at one-loop order. Compared to the currently used gauge-invariant correlators, this new method can substantially improve statistical precision and simplify renormalization for the time-reversal-even TMDs, which will greatly enhance the predicative power of lattice QCD in the non-perturbative region.</description>

      <title>Analytic and numerical bootstrap for the long-range Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02742v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine perturbation theory with analytic and numerical bootstrap techniques to study the critical point of the long-range Ising (LRI) model in two and three dimensions. This model interpolates between short-range Ising (SRI) and mean-field behaviour. We use the Lorentzian inversion formula to compute infinitely many three-loop corrections in the two-dimensional LRI near the mean-field end. We further exploit the exact OPE relations that follow from bulk locality of the LRI to compute infinitely many two-loop corrections near the mean-field end, as well as some one-loop corrections near SRI. By including such exact OPE relations in the crossing equations for LRI we set up a very constrained bootstrap problem, which we solve numerically using SDPB. We find a family of sharp kinks for two- and three-dimensional theories which compare favourably to perturbative predictions, as well as some Monte Carlo simulations for the two-dimensional LRI.</description>

      <title>Roberge-Weiss periodicity and singularity in hadron resonance gas model with excluded volume effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum chromodynamics (QCD) with pure imaginary baryon number chemical potential mu =i theta T, where T is temperature and theta is a real number, has the Roberge-Weiss periodicity. We study the theta-dependence of the baryon number density and the pressure in the hadron resonance gas model with excluded volume effects of baryons. It is shown that the baryon number density and the pressure are smooth periodic functions of theta at low or high temperature. However, they have singular behavior at theta =(2k+1)pi where k is an integer, when T sim 211MeV. This temperature is consistent with the Roberge-Weiss transition temperature TRW obtained by lattice QCD simulations. This singularity can be explained by the dual excluded volume effects in which the roles of point-like and non point-like particles are exchanged each other in the ordinary excluded volume effects. It is also indicated that the excluded volume effect is visible just below TRW and is directly detectable by the lattice QCD simulation at finite theta. We compare the results with the one obtained by the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model.</description>
