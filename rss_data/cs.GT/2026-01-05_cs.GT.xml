      <title>Sparse Probabilistic Coalition Structure Generation: Bayesian Greedy Pursuit and $\ell_1$ Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study coalition structure generation (CSG) when coalition values are not given but must be learned from episodic observations. We model each episode as a sparse linear regression problem, where the realised payoff \(Y_t\) is a noisy linear combination of a small number of coalition contributions. This yields a probabilistic CSG framework in which the planner first estimates a sparse value function from \(T\) episodes, then runs a CSG solver on the inferred coalition set. We analyse two estimation schemes. The first, Bayesian Greedy Coalition Pursuit (BGCP), is a greedy procedure that mimics orthogonal matching pursuit. Under a coherence condition and a minimum signal assumption, BGCP recovers the true set of profitable coalitions with high probability once \(T \gtrsim K \log m\), and hence yields welfare-optimal structures. The second scheme uses an \(\ell_1\)-penalised estimator; under a restricted eigenvalue condition, we derive \(\ell_1\) and prediction error bounds and translate them into welfare gap guarantees. We compare both methods to probabilistic baselines and identify regimes where sparse probabilistic CSG is superior, as well as dense regimes where classical least-squares approaches are competitive.</description>

      <title>Unifying Proportional Fairness in Centroid and Non-Centroid Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proportional fairness criteria inspired by democratic ideals of proportional representation have received growing attention in the clustering literature. Prior work has investigated them in two separate paradigms. Chen et al. [ICML 2019] study centroid clustering, in which each data point's loss is determined by its distance to a representative point (centroid) chosen in its cluster. Caragiannis et al. [NeurIPS 2024] study non-centroid clustering, in which each data point's loss is determined by its maximum distance to any other data point in its cluster.
  We generalize both paradigms to introduce semi-centroid clustering, in which each data point's loss is a combination of its centroid and non-centroid losses, and study two proportional fairness criteria -- the core and, its relaxation, fully justified representation (FJR). Our main result is a novel algorithm which achieves a constant approximation to the core, in polynomial time, even when the distance metrics used for centroid and non-centroid loss measurements are different. We also derive improved results for more restricted loss functions and the weaker FJR criterion, and establish lower bounds in each case.</description>

      <title>The CoinAlg Bind: Profitability-Fairness Tradeoffs in Collective Investment Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective Investment Algorithms (CoinAlgs) are increasingly popular systems that deploy shared trading strategies for investor communities. Their goal is to democratize sophisticated -- often AI-based -- investing tools. We identify and demonstrate a fundamental profitability-fairness tradeoff in CoinAlgs that we call the CoinAlg Bind: CoinAlgs cannot ensure economic fairness without losing profit to arbitrage. We present a formal model of CoinAlgs, with definitions of privacy (incomplete algorithm disclosure) and economic fairness (value extraction by an adversarial insider). We prove two complementary results that together demonstrate the CoinAlg Bind. First, privacy in a CoinAlg is a precondition for insider attacks on economic fairness. Conversely, in a game-theoretic model, lack of privacy, i.e., transparency, enables arbitrageurs to erode the profitability of a CoinAlg. Using data from Uniswap, a decentralized exchange, we empirically study both sides of the CoinAlg Bind. We quantify the impact of arbitrage against transparent CoinAlgs. We show the risks posed by a private CoinAlg: Even low-bandwidth covert-channel information leakage enables unfair value extraction.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Rule-Based Strategy modeling in Classic Indian Rummy: A Metric Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 13-card variant of Classic Indian Rummy is a sequential game of incomplete information that requires probabilistic reasoning and combinatorial decision-making. This paper proposes a rule-based framework for strategic play, driven by a new hand-evaluation metric termed MinDist. The metric modifies the MinScore metric by quantifying the edit distance between a hand and the nearest valid configuration, thereby capturing structural proximity to completion. We design a computationally efficient algorithm derived from the MinScore algorithm, leveraging dynamic pruning and pattern caching to exactly calculate this metric during play. Opponent hand-modeling is also incorporated within a two-player zero-sum simulation framework, and the resulting strategies are evaluated using statistical hypothesis testing. Empirical results show significant improvement in win rates for MinDist-based agents over traditional heuristics, providing a formal and interpretable step toward algorithmic Rummy strategy design.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inverse Games with High-Dimensional Multi-Modal Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many multi-agent interaction scenarios can be naturally modeled as noncooperative games, where each agent's decisions depend on others' future actions. However, deploying game-theoretic planners for autonomous decision-making requires a specification of all agents' objectives. To circumvent this practical difficulty, recent work develops maximum likelihood techniques for solving inverse games that can identify unknown agent objectives from interaction data. Unfortunately, these methods only infer point estimates and do not quantify estimator uncertainty; correspondingly, downstream planning decisions can overconfidently commit to unsafe actions. We present an approximate Bayesian inference approach for solving the inverse game problem, which can incorporate observation data from multiple modalities and be used to generate samples from the Bayesian posterior over the hidden agent objectives given limited sensor observations in real time. Concretely, the proposed Bayesian inverse game framework trains a structured variational autoencoder with an embedded differentiable Nash game solver on interaction datasets and does not require labels of agents' true objectives. Extensive experiments show that our framework successfully learns prior and posterior distributions, improves inference quality over maximum likelihood estimation-based inverse game approaches, and enables safer downstream decision-making without sacrificing efficiency. When trajectory information is uninformative or unavailable, multimodal inference further reduces uncertainty by exploiting additional observation modalities.</description>

      <title>Constant Inapproximability of Pacing Equilibria in Second-Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the problem of approximating a pacing equilibrium in second-price auctions, introduced by Conitzer, Kroer, Sodomka, and Moses [Oper. Res. 2022]. We show that finding a constant-factor approximation of a pacing equilibrium is PPAD-hard, thereby strengthening previous results of Chen, Kroer, and Kumar [Math. Oper. Res. 2024], which established PPAD-hardness only for inverse-polynomial approximations.</description>

      <title>Introspectively Envy-Free and Efficient Allocation of Indivisible Mixed Manna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of allocations that are fair and efficient, simultaneously, is a central inquiry in fair division literature. A prominent result in discrete fair division shows that the complementary desiderata of fairness and efficiency can be achieved together when allocating indivisible items with nonnegative values; specifically, for indivisible goods and among agents with additive valuations, there always exists an allocation that is both envy-free up to one item (EF1) and Pareto efficient (PO). While a recent breakthrough extends the EF1 and PO guarantee to indivisible chores (items with negative values), the question remains open for indivisible mixed manna, i.e., for indivisible items whose values can be positive, negative, or zero. The current work makes notable progress in resolving this central question.
  For indivisible mixed manna and additive valuations, we establish the existence of allocations that are PO and introspectively envy-free up to one item (IEF1). In an IEF1 allocation, each agent can eliminate its envy towards all the other agents by either adding an item or removing an item from its own bundle. The notion of IEF1 coincides with EF1 for indivisible chores, and hence, our result generalizes the aforementioned existence guarantee for chores. Our techniques can be adopted to obtain an alternative proof for the existence of EF1 and PO allocations of indivisible goods. Hence, along with the result for mixed manna, we provide a unified approach for establishing the EF1 and PO guarantee for indivisible goods and indivisible chores. We also utilize our result for indivisible items to develop a distinct proof of the noted EF and PO guarantee for divisible mixed manna. Our work highlights an interesting application of the Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz (KKM) Theorem in discrete fair division and develops multiple, novel structural insights and algorithmic ideas.</description>

      <title>Density-Based Algorithms for Corruption-Robust Contextual Search and Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.07528v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of contextual search, a generalization of binary search in higher dimensions, in the adversarial noise model. Let $d$ be the dimension of the problem, $T$ be the time horizon and $C$ be the total amount of adversarial noise in the system. We focus on the $\epsilon$-ball and the symmetric loss. For the $\epsilon$-ball loss, we give a tight regret bound of $O(C + d \log(1/\epsilon))$ improving over the $O(d^3 \log(1/\epsilon) \log^2(T) + C \log(T) \log(1/\epsilon))$ bound of Krishnamurthy et al (Operations Research '23). For the symmetric loss, we give an efficient algorithm with regret $O(C+d \log T)$. To tackle the symmetric loss case, we study the more general setting of Corruption-Robust Convex Optimization with Subgradient feedback, which is of independent interest.
  Our techniques are a significant departure from prior approaches. Specifically, we keep track of density functions over the candidate target vectors instead of a knowledge set consisting of the candidate target vectors consistent with the feedback obtained.</description>
