      <title>GRACE: an Agentic AI for Particle Physics Experiment Design and Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present GRACE, a simulation-native agent for autonomous experimental design in high-energy and nuclear physics. Given multimodal input in the form of a natural-language prompt or a published experimental paper, the agent extracts a structured representation of the experiment, constructs a runnable toy simulation, and autonomously explores design modifications using first-principles Monte Carlo methods. Unlike agentic systems focused on operational control or execution of predefined procedures, GRACE addresses the upstream problem of experimental design: proposing non-obvious modifications to detector geometry, materials, and configurations that improve physics performance under physical and practical constraints. The agent evaluates candidate designs through repeated simulation, physics-motivated utility functions, and budget-aware escalation from fast parametric models to full Geant4 simulations, while maintaining strict reproducibility and provenance tracking. We demonstrate the framework on historical experimental setups, showing that the agent can identify optimization directions that align with known upgrade priorities, using only baseline simulation inputs. We also conducted a benchmark in which the agent identified the setup and proposed improvements from a suite of natural language prompts, with some supplied with a relevant physics research paper, of varying high energy physics (HEP) problem settings. This work establishes experimental design as a constrained search problem under physical law and introduces a new benchmark for autonomous, simulation-driven scientific reasoning in complex instruments.</description>

      <title>Inclusive Flavour Tagging at LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new algorithm based on a deep neural network, DeepSets, for tagging the production flavour of neutral $B^0$ and $B^0_s$ mesons in proton-proton collisions is presented. Exploiting a comprehensive set of tracks associated with the hadronization process, the algorithm is calibrated on data collected by the LHCb experiment at a centre-of-mass energy of $13$ TeV. This inclusive approach enhances the flavour tagging performance beyond the established same-side and opposite-side tagging methods. The observed gains in tagging power of $35\%$ for $B^0$ mesons and $20\%$ for $B_s^0$ mesons relative to the combined performance of the existing LHCb flavour-tagging algorithms offer significant benefits for precision measurements of $C\!P$ violation and mixing in the neutral $B$ meson systems.</description>

      <title>The COHERENT Experiment: 2026 Update</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COHERENT experiment measures neutrino-induced recoils from coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CEvNS) with multiple nuclear targets at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), USA. Several successful CEvNS measurements have been achieved in recent years with tens-of-kg detector masses, with a CsI scintillating crystal, a liquid argon single-phase detector, and high-purity germanium spectrometers. For the next phase, COHERENT aims at high-statistics detection of CEvNS events for precision tests of the standard model of particle physics, and to probe new physics beyond-the-standard model. Percent-level precision can be achieved by lowering thresholds, reducing backgrounds, and by scaling up the detector masses. It goes hand in hand with benchmarking the neutrino flux from the SNS. Further detectors will measure CEvNS in additional nuclei, including lighter target nuclei such as sodium and neon, to continue to test the expected neutron-number-squared dependence of the cross section. COHERENT can furthermore study charged-current and neutral-current inelastic neutrino-nucleus cross sections on various nuclei at neutrino energies below $\sim$50 MeV. Many of these cross sections have never been measured before, but are critical input for the interpretation of core-collapse supernova detection in large-scale neutrino experiments such as DUNE, Super-K, Hyper-K, and HALO.</description>

      <title>Enabling Low-Latency Machine learning on Radiation-Hard FPGAs with hls4ml</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first demonstration of a viable, ultra-fast, radiation-hard machine learning (ML) application on FPGAs, which could be used in future high-energy physics experiments. We present a three-fold contribution, with the PicoCal calorimeter, planned for the LHCb Upgrade II experiment, used as a test case. First, we develop a lightweight autoencoder to compress a 32-sample timing readout, representative of that of the PicoCal, into a two-dimensional latent space. Second, we introduce a systematic, hardware-aware quantization strategy and show that the model can be reduced to 10-bit weights with minimal performance loss. Third, as a barrier to the adoption of on-detector ML is the lack of support for radiation-hard FPGAs in the High-Energy Physics community's standard ML synthesis tool, hls4ml, we develop a new backend for this library. This new back-end enables the automatic translation of ML models into High-Level Synthesis (HLS) projects for the Microchip PolarFire family of FPGAs, one of the few commercially available and radiation hard FPGAs. We present the synthesis of the autoencoder on a target PolarFire FPGA, which indicates that a latency of 25 ns can be achieved. We show that the resources utilized are low enough that the model can be placed within the inherently protected logic of the FPGA. Our extension to hls4ml is a significant contribution, paving the way for broader adoption of ML on FPGAs in high-radiation environments.</description>

      <title>Neural Scaling Laws for Boosted Jet Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established that scaling compute, through joint increases in model capacity and dataset size, is the primary driver of performance in modern machine learning. While machine learning has long been an integral component of High Energy Physics (HEP) data analysis workflows, the compute used to train state-of-the-art HEP models remains orders of magnitude below that of industry foundation models. With scaling laws only beginning to be studied in the field, we investigate neural scaling laws for boosted jet classification using the public JetClass dataset. We derive compute optimal scaling laws and identify an effective performance limit that can be consistently approached through increased compute. We study how data repetition, common in HEP where simulation is expensive, modifies the scaling yielding a quantifiable effective dataset size gain. We then study how the scaling coefficients and asymptotic performance limits vary with the choice of input features and particle multiplicity, demonstrating that increased compute reliably drives performance toward an asymptotic limit, and that more expressive, lower-level features can raise the performance limit and improve results at fixed dataset size.</description>

      <title>Dispersive analysis of the $\boldsymbol{\phi \to \gamma \pi^0 \pi^0}$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the radiative decay $\phi \to \gamma \pi^0 \pi^0$ in a dispersive framework, where the two-pion subsystem undergoes strong final-state interactions that cover the $f_0(500)$ and $f_0(980)$ regions. We employ a coupled-channel Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es framework that allows for a consistent treatment of two scalar resonances and crossed-channel singularities induced by the Born and vector-meson exchanges. We explicitly verify the equivalence between the modified and standard Muskhelishvili-Omn\`es representations for vector-meson pole contributions when the isoscalar Omn\`es matrix is chosen asymptotically bounded, and we adopt the standard representation in decay kinematics. This yields, for the first time, a parameter-free dispersive prediction for the kaon Born rescattering, which provides a dominant contribution. To obtain a good fit to the KLOE and SND data, we employ a once-subtracted coupled-channel dispersion relation with heavier left-hand cut contributions and two unknown subtraction constants. The results demonstrate the consistency among the data for $\pi\pi$ scattering, $\gamma\gamma$ fusion, and $\phi $ radiative decay, thereby validating the underlying dispersive formalism and the input used for the hadronic Omn\`es matrix and left-hand cuts.</description>

      <title>Experimental characterization of the hierarchy of quantum correlations in top quark pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results from the Large Hadron Collider have demonstrated quantum entanglement of top quark-antiquark pairs using the spin degree of freedom. Based on the doubly differential measurement of the spin density matrix of the top quark and antiquark performed by the CMS collaboration in the helicity and beam bases, we evaluate a set of quantum observables, including discord, steering, Bell correlation, and magic. These observables allow for a quantitative characterization of the quantum correlations present in a top quark--antiquark system, thus enabling an interpretation of collider data in terms of quantum states and their properties. Discord is observed to be greater than zero with a significance of more than 5 standard deviations ($\sigma$). Evidence for steering is found with a significance of more than 3$\sigma$. This is the first evidence for steering, and the first observation of discord in a high-energy system. No Bell correlation is observed within the currently probed phase space, in agreement with the theoretical prediction. These results experimentally corroborate the full hierarchy of quantum correlations in top quarks with discord being the most basic form of quantum correlation, followed by entanglement, steering and Bell correlation. The significance of nonzero magic, which is a complementary observable to the quantum-correlation hierarchy, is found to exceed 5$\sigma$ in several regions of phase space.</description>

      <title>Excluding MeV-scale QCD axions by $K_L \to \pi^0\pi^0 a$ at KTeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An interesting proposal suggests that a QCD axion $(a)$ coupling to the up quark, down quark, and electron remains viable for an axion mass near 10~MeV. In this paper, this possibility is reexamined by deriving new bounds from kaon decays. In particular, we perform a detailed analysis of the $K_L \to \pi^0 \pi^0 e^+ e^-$ measurement reported by the KTeV experiment, and reinterpret $K^+$ decay measurements at the E949 and NA62 experiments to constrain both the diphoton decay and effectively invisible decay modes of the axion. We find that, combined with the previously known bounds, the viable window for the MeV-scale QCD axion is excluded, primarily due to the KTeV bound. Uncertainties associated with the chiral Lagrangian are further examined, and the scenario remains excluded even after accounting for these uncertainties, except for a tiny region of parameter space where higher-order corrections must finely cancel the leading-order contribution, suppressing the branching ratio of $K_L\to \pi^0\pi^0 a$ by three orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Real-time graph neural networks on FPGAs for the Belle II electromagnetic calorimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the development and evaluation of a real-time Graph Neural Network-based trigger for the electromagnetic calorimeter of the Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider. The algorithm processes calorimeter trigger cells as graph nodes to perform clustering, feature extraction, and per-cluster signal classification with deterministic latency compatible with the first-level trigger readout system. The model predicts cluster positions and energies and provides a signal classification score, enabling a more flexible clustering strategy than the baseline trigger algorithm. Implemented on an FPGA and integrated into the Belle II trigger chain for synchronous operation, the system sustains the 8 MHz trigger throughput with an end-to-end latency of 3.168 $\mu$s. The performance is evaluated using simulated events and collision data. The energy resolution is comparable to the baseline trigger, while the position resolution for high-energy clusters improves by up to 18 percent in the central detector region. Cluster purity increases by up to 20 percent at low energies for isolated clusters, and cluster efficiency improves by up to 20 percent for overlapping clusters. The signal classifier enables additional background suppression at fixed signal retention. These results demonstrate the first operation of a Graph Neural Network-based reconstruction system implemented on FPGAs within the real-time trigger readout path of a collider experiment.</description>

      <title>Detection horizon for the neutrino burst from the stellar helium flash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-mass stars ($M\lesssim 2\,M_\odot$) ignite helium under degenerate conditions, eventually causing a nuclear run-away -- the helium flash. The alpha-capture process on $^{14}$N produces a large amount of $^{18}$F, whose subsequent decay spawns an intense $\nu_e$ burst (with average energy of $0.38$ MeV) lasting about a day. We show that, in addition, a strong $1.7$ MeV neutrino line is generated by electron capture on $^{18}$F. Detection is hindered by large backgrounds in state-of-the-art neutrino observatories, such as JUNO. In next-generation facilities, such as the Jinping neutrino experiment, the horizon for a detection with a local significance of $3 \sigma$ would be extended to almost $3$ pc. Although helium flashes occur a few times per year in our Galaxy, there are no stellar candidates approaching the tip of the red giant branch within $10$ pc. Hence, to date, asteroseismology remains the most promising tool for probing the most energetic thermonuclear event in the life of a low-mass star.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quark fragmentation functions describe the hadronization process of a quark where any of the final-state hadrons carries a fraction of its initial momentum. We compute these fragmentation functions for a cascade that includes pions, kaons, and the charmed $D$ and $D_s$ mesons, starting from the elementary quark-to-meson fragmentation process. The latter is obtained from the relevant cut diagram, and employs Poincar\'e covariant Bethe-Salpeter wave functions and quark propagators. We derive a set of twenty-five coupled jet equations that describe the cascade of emitted mesons in the fragmentation process. Their solutions yield full fragmentation functions that offer a consistent picture of the quark fragmentations across the light and heavy sectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first results of the search for sub-MeV fermionic dark matter absorbed by electron targets of germanium using the 205.4~kg$\cdot$day data collected by the CDEX-10 experiment, with the analysis threshold of 160~eVee. No significant dark matter (DM) signals over the background are observed. Results are presented as limits on the cross section of DM--electron interaction. We present new constraints of cross section in the DM range of 0.1--10 keV/$c^2$ for vector and axial-vector interaction. The upper limit on the cross section is set to be $\rm 6.8\times10^{-46}~cm^2$ for vector interaction, and $\rm 2.3\times10^{-46}~cm^2$ for axial-vector interaction at DM mass of 5 keV/$c^2$.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Muon Measurements Near Tornadic and Non-Tornadic Storms in the US Central Plains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tornadoes and other severe weather hazards affect thousands of people every year. Despite this, the details surrounding tornadic processes including formation, decay, and longevity are not well understood, partially due to limitations of available instrumentation. Measurements of atmospheric pressure within tornadic systems currently rely almost entirely on in-situ instrumentation, and no existing techniques can provide two-dimensional spatial information of the atmospheric density field. Atmospheric muons may hold a solution to this problem: muons are attenuated by matter, and tornadic storms are large regions of low atmospheric density, suggesting that tornadic storms induce a directional perturbation on the atmospheric muon flux. Measurements of this perturbation could then be used to infer the density field associated with severe weather. Simulations of these systems indicate that a robust measurement of the atmospheric density field would require a relatively large muon detector, however smaller detectors may be able to detect ambient muon flux perturbations if the storm is large and intense enough. This paper presents results from a pilot field study that measured the atmospheric muon flux near tornadic storms during May 2025, including directional measurements of the muon flux near tornadic mesocyclones and a measurement of the muon flux near the base of a forming tornado.</description>

      <title>LAYCAST: LAYered CAvern Surface Tracker at future electron-positron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a detector concept, LAYered CAvern Surface Tracker (LAYCAST), to be installed on the ceiling and the wall of the cavern hosting the main experiment of future electron-positron colliders such as CEPC and FCC-ee. With detailed and realistic considerations of the design of such a new experiment, the proposed detector is dedicated to extending the sensitivity reach of the main detector to various theoretical scenarios of long-lived particles (LLPs). We study carefully four such scenarios involving a light scalar boson $X$, the heavy neutral lepton $N$, the lightest neutralino $\tilde{\chi}^0_1$ in the R-parity-violating supersymmetry, and the axion-like particle $a$. Long-lived light scalar bosons are considered to be produced from the Standard-Model (SM) Higgs boson's decay ($h \to X X$) at the center-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s} =$ 240 GeV, while the other three types of LLPs are produced either from $Z$-boson decays (viz. $Z \to \nu\, N, ~\tilde{\chi}^0_1\, \tilde{\chi}^0_1 $) or direct scattering process ($ e^- e^+ \to ~\gamma\, a$) at $\sqrt{s} =$ 91.2 GeV, where $\gamma$ and $\nu$ denote the SM photon and neutrino, respectively. With Monte-Carlo simulations, we derive the sensitivities of the proposed experiment to these LLPs and the corresponding signal-event numbers. We also provide a dedicated estimate of a potentially important SM background from long-lived neutral kaons in hadronic $Z$ decays, and show that it is strongly suppressed by the combined requirements of the main detector and LAYCAST. Our findings show that LAYCAST can probe large new parameter space beyond both current bounds and the expected reach of the main experiments at CEPC and FCC-ee. Comparison with existing works in similar directions is also made.</description>

      <title>Testing Real WIMPs with CTAO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We forecast the reach of the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) to the full set of real representations within the paradigm of minimal dark matter. We employ effective field theory techniques to compute the annihilation cross section and photon spectrum that results when fermionic dark matter is the neutral component of an arbitrary odd and real representation of SU(2), including the Sommerfeld enhancement, next-to-leading log resummation of the relevant electroweak effects, and the contribution from bound states. We also compute the corresponding signals for scalar dark matter, with the exception of the bound state contribution. Results are presented for all real representations from the $\sim$3 TeV triplet (or wino), a $\mathbf{3}$ of SU(2), to the $\sim$300 TeV tredecuplet, a $\mathbf{13}$ of SU(2) that is at the threshold of the unitarity bound. Using these results, we forecast that with 500 hrs of Galactic Center observations and assuming background systematics are controlled at the level of ${\cal O}(1\%)$, then should no signal emerge, CTAO could exclude all representations up to the $\mathbf{11}$ of SU(2) in even the most conservative models for the dark-matter density in the inner galaxy, in both the fermionic and scalar dark matter cases. Assuming the default CTAO configuration, the tredecuplet will marginally escape exclusion, although we outline steps that CTAO could take to test even this scenario. In summary, CTAO appears poised to make a definitive statement on whether real WIMPs constitute the dark matter of our universe.</description>

Abstract: The substantial data volumes encountered in modern particle physics and other domains of fundamental physics research allow (and require) the use of increasingly complex data analysis tools and workflows. While the use of machine learning (ML) tools for data analysis has recently proliferated, these tools are typically special-purpose algorithms that rely, for example, on encoded physics knowledge to reach optimal performance. In this work, we investigate a new and orthogonal direction: Using recent progress in large language models (LLMs) to create a team of agents -- instances of LLMs with specific subtasks -- that jointly solve data analysis-based research problems in a way similar to how a human researcher might: by creating code to operate standard tools and libraries (including ML systems) and by building on results of previous iterations. If successful, such agent-based systems could be deployed to automate routine analysis components to counteract the increasing complexity of modern tool chains. To investigate the capabilities of current-generation commercial LLMs, we consider the task of anomaly detection via the publicly available and highly-studied LHC Olympics dataset. Several current models by OpenAI (GPT-4o, o4-mini, GPT-4.1, and GPT-5) are investigated and their stability tested. Overall, we observe the capacity of the agent-based system to solve this data analysis problem. The best agent-created solutions mirror the performance of human state-of-the-art results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higgs boson production through gluon fusion in association with two jets is an irreducible background to Higgs boson production through vector boson fusion, one of the most important channels for analyzing and understanding the Higgs boson properties at the Large Hadron Collider. Despite a range of available simulation tools, precise predictions for the corresponding final states are notoriously hard to achieve. Using state-of-the-art fixed-order calculations as the baseline for a comparison, we perform a detailed study of similarities and differences in existing event generators. We provide consistent setups for the simulations that can be used to obtain identical parametric precision in various programs used by experiments. We find that NLO calculations for the two-jet final state are essential to achieve reliable predictions.</description>

      <title>A Way of Axion Detection with Mass $10^{-4} \text{-}10^{-3}$eV Using Cylindrical Sample with Low Electric Conductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16746v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A dark matter axion with mass $m_a$ induces an oscillating electric field in a cylindrical sample placed under a magnetic field $B_0$ parallel to the cylinder axis. When the cylinder is made of a highly electrically conductive material, the induced oscillating current flows only at the surface. In contrast, if the cylinder is composed of a material with small conductivity, e.g. $\sigma = 10^{-3}\text{eV}$, the electric current flows inside the bulk of the cylinder. Within the QCD axion model, the power $P$ is estimated as $P\simeq 5.7\times 10^{-27}\mbox{W}g_{\gamma}^2 \Big(\frac{L}{100\mbox{cm}}\Big)\Big(\frac{R}{6\mbox{cm}}\Big)^2 \Big(\frac{B_0}{15\mbox{T}}\Big)^2 \Big(\frac{m_a}{10^{-4}\mbox{eV}}\Big)\Big(\frac{10}{\epsilon}\Big)\Big(\frac{\rho_a}{0.3\rm GeVcm^{-3}}\Big)$ with radius $R$, length $L$, permittivity $\epsilon = 10$ of the cylinder and axion energy density $\rho_a$, where $g_{\gamma}$ is model dependent parameter; $g_{\gamma}(\text{KSVZ}) = -0.96$ and $g_{\gamma}(\text{DFSZ}) = 0.37$. The signal of the axion can be detected by observing electric current in parallel LC circuit with quality factor $Q\ge 2$. The detection of dark matter axions in our method may be feasible in the mass range $m_a =10^{-4}\text{-}10^{-3}\text{eV}$.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hadronic $\tau$ decays present an opportunity to determine the isovector part of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon in a way complementary to $e^+e^-\to\text{hadrons}$ cross sections. However, the required isospin rotation is only exact in the isospin limit, and corrections need to be under control to draw robust conclusions, most notably for $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ decays to determine the two-pion contribution, $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$. In this work, we present a novel analysis of the required radiative corrections using dispersion relations, thereby extending in a model-independent way the previous analysis in chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) beyond the threshold region. In particular, we include the dominant structure-dependent virtual corrections from pion-pole diagrams, leading to sizable changes in the vicinity of the $\rho(770)$ resonance. Moreover, we work out the matching to ChPT and devise a strategy for a stable numerical evaluation of real-emission contributions near the two-pion threshold, which proves important to capture isospin-breaking corrections enhanced by the threshold singularity. For the numerical analysis, we use a dispersive representation of the pion form factor including the $\rho'$, $\rho''$ resonances, perform fits to the available data sets for the $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ spectral function, and calculate the corresponding radiative correction factor $G_\text{EM}(s)$ in a self-consistent manner. Based on these results, we evaluate the $\tau$-specific isospin-breaking corrections to $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$.</description>

      <title>Explaining higher-order correlations between elliptic and triangular flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ALICE and CMS Collaborations have analyzed a number of cumulants mixing elliptic flow ($v_2$) and triangular flow ($v_3$), involving up to $8$ particles, in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC. We unravel an unexpected simplicity in these complex mathematical quantities for collisions at fixed impact parameter. We show that as one increases the order in $v_2$, for a given order in $v_3$, the changes in the cumulants are solely determined by the mean elliptic flow in the reaction plane, which originates from the almond-shaped geometry of the overlap area between the colliding nuclei. We derive simple analytic relations between cumulants of different orders on this basis. These relations are in good agreement with recent data from the CMS Collaboration. We argue that agreement will be further improved if the analysis is repeated with a finer centrality binning. We make quantitative predictions for cumulants of order 10 which have not yet been analyzed.</description>

      <title>A journey to ITACA: Ion Tracking with Ammonium Cations Apparatus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A unique feature of gas xenon electroluminescent time projection chambers (GXeEL TPCs) in $0\nu\beta\beta$ searches is their ability to reconstruct event topology, in particular to distinguish "single-electron" from "double-electron" tracks, the latter being the signature of a $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay near the decay endpoint $Q_{\beta\beta}$. Together with excellent energy resolution and the t$_0$ provided by primary scintillation, this topological information is key to suppressing backgrounds. Preserving EL, however, requires operation in pure xenon (with helium as the only benign additive), where electron diffusion is large. Consequently, reconstructed track fidelity is limited by diffusion and intrinsic EL blurring. We propose augmenting the detector with the ability to image not only the electron track but also the corresponding mirror ion track. Introducing trace amounts of NH$_3$ ($\sim$100 ppb) converts primary xenon ions into ammonium ions, NH$_4^+$, via a fast two-step ion-molecule process involving charge transfer followed by proton transfer, while leaving EL unaffected. Electrons drift rapidly to the anode, producing the standard EL image, whereas NH$_4^+$ ions drift slowly toward the cathode, allowing time to determine the event energy and barycenter. For events in the region of interest, an ion sensor near the cathode at the projected barycenter captures the ions. Laser interrogation of the sensor's molecular layer then reveals an ion-track image with sub-millimeter diffusion and no EL-induced smearing. Combined electron-ion imaging strengthens topological discrimination, improving background rejection by about an order of magnitude and significantly extending the discovery potential of GXeEL TPCs for very long $0\nu\beta\beta$ lifetimes.</description>

      <title>Discovery prospects for photophobic axion-like particles at a 100 TeV proton--proton collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study heavy photophobic axion-like particles (ALPs) in the limit of an effectively vanishing diphoton coupling, $g_{a\gamma\gamma}\simeq 0$, for which diphoton production and decay are suppressed and collider phenomenology is driven by electroweak interactions ($aWW$, $aZ\gamma$, $aZZ$). We perform detector-level searches at a future $\sqrt{s}=$ 100 TeV $pp$ collider (SppC/FCC-hh), with an integrated luminosity of $\mathcal{L} =$ 20 ab$^{-1}$. We consider $a\to Z\gamma$ and $a\to W^+W^-$ decays. For $pp\to jj\,a$ we include both $s$-channel electroweak exchange and vector boson fusion (VBF)-like topologies, while the tri-$W$ signature arises from associated production $pp\to W^\pm a$ (via $s$-channel exchange) followed by $a\to W^+W^-$. We analyze three final states--$Z\gamma jj$ with $Z\to\ell^+\ell^-$, tri-$W$ ($W^\pm W^\pm W^\mp$) with same-sign dimuons plus jets, and $W^+W^-jj$ with opposite-sign, different-flavor dilepton ($e^\pm\mu^\mp$) plus jets. Among the two $WW$ final states, the VBF-assisted $jj\,a(\to W^+W^-)$ channel overtakes the purely $s$-channel tri-$W$ mode for $m_a \stackrel{&gt;}{\sim}$ 1 TeV, reflecting 100~TeV signal/background kinematic shifts beyond naive energy/luminosity rescaling. A boosted-decision-tree (BDT) classifier built from kinematic observables provides the final signal--background separation, using detector-level simulations of signal and high-statistics SM backgrounds. At $\sqrt{s}=100$ TeV and $\mathcal{L} =$ 20 ab$^{-1}$, we present discovery sensitivities to the ALP--$W$ coupling $g_{aWW}$ over $m_a\in[100,\,7000]$ GeV. In parallel, we report model-independent discovery thresholds on $\sigma\times\mathrm{Br}$ for $pp\to jj\,a$ with $a\to Z\gamma$ and $a\to W^+W^-$, as well as for associated production $pp\to W^\pm a$ with $a\to W^+W^-$....</description>

      <title>Seasonal Variation of Polar Ice: Implications for Ultrahigh Energy Neutrino Detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The upper $100 \, \mathrm{m}$ to $150 \, \mathrm{m}$ of the polar ice sheet, called the firn, has a time-dependent density due to seasonal variations in the surface temperature and snow accumulation. We present RF simulations of an in-ice neutrino-induced radio source that show that these density anomalies create variations in the amplitude and propagation times of radio signals propagating through polar firn at an altitude of ${\sim}3000 \, \mathrm{m}$ above sea level. The received power from signals generated in the ice that refract within the upper ${\sim} 15 \, \mathrm{m}$ firn are subject to a seasonal variation on the order of 10\%. These variations result in an irreducible background uncertainty on the reconstructed neutrino energy and arrival direction for detectors using ice as a detection medium.</description>

Abstract: CP-odd observables originating from the strange-quark electric dipole moment ($d_s$) are identified in $\gamma^\ast\to K^+K^-\pi^0$ and evaluated in the chiral limit. A nonzero T-odd asymmetry $A_T$ requires anomalous couplings descending from a five-dimensional Chern-Simons construction. Modeling the running of $F_A$ and $F_V$ with vector-meson dominance, we estimate sensitivities to $d_s$ at the level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-16})\,e\cdot\mathrm{cm}$ in $e^+e^-$ data at CMD-3 and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-18})\,e\cdot\mathrm{cm}$ using existing $J/\psi$ samples at BESIII. Future experiments at the Super Tau-Charm Facility and Belle~II can further improve the reach by an order of magnitude.</description>
