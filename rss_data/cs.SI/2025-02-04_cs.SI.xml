      <title>GNN-based Anchor Embedding for Exact Subgraph Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subgraph matching query is a classic problem in graph data management and has a variety of real-world applications, such as discovering structures in biological or chemical networks, finding communities in social network analysis, explaining neural networks in machine learning, and so on. To further solve the subgraph matching problem, several recent advanced works attempt to utilize deep-learning-based techniques to handle the subgraph matching query. However, most of these works only obtain approximate results for subgraph matching without theoretical guarantees of accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective graph neural network (GNN)-based anchor embedding framework (GNN-AE), which allows exact subgraph matching. Unlike GNN-based approximate subgraph matching approaches that only produce inexact results, in this paper, we pioneer the anchor concept (including anchor, anchor graph/path, etc.) in subgraph matching and carefully devise the anchor (graph) embedding technique based on GNN models. We transform the subgraph matching problem into a search problem in the embedding space via the anchor (graph &amp; path) embedding techniques. With the proposed anchor matching mechanism, GNN-AE can guarantee subgraph matching has no false dismissals. We design an efficient matching growth algorithm, which can retrieve the locations of all exact matches in parallel. We also propose a cost-model-based DFS query plan to enhance the parallel matching growth algorithm. Through extensive experiments on 6 real-world and 3 synthetic datasets, we confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our GNN-AE approach for exact subgraph matching.</description>

      <title>The Best Soules Basis for the Estimation of a Spectral Barycentre Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main contribution of this work is a fast algorithm to compute the barycentre of a set of networks based on a Laplacian spectral pseudo-distance. The core engine for the reconstruction of the barycentre is an algorithm that explores the large library of Soules bases, and returns a basis that yields a sparse approximation of the sample mean adjacency matrix. We prove that when the networks are random realizations of stochastic block models, then our algorithm reconstructs the population mean adjacency matrix. In addition to the theoretical analysis of the estimator of the barycentre network, we perform Monte Carlo simulations to validate the theoretical properties of the estimator. This work is significant because it opens the door to the design of new spectral-based network synthesis that have theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Accurately Estimating Unreported Infections using Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most significant challenges in combating against the spread of infectious diseases was the difficulty in estimating the true magnitude of infections. Unreported infections could drive up disease spread, making it very hard to accurately estimate the infectivity of the pathogen, therewith hampering our ability to react effectively. Despite the use of surveillance-based methods such as serological studies, identifying the true magnitude is still challenging. This paper proposes an information theoretic approach for accurately estimating the number of total infections. Our approach is built on top of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) based models, which are commonly used in epidemiology and for estimating such infections. We show how we can help such models to better compute the number of total infections and identify the parametrization by which we need the fewest bits to describe the observed dynamics of reported infections. Our experiments on COVID-19 spread show that our approach leads to not only substantially better estimates of the number of total infections but also better forecasts of infections than standard model calibration based methods. We additionally show how our learned parametrization helps in modeling more accurate what-if scenarios with non-pharmaceutical interventions. Our approach provides a general method for improving epidemic modeling which is applicable broadly.</description>

      <title>HoloGraphs: An Interactive Physicalization for Dynamic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present HoloGraphs, a novel approach for physically representing, explaining, exploring, and interacting with dynamic networks. HoloGraphs addresses the challenges of visualizing and understanding evolving network structures by providing an engaging method of interacting and exploring dynamic network structures using physicalization techniques. In contrast to traditional digital interfaces, our approach leverages tangible artifacts made from transparent materials to provide an intuitive way for people with low visualization literacy to explore network data. The process involves printing network embeddings on transparent media and assembling them to create a 3D representation of dynamic networks, maintaining spatial perception and allowing the examination of each timeslice individually. Interactivity is envisioned using optional Focus+Context layers and overlays for node trajectories and labels. Focus layers highlight nodes of interest, context layers provide an overview of the network structure, and global overlays show node trajectories over time. In this paper, we outline the design principles and implementation of HoloGraphs and present how elementary digital interactions can be mapped to physical interactions to manipulate the elements of a network and temporal dimension in an engaging matter. We demonstrate the capabilities of our concept in a case study. Using a dynamic network of character interactions from a popular book series, we showcase how it represents and supports understanding complex concepts such as dynamic networks.</description>

      <title>Towards Recommender Systems LLMs Playground (RecSysLLMsP): Exploring Polarization and Engagement in Simulated Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the exponential advancement in AI technologies and the potential escalation of harmful effects from recommendation systems, it is crucial to simulate and evaluate these effects early on. Doing so can help prevent possible damage to both societies and technology companies. This paper introduces the Recommender Systems LLMs Playground (RecSysLLMsP), a novel simulation framework leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to explore the impacts of different content recommendation setups on user engagement and polarization in social networks. By creating diverse AI agents (AgentPrompts) with descriptive, static, and dynamic attributes, we assess their autonomous behaviour across three scenarios: Plurality, Balanced, and Similarity. Our findings reveal that the Similarity Scenario, which aligns content with user preferences, maximizes engagement while potentially fostering echo chambers. Conversely, the Plurality Scenario promotes diverse interactions but produces mixed engagement results. Our study emphasizes the need for a careful balance in recommender system designs to enhance user satisfaction while mitigating societal polarization. It underscores the unique value and challenges of incorporating LLMs into simulation environments. The benefits of RecSysLLMsP lie in its potential to calculate polarization effects, which is crucial for assessing societal impacts and determining user engagement levels with diverse recommender system setups. This advantage is essential for developing and maintaining a successful business model for social media companies. However, the study's limitations revolve around accurately emulating reality. Future efforts should validate the similarity in behaviour between real humans and AgentPrompts and establish metrics for measuring polarization scores.</description>

      <title>GitHub Stargazers | Building Graph- and Edge-level Prediction Algorithms for Developer Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing social networks formed by developers provides valuable insights for market segmentation, trend analysis, and community engagement. In this study, we explore the GitHub Stargazers dataset to classify developer communities and predict potential collaborations using graph neural networks (GNNs). By modeling 12,725 developer networks, we segment communities based on their focus on web development or machine learning repositories, leveraging graph attributes and node embeddings. Furthermore, we propose an edge-level recommendation algorithm that predicts new connections between developers using similarity measures. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in accurately segmenting communities and improving connection predictions, offering valuable insights for understanding open-source developer networks.</description>

      <title>Israel-Hamas war through Telegram, Reddit and Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Israeli-Palestinian conflict started on 7 October 2023, have resulted thus far to over 48,000 people killed including more than 17,000 children with a majority from Gaza, more than 30,000 people injured, over 10,000 missing, and over 1 million people displaced, fleeing conflict zones. The infrastructure damage includes the 87\% of housing units, 80\% of public buildings and 60\% of cropland 17 out of 36 hospitals, 68\% of road networks and 87\% of school buildings damaged. This conflict has as well launched an online discussion across various social media platforms. Telegram was no exception due to its encrypted communication and highly involved audience. The current study will cover an analysis of the related discussion in relation to different participants of the conflict and sentiment represented in those discussion. To this end, we prepared a dataset of 125K messages shared on channels in Telegram spanning from 23 October 2025 until today. Additionally, we apply the same analysis in two publicly available datasets from Twitter containing 2001 tweets and from Reddit containing 2M opinions. We apply a volume analysis across the three datasets, entity extraction and then proceed to BERT topic analysis in order to extract common themes or topics. Next, we apply sentiment analysis to analyze the emotional tone of the discussions. Our findings hint at polarized narratives as the hallmark of how political factions and outsiders mold public opinion. We also analyze the sentiment-topic prevalence relationship, detailing the trends that may show manipulation and attempts of propaganda by the involved parties. This will give a better understanding of the online discourse on the Israel-Palestine conflict and contribute to the knowledge on the dynamics of social media communication during geopolitical crises.</description>

      <title>Team Size and Its Negative Impact on the Disruption Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As science transitions from the age of lone geniuses to an era of collaborative teams, the question of whether large teams can sustain the creativity of individuals and continue driving innovation has become increasingly important. Our previous research first revealed a negative relationship between team size and the Disruption Index-a network-based metric of innovation-by analyzing 65 million projects across papers, patents, and software over half a century. This work has sparked lively debates within the scientific community about the robustness of the Disruption Index in capturing the impact of team size on innovation. Here, we present additional evidence that the negative link between team size and disruption holds, even when accounting for factors such as reference length, citation impact, and historical time. We further show how a narrow 5-year window for measuring disruption can misrepresent this relationship as positive, underestimating the long-term disruptive potential of small teams. Like "sleeping beauties," small teams need a decade or more to see their transformative contributions to science.</description>

      <title>Multi-Order Hyperbolic Graph Convolution and Aggregated Attention for Social Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social event detection (SED) is a task focused on identifying specific real-world events and has broad applications across various domains. It is integral to many mobile applications with social features, including major platforms like Twitter, Weibo, and Facebook. By enabling the analysis of social events, SED provides valuable insights for businesses to understand consumer preferences and supports public services in handling emergencies and disaster management. Due to the hierarchical structure of event detection data, traditional approaches in Euclidean space often fall short in capturing the complexity of such relationships. While existing methods in both Euclidean and hyperbolic spaces have shown promising results, they tend to overlook multi-order relationships between events. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel framework, Multi-Order Hyperbolic Graph Convolution with Aggregated Attention (MOHGCAA), designed to enhance the performance of SED. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements under both supervised and unsupervised settings. To further validate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework, we conducted extensive evaluations across multiple datasets, confirming its superiority in tackling common challenges in social event detection.</description>

      <title>Community Membership Hiding via Gradient-based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle the problem of \emph{community membership hiding}, which involves strategically altering a network's structure to obscure a target node's membership in a specific community identified by a detection algorithm. We reformulate the original discrete counterfactual graph objective as a differentiable constrained optimization task. To solve this, we propose \method{}, a gradient-based method that modifies the network's structure within the feasible bounds for an individual target node, effectively concealing its membership. Experimental results across multiple datasets and community detection algorithms show that our approach surpasses existing baselines, offering a better balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Discord Unveiled: A Comprehensive Dataset of Public Communication (2015-2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discord has evolved from a gaming-focused communication tool into a versatile platform supporting diverse online communities. Despite its large user base and active public servers, academic research on Discord remains limited due to data accessibility challenges. This paper introduces Discord Unveiled: A Comprehensive Dataset of Public Communication (2015-2024), the most extensive Discord public server's data to date. The dataset comprises over 2.05 billion messages from 4.74 million users across 3,167 public servers, representing approximately 10% of servers listed in Discord's Discovery feature. Spanning from Discord's launch in 2015 to the end of 2024, it offers a robust temporal and thematic framework for analyzing decentralized moderation, community governance, information dissemination, and social dynamics. Data was collected through Discord's public API, adhering to ethical guidelines and privacy standards via anonymization techniques. Organized into structured JSON files, the dataset facilitates seamless integration with computational social science methodologies. Preliminary analyses reveal significant trends in user engagement, bot utilization, and linguistic diversity, with English predominating alongside substantial representations of Spanish, French, and Portuguese. Additionally, prevalent community themes such as social, art, music, and memes highlight Discord's expansion beyond its gaming origins.</description>

      <title>Improved Community Detection using Stochastic Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00686v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying edge-dense communities that are also well-connected is an important aspect of understanding community structure. Prior work has shown that community detection methods can produce poorly connected communities, and some can even produce internally disconnected communities. In this study we evaluate the connectivity of communities obtained using Stochastic Block Models. We find that SBMs produce internally disconnected communities from real-world networks. We present a simple technique, Well-Connected Clusters (WCC), which repeatedly removes small edge cuts until the communities meet a user-specified threshold for well-connectivity. Our study using a large collection of synthetic networks based on clustered real-world networks shows that using WCC as a post-processing tool with SBM community detection typically improves clustering accuracy. WCC is fast enough to use on networks with millions of nodes and is freely available in open source form.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Spiral of Silence: Surveying Unspoken Opinions in Online Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We often treat social media as a lens onto society. How might that lens be distorting the actual popularity of political and social viewpoints? In this paper, we examine the difference between the viewpoints publicly posted in a community and the privately surveyed viewpoints of community members, contributing a measurement of a theory called the "spiral of silence." This theory observes that people are less likely to voice their opinion when they believe they are in the minority--leading to a spiral where minority opinions are less likely to be shared, so they appear even further in the minority, and become even less likely to be shared. We surveyed active members of politically oriented Reddit communities to gauge their willingness to post on contentious topics, yielding 627 responses from 108 participants about 11 topics and 33 subreddits. We find that 72.6% of participants who perceive themselves in the minority remain silent, and are only half as likely to post their viewpoint compared to those who believe their opinion is in the majority. Communities perceived as being more inclusive reduce the magnitude of this effect. These results emphasize how far out of step the opinions we see online may be with the population they purport to represent.</description>

      <title>Simulating Rumor Spreading in Social Networks using LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rise of social media, misinformation has become increasingly prevalent, fueled largely by the spread of rumors. This study explores the use of Large Language Model (LLM) agents within a novel framework to simulate and analyze the dynamics of rumor propagation across social networks. To this end, we design a variety of LLM-based agent types and construct four distinct network structures to conduct these simulations. Our framework assesses the effectiveness of different network constructions and agent behaviors in influencing the spread of rumors. Our results demonstrate that the framework can simulate rumor spreading across more than one hundred agents in various networks with thousands of edges. The evaluations indicate that network structure, personas, and spreading schemes can significantly influence rumor dissemination, ranging from no spread to affecting 83\% of agents in iterations, thereby offering a realistic simulation of rumor spread in social networks.</description>

Abstract: Livestreaming by VTubers -- animated 2D/3D avatars controlled by real individuals -- have recently garnered substantial global followings and achieved significant monetary success. Despite prior research highlighting the importance of realism in audience engagement, VTubers deliberately conceal their identities, cultivating dedicated fan communities through virtual personas. While previous studies underscore that building a core fan community is essential to a streamer's success, we lack an understanding of the characteristics of viewers of this new type of streamer. Gaining a deeper insight into these viewers is critical for VTubers to enhance audience engagement, foster a more robust fan base, and attract a larger viewership. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of VTuber viewers on Bilibili, a leading livestreaming platform where nearly all VTubers in China stream. By compiling a first-of-its-kind dataset covering 2.7M livestreaming sessions, we investigate the characteristics, engagement patterns, and influence of VTuber viewers. Our research yields several valuable insights, which we then leverage to develop a tool to "recommend" future subscribers to VTubers. By reversing the typical approach of recommending streams to viewers, this tool assists VTubers in pinpointing potential future fans to pay more attention to, and thereby effectively growing their fan community.</description>

      <title>Demystifying MPNNs: Message Passing as Merely Efficient Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success, their design largely relies on empirical intuition rather than theoretical understanding. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of GNN behavior through three fundamental aspects: (1) we establish that \textbf{$k$-layer} Message Passing Neural Networks efficiently aggregate \textbf{$k$-hop} neighborhood information through iterative computation, (2) analyze how different loop structures influence neighborhood computation, and (3) examine behavior across structure-feature hybrid and structure-only tasks. For deeper GNNs, we demonstrate that gradient-related issues, rather than just over-smoothing, can significantly impact performance in sparse graphs. We also analyze how different normalization schemes affect model performance and how GNNs make predictions with uniform node features, providing a theoretical framework that bridges the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding.</description>

      <title>Bounded-Confidence Models of Multi-Dimensional Opinions with Topic-Weighted Discordance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: People's opinions on a wide range of topics often evolve over time through their interactions with others. Models of opinion dynamics primarily focus on one-dimensional opinions which represent opinions on one topic. However, opinions on various topics are rarely isolated; instead, they can be interdependent and exhibit correlations. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, agents influence each other's opinions only if their opinions are sufficiently similar. We extend classical agent-based BCMs -- namely, the Hegeselmann--Krause BCM, which has synchronous interactions, and the Deffuant--Weisbuch BCM, which has asynchronous interactions -- to a multidimensional setting, in which the opinions are multidimensional vectors representing opinions of different topics and opinions on different topics are interdependent. To measure opinion differences between agents, we introduce topic-weighted discordance functions that account for opinion differences in all topics. We use the regions of receptiveness to characterize the steady-state opinion clusters and provide an analytical approach to compute these regions. In addition, we numerically simulate our models on various networks with initial opinions drawn from a variety of distributions. When initial opinions are correlated across different topics, our topic-weighted BCMs yield significantly different results in both transient and steady states compared to baseline models, where the dynamics of each opinion topic are independent.</description>

      <title>Generic Multimodal Spatially Graph Network for Spatially Embedded Network Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatially embedded networks (SENs) represent a special type of complex graph, whose topologies are constrained by the networks' embedded spatial environments. The graph representation of such networks is thereby influenced by the embedded spatial features of both nodes and edges. Accurate network representation of the graph structure and graph features is a fundamental task for various graph-related tasks. In this study, a Generic Multimodal Spatially Graph Convolutional Network (GMu-SGCN) is developed for efficient representation of spatially embedded networks. The developed GMu-SGCN model has the ability to learn the node connection pattern via multimodal node and edge features. In order to evaluate the developed model, a river network dataset and a power network dataset have been used as test beds. The river network represents the naturally developed SENs, whereas the power network represents a man-made network. Both types of networks are heavily constrained by the spatial environments and uncertainties from nature. Comprehensive evaluation analysis shows the developed GMu-SGCN can improve accuracy of the edge existence prediction task by 37.1\% compared to a GraphSAGE model which only considers the node's position feature in a power network test bed. Our model demonstrates the importance of considering the multidimensional spatial feature for spatially embedded network representation.</description>

      <title>Selective Response Strategies for GenAI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of Generative AI (GenAI) has significantly impacted human-based forums like Stack Overflow, which are essential for generating high-quality data. This creates a negative feedback loop, hindering the development of GenAI systems, which rely on such data to provide accurate responses. In this paper, we provide a possible remedy: A novel strategy we call selective response. Selective response implies that GenAI could strategically provide inaccurate (or conservative) responses to queries involving emerging topics and novel technologies, thereby driving users to use human-based forums like Stack Overflow. We show that selective response can potentially have a compounding effect on the data generation process, increasing both GenAI's revenue and user welfare in the long term. From an algorithmic perspective, we propose an approximately optimal approach to maximize GenAI's revenue under social welfare constraints. From a regulatory perspective, we derive sufficient and necessary conditions for selective response to improve welfare improvements.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis on LLM-based Node Classification Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Node classification is a fundamental task in graph analysis, with broad applications across various fields. Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled LLM-based approaches for this task. Although many studies demonstrate the impressive performance of LLM-based methods, the lack of clear design guidelines may hinder their practical application. In this work, we aim to establish such guidelines through a fair and systematic comparison of these algorithms. As a first step, we developed LLMNodeBed, a comprehensive codebase and testbed for node classification using LLMs. It includes ten datasets, eight LLM-based algorithms, and three learning paradigms, and is designed for easy extension with new methods and datasets. Subsequently, we conducted extensive experiments, training and evaluating over 2,200 models, to determine the key settings (e.g., learning paradigms and homophily) and components (e.g., model size) that affect performance. Our findings uncover eight insights, e.g., (1) LLM-based methods can significantly outperform traditional methods in a semi-supervised setting, while the advantage is marginal in a supervised setting; (2) Graph Foundation Models can beat open-source LLMs but still fall short of strong LLMs like GPT-4o in a zero-shot setting. We hope that the release of LLMNodeBed, along with our insights, will facilitate reproducible research and inspire future studies in this field. Codes and datasets are released at \href{https://llmnodebed.github.io/}{https://llmnodebed.github.io/}.</description>

      <title>Embracing Dialectic Intersubjectivity: Coordination of Different Perspectives in Content Analysis with LLM Persona Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00903v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study attempts to advancing content analysis methodology from consensus-oriented to coordination-oriented practices, thereby embracing diverse coding outputs and exploring the dynamics among differential perspectives. As an exploratory investigation of this approach, we evaluate six GPT-4o configurations to analyze sentiment in Fox News and MSNBC transcripts on Biden and Trump during the 2020 U.S. presidential campaign, examining patterns across these models. By assessing each model's alignment with ideological perspectives, we explore how partisan selective processing could be identified in LLM-Assisted Content Analysis (LACA). Findings reveal that partisan persona LLMs exhibit stronger ideological biases when processing politically congruent content. Additionally, intercoder reliability is higher among same-partisan personas compared to cross-partisan pairs. This approach enhances the nuanced understanding of LLM outputs and advances the integrity of AI-driven social science research, enabling simulations of real-world implications.</description>

      <title>DiffIM: Differentiable Influence Minimization with Surrogate Modeling and Continuous Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In social networks, people influence each other through social links, which can be represented as propagation among nodes in graphs. Influence minimization (IMIN) is the problem of manipulating the structures of an input graph (e.g., removing edges) to reduce the propagation among nodes. IMIN can represent time-critical real-world applications, such as rumor blocking, but IMIN is theoretically difficult and computationally expensive. Moreover, the discrete nature of IMIN hinders the usage of powerful machine learning techniques, which requires differentiable computation. In this work, we propose DiffIM, a novel method for IMIN with two differentiable schemes for acceleration: (1) surrogate modeling for efficient influence estimation, which avoids time-consuming simulations (e.g., Monte Carlo), and (2) the continuous relaxation of decisions, which avoids the evaluation of individual discrete decisions (e.g., removing an edge). We further propose a third accelerating scheme, gradient-driven selection, that chooses edges instantly based on gradients without optimization (spec., gradient descent iterations) on each test instance. Through extensive experiments on real-world graphs, we show that each proposed scheme significantly improves speed with little (or even no) IMIN performance degradation. Our method is Pareto-optimal (i.e., no baseline is faster and more effective than it) and typically several orders of magnitude (spec., up to 15,160X) faster than the most effective baseline while being more effective.</description>

      <title>Human-Agent Interaction in Synthetic Social Networks: A Framework for Studying Online Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online social networks have dramatically altered the landscape of public discourse, creating both opportunities for enhanced civic participation and risks of deepening social divisions. Prevalent approaches to studying online polarization have been limited by a methodological disconnect: mathematical models excel at formal analysis but lack linguistic realism, while language model-based simulations capture natural discourse but often sacrifice analytical precision. This paper introduces an innovative computational framework that synthesizes these approaches by embedding formal opinion dynamics principles within LLM-based artificial agents, enabling both rigorous mathematical analysis and naturalistic social interactions. We validate our framework through comprehensive offline testing and experimental evaluation with 122 human participants engaging in a controlled social network environment. The results demonstrate our ability to systematically investigate polarization mechanisms while preserving ecological validity. Our findings reveal how polarized environments shape user perceptions and behavior: participants exposed to polarized discussions showed markedly increased sensitivity to emotional content and group affiliations, while perceiving reduced uncertainty in the agents' positions. By combining mathematical precision with natural language capabilities, our framework opens new avenues for investigating social media phenomena through controlled experimentation. This methodological advancement allows researchers to bridge the gap between theoretical models and empirical observations, offering unprecedented opportunities to study the causal mechanisms underlying online opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Machine Learning Model for Detecting Bangla Smishing Text Using BERT and Character-Level CNN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smishing is a social engineering attack using SMS containing malicious content to deceive individuals into disclosing sensitive information or transferring money to cybercriminals. Smishing attacks have surged by 328%, posing a major threat to mobile users, with losses exceeding \$54.2 million in 2019. Despite its growing prevalence, the issue remains significantly under-addressed. This paper presents a novel hybrid machine learning model for detecting Bangla smishing texts, combining Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for enhanced character-level analysis.
  Our model addresses multi-class classification by distinguishing between Normal, Promotional, and Smishing SMS. Unlike traditional binary classification methods, our approach integrates BERT's contextual embeddings with CNN's character-level features, improving detection accuracy. Enhanced by an attention mechanism, the model effectively prioritizes crucial text segments. Our model achieves 98.47% accuracy, outperforming traditional classifiers, with high precision and recall in Smishing detection, and strong performance across all categories.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Instance-Optimal Cluster Recovery in the Labeled Stochastic Block Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12968v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of recovering hidden communities in the Labeled Stochastic Block Model (LSBM) with a finite number of clusters whose sizes grow linearly with the total number of nodes. We derive the necessary and sufficient conditions under which the expected number of misclassified nodes is less than $ s $, for any number $ s = o(n) $. To achieve this, we propose IAC (Instance-Adaptive Clustering), the first algorithm whose performance matches the instance-specific lower bounds both in expectation and with high probability. IAC is a novel two-phase algorithm that consists of a one-shot spectral clustering step followed by iterative likelihood-based cluster assignment improvements. This approach is based on the instance-specific lower bound and notably does not require any knowledge of the model parameters, including the number of clusters. By performing the spectral clustering only once, IAC maintains an overall computational complexity of $ \mathcal{O}(n\, \text{polylog}(n)) $, making it scalable and practical for large-scale problems.</description>

      <title>P4GCN: Vertical Federated Social Recommendation with Privacy-Preserving Two-Party Graph Convolution Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13905v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, graph neural networks (GNNs) have been commonly utilized for social recommendation systems. However, real-world scenarios often present challenges related to user privacy and business constraints, inhibiting direct access to valuable social information from other platforms. While many existing methods have tackled matrix factorization-based social recommendations without direct social data access, developing GNN-based federated social recommendation models under similar conditions remains largely unexplored. To address this issue, we propose a novel vertical federated social recommendation method leveraging privacy-preserving two-party graph convolution networks (P4GCN) to enhance recommendation accuracy without requiring direct access to sensitive social information. First, we introduce a Sandwich-Encryption module to ensure comprehensive data privacy during the collaborative computing process. Second, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the privacy guarantees, considering the participation of both curious and honest parties. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that P4GCN outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of recommendation accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14513v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local communities are widely observed in spatial networks. However, how such structure affects the vulnerability against malicious attacks remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of local communities on the robustness of connectivity by modeling planar infrastructure networks based on statistical population data. Our research reveals that the emergence of local communities is caused by spatial concentrations of nodes connected by short links, which significantly reduce the robustness. These results suggest that strategically establishing long distance links provides a feasible solution to balance reliability and construction costs in infrastructure network design.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04802v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This comprehensive review aims to provide an overview of the current state of Healthcare Knowledge Graphs (HKGs), including their construction, utilization models, and applications across various healthcare and biomedical research domains. We thoroughly analyzed existing literature on HKGs, covering their construction methodologies, utilization techniques, and applications in basic science research, pharmaceutical research and development, clinical decision support, and public health. The review encompasses both model-free and model-based utilization approaches and the integration of HKGs with large language models (LLMs). We searched Google Scholar for relevant papers on HKGs and classified them into the following topics: HKG construction, HKG utilization, and their downstream applications in various domains. We also discussed their special challenges and the promise for future work. The review highlights the potential of HKGs to significantly impact biomedical research and clinical practice by integrating vast amounts of biomedical knowledge from multiple domains. The synergy between HKGs and LLMs offers promising opportunities for constructing more comprehensive knowledge graphs and improving the accuracy of healthcare applications. HKGs have emerged as a powerful tool for structuring medical knowledge, with broad applications across biomedical research, clinical decision-making, and public health. This survey serves as a roadmap for future research and development in the field of HKGs, highlighting the potential of combining knowledge graphs with advanced machine learning models for healthcare transformation.</description>

      <title>The dynamics of the Reddit collective action leading to the GameStop short squeeze</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14999v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In early 2021, the stock prices of GameStop, AMC, Nokia and BlackBerry experienced dramatic increases, triggered by short-squeeze operations that have been largely attributed to Reddit's retail investors. Here, we shed light on the extent and timing of Reddit users' influence on the GameStop short squeeze. Using statistical analysis tools with high temporal resolution, we find that increasing Reddit discussions anticipated high trading volumes. This effect emerged abruptly a few weeks before the event but waned once the community gained widespread visibility through Twitter. Meanwhile, the collective investment of the community quantified through posts of individual positions, closely mirrored the market capitalization of the stock. This evidence suggests a coordinated action of users in developing a shared financial strategy through social media--targeting GameStop first and other stocks afterward. Overall, our results provide novel insights into the role of Reddit users in the dynamics of the GameStop short squeeze.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Understanding the Promotion of Illicit Goods and Services on Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07797</link>

Abstract: In this study, we reveal, for the first time, popular online social networks (especially Twitter) are being extensively abused by miscreants to promote illicit goods and services of diverse categories. This study is made possible by multiple machine learning tools that are designed to detect and analyze Posts of Illicit Promotion (PIPs) as well as revealing their underlying promotion campaigns. Particularly, we observe that PIPs are prevalent on Twitter, along with extensive visibility on other three popular OSNs including YouTube, Facebook, and TikTok. For instance, applying our PIP hunter to the Twitter platform for 6 months has led to the discovery of 12 million distinct PIPs which are widely distributed in 5 major natural languages and 10 illicit categories, e.g., drugs, data leakage, gambling, and weapon sales. Along the discovery of PIPs are 580K Twitter accounts publishing PIPs as well as 37K distinct instant messaging accounts that are embedded in PIPs and serve as next hops of communication with prospective customers. Also, an arms race between Twitter and illicit promotion operators is also observed. Especially, 90% PIPs can survice the first two months since getting published on Twitter, which is likely due to the diverse evasion tactics adopted by miscreants to masquerade PIPs.</description>

      <title>DocNet: Semantic Structure in Inductive Bias Detection Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10965v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: News will be biased so long as people have opinions. As social media becomes the primary entry point for news and partisan differences increase, it is increasingly important for informed citizens to be able to recognize bias. If people are aware of the biases of the news they consume, they will be able to take action to avoid polarizing echo chambers. In this paper, we explore an often overlooked aspect of bias detection in media: the semantic structure of news articles. We present DocNet, a novel, inductive, and low-resource document embedding and political bias detection model. We also demonstrate that the semantic structure of news articles from opposing political sides, as represented in document-level graph embeddings, have significant similarities. DocNet bypasses the need for pre-trained language models, reducing resource dependency while achieving comparable performance. It can be used to advance political bias detection in low-resource environments. Our code and data are made available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DocNet/</description>

      <title>Competing Social Contagions with Opinion Dependent Infectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spread of disinformation (maliciously spread false information) in online social networks has become an important problem in today's society. Disinformation's spread is facilitated by the fact that individuals often accept false information based on cognitive biases which predispose them to believe information that they have heard repeatedly or that aligns with their beliefs. Moreover, disinformation often spreads in direct competition with a corresponding true information. To model these phenomena, we develop a model for two competing beliefs spreading on a social network, where individuals have an internal opinion that models their cognitive biases and modulates their likelihood of adopting one of the competing beliefs. By numerical simulations of an agent-based model and a mean-field description of the dynamics, we study how the long-term dynamics of the spreading process depends on the initial conditions for the number of spreaders and the initial opinion of the population. We find that the addition of cognitive biases enriches the transient dynamics of the spreading process, facilitating behavior such as the revival of a dying belief and the overturning of an initially widespread opinion. Finally, we study how external recruitment of spreaders can lead to the eventual dominance of one of the two beliefs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Annotator Reliability Assessment and Sample Weighting for Knowledge-Based Misinformation Detection on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14515v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misinformation spreads rapidly on social media, confusing the truth and targeting potentially vulnerable people. To effectively mitigate the negative impact of misinformation, it must first be accurately detected before applying a mitigation strategy, such as X's community notes, which is currently a manual process. This study takes a knowledge-based approach to misinformation detection, modelling the problem similarly to one of natural language inference. The EffiARA annotation framework is introduced, aiming to utilise inter- and intra-annotator agreement to understand the reliability of each annotator and influence the training of large language models for classification based on annotator reliability. In assessing the EffiARA annotation framework, the Russo-Ukrainian Conflict Knowledge-Based Misinformation Classification Dataset (RUC-MCD) was developed and made publicly available. This study finds that sample weighting using annotator reliability performs the best, utilising both inter- and intra-annotator agreement and soft-label training. The highest classification performance achieved using Llama-3.2-1B was a macro-F1 of 0.757 and 0.740 using TwHIN-BERT-large.</description>

      <title>Transforming Role Classification in Scientific Teams Using LLMs and Advanced Predictive Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scientific team dynamics are critical in determining the nature and impact of research outputs. However, existing methods for classifying author roles based on self-reports and clustering lack comprehensive contextual analysis of contributions. Thus, we present a transformative approach to classifying author roles in scientific teams using advanced large language models (LLMs), which offers a more refined analysis compared to traditional clustering methods. Specifically, we seek to complement and enhance these traditional methods by utilizing open source and proprietary LLMs, such as GPT-4, Llama3 70B, Llama2 70B, and Mistral 7x8B, for role classification. Utilizing few-shot prompting, we categorize author roles and demonstrate that GPT-4 outperforms other models across multiple categories, surpassing traditional approaches such as XGBoost and BERT. Our methodology also includes building a predictive deep learning model using 10 features. By training this model on a dataset derived from the OpenAlex database, which provides detailed metadata on academic publications -- such as author-publication history, author affiliation, research topics, and citation counts -- we achieve an F1 score of 0.76, demonstrating robust classification of author roles.</description>

      <title>Network-informed Prompt Engineering against Organized Astroturf Campaigns under Extreme Class Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting organized political campaigns is of paramount importance in fighting against disinformation on social media. Existing approaches for the identification of such organized actions employ techniques mostly from network science, graph machine learning and natural language processing. Their ultimate goal is to analyze the relationships and interactions (e.g. re-posting) among users and the textual similarities of their posts. Despite their effectiveness in recognizing astroturf campaigns, these methods face significant challenges, notably the class imbalance in available training datasets. To mitigate this issue, recent methods usually resort to data augmentation or increasing the number of positive samples, which may not always be feasible or sufficient in real-world settings. Following a different path, in this paper, we propose a novel framework for identifying astroturf campaigns based solely on large language models (LLMs), introducing a Balanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Balanced RAG) component. Our approach first gives both textual information concerning the posts (in our case tweets) and the user interactions of the social network as input to a language model. Then, through prompt engineering and the proposed Balanced RAG method, it effectively detects coordinated disinformation campaigns on X (Twitter). The proposed framework does not require any training or fine-tuning of the language model. Instead, by strategically harnessing the strengths of prompt engineering and Balanced RAG, it facilitates LLMs to overcome the effects of class imbalance and effectively identify coordinated political campaigns. The experimental results demonstrate that by incorporating the proposed prompt engineering and Balanced RAG methods, our framework outperforms the traditional graph-based baselines, achieving 2x-3x improvements in terms of precision, recall and F1 scores.</description>
