      <title>From Bits to Qubits: Challenges in Classical-Quantum Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While quantum computing holds immense potential for tackling previously intractable problems, its current practicality remains limited. A critical aspect of realizing quantum utility is the ability to efficiently interface with data from the classical world. This research focuses on the crucial phase of quantum encoding, which enables the transformation of classical information into quantum states for processing within quantum systems. We focus on three prominent encoding models: Phase Encoding, Qubit Lattice, and Flexible Representation of Quantum Images (FRQI) for cost and efficiency analysis. The aim of quantifying their different characteristics is to analyze their impact on quantum processing workflows. This comparative analysis offers valuable insights into their limitations and potential to accelerate the development of practical quantum computing solutions.</description>

      <title>Low-cost Microfluidic Testbed for Molecular Communications with Integrated Hydrodynamic Gating and Screen-printed Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular Communications (MC), transferring information via chemical signals, holds promise for transformative healthcare applications within the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) framework. Despite promising advances toward practical MC systems, progress has been constrained by experimental testbeds that are costly, difficult to customize, and require labor-intensive fabrication. Here, we address these challenges by introducing a low-cost ($\sim$\$1 per unit), rapidly fabricated ($&lt;$1 hour), and highly customizable microfluidic testbed that integrates hydrodynamic gating and screen-printed potentiometric sensors. This platform enables precise spatiotemporal control over chemical signals and supports reconfigurable channel architectures along with on-demand sensor functionalization. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate a pH-based MC system combining a polyaniline (PANI)-functionalized sensor for real-time signal detection with a programmable hydrodynamic gating architecture, patterned in a double-sided adhesive tape, as the transmitter. By dynamically mixing phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) with an acidic solution (pH 3), the testbed reliably generates pH-encoded pulses. Experimental results confirm robust control over pulse amplitude and pulse width, enabling the simulation of end-to-end MC scenarios with 4-ary concentration shift keying (CSK) modulation. By combining affordability and rapid prototyping without compromising customizability, this platform is poised to accelerate the translation of MC concepts into practical IoBNT applications.</description>

Abstract: We present a silicon-photonic tensor core using 2D ferroelectric materials to enable wavelength- and polarization-domain computing. Results, based on experimentally characterized material properties, show up to 83% improvement in computation accuracy compared to coherent networks.</description>

      <title>Human-Precision Medicine Interaction: Public Perceptions of Polygenic Risk Score for Genetic Health Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precision Medicine (PM) transforms the traditional "one-drug-fits-all" paradigm by customising treatments based on individual characteristics, and is an emerging topic for HCI research on digital health. A key element of PM, the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS), uses genetic data to predict an individual's disease risk. Despite its potential, PRS faces barriers to adoption, such as data inclusivity, psychological impact, and public trust. We conducted a mixed-methods study to explore how people perceive PRS, formed of surveys (n=254) and interviews (n=11) with UK-based participants. The interviews were supplemented by interactive storyboards with the ContraVision technique to provoke deeper reflection and discussion. We identified ten key barriers and five themes to PRS adoption and proposed design implications for a responsible PRS framework. To address the complexities of PRS and enhance broader PM practices, we introduce the term Human-Precision Medicine Interaction (HPMI), which integrates, adapts, and extends HCI approaches to better meet these challenges.</description>

      <title>A RRAM_based In_Memory Computing Architecture for Binary Matrix_Vector Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary matrix-vector multiplication, as one of the core operations in many post-quantum cryptography (PQC) schemes, has found widespread applications in the field of information encryption. However, the transmission bottleneck of large matrices between the computation and memory modules leads to significant data movement power consumption and high storage bandwidth demands. In this paper, a partitioned RRAM-based in-memory computing (IMC) architecture is proposed, aiming to overcome the data transmission bottleneck and efficiently perform binary field matrix-vector multiplication. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed in-memory computing architecture...</description>

      <title>Resilience of the Electric Grid through Trustable IoT-Coordinated Assets (Extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14861v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electricity grid has evolved from a physical system to a cyber-physical system with digital devices that perform measurement, control, communication, computation, and actuation. The increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) including renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage provides extraordinary opportunities for improvements in efficiency and sustainability. However, they can introduce new vulnerabilities in the form of cyberattacks, which can cause significant challenges in ensuring grid resilience. We propose a framework in this paper for achieving grid resilience through suitably coordinated assets including a network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A local electricity market is proposed to identify trustable assets and carry out this coordination. Situational Awareness (SA) of locally available DERs with the ability to inject power or reduce consumption is enabled by the market, together with a monitoring procedure for their trustability and commitment. With this SA, we show that a variety of cyberattacks can be mitigated using local trustable resources without stressing the bulk grid. Multiple demonstrations are carried out using a high-fidelity co-simulation platform, real-time hardware-in-the-loop validation, and a utility-friendly simulator.</description>
