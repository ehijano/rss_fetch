      <title>Better Late than Never: the Complexity of Arrangements of Polyhedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the subdivision of $\mathbb{R}^d$ induced by $m$ convex polyhedra having $n$ facets in total. We prove that $\mathcal{A}$ has combinatorial complexity $O(m^{\lceil d/2 \rceil} n^{\lfloor d/2 \rfloor})$ and that this bound is tight. The bound is mentioned several times in the literature, but no proof for arbitrary dimension has been published before.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Mesh to Improve the Triangular Expansion Algorithm for Computing Visibility Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of improving the query performance of the triangular expansion algorithm (TEA) for computing visibility regions by finding the most advantageous instance of the triangular mesh, the preprocessing structure. The TEA recursively traverses the mesh while keeping track of the visible region, the set of all points visible from a query point in a polygonal world. We show that the measured query time is approximately proportional to the number of triangle edge expansions during the mesh traversal. We propose a new type of triangular mesh that minimizes the expected number of expansions assuming the query points are drawn from a known probability distribution. We design a heuristic method to approximate the mesh and evaluate the approach on many challenging instances that resemble real-world environments. The proposed mesh improves the mean query times by 12-16% compared to the reference constrained Delaunay triangulation. The approach is suitable to boost offline applications that require computing millions of queries without addressing the preprocessing time. The implementation is publicly available to replicate our experiments and serve the community.</description>

      <title>Exact predicates, exact constructions and combinatorics for mesh CSG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12949v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a general mesh intersection algorithm that exactly computes the so-called Weiler model (also called an arrangement) and that uses it to implement boolean operations with arbitrary multi-operand expressions, CSG (constructive solid geometry) and some mesh repair operations. From an input polygon soup, the algorithm first computes the co-refinement, with an exact representation of the intersection points. Then, the decomposition of 3D space into volumetric regions (Weiler model) is constructed, by sorting the facets around the non-manifold intersection edges (radial sort), using specialized exact predicates. Finally, based on the input boolean expression, the triangular facets that belong to the boundary of the result are classified. To implement all the involved predicates and constructions, two geometric kernels are proposed, tested and discussed (arithmetic expansions and multi-precision floating-point). As a guiding principle,the combinatorial information shared between each step is kept as simple as possible. It is made possible by treating all the particular cases in the kernel. In particular, triangles with intersections are remeshed using the (uniquely defined) Constrained Delaunay Triangulation, with symbolic perturbations to disambiguate configurations with co-cyclic points. It makes it easy to discard the duplicated triangles that appear when remeshing overlapping facets. The method is tested and compared with previous work, on the existing "thingi10K" dataset (to test co-refinement and mesh repair) and on a new "thingiCSG" dataset made publicly available (to test the full CSG pipeline) on a variety of interesting examples featuring different types of "pathologies"</description>
