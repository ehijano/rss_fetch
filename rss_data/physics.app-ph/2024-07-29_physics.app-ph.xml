      <title>Stochastic Instabilities of the Diffusive Memristor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently created diffusive memristors have garnered significant research interest owing to their distinctive capability to generate a diverse array of spike dynamics which are similar in nature to those found in biological cells. This gives the memristor an opportunity to be used in a wide range of applications, specifically within neuromorphic systems. The diffusive memristor is known to produce regular, chaotic and stochastic behaviors which leads to interesting phenomena resulting from the interactions between the behavioral properties. The interactions along with the instabilities that lead to the unique spiking phenomena are not fully understood due to the complexities associated with examining the stochastic properties within the diffusive memristor. In this work, we analyze both the classical and the noise induced bifurcations that a set of stochastic differential equations, justified through a Fokker-Planck equation used to model the diffusive memristor, can produce. Finally, we replicate the results of the numerical stochastic threshold phenomena with experimentally measured spiking.</description>

      <title>Milli-spinner thrombectomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockage of blood flow in arteries or veins by blood clots can lead to serious medical conditions. Mechanical thrombectomy (MT), minimally invasive endovascular procedures that utilize aspiration, stent retriever, or cutting mechanisms for clot removal have emerged as an effective treatment modality for ischemic stroke, myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism, and peripheral vascular disease. However, state-of-the-art MT technologies still fail to remove clots in approximately 10% to 30% of patients, especially when treating large-size clots with high fibrin content. In addition, the working mechanism of most current MT techniques results in rupturing or cutting of clots which could lead to clot fragmentation and distal emboli. Here, we report a new MT technology based on an unprecedented mechanism, in which a milli-spinner mechanically debulks the clot by densifying its fibrin fiber network and discharging red blood cells to significantly reduce the clot volume for complete clot removal. This mechanism is achieved by the spin-induced compression and shearing of the clot. We demonstrate its effective clot-debulking performance with clot volumetric reduction of up to 90% on various sizes of clots with diverse clot compositions. Milli-spinner MT in both in-vitro pulmonary and cerebral artery flow models and in-vivo swine models demonstrate high-fidelity revascularization. The milli-spinner MT is the first reported mechanism that directly modifies the clot microstructure to facilitate clot removal, which also results in markedly improved MT efficacy compared to the existing MT mechanisms that are based on clot rupturing and cutting. This technology introduces a unique mechanical way of debulking and removing clots for future MT device development, especially for the treatment of ischemic stroke, pulmonary emboli, and peripheral thrombosis.</description>

      <title>Fast and Reliable Probabilistic Reflectometry Inversion with Prior-Amortized Neural Posterior Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing the structure of thin films and multilayers from measurements of scattered X-rays or neutrons is key to progress in physics, chemistry, and biology. However, finding all structures compatible with reflectometry data is computationally prohibitive for standard algorithms, which typically results in unreliable analysis with only a single potential solution identified. We address this lack of reliability with a probabilistic deep learning method that identifies all realistic structures in seconds, setting new standards in reflectometry. Our method, Prior-Amortized Neural Posterior Estimation (PANPE), combines simulation-based inference with novel adaptive priors that inform the inference network about known structural properties and controllable experimental conditions. PANPE networks support key scenarios such as high-throughput sample characterization, real-time monitoring of evolving structures, or the co-refinement of several experimental data sets, and can be adapted to provide fast, reliable, and flexible inference across many other inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Formulation of Average Force in Amplitude-Modulation Atomic Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amplitude-modulation (tapping-mode) atomic force microscopy (AM-AFM) is a technique for obtaining surface topographic images at the atomic or molecular-scale by detecting changes in the cantilever oscillation amplitude. Since it can operate in air or liquid conditions, it has contributed to various material research fields. However, it remains unclear why the tip-sample interaction force estimated from an experimental amplitude value is substantially greater than the actual molecular binding force, despite the successful visualization of molecular dynamics. Here, we performed a theoretical analysis to tackle this question. We show that in general AM-AFM measurements, the cantilever is excited at the resonance slope whereas the conventional equation is only valid for excitation exactly at the resonance frequency. We then derive a force conversion equation for an arbitrary excitation frequency and found that the conventional equation overestimates the actual force by about five times. The theory derived here can be used for diverse AM-AFM applications, and is useful in many fields of material research.</description>

      <title>Physics-guided machine learning predicts the planet-scale performance of solar farms with sparse, heterogeneous, public data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The photovoltaics (PV) technology landscape is evolving rapidly. To predict the potential and scalability of emerging PV technologies, a global understanding of these systems' performance is essential. Traditionally, experimental and computational studies at large national research facilities have focused on PV performance in specific regional climates. However, synthesizing these regional studies to understand the worldwide performance potential has proven difficult. Given the expense of obtaining experimental data, the challenge of coordinating experiments at national labs across a politically-divided world, and the data-privacy concerns of large commercial operators, however, a fundamentally different, data-efficient approach is desired. Here, we present a physics-guided machine learning (PGML) scheme to demonstrate that: (a) The world can be divided into a few PV-specific climate zones, called PVZones, illustrating that the relevant meteorological conditions are shared across continents; (b) by exploiting the climatic similarities, high-quality monthly energy yield data from as few as five locations can accurately predict yearly energy yield potential with high spatial resolution and a root mean square error of less than 8 kWhm$^{2}$, and (c) even with noisy, heterogeneous public PV performance data, the global energy yield can be predicted with less than 6% relative error compared to physics-based simulations provided that the dataset is representative. This PGML scheme is agnostic to PV technology and farm topology, making it adaptable to new PV technologies or farm configurations. The results encourage physics-guided, data-driven collaboration among national policymakers and research organizations to build efficient decision support systems for accelerated PV qualification and deployment across the world.</description>

      <title>Transmission characteristics of millimeter and sub-terahertz channels through spatially ripple plasma sheath layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The propagation of millimeter wave (MMW) and sub-terahertz (THz) signals through plasma sheaths is a critical concern for maintaining communication with hypersonic vehicles, yet the impact of complex plasma structures on these high-frequency channels remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we aim to characterize the transmission properties of MMW and sub-THz waves through plasma sheaths with various density profiles and ripple structures, addressing the gap in knowledge regarding the effects of plasma inhomogeneities on signal propagation. We employ an approach combining Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) data with transfer matrix methods (TMM) to model propagation through both flat and rippled plasma layers. Our findings reveal that ripple structures in plasma sheaths significantly affect channel performance, with periodic ripples reducing cutoff frequency and introducing frequency-selective behavior, while random ripples cause more unpredictable transmission characteristics. Our results explore the impact of the arrangement of plasma density layers and the parameters of ripple structures (period and amplitude) on channel transmission, group velocity dispersion, and angular dependence of wave propagation. These results provide crucial insights for the design and optimization of communication systems for hypersonic vehicles, potentially enabling the development of adaptive technologies capable of maintaining reliable communication in complex plasma environments.</description>

      <title>Experimentally mapping the scattering phases and amplitudes of a finite object by optical mutual scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mutual scattering arises when multiple waves intersect within a finite scattering object, resulting in cross-interference between the incident and scattered waves. By measuring mutual scattering, we determine the complex-valued scattering amplitude $f$ - both amplitude and phase - of the finite object, which holds information on its scattering properties by linking incident and outgoing waves from any arbitrary direction. Mutual scattering is present for any coherent wave - acoustic, electromagnetic, particle - and we here demonstrate the effect using optical experiments. We propose an experimental technique for characterization that utilizes mutual scattering and we present our results for four distinct finite objects: a polystyrene sphere (diameter $59\ \mu$m), a single black human hair (diameter $92\ \mu$m), a strip of pultruded carbon (edge length $140\ \mu$m), and a block of ZnO$_2$ (edge length $64\ \mu$m). Our measurements exhibit qualitative agreement with Mie scattering calculations where the model is applicable. Deviations from the model indicate the complexity of the objects, both in terms of their geometrical structure and scattering properties. Our results offer new insights into mutual scattering and have significant implications for future applications of sample characterization in fields such as metrology, microscopy, and nanofabrication.</description>

      <title>Application of interpretable machine learning for cross-diagnostic inference on the ST40 spherical tokamak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning models are exceptionally effective in capturing complex non-linear relationships of high-dimensional datasets and making accurate predictions. However, their intrinsic ``black-box'' nature makes it difficult to interpret them or guarantee ``safe behavior'' when deployed in high-risk applications such as feedback control, healthcare and finance. This drawback acts as a significant barrier to their wider application across many scientific and industrial domains where the interpretability of the model predictions is as important as accuracy. Leveraging the latest developments in interpretable machine learning, we develop a method to parameterise ``black-box'' models, effectively transforming them into ``grey-box'' models. We apply this approach to plasma diagnostics by creating a parameterised synthetic Soft X-Ray imaging $-$ Thomson Scattering diagnostic, which predicts high temporal resolution electron temperature and density profiles from the measured soft X-ray emission. The ``grey-box'' model predictions are benchmarked against the trained ``black-box'' models as well as a diverse range of plasma conditions. Our model-agnostic approach can be applied to various machine learning architectures, enabling direct comparisons of model interpretations.</description>

      <title>Virtual VNA: Minimal-Ambiguity Scattering Matrix Estimation with Load-Tunable Ports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the following generic wave problem: is the estimation of the $N \times N$ scattering matrix characterizing an arbitrarily complex linear system with $N$ monomodal ports possible if waves can be input and output only via $N_\mathrm{A}&lt;N$ ports while the remaining $N_\mathrm{S}=N-N_\mathrm{A}$ ports are terminated with tunable loads? We show that if $N_\mathrm{A}\geq 2$ and at least three distinct and known tunable loads are available, the problem can be solved (in closed form or via gradient descent) except for sign ambiguities on the off-diagonal scattering coefficients involving the $N_\mathrm{S}$ not-directly-accessible (NDA) ports. Moreover, we demonstrate that a limitation to phase-insensitive measurements only results in a mild additional blockwise phase ambiguity. If the transmission from at least one accessible port to the NDA ports can be measured, all ambiguities can be lifted. We corroborate our results with microwave experiments on an 8-port chaotic cavity with $N_\mathrm{A}=N_\mathrm{S}=4$. The demonstrated suite of techniques (coined "virtual VNA") enables the characterization of an arbitrary linear $N$-port system with an $N_\mathrm{A}$-port measurement device, where $N_\mathrm{A} \ll N$. Potential applications include the contactless characterization of miniaturized, embedded, receive-only and/or multi-element antenna systems and programmable integrated photonic circuits, as well as wireless bioelectronic sensing in complex media.</description>

      <title>Active Interface Characteristics of Heterogeneously Integrated GaAsSb/Si Photodiodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is increased interest in the heterogeneous integration of various compound semiconductors with Si for a variety of electronic and photonic applications. This paper focuses on integrating GaAsSb (with absorption in the C-band at 1550nm) with silicon to fabricate photodiodes, leveraging epitaxial layer transfer (ELT) methods. Two ELT techniques, epitaxial lift-off (ELO) and macro-transfer printing (MTP), are compared for transferring GaAsSb films from InP substrates to Si, forming PIN diodes. Characterization through atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) exhibits a high-quality, defect-free interface. Current-voltage (IV) measurements and capacitance-voltage (CV) analysis validate the quality and functionality of the heterostructures. Photocurrent measurements at room temperature and 200 K demonstrate the device's photo-response at 1550 nm, highlighting the presence of an active interface.</description>

      <title>Tunable kHz distributed feedback fiber laser enabled by glass additive-manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04598v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: techniques can be considered as an attractive alternative to the often-cumbersome traditional manufacturing routes. With the use of high-power lasers, localized hot zones that are necessary for glass making can be obtained rapidly. For instance, Laser-Powder-Deposition enables rapid fabrication of short, high gain fibers used in e.g., distributed feedback fiber lasers (DFFL). DFFLs offer sought after performance suitable for a broad range of applications in modern photonics i.e., superior stability and narrower, single-frequency linewidth compared to conventional fiber lasers. Tunable, narrow laser sources with output in eye-safe spectrum are desired for sensing, signal multiplexing, LIDAR systems, quantum applications etc. In this work we present DFFL obtained using Laser-Powder-Deposition made Er-doped silica fiber. Milliwatt level, narrow line lasing (&lt; 704 kHz, equipment limited) was obtained using a phaseshifted grating written in 16 mm long fiber. The backward slope efficiency was as high as 24% when pumping at 976 nm. The results presented in this work showcase new possibilities in fiber fabrication that were unlocked through laser-assisted additive manufacturing. This fiber laser sets the stage for the future of rapid fabrication of advanced fiber devices through unconventional manufacturing routes.</description>
