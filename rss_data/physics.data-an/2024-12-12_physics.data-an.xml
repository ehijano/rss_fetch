      <title>Homophily Within and Across Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional social network analysis often models homophily--the tendency of similar individuals to form connections--using a single parameter, overlooking finer biases within and across groups. We present an exponential family model that integrates both local and global homophily, distinguishing between strong homophily within tightly knit cliques and weak homophily spanning broader community interactions. By modeling these forms of homophily through a maximum entropy approach and deriving the network behavior under percolation, we show how higher-order assortative mixing influences network dynamics. Our framework is useful for decomposing homophily into finer levels and studying the spread of information and diseases, influence dynamics, and innovation diffusion. We demonstrate that the interaction between different levels of homophily results in complex percolation thresholds. We tested our model on various datasets with distinct homophily patterns, showcasing its applicability. These homophilic connections significantly affect the effectiveness of intervention and mitigation strategies. Hence, our findings have important implications for improving public health measures, understanding information dissemination on social media, and optimizing intervention strategies.</description>

      <title>PAD\'E FILTERING, Principles and Use: an Introductory Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report aims to provide gravitational waves data analysts with an introduction to the ideas and practice of the Pad\'e Filtering method for disentangling a signal from the noise. Technically it comes to the tracking of the zeros and singularities of random z-Transforms by noisy Pad\'e Approximants.</description>

      <title>Fast GPU-Powered and Auto-Differentiable Forward Modeling of IFU Data Cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present RUBIX, a fully tested, well-documented, and modular Open Source tool developed in JAX, designed to forward model IFU cubes of galaxies from cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The code automatically parallelizes computations across multiple GPUs, demonstrating performance improvements over state-of-the-art codes by a factor of 600. This optimization reduces compute times from hours to only seconds. RUBIX leverages JAX's auto-differentiation capabilities to enable not only forward modeling but also gradient computations through the entire pipeline paving the way for new methodological approaches such as e.g. gradient-based optimization of astrophysics model parameters. RUBIX is open-source and available on GitHub: https://github.com/ufuk-cakir/rubix.</description>

      <title>Toward Model-Agnostic Detection of New Physics Using Data-Driven Signal Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the search for new particles in high-energy physics, it is crucial to select the Signal Region (SR) in such a way that it is enriched with signal events if they are present. While most existing search methods set the region relying on prior domain knowledge, it may be unavailable for a completely novel particle that falls outside the current scope of understanding. We address this issue by proposing a method built upon a model-agnostic but often realistic assumption about the localized topology of the signal events, in which they are concentrated in a certain area of the feature space. Considering the signal component as a localized high-frequency feature, our approach employs the notion of a low-pass filter. We define the SR as an area which is most affected when the observed events are smeared with additive random noise. We overcome challenges in density estimation in the high-dimensional feature space by learning the density ratio of events that potentially include a signal to the complementary observation of events that closely resemble the target events but are free of any signals. By applying our method to simulated $\mathrm{HH} \rightarrow 4b$ events, we demonstrate that the method can efficiently identify a data-driven SR in a high-dimensional feature space in which a high portion of signal events concentrate.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the Solar Wind Plasma Density on Moderate Geomagnetic Activity Elucidated by Potential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07073v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between a moderate level of geomagnetic activity, represented by Kp (2- - 5+), and solar wind conditions was revealed using Potential Learning (PL). We also discussed dependence of particular solar wind plasma density on moderate geomagnetic conditions. It has poorly been understood from what stage of geomagnetic activity solar wind density begins to control Kp. Previously, PL succeeded to extract the most influential solar wind parameters at an extremely low (0 - 1+) and high (6- - 9) Kp under southward IMF conditions. The IMF three components, solar wind flow speed, and plasma density obtained from the 22 years' OMNI solar wind database were used as the inputs. PL extracted the solar wind velocity as the most significant, and further solar wind number density was the second most influential parameter for the moderate Kp under southward IMF conditions. This result was the same as the previous PL result in relation between extremely low and high Kp for southward IMF. Based on statistical investigations using solar wind speed and plasma density database used in PL under extremely low, high, and moderate Kp, geomagnetic conditions remain high while the plasma number density becomes large, even if the solar wind velocity is slow. This shows that not only solar wind velocity but also plasma density plays a crucial role in causing geomagnetic disturbances, following empirical relation between Kp and the solar wind plasma parameter. The results obtained from PL and incidental statistical investigations using the PL database suggest that the solar wind density begins to affect Kp from moderate geomagnetic activity even under southward IMF conditions. They also would greatly help not only understand general relationship between solar wind conditions and geomagnetic activity but also forecast geomagnetic activity under various IMF conditions.</description>
