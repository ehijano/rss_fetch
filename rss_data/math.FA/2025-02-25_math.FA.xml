      <title>Some spectral results for certain positive operators in Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates spectral properties of certain classes of positive operators originated from different matrices appeared in linear complementarity problem. These positive operators play a crucial role in various areas of mathematics and its applications, including operator theory, functional analysis, and quantum mechanics. Understanding their spectral behavior is essential for analyzing the dynamics and stability of systems governed by such operators. P-matrix is one of the important types of matrices appearing in linear complementarity problems. In this research, with the help of spectral results we have given a factorization for P-matrix, as the product of two non-trivial P-matrices. We also focus on elucidating spectral properties such as eigenvalues, approximate eigenvalues and spectral values associated with certain positive operators.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Wigner multipliers and the Bochner-Riesz conjecture for Schatten class operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce the notion of Fourier-Wigner multipliers for the Schatten class operators $\mathcal{S}^p$, which acts as an extension of classical localisation operators in time-frequency analysis. We establish results about Fourier-Wigner multipliers through convolution with rank-one operators and Werner-Young's inequality. We are also able to prove an equivalence relation for compactly supported Fourier multipliers. This allows us to reformulate the Bochner-Riesz conjecture in terms of Schatten class operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ and $H$ be locally compact groups and consider their associate spaces of almost periodic functions $AP(G)$ and $AP(H)$. We investigate the continuous group homomorphisms induced by isometries of $AP(G)$ into $AP(H)$. Among others, the following results are proved:
  {\bf Theorem} Let $G$ and $H$ be $\sigma$-compact maximally almost periodic locally compact groups. Suppose that $T$ is a non-vanishing linear isometry of $AP(G)$ into $AP(H)$ that respects finite dimensional unitary representations. Then there is a closed subgroup $H_0\subseteq H$, a continuous group homomorphism $t$ of $H_0$ onto $G$ and an character $\gamma\in \widehat{H}$ such that $(Tf)(h)=\gamma (h)~f(t(h))$ for all $h\in H_0$ and for all $f\in C(G)$.
  {\bf Theorem} Let $G$ and $H$ be $LC$ Abelian groups and $H$ is connected. Suppose that $T$ is a non-vanishing linear isometry of $AP(G)$ into $AP(H)$ that preserves trigonometric polynomials. Then there is a closed subgroup $H_0\subseteq H$, a continuous group homomorphism $t$ of $H_0$ onto $G$, an element $h_0\in H_0$, a character $\alpha \in \widehat{H}$ and an unimodular complex number $a$ such that $(Tf)(h)=a\cdot \alpha (h)~\cdot f(t(h-h_0))\text{ for
  all }h\in H_0\text{ and for all }f\in C(G)\text{.}$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Banach spaces $C(K)$ of real-valued continuous functions from the finite product of compact lines. It turns out that the topological character of these compact lines can be used to distinguish whether two spaces of continuous functions on products are isomorphic or embeddable to each other. In particular, for compact lines $K_1, \dots, K_n, L_1, \dots, L_k$ of uncountable character and $k \neq n$, we claim that Banach spaces $C(\prod_{i=1}^n K_i)$ and $C(\prod_{j=1}^k L_j)$ are not isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Polyhedrality for twisted sums of $C(\omega^\omega)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a partial answer to the $3$-space problem for isomorphic polyhedrality: every twisted sum of $C(\alpha)$, $\alpha&lt;\omega_1$ with a separable isomorphically polyhedral space with the BAP, is isomorphically polyhedral. We obtain other related results of independent interest; for instance, that every twisted sum of $c_0(\kappa)$ and a Banach space having a boundary with property $(*)$ has a boundary with property $(*)$.</description>

      <title>Notes on a special order on $\mathbb{Z}^\infty$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1958, Helson and Lowdenslager extended the theory of analytic functions to a general class of groups with ordered duals. In this context, analytic functions on such a group $G$ are defined as the integrable functions whose Fourier coefficients lie in the positive semigroup of the dual of $G$. In this paper, we found some applications of their theory to infinite-dimensional complex analysis. Specifically, we considered a special order on $\mathbb{Z}^\infty$ and corresponding analytic continuous functions on $\mathbb{T}^\omega$, which serves as the counterpart of the disk algebra in infinitely many variables setting. By characterizing its maximal ideals, we have generalized the following theorem to the infinite-dimensional case: For a positive function $w$ that is integrable and log-integrable on $\mathbb{T}^d$, there exists an outer function $g$ such that $w=|g|^2$ if and only if the support of $\hat{\log w}$ is a subset of $\mathbb{N}^d\cap (-\mathbb{N})^d$. Furthermore, we have found the counterpart of the above function algebra in the closed right half-plane, and the representing measures of each point in the right half-plane for this algebra. As an application of the order, we provided a new proof of the infinite-dimensional Szeg\"{o}'s theorem.</description>

      <title>Directional polynomial wavelets on spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we construct discrete tight frames for $L^2(\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$, $d\geq3$, which consist of localized polynomial wavelets with adjustable degrees of directionality. In contrast to the well studied isotropic case, these systems are well suited for the direction sensitive analysis of anisotropic features such as edges. The price paid for this is the fact that at each scale the wavelet transform lives on the rotation group $SO(d)$, and not on $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ as in the zonal setting. Thus, the standard approach of building discrete frames by sampling the continuous wavelet transform requires a significantly larger amount of sample points. However, by keeping the directionality limited, this number can be greatly reduced to the point where it is comparable to the number of samples needed in the isotropic case. Moreover, the limited directionality is reflected in the wavelets being steerable and their great localization in space leads to a fast convergence of the wavelet expansion in the spaces $L^p(\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$, $1\leq p \leq \infty$.</description>

      <title>Some sets of first category in product Calder\'{o}n-Lozanovski\u{\i} spaces on hypergroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a locally compact hypergroup with a left Haar measure $\mu$ and $\Omega$ be a Banach ideal of $\mu$-measurable complex-valued functions on $K$. For Young functions $\{\varphi_i\}_{i=1,2,3}$, let $\Omega_{\varphi_i}(K)$ be the corresponding Calder\'{o}n--Lozanovski\u{\i} space associated with $\varphi_i$ on $K$. Motivated by the remarkable work of Akbarbaglu et al. in [Adv. Math. 312 (2017), 737-763], in this article, the authors give several sufficient conditions for the sets $$\left\{(f,g)\in\Omega_{\varphi_1}(K)\times\Omega_{\varphi_2}(K):\ |f|\ast |g|\in\Omega_{\varphi_3}(K)\right\}$$ and $$\left\{(f,g)\in\Omega_{\varphi_1}(K)\times\Omega_{\varphi_2}(K):\ \exists\,x\in U,\ (|f|\ast |g|)(x)&lt;\infty\right\}$$ to be of first category in the sense of Baire, where $U\subset K$ denotes a compact set. All these results are new even for Orlicz(-Lorentz) spaces on hypergroups.</description>

      <title>Maximal regularity estimates for the abstract Cauchy problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the Da Prato-Grisvard theory of maximal regularity estimates for sectorial operators in interpolation spaces. Specifically, for any generator $-A$ of an analytic semigroup on a Banach space $X$, we identify the interpolation spaces between $X$ and the domain $D_{A}$ of $A$ in which the part of $A$ satisfies certain maximal regularity estimates. We also establish several new results concerning both homogeneous and inhomogeneous $L^1$-maximal regularity estimates, extending and completing recent findings in the literature. These results are motivated not only by applications to problems in areas such as fluid mechanics but also by the intrinsic theoretical interest of the subject. In particular, we address the optimal choice of data spaces for the Cauchy problem associated with $A$, ensuring the existence of strong solutions with global-in-time control of their derivatives. This control is measured via the homogeneous parts of the interpolation norms in the spatial variable and weighted Lebesgue norms over the time interval. Furthermore, we characterize weighted $L^1$-estimates and establish their relationship with unweighted estimates. Additionally, we reformulate the characterization condition for $L^1$-maximal regularity due to Kalton and Portal in a priori terms that do not rely on semigroup operators. Finally, we introduce a new interpolation framework for $L^p$-maximal regularity estimates, where $p \in (1, \infty)$, within interpolation spaces generated by non-classical interpolation functors.</description>

      <title>On the functional Minkowski problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To every log-concave function $f$ one may associate a pair of measures $(\mu_{f},\nu_{f})$ which are the surface area measures of $f$. These are a functional extension of the classical surface area measure of a convex body, and measure how the integral $\int f$ changes under perturbations. The functional Minkowski problem then asks which pairs of measures can be obtained as the surface area measures of a log-concave function. In this work we fully solve this problem.
  Furthermore, we prove that the surface area measures are continuous in correct topology: If $f_{k}\to f$, then $\left(\mu_{f_{k}},\nu_{f_{k}}\right)\to\left(\mu_{f},\nu_{f}\right)$ in the appropriate sense. Finding the appropriate mode of convergence of the pairs $\left(\mu_{f_{k}},\nu_{f_{k}}\right)$ sheds a new light on the construction of functional surface area measures. To prove this continuity theorem we associate to every convex function a new type of radial function, which seems to be an interesting construction on its own right.
  Finally, we prove that the solution to functional Minkowski problem is continuous in the data, in the sense that if $\left(\mu_{f_{k}},\nu_{f_{k}}\right)\to\left(\mu_{f},\nu_{f}\right)$ then $f_{k}\to f$ up to translations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give direct proofs and constructions of the trace and extension theorems for Sobolev mappings in $W^{1, 1} (M, N)$, where $M$ is Riemannian manifold with compact boundary $\partial M$ and $N$ is a complete Riemannian manifold. The analysis is also applicable to halfspaces and strips. The extension is based on a tiling the domain of the considered applications by suitably chosen dyadic cubes to construct the desired extension. Along the way, we obtain asymptotic characterizations of the $L^1$-energy of mappings.</description>

      <title>The multilinear fractional sparse operator theory II: refining weighted estimates via multilinear stochastic fractional sparse forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon our study of the sparse bounds of generalized commutators of multilinear fractional singular integral operators in \cite{CenSong2412}, this paper seeks to further refine the main results presented in \cite{CenSong2412} in the following key aspects. Firstly, we replace pointwise domination with ($m+1$)-linear stochastic fractional reducing sparse form ${\mathcal B}_{\alpha(\eta) ,\mathcal{S},\tau,\tau',{\vec r},t}^\mathbf{b,k}$, thus providing a new approach to the vector-valued multilinear stochastic fractional sparse domination principle. Additionally, the conditions required for this result are relaxed from multilinear weak type boundedness in \cite{CenSong2412} to multilinear locally weak type boundedness $W_{\vec{p}, q}(X)$, which allows us to extend the main ideas from Lerner \cite{Lerner2019} (2019) and Lorist et al. \cite{Lorist2024} (2024). Secondly, and more importantly, we move away from the original techniques of quantitatively estimating multilinear stochastic fractional sparse operators ${\mathcal A}_{\alpha(\eta),\mathcal{S},\tau,{\vec{r}},t}^\mathbf{b,k,t}$, and instead employ a more powerful multilinear fractional \( \vec{r} \)-type maximal operator $\mathscr{M}_{\alpha(\eta),\vec{r}}$. This necessitates the development of a new class of multilinear fractional weights $ A_{(\vec{p},q),(\vec{r}, s)}(X)$ to quantitatively characterize this maximal operator, followed by revealing the norm equivalence between this maximal operator and the sparse forms introduced earlier, thereby generalizing part of the ideas of Nieraeth \cite{Nier2019} (2019). ......</description>

      <title>A lattice approach to matrix weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14666v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we recontextualize the theory of matrix weights within the setting of Banach lattices. We define an intrinsic notion of directional Banach function spaces, generalizing matrix weighted Lebesgue spaces. Moreover, we prove an extrapolation theorem for these spaces based on the boundedness of the convex-set valued maximal operator. We also provide bounds and equivalences related to the convex body sparse operator. Furthermore, we introduce a weak-type analogue of directional Banach function spaces. In particular, we show that the weak-type boundedness of the set valued maximal operator on matrix weighted Lebesgue spaces is equivalent to the matrix Muckenhoupt condition, with equivalent constants.
  Finally, we apply our main results to matrix-weighted variable Lebesgue and Morrey spaces, obtaining new extrapolation results and characterizations extending the known ones of the scalar setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24113v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The representations that can be defined starting from positive sesquilinear maps {\Phi} with values in an ordered Banach module are essentially of two types: if {\Phi} is positive, a natural generalization follows the path of the GNS construction; if {\Phi} is completely positive, one can move toward a possible generalization of the Stinespring dilation theorem. Both possibilities are explored in this paper providing representations of positive and completely positive ordered Banach bimodule-valued sesquilinear maps on a quasi *-algebra.</description>

      <title>On the definition of "almost LUR (ALUR)" notion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of almost LUR (ALUR) point is introduced in the paper [P. Bandyopadhyay et al., Some generalizations of locally uniform rotundity, J. Math. Anal. Appl., 252, 906-916 (2000)], where one says that the point $x$ of the unit sphere $S_{X}$ of a Banach space is an almost LUR (ALUR) point of $B_{X}$ if for any sequences $\{x_{n}\}\subseteq B_{X}$ and $\{x_{m}^{\ast}\}\subseteq B_{X^{\ast}}$, the condition $\lim_{m}\lim_{n}x_{m}^{\ast}\left(\frac{x_{n}+x}{2}\right)=1$ implies $\lim_{n}\left\Vert x_{n}-x\right\Vert =0$, without mentioning what is meant by $\lim_{m}\lim_{n}\gamma_{m,n}=\gamma$ for $\gamma$, $\gamma_{m,n}\in\mathbb{R}$; $X$ is ALUR if $X$ is almost LUR at any $x\in S_{X}$. Of course, the natural definition for this iterated limit would be that for each $m$ sufficiently large there exists $\mu_{m}:=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\gamma_{m,n}\in\mathbb{R}$ and $\gamma =\lim_{m\rightarrow\infty}\mu_{m}$. However, as seen in some proofs where $\lim_{m}\lim_{n}$ appears, this interpretation is not confirmed. In this paper we examine several works in which almost LUR is mentioned and, especially, the proofs of those results in which the above definition of "almost LUR" point (or space) is invoked. Moreover, we analyze similar problems related to the notion CWALUR which extend ALUR. Furthermore, we mention several gaps in the proofs of some results. Finally, we propose the change of $\lim_{m}\lim_{n}$ by $\lim_{m}\liminf_{n}$ in the definitions of several types of ALUR points; moreover, we provide the complete proofs of two results from the literature in which $\lim_{m}\lim_{n}$ were used effectively, using $\lim_{m}\liminf_{n}$ instead.</description>

      <title>Multiple positive solutions for a double phase system with singular nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01319v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of double phase systems which contain the singular and mixed nonlinear terms. Unlike the single equation, the mixed nonlinear terms make the problem more complicate. The geometry of the fibering mapping has multiple possibilities. To overcome the difficulties posed by the mixed nonlinear terms, we need to repeatedly construct concave functions, discuss different cases, and use the properties of concave functions and basic inequalities such as H\"{o}lder inequality, Poincar\'{e}'s inequality and Young's inequality. By the use of the Nehari manifold, the existence and multiplicity of positive solutions which have nonnegative energy are obtained.</description>

      <title>RKHS, Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on arbitrary compact smooth manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02838v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we define Berezin-type and Odzijewicz-type quantizations on compact smooth manifolds. The method is we embed the smooth manifold of real dimension $n$ into ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and induce the quantizations from there. The standard way by which reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are defined on submanifolds gives a way to define the pullback coherent states. In Berezin-type quantization the Hilbert space of quantization is the pullback (by the embedding) of the Hilbert space of geometric quantization of ${\mathbb C}P^n$. In the Odzijewicz-type quantization one has to consider a tensor product of the geometric quantization line bundle with holomorphic $n$-forms. In the Berezin case, the operators that are quantized are those induced from the ambient space ${\mathbb C}P^n$. The Berezin-type quantization exhibited here is a generalization of an earlier work of the author and Ghosh. In both Berezin and Odzijewicz-type quantizations we first exhibit this quantization explicitly on ${\mathbb C}P^n$ and we induce the quantization on the smooth compact embedded manifold from ${\mathbb C}P^n$.</description>

      <title>Heat operators and isometry groups of Cuntz-Krieger algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces heat semigroups of topological Markov chains and Cuntz-Krieger algebras by means of spectral noncommutative geometry. Using recent advances on the logarithmic Dirichlet Laplacian on Ahlfors regular metric-measure spaces, we construct spectral triples on Cuntz-Krieger algebras from singular integral operators. These spectral triples exhaust odd K-homology and for Cuntz algebras we can compute their heat operators explicitly as Riesz potential operators. We also describe their isometry group in terms of the automorphism group of the underlying directed graph and prove that the Voiculescu noncommutative topological entropy vanishes on isometries.</description>

      <title>Abstract semiclassical analysis of the van Hove model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the semiclassical limit $\hslash\to 0$ of a completely solvable model in quantum field theory: the van Hove model, describing a scalar field created and annihilated by an immovable source. Despite its simplicity, the van Hove model possesses many characterizing features of quantum fields, especially in the infrared region. In particular, the existence of non-Fock ground and equilibrium states in the presence of infrared singular sources makes a representation-independent algebraic approach of utmost importance. We make use of recent representation-independent techniques of infinite dimensional semiclassical analysis to establish the Bohr correspondence principle for the dynamics, equilibrium states, and long-time asymptotics in the van Hove model.</description>

      <title>On exponential frames near the critical density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a relatively compact set $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of Lebesgue measure $|\Omega|$ and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we show the existence of a set $\Lambda \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ of uniform density $D (\Lambda) \leq (1+\varepsilon) |\Omega|$ such that the exponential system $\{ \exp(2\pi i \lambda \cdot) \mathbf{1}_{\Omega}: \lambda \in \Lambda \}$ is a frame for $L^2 (\Omega)$ with frame bounds $A |\Omega|, B |\Omega|$ for constants $A,B$ only depending on $\varepsilon$. This solves a problem on the frame bounds of an exponential frame near the critical density posed by Nitzan, Olevskii and Ulanovskii. We also prove an extension to locally compact abelian groups, which improves a result by Agora, Antezana and Cabrelli by providing frame bounds involving the spectrum.</description>
