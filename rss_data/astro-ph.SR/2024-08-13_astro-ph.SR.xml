      <title>Spin-Orbit Alignment of Early-type Astrometric Binaries and the Origin of Slow Rotators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spin-orbit alignment of binary stars traces their formation and accretion history. Previous studies of spin-orbit alignment have been limited to small samples, slowly rotating solar-type stars, and/or wide visual binaries that not surprisingly manifest random spin-orbit orientations. We analyze 917 Gaia astrometric binaries across periods $P$ = 100-3,000 days ($a$ = 0.5-5 au) that have B8-F1 IV/V primaries ($M_1$ = 1.5-3 M$_{\odot}$) and measured projected rotational velocities $v$sin$i$. The primary stars in face-on orbits exhibit substantially smaller $v$sin$i$ compared to those in edge-on orbits at the 6$\sigma$ level, demonstrating significant spin-orbit alignment. The primaries in our astrometric binaries are rotating more slowly than their single-star or wide-binary counterparts and therefore comprise the slow-rotator population in the observed bimodal rotational velocity distribution of early-type stars. We discuss formation models of close binaries where some of the disk angular momentum is transferred to the orbit and/or secondary spin, quenching angular momentum flow to the primary spin. The primaries in astrometric binaries with small mass ratios $q$ = $M_2$/$M_1&lt;$0.3 possess even smaller $v$sin$i$, consistent with model predictions. Meanwhile, astrometric binaries with large eccentricities $e&gt;$0.4 do not display spin-orbit alignment or spin reduction. Using a Monte Carlo technique, we measure a spin-orbit alignment fraction of $F_{\rm align}$ = 75% $\pm$ 5% and an average spin reduction factor of $\langle S_{\rm align} \rangle$ = 0.43 $\pm$ 0.04. We conclude that 75% of close A-type binaries likely experienced circumbinary disk accretion and probably formed via disk fragmentation and inward disk migration. The remaining 25%, mostly those with $e&gt;$0.4, likely formed via core fragmentation and orbital decay via dynamical friction.</description>

      <title>Statistics of Solar White-Light Flares I: Optimization of Identification Methods and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White-light flares (WLFs) are energetic activity in stellar atmosphere. However, the observed solar WLF is relatively rare compared to stellar WLFs or solar flares observed at other wavelengths, limiting our further understanding solar/stellar WLFs through statistical studies. By analyzing flare observations from the \emph{Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO)}, here we improve WLF identification methods for obtaining more solar WLFs and their accurate light curves from two aspects: 1) imposing constraints defined by the typical temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of WLF-induced signals; 2) setting the intrinsic threshold for each pixel in the flare ribbon region according to its inherent background fluctuation rather than a fixed threshold for the whole region. Applying the optimized method to 90 flares (30 C-class ones, 30 M-class ones, and 30 X-class ones) for a statistical study, we identified a total of 9 C-class WLFs, 18 M-class WLFs, and 28 X-class WLFs. The WLF identification rate of C-class flares reported here reaches 30\%, which is the highest to date to our best knowledge. It is also revealed that in each GOES energy level, the proportion of WLFs is higher in confined flares than that in eruptive flares. Moreover, a power-law relation is found between the WLF energy (\emph{E}) and duration ($\tau$): $\tau \propto {E}^{0.22}$, similar to those of solar hard/soft X-ray flares and other stellar WLFs. These results indicate that we could recognize more solar WLFs through optimizing the identification method, which will lay a base for future statistical and comparison study of solar and stellar WLFs.</description>

      <title>Unveiling subarcsecond multiplicity in the Pleiades with Gaia multicolor photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The list of 409 probable cluster members down to $G=15^{\rm mag}$ ($m \gtrsim 0.5M_\odot$) is compiled for the two degree radius of the Pleiades, based on astrometric data from Gaia DR3 and the PPMXL catalog, along with several radial velocity surveys, including APOGEE and LAMOST. This approach allows for the inclusion of binary stars with unreliable Gaia solutions, thereby eliminating associated bias. Thus, the often-neglected 14 sources with Gaia two-parameter solutions are included. The subsequent analysis of color-magnitude and color-color diagrams exploits artifacts in Gaia photometric data, caused by the different field sizes used to measure fluxes in the $G$, $B_p$, and $R_p$ passbands, to reveal binary stars with subarcsecond angular separation. The findings are validated with prior high-resolution observations. Overall, $24 \pm 3$ cluster members with angular separation between 0.1 and 1 arcsec (13.5 to 135 AU projected distance) and mass ratio $q&gt;0.5$ are deemed binary, indicating a binarity fraction of $6 \pm 1$\%.</description>

      <title>Localizing quasi-periodic pulsations in hard X-ray, microwave and Lya emissions of an X6.4 Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the simultaneous observations of quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in wavelengths of hard X-ray (HXR), microwave, Ly{\alpha}, and ultraviolet (UV) emissions during the impulsive phase of an X6.4 flare on 2024 February 22 (SOL2024-02-22T22:08). The X6.4 flare shows three repetitive and successive pulsations in HXR and microwave wavebands, and they have an extremely-large modulation depth. The onset of flare QPPs is almost simultaneous with the start of magnetic cancellation between positive and negative fields. The wavelet power spectra suggest the presence of double periods, which are centered at about 200s and 95s, respectively. The long-period QPP can also be detected in Ly$\alpha$ and UV wavebands at the flare area, and it could be observed in the adjacent sunspot. Our observations indicate that the flare QPPs are most likely triggered by accelerated electrons that are associated with periodic magnetic reconnections. The long period at about 200s is probably modulated by the slow magnetoacoustic wave originating from the neighboring sunspot, while the short period at about 95s could be regarded as its second harmonic mode.</description>

      <title>TESS asteroseismology of $\beta$ Hydri: a subgiant with a born-again dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar-type subgiant $\beta$ Hyi has long been studied as an old analog of the Sun. Although the rotation period has never been measured directly, it was estimated to be near 27 days. As a southern hemisphere target it was not monitored by long-term stellar activity surveys, but archival International Ultraviolet Explorer data revealed a 12 year activity cycle. Previous ground-based asteroseismology suggested that the star is slightly more massive and substantially larger and older than the Sun, so the similarity of both the rotation rate and the activity cycle period to solar values is perplexing. We use two months of precise time-series photometry from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) to detect solar-like oscillations in $\beta$ Hyi and determine the fundamental stellar properties from asteroseismic modeling. We also obtain a direct measurement of the rotation period, which was previously estimated from an ultraviolet activity-rotation relation. We then use rotational evolution modeling to predict the rotation period expected from either standard spin-down or weakened magnetic braking (WMB). We conclude that the rotation period of $\beta$ Hyi is consistent with WMB, and that changes in stellar structure on the subgiant branch can reinvigorate the large-scale dynamo and briefly sustain magnetic activity cycles. Our results support the existence of a "born-again" dynamo in evolved subgiants -- previously suggested to explain the cycle in 94 Aqr Aa -- which can best be understood within the WMB scenario.</description>

      <title>Precise and Accurate Short-term Forecasting of Solar Energetic Particle Events with Multivariate Time Series Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events are one of the most crucial aspects of space weather that require continuous monitoring and forecasting using robust methods. We demonstrate a proof of concept of using a data-driven supervised classification framework on a multivariate time series data set covering solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. We implement ensemble modeling that merges the results from three proton channels (E$\geq$10 MeV, 50 MeV, and 100 MeV) and the long band X-ray flux (1-8{\AA}) channel from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite missions. Our task is binary classification, such that the aim of the model is to distinguish strong SEP events from nonevents. Here, strong SEP events are those crossing the Space Weather Prediction Center's "S1" threshold of solar radiation storm and proton fluxes below that are weak SEP events. In addition, we consider periods of non-occurrence of SEPs following a flare with magnitudes $\geq$C6.0 to maintain a natural imbalance of sample distribution. In our data set, there are 244 strong SEP events comprising the positive class. There are 189 weak events and 2,460 "SEP-quiet" periods for the negative class. We experiment with summary statistic classifier, one-nearest neighbor and supervised time series forest (STSF), and compare their performances to validate our methods for prediction windows from 5 min up to 60 min. We find STSF to perform better under all circumstances. For an optimal classification threshold of $\approx$0.3 and a 60 min prediction window, we obtain: TSS = 0.850, HSS = 0.878, GSS = 0.783.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Burning in Accretion Flow of Helium-rich matter onto Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impacts of nuclear burning on the spherically symmetric stationary accretion flow of helium-rich matter on to compact objects. We have already shown the existence of the critical accretion rates for the accretion of CO-rich matter above which the flow truncates in the supersonic region due to nuclear burning in the previous paper \citep{2022ApJ...933...29N}. Here, we show that there are also critical accretion rates for helium-rich matter. While we used empirical formulae for the energy generation rates for carbon burning and oxygen burning without solving the nuclear reaction network in our previous work, we solve a simple nuclear reaction network consisting of 13 elements from $^4$He to $^{56}$Ni to investigate influence of the energy generation from not only triple-$\alpha$ reactions but also the subsequent reactions of synthesized elements. We have also qualitatively confirmed the previous results for CO-rich matter accretion using the revised code with the nuclear reaction network and reported some new findings.</description>

      <title>Various Features of the X-class White-light Flares in Super Active Region NOAA 13664</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super active region NOAA 13664 produced 12 X-class flares (including the largest one, an occulted X8.7 flare, in solar cycle 25 so far) during 2024 May 8-15 and 11 of them are identified as white-light flares. Here we present various features of these X-class white-light flares observed by the White-light Solar Telescope (WST) on board the Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory. It is found that both the white-light emissions at WST 3600 {\AA} (Balmer continuum) and HMI 6173 {\AA} (Paschen continuum) show up in different regions of the sunspot group in these flares, including outside the sunspots and within the penumbra and umbra of the sunspots. They exhibit a point-, ribbon-, loop-, or ejecta-like shape, which can come from flare ribbons (or footpoints), flare loops, and plasma ejecta depending on the perspective view. The white-light duration and relative enhancement are measured and both parameters for 3600 {\AA} emission have greater values than those for 6173 {\AA} emission. It is also found that these white-light emissions are cospatial well with the hard X-ray (HXR) sources in the on-disk flares but have some offsets with the HXR emissions in the off-limb flares. In addition, it is interesting that the 3600 and 6173 {\AA} emissions show different correlations with the peak HXR fluxes, with the former one more sensitive to the HXR emission. All these greatly help us understand the white-light flares of a large magnitude from a super active region on the Sun and also provide important insights into superflares on Sun-like stars.</description>

      <title>Three types of solar coronal rain during magnetic reconnection between open and closed magnetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal rain (CR) is a crucial part of the mass cycle between the corona and chromosphere. It includes the flare-driven CR and two types of quiescent CR separately along the non-flaring active region closed loops and along the open structures, labeled as types I, II, and III CR, respectively. Among them, types I and III CR are generally associated with magnetic reconnection. In this study, employing data taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar Upper Transition Region Imager (SUTRI) on 2022 October 11, we report three types of CR during an interchange reconnection between open and closed magnetic filed structures above the southeastern solar limb. The open and closed structures converge, with the formation of current sheet at the interface, and reconnect. The newly-formed closed and open structures then recede from the reconnection region. During the reconnection, coronal condensation occurs along the reconnecting closed loops, and falls toward the solar surface along both loop legs as the type II CR. Subsequently, condensation happens in the newly-formed closed loops, and moves down toward the solar surface along both loop legs as the type I CR. Magnetic dips of the reconnecting open structures form during the reconnection. In the dips, condensation occurs, and propagates along the open structures toward the solar surface as the type III CR. Our results suggest that the reconnection rate may be crucial for the formation of types I and III CR during the reconnection.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field, magnetospheric accretion and candidate planet of the young star GM Aurigae observed with SPIRou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyses spectropolarimetric observations of the classical T Tauri star (CTTS) GM Aurigae collected with SPIRou, the near-infrared spectropolarimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, as part of the SLS and SPICE Large Programs. We report for the first time results on the large-scale magnetic field at the surface of GM Aur using Zeeman Doppler imaging. Its large-scale magnetic field energy is almost entirely stored in an axisymmetric poloidal field, which places GM Aur close to other CTTSs with similar internal structures. A dipole of about 730 G dominates the large-scale field topology, while higher-order harmonics account for less than 30 per-cent of the total magnetic energy. Overall, we find that the main difference between our three reconstructed maps (corresponding to sequential epochs) comes from the evolving tilt of the magnetic dipole, likely generated by non-stationary dynamo processes operating in this largely convective star rotating with a period of about 6 d. Finally, we report a 5.5$\sigma$ detection of a signal in the activity-filtered radial velocity data of semi-amplitude 110 $\pm$ 20 m/s at a period of 8.745 $\pm$ 0.009 d. If attributed to a close-in planet in the inner accretion disc of GM Aur, it would imply that this planet candidate has a minimum mass of 1.10 $\pm$ 0.30 Mjup and orbits at a distance of 0.082 $\pm$ 0.002 au.</description>

      <title>Study of a red clump giant, KIC~11087027, with high rotation and strong infrared excess -- Evidence of tidal interaction for high lithium abundance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents results from Kepler photometric light curves and high-resolution spectroscopic study of a super Li-rich giant KIC11087027. Using the light curve analysis, we measured the star's rotational period P$_{\rm rot}$=30.4$\pm$0.1~days, which translates to rotational velocity V$_{\rm rot}$=19.5 $\pm$ 1.7~km s$^{-1}$. Star's location in the HR-diagram, derived values of $^{12}C/^{13}C$ = 7$\pm$1 and $[C/N]=-0.95\pm 0.2$, and the inferred asteroseismic parameters from secondary calibration based on spectra suggest star is a low-mass red clump giant in the He-core burning phase. Using Gaia data, we found evidence of variation in radial velocity and proper motion, indicative of presence of an unresolved binary. The large V$_{\rm rot}$ is probably a result of tidal synchronization combined with the after-effects of He-flash, in which the size of the star is reduced significantly. The simultaneous presence of features like high rotation, very high Li abundance, strong dust shell, and strong flares in a single star is relatively uncommon, suggesting that the star experiencing tidal synchronization has recently undergone He-flash. The results pose a question whether the binary interaction, hence the high rotation, is a prerequisite for dredging-up of the high amounts of Li from the interior to the photosphere during or immediately after the He-flash event.</description>

      <title>Continuum and molecular emission from the inner regions of the symbiotic system R Aquarii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symbiotic systems often include an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star and a hot compact companion, such as a white dwarf, that are in close interaction. Due to the intense ultraviolet emission from the hot companion, the molecular content of circumstellar envelopes in the symbiotic systems is poor. As a result, the less abundant molecules have not been previously studied in detail in this kind of object. R Aqr is the closest and best-studied symbiotic system. We obtain the spatial distribution of the recombination line H30{\alpha} with a high and moderate angular resolution, and it is compared with the emission of the continuum at 1.3 mm. High-resolution maps of several molecules are also obtained in the three observed ALMA bands. We study the molecular emissions using a simplified model to explain the brightness distributions seen in the central position of our maps. We find that the low-resolution continuum map at 1.3mm shows the emission of the radio photosphere of the AGB star, its surroundings, and the structure of the bipolar jet launched by the companion. The high-resolution continuum map at 1.3mm shows the innermost part of the jet, probably revealing the position of the secondary, and suggests mass transfer from the AGB star to the white dwarf. The brightness distribution of H30{\alpha} is similar but not coincident with the continuum emission. The brightness distributions of the studied molecular lines show a variety of shapes. The emissions of the abundant molecules, CO and SiO, are relatively extended since they can survive far from the AGB star in spite of the intense ultraviolet emission from the white dwarf. On the contrary, less abundant molecules only survive in regions close to the AGB star, where shielding is stronger. From our best-fit model for these weak species, we find that these less abundant species are confined to the intra-orbital regions.</description>

Abstract: We apply the HanleRT Tenerife Inversion Code to the spectro-polarimetric observations obtained by the Chromospheric LAyer SpectroPolarimeter. This suborbital space experiment measured the variation with wavelength of the four Stokes parameters in the near-ultraviolet spectral region of the Mg II h &amp; k lines over a solar disk area containing part of an active region plage and the edge of a sunspot penumbra. We infer the stratification of the temperature, the electron density, the line of-sight velocity, the micro-turbulent velocity, and the longitudinal component of the magnetic field from the observed intensity and circular polarization profiles. The inferred model atmosphere shows larger temperature and electron density in the plage and the superpenumbra regions than in the quiet regions. The shape of the plage region in terms of its brightness is similar to the pattern of the inferred longitudinal component of the magnetic field in the chromosphere, as well as to that of the overlying moss observed by AIA in the 171 A band, which suggests a similar magnetic origin for the heating in both the plage and the moss region. Moreover, this heating is particularly significant in the regions with larger inferred magnetic flux. In contrast, in the superpenumbra, the regions with larger electron density and temperature are usually found in between these regions with larger magnetic flux, suggesting that the details of the heating mechanism in the chromosphere of the superpenumbra may be different to those in the plage, but with the magnetic field still playing a key role.</description>

      <title>Mode identification and ensemble asteroseismology of 164 \beta Cep stars discovered from Gaia light curves and monitored by TESS</title>

Abstract: The Gaia mission discovered many new candidate \beta Cephei (\beta Cep) pulsators, which are meanwhile confirmed from TESS space photometry. We aim to analyse all currently available TESS data for these \beta Cep pulsators, of which 145 were new discoveries, in order to exploit their asteroseismic potential. \beta Cep stars belong to an under-represented class of pulsators in the current space photometry revolution while being of critical importance to improve evolution models of massive stars. We extracted light curves for 216 star from the TESS full-frame images and performed pre-whitening. Based on Gaia DR3, we deduced stellar properties and compared them to those of known \beta Cep stars. We developed a methodology to identify the dominant pulsation modes of the \beta Cep stars from Gaia and TESS amplitude ratios and from the detection of rotationally-split multiplets. We used grid modelling to gain insights into the population of \beta Cep stars. With the combination of TESS and Gaia, we successfully identified the mode degrees for 176 stars. of which the majority are dipole non-radial modes. Many non-radial modes show splittings in their TESS frequency spectra allowing us to assemble a large set of split multiplets in \beta Cep stars and to calculate their envelope rotation, spin parameter, and the level of differential envelope-to-surface rotation. For the latter, we find an upper limit of 4, with most stars rotating almost rigidly. We also provide the asymmetries of the multiplets. Based on grid modelling, we provide mass, convective core mass, and ages for 164 stars. By combining Gaia and TESS, we enable asteroseismology of \beta Cep stars as a population. Our study prepares for future detailed modelling based on individual frequencies of identified modes leading towards a better understanding of these massive pulsators, as crucial probes of stellar evolution theory.

      <title>Analysis of KIC 7023917 -- spotted low-mass ratio eclipsing binary with $\delta$ Scuti pulsations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Times of minima of eclipsing binary KIC 7023917 show quasiperiodic anti-symmetric deviations from the calculated one with an amplitude of up to 10 minutes and a period of 200 - 300 days. These changes correlate with the observed variations of the light-curve maxima (amplitude and phase separation). We used photometric data obtained by Kepler and TESS missions to analyse the times of minima and determine system parameters. The phases and amplitudes of the maxima were measured to study the O'Connell effect. As an additional source of information, we performed ground-based multi-colour photometric observation and determined the radial velocities of the system from our spectroscopic measurements. We could explain long-term variations of the light-curve shape and times of the eclipses using the cold star spot located on the secondary component and the modification of its size. Based on our modelling, the system consists of a primary main-sequence star of spectral type A7 and an evolved, oversized secondary component with a mass ratio of only 0.1 due to past mass transfer. Calculation of absolute parameters gives us the mass of the primary component about 1.8 M$_\odot$ and 0.2 M$_\odot$ for the secondary one, and radii of 2.2 R$_\odot$ of the primary star and 0.9 R$_\odot$ of secondary one, respectively. The studied low-mass ratio eclipsing binary is probably a progenitor of the variable star of EL CVn type. A multiple-period photometric variability was disclosed in the TESS data ranging from half to two hours due to $\delta$ Scuti-type pulsations of the primary component.</description>

      <title>Testing the flux tube expansion factor -- solar wind speed relation with Solar Orbiter data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of the solar wind measured in-situ in the heliosphere are largely controlled by energy deposition in the solar. Previous studies have shown that long duration and large scale magnetic structures show an inverse relation between the solar wind velocity measured in situ near 1 au and the expansion factor of the magnetic flux tubes in the solar atmosphere. We exploit Solar Orbiter data in conjunction with the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) coronal model, and the solar wind trajectory to evaluate the flux expansion factor - speed relation at the solar "source surface" at rss. We find a statistically weak anti-correlation between the in-situ bulk velocity and the coronal expansion factor, for about 1.5 years of solar data. Classification of the data by source latitude reveals different levels of anticorrelation. We show the existence of fast solar wind that originates in strong magnetic field regions at low latitudes and undergoes large expansion factor. We provide evidence that such winds become supersonic during the super radial expansion (below rss), and are theoretically governed by a positive correlation v-f. We find that faster winds on average have a flux tube expansion at a larger radius than slower winds. An anticorrelation between solar wind speed and expansion factor is present for solar winds originating in high latitude structures in solar minimum activity, typically associated with coronal hole-like structures, but this cannot be generalized to lower latitude sources. Therefore, the value of the expansion factor alone cannot be used to predict the solar wind speed. Other parameters, such as the height at which the expansion gradient is the strongest must also be taken into account.</description>

      <title>Galactic kinematics of various stellar types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare and contrast the kinematics of various classes of stars, both normal (with M-K spectral types) and peculiar. Numerous plots show the differences in spatial and velocity distributions as well as distributions in kinetic energy vs. angular momentum (KE vs. LZ) space. In the latter plots, young, thin disk stars on nearly circular orbits cling to the left edge of a so-called solar parabola, while older objects on elliptical orbits fill the central parabolic region. Some of the young Wolf-Rayet stars violate this trend due to smaller semi-major axes than the Sun or orbital eccentricities. Deviation of the vertex of the velocity ellipsoid is discussed as an indication of population and youth, with an emphasis on Ap, Bp, Am, Fm, Herbig AeBe, and lambda Boo stars. Both the vertex deviation and phase space distribution provide useful insights.</description>

      <title>On the potential origin of the circumbinary planet Delorme 1 (AB)b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many circumbinary gas giant planets have been recently discovered. The formation mechanism of circumbinary planets on wide orbits is unclear. We investigate the formation of Delorme 1 (AB)b, a 13$\pm$5M$_{\rm J}$ planet, orbiting its host binary at 84AU. The planet is accreting while having an estimated age of 40Myr, which is unexpected, as this process should have ceased due to the dissipation of the protoplanetary disc. Using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics code SEREN, we model three formation scenarios for this planet. In Scenario I the planet forms in-situ on a wide orbit in a massive disc (by gravitational instability), in Scenario II closer to the binary in a massive disc (by gravitational instability), and in Scenario III much closer to the binary in a less massive disc (by core accretion). Planets in Scenario I stay at the observed separation, have mass accretion rates consistent with observed value, but their final mass is too high. In Scenario II, the planet reaches the observed separation through outward migration or scattering by the binary, and has mass accretion rate comparable to the observed; however, the planet mass is above the observed value. In Scenario III, the planet's final mass and mass accretion rate are comparable to the observed ones but the planet's separation is smaller. We conclude that all models may explain some features of the observations but not all of them, raising questions about how gas is accreted onto the planet from its circumplanetary disc, and of the presumed age of the system.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave emission in Binary Neutron Star early post-merger within a dark environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using an effective Lagrangian model inspired by [1] we describe the early post-merger of a binary Neutron Star (BNS) merger event with a non-vanishing ambient fraction of dark matter. For this we mimic the dynamics of two oscillating Neutron Star (NS) masses in the gravitational potential well as they merge. We parametrize the ejected baryonic matter fraction in the coalescence event forming a surrounding debris disk containing a non-vanishing dark matter fraction. In order to analyze the dark contribution, we start from a dark-matter free modelization using Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) techniques to replicate the gravitational waveforms obtained from simulations in the CoRe database for three selected equations of state for NS matter (DD2, BHBlp, SFHo). Later, we explore the impact of a dark viscous fluid under a prescribed velocity dependent force and obtain the waveforms and spectral properties originating in the first few ms in the BNS post-merger. Finally we discuss our findings in light of the prospects of detectability of a non-vanishing fraction of dark matter arising in the waveforms and power spectral distribution in present or future experimental settings.</description>

      <title>How accurate are current $^{56}$Ni mass estimates in Type Ia Supernovae?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diversity of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has become increasingly apparent with the rapid growth in observational data. Understanding the explosion mechanism of SNe Ia is crucial for their cosmological calibration and for advancing our knowledge of stellar physics. The estimation of $^{56}$Ni mass produced in these events is key to elucidating their explosion mechanism. This study compares two methods of $^{56}$Ni mass estimation. We first examine the relationship between peak luminosity and the second maximum in near-infrared (NIR) bands using observations of 18 nearby SNe Ia. Based on this relationship, we estimate the Ni mass for a set of nine well-observed SNe Ia using the Arnett rule. Additionally, we estimate the $^{56}$Ni mass using bolometric light curves of these SNe through energy conservation arguments. A comparison of these two estimation methods using Student's t-test reveals no statistically significant differences between the estimates. This finding suggests that both methods provide robust estimates of Ni mass in SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Spectuner: A Framework for Automated Line Identification of Interstellar Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar molecules, which play an important role in astrochemistry, are identified using observed spectral lines. Despite the advent of spectral analysis tools in the past decade, the identification of spectral lines remains a tedious task that requires extensive manual intervention, preventing us from fully exploiting the vast amounts of data generated by large facilities such as ALMA. This study aims to address the aforementioned issue by developing a framework of automated line identification. We introduce a robust spectral fitting technique applicable for spectral line identification with minimal human supervision. Our method is assessed using published data from five line surveys of hot cores, including W51, Orion-KL, Sgr B2(M), and Sgr B2(N). By comparing the identified lines, our algorithm achieves a recall of ~ 84% - 98%. Our code, named Spectuner, is publicly available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Logic and numbers related to solar neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, first of all, we analyze a number of hidden aspects of the concept of particle oscillations. The key element of this concept, which do not comply with the principle of least action, is the notion of a mixture of particles, introduced by Gell-Mann and Pais for neutral $K$-mesons. It has been proven that the law of conservation of energy-momentum in the processes of electron neutrino production does not allow solving the problem of solar neutrinos based on the assumption of Gribov and Pontecorvo about their oscillations. It has been established that the consequences of Wolfenstein's equation contradict the results of the SNO and Super-Kamiokande collaborations and that the assertion by Mikheev and Smirnov on the conversion of solar neutrinos is erroneous. Another part of the work is devoted to a logically clear solution to this problem based on the hypothesis of the existence of a new interaction, the carrier of which is a massless pseudoscalar boson, which has a Yukawa coupling with electron neutrinos and nucleons. At each act of interaction of an electron neutrino with the nucleons of the Sun, caused by such interaction, the handedness of the neutrino changes from left to right and vice versa, and also the neutrino energy decreases. The hypothesis provides good agreement between the theoretical and experimental values of the rates of all five observed processes with solar neutrinos. This serves as a significant criterion for both the confidence of such a solution to the problem of solar neutrinos and the confidence of the existence of a new interaction.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the dust and gas contributions of the JWST/MIRI spectrum of Sz28</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent spectra of protoplanetary disks around very low-mass stars (VLMS), captured by the Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), reveal a rich carbon chemistry. Current interpretations of these spectra are based on 0D slab models and provide valuable estimates for molecular emission temperatures and column densities in the innermost disk. However, the established fitting procedures and simplified models are challenged by the many overlapping gas features. We aim to simultaneously determine the molecular and the dust composition of the disk around the VLMS Sz28 in a Bayesian way. We model the JWST/MIRI spectrum of Sz28 up to $17\,\rm \mu m$ using the Dust Continuum Kit with Line emission from Gas (DuCKLinG). Systematically excluding different molecules from the Bayesian analysis allows for an evidence determination of all investigated molecules and isotopologues. We continue by examining the emission conditions and locations of all molecules, analysing the differences to previous 0D slab fitting, and analysing the dust composition. We find very strong Bayesian evidence for the presence of C2H2, HCN, C6H6, CO2, HC3N, C2H6, C3H4, C4H2, and CH4 in the JWST/MIRI spectrum of Sz28. Additionally, we identify CH3 and find tentative indications for NH3. There is no evidence for water in the spectrum. However, we show that column densities of up to $2\times10^{17}\,\rm cm^{-2}$ could be hidden in the observational noise if assuming similar emission conditions of water as the detected hydrocarbons. Contrary to previous 0D slab results, a C4H2 quasi-continuum is robustly identified. We expect some of the stated differences to previous 0D slab fitting results to arise from an updated data reduction of the spectrum, but also due to the different modelling process. The latter reason underpins the need for more advanced models and fitting procedures.</description>

      <title>Gas-phase Fe/O and Fe/N abundances in Star-Forming Regions. Relations between nucleosynthesis, metallicity and dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In stars, metallicity is usually traced using Fe, while in nebulae, O serves as the preferred proxy. Both elements have different nucleosynthetic origins and are not directly comparable. Additionally, in ionized nebulae, Fe is heavily depleted onto dust grains. We investigate the distribution of Fe gas abundances in a sample of 452 star-forming nebulae with \feiii~$\lambda 4658$ detections and their relationship with O and N. Additionally, we analyze the depletion of Fe onto dust grains in photoionized environments. We homogeneously determine the chemical abundances with direct determinations of electron temperature ($T_e$), considering the effect of possible internal variations of this parameter. We adopt a sample of 300 Galactic stars to interpret the nebular findings. We find a moderate linear correlation ($r=-0.59$) between Fe/O and O/H. In turn, we report a stronger correlation ($r=-0.80$) between Fe/N and N/H. We interpret the tighter correlation as evidence of Fe and N being produced on similar timescales while Fe-dust depletion scales with the Fe availability. The apparently flat distribution between Fe/N and N/H in Milky Way stars supports this interpretation. We find that when 12+log(O/H)&lt;7.6, the nebulae seem to reach a plateau value around $\text{log(Fe/O)} \approx -1.7$. If this trend is confirmed, it would be consistent with a very small amount of Fe-dust in these systems, similar to what is observed in high-z galaxies discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We derive a relationship that allows us to approximate the fraction of Fe trapped into dust in ionized nebulae. If the O-dust scales in the same way, its possible contribution in low metallicity nebulae would be negligible. After analyzing the Fe/O abundances in J0811+4730 and J1631+4426, we do not see evidence of the presence of very massive stars with $M_\text{init}&gt;300M_{\odot}$ in these systems.</description>

      <title>PDRs4All. X. ALMA and JWST detection of neutral carbon in the externally irradiated disk d203-506: Undepleted gas-phase carbon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gas-phase abundance of carbon, x_C = C/H, and its depletion factors are essential parameters for understanding the gas and solid compositions that are ultimately incorporated into planets. The majority of protoplanetary disks are born in clusters and, as a result, are exposed to external FUV radiation. These FUV photons potentially affect the disk's evolution, chemical composition, and line excitation. We present the first detection of the [CI]609um fine-structure line of neutral carbon (CI), achieved with ALMA, toward one of these disks, d203-506, in the Orion Nebula Cluster. We also report the detection of CI forbidden and permitted lines (from electronically excited states up to 10 eV) observed with JWST in the IR. These lines trace the irradiated outer disk and photo-evaporative wind. Contrary to the common belief that these IR lines are C+ recombination lines, we find that they are dominated by FUV-pumping of CI followed by fluorescence cascades. They trace the transition from atomic to molecular gas, and their intensities scale with G0. The lack of outstanding IR OI fluorescent emission, however, implies a sharper attenuation of external FUV radiation with E &gt; 12 eV (~Lyman-beta). This is related to a lower effective FUV dust absorption cross section compared to that of interstellar grains, implying a more prominent role for FUV shielding by the CI photoionization continuum. The [CI]609um intensity is proportional to N(CI) and can be used to infer x_C. We derive x_C ~ 1.4E-4. This implies that there is no major depletion of volatile carbon compared to x_C measured in the natal cloud, hinting at a young disk. We also show that external FUV radiation impacts the outer disk and wind by vertically shifting the water freeze-out depth, which results in less efficient grain growth and settling. This shift leads to nearly solar gas-phase C/O abundance ratios in these irradiated layers.</description>

      <title>Infant Type Ia Supernovae from the KMTNet I. Multi-Color Evolution and Populations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct a systematic analysis of the early multi-band light curves and colors of 19 Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) from the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network SN Program, including 16 previously unpublished events. Seven are detected $\lesssim$ 1 day since the estimated epoch of first light and the rest within $\lesssim$ 3 days. Some show excess emission within $&lt;$ 0.5 days to $\sim$ 2 days, but most show pure power-law rises. The colors are initially diverse before $\sim$ 5 days, but converge to a similar color at $\sim$ 10 days. We identify at least three populations based on 2--5-day color evolution: (1) "early-blues" exhibit slowly-evolving colors consistent with a $\sim$ 17,000 K blackbody; (2) "early-reds" have initially blue $B-V$ and red $V-i$ colors that cannot simultaneously be fit with a blackbody -- likely due to suppression of $B$- and $i$-band flux by Fe II/III and Ca II -- and evolve more rapidly; and (3) "early-yellows" evolve blueward, consistent with thermal heating from $\sim$ 8,000 to 13,000 K. The distributions of early-blue and early-red colors are compatible with them being either distinct populations -- with early-reds comprising (60 $\pm$ 15)% of them -- or extreme ends of one continuous population; whereas the early-yellow population identified here is clearly distinct. Compared to the other populations, early-blues in our sample differ by exhibiting excess emission within 1--2 days, nearly constant peak brightness regardless of $\Delta M_{15}(B)$ after standardization, and shallower Si II features. Early-blues also prefer star-forming host environments, while early-yellows and, to a lesser extent, early-reds prefer quiescent ones. These preferences appear to indicate at least two Type Ia SN production channels based on stellar population age, while early-reds and early-blues may still share a common origin.</description>

      <title>Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES). II. An Observation Strategy for the Target Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) constitutes a mission intricately designed to systematically survey approximately 100 solar-type stars located within the immediate proximity of the solar system, specifically within a range of 10 parsecs. The core objective of this mission is the detection and characterization of potentially habitable Earth-like planets or super-Earths within the habitable zone of these stars. The CHES mission obtains high-precision astrometric measurements of planets orbiting the target stars by observing angular distance variations between the target star and reference stars. As a result, we surveyed the relevant parameters of both target and reference stars in detail, conducting a thorough analysis and calculation of the required observation accuracy, the number of observations, and the priority assigned to each target star. Observational emphasis will be concentrated on targets considered of higher priority, ensuring the effectiveness of their observation capabilities. Through this approach, we formulate a five-year observation strategy that will cover all the target stars within a six-month timeframe. The strategy not only fulfills the required observing capability but also exhibit high efficiency simultaneously, providing an executable program for future mission. Over the span of the mission's five-year duration, a cumulative observation time of 29,220 hours will be available. Approximately 86 percent of this, totaling 25,120 hours, is allocated for the observation of target stars. This allocation leaves approximately 4,100 hours for extended scientific observation programs. We have also performed simulated observations based on this strategy and verified its observational capability for exoplanets.</description>

      <title>EP Aquarii: a new picture of the circumstellar envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New analyses of earlier ALMA observations of oxygen-rich AGB star EP Aquarii are presented, which contribute major progress to our understanding of the morpho-kinematics of the circumstellar envelope (CSE). The birth of the equatorial density enhancement (EDE) is shown to occur very close to the star where evidence for rotation has been obtained. High Doppler velocity wings are seen to consist of two components, the front end of the global wind, reaching above $\pm$12 km s$^{-1}$, and an effective line broadening, confined within 200 mas from the centre of the star, reaching above $\pm$20 km s$^{-1}$ and interpreted as caused by the pattern of shock waves resulting from the interaction between stellar pulsation and convective cell granulation. Close to the star, episodic and lumpy mass ejections are observed, and their interaction with the gas of the nascent EDE, first rotating and later slowly expanding, is seen to play an important role in the development of the wind and the evolution of its radial velocity from 8-10 km s$^{-1}$ on the polar symmetry axis to $\sim$2 km s$^{-1}$ at the equator. It implies a very complex morpho-kinematics, which prevents making reliable interpretations with reasonable confidence. In particular, it sheds serious doubts on an earlier interpretation implying the presence of a white dwarf companion orbiting the star at an angular distance of $\sim$0.4 arcsec from its centre and currently west of it.</description>

      <title>3D hydrodynamic simulations of massive main-sequence stars. III. The effect of radiation pressure and diffusion leading to a 1D equilibrium model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present 3-D hydrodynamical simulations of core convection with a stably stratified envelope of a \unit{25}{\Msun} star in the early phase of the main-sequence. We use the explicit gas-dynamics code \code{PPMstar} which tracks two fluids and includes radiation pressure and radiative diffusion. Multiple series of simulations with different luminosities and radiative thermal conductivities are presented. The entrainment rate at the convective boundary, internal gravity waves in and above the boundary region, and the approach to dynamical equilibrium shortly after a few convective turnovers are investigated. We perform very long simulations on $896^3$ grids accelerated by luminosity boost factors $1000$, $3162$ and $10000$. In these simulations the growing penetrative convection reduces the initially unrealistically large entrainment. This reduction is enabled by a spatial separation that develops between the entropy gradient and the composition gradient. The convective boundary moves outward much more slowly at the end of these simulations. Finally, we present a 1-D method to predict the extent and character of penetrative convection beyond the Schwarzschild bounxdary. The 1-D model is based on a spherically-averaged reduced entropy equation that takes the turbulent dissipation as input from the 3-D hydrodynamic simulation and takes buoyancy and all other energy sources and sinks into account. This 1-D method is intended to be ultimately deployed in 1-D stellar evolution calculations and is based on the properties of penetrative convection in our simulations carried forward through the local thermal timescale.</description>

      <title>Detection of high-frequency pulsation in WR135: investigation of stellar wind dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the detection of high-frequency pulsations in WR 135 from short cadence (10 minutes) optical photometric and spectroscopic time series surveys. The harmonics up to $6^{th}$ order are detected from the integrated photometric flux variations while the comparatively weaker $8^{th}$ harmonic is detected from the strengths of the emission lines. We investigate the driving source of the stratified winds of WR 135 using the radiative transfer modeling code, CMFGEN, and find the physical conditions that can explain the propagation of such pulsations. From our study, we find that the optically thick sub-sonic layers of the atmosphere are close to the Eddington limit and are launched by the Fe-opacity. The outer optically thin super-sonic winds ($\tau_{ross}=0.1-0.01$) are launched by the He II and C IV opacities. The stratified winds above the sonic point undergo velocity perturbation that can lead to clumps. In the optically thin supersonic winds ($\tau_{ross}=0.1-0.01$), dense clumps of smaller size ($f=0.27-0.3$) pulsate with higher-order harmonics. The larger clumps ($f=0.2$) oscillate with lower-order harmonics of the pulsation and affect the overall wind variability.</description>

      <title>The enigma of Li-rich giants and its relation with temporal variations observed in radial velocity and stellar activity signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the large number of studies focused on the characterisation of Li-rich stars and understanding the mechanisms leading to such enrichment, their origin remains a mystery. Magnetic activity, particularly the phenomena usually associated with it, and the Li abundance (A(Li)) of stars, are in general thought to be connected. As of today, however, just how they are connected is unclear. In this work, we study a sample of young but evolved intermediate-mass red giants that are inhabitants of open clusters where planets have been searched for. Our aim is to use radial velocity (RV) and stellar activity indicator signals to look for relations between Li abundances and stellar activity or variability. We explored how the standard deviation (STD), peak-to-peak amplitude (PTP), mean, and median of typical stellar activity indicators (BIS, FWHM, $T_\textrm{eff}$, and H$\alpha$ index) change as a function of the Li content of 82 red giants. Furthermore, we computed weighted Pearson correlation coefficients ($\rho_w$) between time series of RV measurements and the stellar activity indicators for the stars in our sample. To aid our results, we also studied generalized Lomb-Scargle periodograms (GLSP) to capture possible significant periodic temporal variations in our data. Our analysis indicates that the STD and PTP of BIS and FWHM, the mean and median of the H$\alpha$ index, and $v\sin(i)$ increase exponentially with A(Li) in our sample of red giants. Significant temporal variations and correlations between RVs and activity indicators also tend to be found preferentially for stars where high A(Li) is observed. Most of the Li-rich stars in our sample either show strong correlations of RV with at least one of the stellar activity indicators or reveal significant periodic temporal variations in their GLSPs of stellar activity indicators that are consistent with those found for RV.</description>

      <title>Estimated Heating Rates Due to Cyclotron Damping of Ion-scale Waves Observed by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02708v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Circularly polarized waves consistent with parallel-propagating ion cyclotron waves (ICWs) and fast magnetosonic waves (FMWs) are often observed by Parker Solar Probe (PSP) at ion kinetic scales. Such waves damp energy via the cyclotron resonance, with such damping expected to play a significant role in the enhanced, anisotropic heating of the solar wind observed in the inner heliosphere. We employ a linear plasma dispersion solver, PLUME, to evaluate frequencies of ICWs and FMWs in the plasma rest frame and Doppler-shift them to the spacecraft frame, calculating their damping rates at frequencies where persistently high values of circular polarization are observed. We find such ion-scale waves are observed during $20.37\%$ of PSP Encounters 1 and 2 observations and their plasma frame frequencies are consistent with them being transient ICWs. We estimate significant ICW dissipation onto protons, consistent with previous empirical estimates for the total turbulent damping rates, indicating that ICW dissipation could account for the observed enhancements in the proton temperature and its anisotropy with respect to the mean magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Primeval very low-mass stars and brown dwarfs -- VIII. The first age benchmark L subdwarf, a wide companion to a halo white dwarf</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of five white dwarf + ultracool dwarf systems identified as common proper motion wide binaries in the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars. The discoveries include a white dwarf + L subdwarf binary, VVV 1256-62AB, a gravitationally bound system located 75.6(+1.9/-1.8) pc away with a projected separation of 1375(+35/-33) au. The primary is a cool DC white dwarf with a hydrogen dominated atmosphere, and has a total age of 10.5(+3.3/-2.1) Gyr, based on white dwarf model fitting. The secondary is an L subdwarf with a metallicity of [M/H] = -0.72(+0.08/-0.10) (i.e. [Fe/H] = -0.81+/-0.10) and Teff = 2298(+45/-43) K based on atmospheric model fitting of its optical to near infrared spectrum, and likely has a mass just above the stellar/substellar boundary. The sub-solar metallicity of the L subdwarf and the system's total space velocity of 406 km/s indicates membership in the Galactic halo, and it has a flat eccentric Galactic orbit passing within 1~kpc of the centre of the Milky Way every ~0.4Gyr and extending to 15-31 kpc at apogal. VVV 1256-62B is the first L subdwarf to have a well-constrained age, making it an ideal benchmark of metal-poor ultracool dwarf atmospheres and evolution.</description>

      <title>Case studies on pre-eruptive X-class flares using R-value in the lower solar atmosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04018v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The R-value is a measure of the strength of photospheric magnetic Polarity Inversion Lines (PILs) in Active Regions (ARs). This work investigates the possibility of a relation between R-value variations and the occurrence of X-class flares in ARs, not in the solar photosphere, as usual, but above it in regions, closer to where flares occur. The modus operandi is to extrapolate the Solar Dynamic Observatory's (SDO) Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) magnetogram data up to a height of 3.24 Mm above the photosphere and then compute the R-value based on the extrapolated magnetic field. Recent studies have shown that certain flare-predictive parameters such as the horizontal gradient of the vertical magnetic field and magnetic helicity may improve flare prediction lead times significantly if studied at a specific height range above the photosphere, called the Optimal Height Range (OHR). Here we define the OHR as a collection of heights where a sudden but sustained increase in R-value is found. For the eight case studies discussed in this paper, our results indicate that it is possible for OHRs to exist in the low solar atmosphere (between 0.36 - 3.24 Mm), where R-value spikes occur 48-68 hrs before the first X-class flare of an emerging AR. The temporal evolution of R-value before the first X-class flare for an emerging AR is also found to be distinct from that of non-flaring ARs. For X-class flares associated with non-emerging ARs, an OHR could not be found.</description>

      <title>TransformerPayne: enhancing spectral emulation accuracy and data efficiency by capturing long-range correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar spectra emulators often rely on large grids and tend to reach a plateau in emulation accuracy, leading to significant systematic errors when inferring stellar properties. Our study explores the use of Transformer models to capture long-range information in spectra, comparing their performance to The Payne emulator (a fully connected multilayer perceptron), an expanded version of The Payne, and a convolutional-based emulator. We tested these models on synthetic spectra grids, evaluating their performance by analyzing emulation residuals and assessing the quality of spectral parameter inference. The newly introduced TransformerPayne emulator outperformed all other tested models, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 0.15% when trained on the full grid. The most significant improvements were observed in grids containing between 1000 and 10,000 spectra, with TransformerPayne showing 2 to 5 times better performance than the scaled-up version of The Payne. Additionally, TransformerPayne demonstrated superior fine-tuning capabilities, allowing for pretraining on one spectral model grid before transferring to another. This fine-tuning approach enabled up to a tenfold reduction in training grid size compared to models trained from scratch. Analysis of TransformerPayne's attention maps revealed that they encode interpretable features common across many spectral lines of chosen elements. While scaling up The Payne to a larger network reduced its MAE from 1.2% to 0.3% when trained on the full dataset, TransformerPayne consistently achieved the lowest MAE across all tests. The inductive biases of the TransformerPayne emulator enhance accuracy, data efficiency, and interpretability for spectral emulation compared to existing methods.</description>
