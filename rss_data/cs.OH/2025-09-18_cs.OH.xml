      <title>Vehicle-to-Grid Integration: Ensuring Grid Stability, Strengthening Cybersecurity, and Advancing Energy Market Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing adoption of electric vehicles has spurred significant interest in Vehicle-to-Grid technology as a transformative approach to modern energy systems. This paper presents a systematic review of V2G systems, focusing on their integration challenges and potential solutions. First, the current state of V2G development is examined, highlighting its growing importance in mitigating peak demand, enhancing voltage and frequency regulation, and reinforcing grid resilience. The study underscores the pivotal role of artificial intelligence and machine learning in optimizing energy management, load forecasting, and real-time grid control. A critical analysis of cybersecurity risks reveals heightened vulnerabilities stemming from V2G's dependence on interconnected networks and real-time data exchange, prompting an exploration of advanced mitigation strategies, including federated learning, blockchain, and quantum-resistant cryptography. Furthermore, the paper reviews economic and market aspects, including business models (V2G as an aggregator or due to self-consumption), regulation (as flexibility service provider) and factors influencing user acceptance shaping V2G adoption. Data from global case studies and pilot programs offer a snapshot of how V2G has been implemented at different paces across regions. Finally, the study suggests a multi-layered framework that incorporates grid stability resilience, cybersecurity resiliency, and energy market dynamics and provides strategic recommendations to enable scalable, secure, and economically viable V2G deployment.</description>
