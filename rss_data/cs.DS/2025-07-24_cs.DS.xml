      <title>Smoothed Analysis of Online Metric Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study three classical online problems -- $k$-server, $k$-taxi, and chasing size $k$ sets -- through a lens of smoothed analysis. Our setting allows request locations to be adversarial up to small perturbations, interpolating between worst-case and average-case models. Specifically, we show that if the metric space is contained in a ball in any normed space and requests are drawn from distributions whose density functions are upper bounded by $1/\sigma$ times the uniform density over the ball, then all three problems admit polylog$(k/\sigma)$-competitive algorithms. Our approach is simple: it reduces smoothed instances to fully adversarial instances on finite metrics and leverages existing algorithms in a black-box manner. We also provide a lower bound showing that no algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio sub-polylogarithmic in $k/\sigma$, matching our upper bounds up to the exponent of the polylogarithm. In contrast, the best known competitive ratios for these problems in the fully adversarial setting are $2k-1$, $\infty$ and $\Theta(k^2)$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Better Bounds for Semi-Streaming Single-Source Shortest Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the semi-streaming model, an algorithm must process any $n$-vertex graph by making one or few passes over a stream of its edges, use $O(n \cdot \text{polylog }n)$ words of space, and at the end of the last pass, output a solution to the problem at hand. Approximating (single-source) shortest paths on undirected graphs is a longstanding open question in this model. In this work, we make progress on this question from both upper and lower bound fronts:
  We present a simple randomized algorithm that for any $\epsilon &gt; 0$, with high probability computes $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate shortest paths from a given source vertex in \[
  O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \cdot n \log^3 n \right)~\text{space} \quad \text{and} \quad O\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon} \cdot \left(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n} \right) ^2\right) ~\text{passes}.
  \] The algorithm can also be derandomized and made to work on dynamic streams at a cost of some extra $\text{poly}(\log n, 1/\epsilon)$ factors only in the space. Previously, the best known algorithms for this problem required $1/\epsilon \cdot \log^{c}(n)$ passes, for an unspecified large constant $c$.
  We prove that any semi-streaming algorithm that with large constant probability outputs any constant approximation to shortest paths from a given source vertex (even to a single fixed target vertex and only the distance, not necessarily the path) requires \[ \Omega\left(\frac{\log n}{\log\log n}\right) ~\text{passes}. \] We emphasize that our lower bound holds for any constant-factor approximation of shortest paths. Previously, only constant-pass lower bounds were known and only for small approximation ratios below two.
  Our results collectively reduce the gap in the pass complexity of approximating single-source shortest paths in the semi-streaming model from $\text{polylog } n$ vs $\omega(1)$ to only a quadratic gap.</description>

      <title>Strong Sparsification for 1-in-3-SAT via Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new notion of sparsification, called \emph{strong sparsification}, in which constraints are not removed but variables can be merged. As our main result, we present a strong sparsification algorithm for 1-in-3-SAT. The correctness of the algorithm relies on establishing a sub-quadratic bound on the size of certain sets of vectors in $\mathbb{F}_2^d$. This result, obtained using the recent \emph{Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa Theorem} (Gowers, Green, Manners and Tao, Ann. Math. 2025), could be of independent interest. As an application, we improve the state-of-the-art algorithm for approximating linearly-ordered colourings of 3-uniform hypergraphs (H{\aa}stad, Martinsson, Nakajima and{\v{Z}}ivn{\'{y}}, APPROX 2024).</description>

      <title>Dual Charging for Half-Integral TSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the max entropy algorithm is a randomized 1.49776 approximation for half-integral TSP, improving upon the previous known bound of 1.49993 from Karlin et al. This also improves upon the best-known approximation for half-integral TSP due to Gupta et al. Our improvement results from using the dual, instead of the primal, to analyze the expected cost of the matching. We believe this method of analysis could lead to a simpler proof that max entropy is a better-than-3/2 approximation in the general case.
  We also give a 1.4671 approximation for half integral LP solutions with no proper minimum cuts and an even number of vertices, improving upon the bound of Haddadan and Newman of 1.476. We then extend the analysis to the case when there are an odd number of vertices $n$ at the cost of an additional $O(1/n)$ factor.</description>

      <title>On recognizing graphs representing Persistent Perfect Phylogenies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Persistent Perfect phylogeny, also known as Dollo-1, has been introduced as a generalization of the well-known perfect phylogenetic model for binary characters to deal with the potential loss of characters. The problem of deciding the existence of a Persistent Perfect phylogeny can be reduced to the one of recognizing a class of bipartite graphs whose nodes are species and characters. Thus an interesting question is solving directly the problem of recognizing such graphs. We present a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding Persistent Perfect phylogeny existence in maximal graphs, where no character's species set is contained within another character's species set. Our solution, that relies only on graph properties, narrows the gap between the linear-time simple algorithm for Perfect Phylogeny and the NP-hardness results for the Dollo-$k$ phylogeny with $k&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Zeroth-order log-concave sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the zeroth-order query complexity of log-concave sampling, specifically uniform sampling from convex bodies using membership oracles. We propose a simple variant of the proximal sampler that achieves the query complexity with matched R\'enyi orders between the initial warmness and output guarantee. Specifically, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and $q\geq2$, the sampler, initialized at $\pi_{0}$, outputs a sample whose law is $\varepsilon$-close in $q$-R\'enyi divergence to $\pi$, the uniform distribution over a convex body in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, using $\widetilde{O}(qM_{q}^{q/(q-1)}d^{2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ membership queries, where $M_{q}=\lVert\text{d}\pi_{0}/\text{d}\pi\rVert_{L^{q}(\pi)}$.
  We further introduce a simple annealing scheme that produces a warm start in $q$-R\'enyi divergence (i.e., $M_{q}=O(1)$) using $\widetilde{O}(qd^{2}R^{3/2}\,\lVert\operatorname{cov}\pi\rVert^{1/4})$ queries, where $R^{2}=\mathbb{E}_{\pi}[|\cdot|^{2}]$. This interpolates between known complexities for warm-start generation in total variation and R\'enyi-infinity divergence. To relay a R\'enyi warmness across the annealing scheme, we establish hypercontractivity under simultaneous heat flow and translate it into an improved mixing guarantee for the proximal sampler under a logarithmic Sobolev inequality. These results extend naturally to general log-concave distributions accessible via evaluation oracles, incurring additional quadratic queries.</description>

      <title>Learning Safe Strategies for Value Maximizing Buyers in Uniform Price Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03674v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the bidding problem in repeated uniform price multi-unit auctions from the perspective of a value-maximizing buyer. The buyer aims to maximize their cumulative value over $T$ rounds while adhering to per-round return-on-investment (RoI) constraints in a strategic (or adversarial) environment. Using an $m$-uniform bidding format, the buyer submits $m$ bid-quantity pairs $(b_i, q_i)$ to demand $q_i$ units at bid $b_i$, with $m \ll M$ in practice, where $M$ denotes the maximum demand of the buyer.
  We introduce the notion of safe bidding strategies as those that satisfy the RoI constraints irrespective of competing bids. Despite the stringent requirement, we show that these strategies satisfy a mild no-overbidding condition, depend only on the valuation curve of the bidder, and the bidder can focus on a finite subset without loss of generality. Though the subset size is $O(M^m)$, we design a polynomial-time learning algorithm that achieves sublinear regret, both in full-information and bandit settings, relative to the hindsight-optimal safe strategy.
  We assess the robustness of safe strategies against the hindsight-optimal strategy from a richer class. We define the richness ratio $\alpha \in (0,1]$ as the minimum ratio of the value of the optimal safe strategy to that of the optimal strategy from richer class and construct hard instances showing the tightness of $\alpha$. Our algorithm achieves $\alpha$-approximate sublinear regret against these stronger benchmarks. Simulations on semi-synthetic auction data show that empirical richness ratios significantly outperform the theoretical worst-case bounds. The proposed safe strategies and learning algorithm extend naturally to more nuanced buyer and competitor models.</description>

      <title>Distributed Model Checking in Graphs Classes of Bounded Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14825v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sparsity theory of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez provides generic combinatorial and algorithmic methods suitable for many classes of sparse graphs. As such, it has already driven major advances in model checking, parameterized complexity, and approximation algorithms. We show that this theory is equally well suited to the design of distributed algorithms, providing the first generic algorithmic results for distributed first-order (FO) model checking on graphs of bounded expansion. The latter form a rich graph family which subsumes planar, bounded-genus, bounded-treewidth, and bounded-degree graphs, as well as graphs excluding a fixed minor or topological minor, and sparse Erdos-R\'enyi graphs (a.a.s).
  Our main results are the following algorithmic meta-theorems for distributed algorithms in the standard CONGEST model on every graph class $\mathcal{G}$ of bounded expansion.
  First, we resolve an open problem originally posed by Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il and Ossona de Mendez (Distributed Computing 2016), and reiterated by Pilipczuk, Siebertz, and Toru\'nczyk (LICS 2018). A formula $\varphi(x)$ is local if the satisfaction of $\varphi(x)$ depends only on the $r$-neighbourhood of its free variable $x$, for some fixed $r$. For instance, the formula '$x$ belongs to a triangle' is local. We show that, for every local FO formula $\varphi(x)$, there exists a deterministic algorithm that, for every $n$-vertex graph $G\in \mathcal{G}$, identifies all vertices $v\in V(G)$ such that $G\models \varphi(v)$, in $O(\log n)$ rounds.
  Second, we show that, for every FO formula $\varphi$, there is a deterministic algorithm that, for every $n$-vertex graph $G\in \mathcal{G}$, decides whether $G\models \varphi$, in $\mathcal{O}(D+\log n)$ rounds, where $D$ is the diameter of $G$. The techniques extend to distributed counting, optimization, and certification problems.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial Selection with Costly Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of optimization problems over stochastic variables where the algorithm can learn information about the value of any variable through a series of costly steps; we model this information acquisition process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The algorithm's goal is to minimize the cost of its solution plus the cost of information acquisition, or alternately, maximize the value of its solution minus the cost of information acquisition. Such bandit superprocesses have been studied previously but solutions are known only for fairly restrictive special cases.
  We develop a framework for approximate optimization of bandit superprocesses that applies to arbitrary acyclic MDPs with a matroid feasibility constraint. Our framework establishes a bound on the optimal cost through a novel cost amortization; it then couples this bound with a notion of local approximation that allows approximate solutions for each component MDP in the superprocess to be composed without loss into a global approximation.
  We use this framework to obtain approximately optimal solutions for several variants of bandit superprocesses for both maximization and minimization. We obtain new approximations for combinatorial versions of the previously studied Pandora's Box with Optional Inspection and Pandora's Box with Partial Inspection; the less-studied Additive Pandora's Box problem; as well as a new problem that we call the Weighing Scale problem.</description>

      <title>Recognizing and Eliciting Weakly Single Crossing Profiles on Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:1611.04175v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the weakly single-crossing domain on trees which is a generalization of the well-studied single-crossing domain in social choice theory. We design a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing preference profiles which belong to this domain. We then develop an efficient elicitation algorithm for this domain which works even if the preferences can be accessed only sequentially and the underlying single-crossing tree structure is not known beforehand. We also prove matching lower bound on the query complexity of our elicitation algorithm when the number of voters is large compared to the number of candidates. We also prove a lower bound of $\Omega(m^2\log n)$ on the number of queries that any algorithm needs to ask to elicit single crossing profile when random queries are allowed. This resolves an open question in an earlier paper and proves optimality of their preference elicitation algorithm when random queries are allowed.</description>

      <title>Choosing Public Datasets for Private Machine Learning via Gradient Subspace Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Differentially private stochastic gradient descent privatizes model training by injecting noise into each iteration, where the noise magnitude increases with the number of model parameters. Recent works suggest that we can reduce the noise by leveraging public data for private machine learning, by projecting gradients onto a subspace prescribed by the public data. However, given a choice of public datasets, it is not a priori clear which one may be most appropriate for the private task. We give an algorithm for selecting a public dataset by measuring a low-dimensional subspace distance between gradients of the public and private examples. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that the excess risk scales with this subspace distance. This distance is easy to compute and robust to modifications in the setting. Empirical evaluation shows that trained model accuracy is monotone in this distance.</description>

      <title>Certificate-Sensitive Subset Sum: Realizing Instance Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present, to our knowledge, the first deterministic, certificate-sensitive algorithm for a canonical NP-complete problem whose runtime provably adapts to the structure of each input. For a Subset-Sum instance $(S, t)$, let $\Sigma(S)$ denote the set of distinct subset sums and define $U = |\Sigma(S)|$. This set serves as an information-theoretically minimal witness, the instance-complexity (IC) certificate.
  Our solver, IC-SubsetSum, enumerates every element of $\Sigma(S)$ in deterministic time $O(U \cdot n^2)$ and space $O(U \cdot n)$. A randomized variant achieves expected runtime $O(U \cdot n)$. The algorithm's complexity is thus directly governed by the certificate size, and this structure-sensitive performance is paired with a guaranteed worst-case runtime of $O^*(2^{n/2 - \varepsilon})$ for some constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the first such result to strictly outperform classical methods on every instance.
  We revisit fine-grained reductions that rely on the classical $2^{n/2}$ hardness of SubsetSum and show that these arguments hold only for collision-free instances where $U$ is maximal. IC-SubsetSum reframes this barrier structurally and introduces a new paradigm for certificate-sensitive algorithms across NP-complete problems.</description>
