      <title>Inferring and Interpreting the Visual Geometric Albedo and Phase Function of Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding reflectance-related quantities for worlds enables effective comparative planetology and strengthens mission planning and execution. Measurements of these properties for Earth, especially its geometric albedo and phase function, have been difficult to achieve due to our Terrestrial situation -- it is challenging to obtain planetary-scale brightness measurements for the world we stand on. Using a curated dataset of visual phase-dependent, disk-averaged observations of Earth taken from the ground and spacecraft, alongside a physical-statistical model, this work arrives at a definitive value for the visual geometric albedo of our planet: 0.242 (+0.005/-0.004). This albedo constraint is up 30--40% smaller than earlier, widely-quoted values. The physical-statistical model enables retrieval-like inferences to be performed on phase curves, and includes contributions from optically thick clouds, optically thin aerosols, Rayleigh scattering, ocean glint, gas absorption, and Lambertian surface reflectance. Detailed application of this inverse model to Earth's phase curve quantifies contributions of these different processes to the phase-dependent brightness of the Pale Blue Dot. Model selection identifies a scenario where aerosol forward scattering results in a false negative for surface habitability detection. Observations of phase curves for Earth at redder-optical or near-infrared wavelengths could disentangle ocean glint effects from aerosol forward scattering and would help with understanding the utility of phase curve observations for the under-development Habitable Worlds Observatory.</description>

      <title>A catalog of near-IR absolute magnitudes of Solar System small bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Phase curves of small bodies are useful tools to obtain their absolute magnitudes and phase coefficients. The former relates to the object's apparent brightness, while the latter relates to how the light interacts with the surface. Data from multi-wavelength photometric surveys, which usually serendipitously observe small bodies, are becoming the cornerstone of large statistical studies of the Solar System. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, all studies have been carried out in visible wavelengths. Aims. We aim to provide the first catalog of absolute magnitudes in near-infrared filters (Y, J, H, and K). We will study the applicability of a non-linear model to these data and compare it with a simple linear model. Methods. We compute the absolute magnitudes using two photometric models: the HG* 12 and the linear model. We employ a combination of Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo sampling to calculate the probability distributions of the absolute magnitudes and their corresponding phase coefficients. We use the combination of four near-infrared photometric catalogs to create our input database. Results. We produced the first catalog of near-infrared magnitudes. We obtained absolute magnitudes for over 10 000 objects (with at least one absolute magnitude measured), with about 180 objects having four absolute magnitudes. We confirmed that a linear model that fits the phase curves produces accurate results. Since a linear behavior well describes the curves, fitting to a restricted phase angle range (in particular, larger than 9.5 deg) does not substantially affect the results. Finally, we also detect a phase-coloring effect in the near-infrared, as observed in visible wavelengths for asteroids and trans-Neptunian objects.</description>

      <title>The Radius, Composition, Albedo, and Absolute Magnitude of Planet Nine Based on Exoplanets with Teq less than 600 K and the Planet Nine Reference Population 3.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence suggests the existence of a large planet in the outer Solar System, Planet Nine, with a predicted mass of 6.6 +2.6 / -1.7 Earth masses (Brown et al., 2024). Based on mass radius composition models, planet formation theory, and confirmed exoplanets with low mass and radius uncertainty and equilibrium temperature less than 600 K, we determine the most likely composition for Planet Nine is a mini-Neptune with a radius in the range 2.0 to 2.6 Earth radii and a H-He envelope fraction in the range of 0.6 percent to 3.5 percent by mass. Using albedo estimates for a mini-Neptune extrapolated from V-band data for the Solar Systems giant planets gives albedo values for Planet Nine in the range of 0.47 to 0.33. Using the most likely orbit and aphelion estimates from the Planet Nine Reference Population 3.0, we estimate Planet Nines absolute magnitude in the range of -6.1 to -5.2 and apparent magnitude in the range of +21.9 to +22.7. Finally, we estimate that, if the hypothetical Planet Nine exists and is detected by upcoming surveys, it will have a resolvable disk using some higher resolution world class telescopes.</description>

      <title>Differential Corrections Algorithm for Initial Orbit Determination in the Cislunar Region using Angle-Only Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As space traffic continues to increase in the cislunar region, accurately determining the trajectories of objects operating within this domain becomes critical. However, due to the combined gravitational influences of the Earth and Moon, orbital dynamics in this region are highly nonlinear and often exhibit chaotic behavior, posing significant challenges for trajectory determination. Many existing methods attempt to address this complexity using machine learning models, advanced optimization techniques, or sensors that directly measure distance to the target, approaches that often increase computational burden and system complexity. This work presents a novel initial orbit determination (IOD) algorithm for cislunar objects based solely on three angle-only measurements taken at three discrete times. The core methodology builds upon a differential corrections framework which iteratively refines the target's trajectory to satisfy line-of-sight constraints. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the algorithm enables accurate IOD using minimal observational data, making it particularly suited for onboard implementation in resource-constrained cislunar missions.</description>

      <title>Exploring Impact Vapor Plume Reactions from Asteroidal Impacts: Monte Carlo Simulations and Implications for Biomolecules Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During a hypervelocity impact, both the impactor and target materials evaporate, generating an impact vapor plume with temperatures reaching several thousand K. As the plume cools through adiabatic expansion, chemical reactions are predicted to quench, leading to a non-equilibrium composition. However, it is still unclear how chemical reactions proceed during the cooling impact vapor plume and lead to the synthesis of organic molecules. In this study, to investigate the evolution of chemical composition within impact vapor plumes, we conducted a Monte Carlo chemical reaction simulation for complex organic synthesis, developed in our previous work. Our model does not rely on a predefined reaction network; instead, it utilizes imposed conditions for chemical changes and an approximate method for calculating reaction rates suited to our objectives. Additionally, we developed a new approach to couple these chemical reaction calculations with the rapid temperature and pressure decay in the vapor plume. Results show diverse organic molecule production depending on the impactor materials assumed in this study. These products include important precursors to biomolecules such as amino acids, sugars, and nucleobases. On the other hand, for all impactor compositions, the abundance of biomolecules themselves remains extremely low throughout the reactions from an impact to quenching. Therefore, our results suggest that biomolecules are not directly produced in impact vapor plumes but rather synthesized through reactions of these precursor molecules in aqueous solutions, following H2O condensation as the vapor plume cools. Many of the detected organic compounds, including the precursor molecules such as imine compounds and formamide, are not included in the reaction networks of previous kinetic model simulations, and their formation has not been predicted.</description>

      <title>Can a convecting magma ocean offer a solution to the puzzling case of core convection in early earth?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convective flow in Earth's iron-rich liquid core drives self-sustained dynamo action, generating Earth's magnetic field, which is strongest among all terrestrial planets of the solar system. Rock records show that this magnetic field has been operative in Earth for at least 3.4 billion years (b.y). However, advanced high pressure experiments have revised the value of the thermal conductivity of the outer core, which implies an age for the inner core of less than 1 b.y., when compositional convection begins. This creates a puzzle, with a gap between the observations of an early magnetic field on Earth and the young inner core. Previous work has suggested that the pre-inner core dynamo could have been generated in a magma ocean (MO) at the base of the mantle; however, the fluid dynamics of this scenario have received little attention. Here we numerically model the non-magnetic rotating flow in a MO above a convectively stable core in a configuration representing the pre-inner core days of Earth's evolution. Simulations here explore the importance of several dimensionless parameters on coupled core-MO convection -- the Rayleigh number, the ocean/core thermal diffusivity ratio, thermal expansion coefficient ratio, viscosity ratio, and layer thickness ratio. It is found that the MO can easily drive a flow of comparable magnitude in the core, and an approximately linear relationship is observed between the ratio of root-mean-square velocities in the core and the ocean, $(u_c^{RMS}/u_o^{RMS})$, and $(\Nu_o-1)$, where $\Nu_o$ is the Nusselt number for the MO, for the $\Nu_o$ of order 1 to 10 considered. Radial and azimuthal components of the core flow are of similar magnitude, so that, with comparable toroidal and poloidal components, we speculate that the MO-driven core flow could drive an early dynamo.</description>

      <title>Different arrival times of CM and CI-like bodies from the outer Solar System to the asteroid belt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the provenance of CI and CM chondrites, the most primitive materials in our meteorite collections, is critical for shedding light on the Solar System's early evolution and contextualizing findings from recent sample return missions. Here we show that the parent bodies of CM chondrites originate from the Saturn formation region, whereas those of CI chondrites originate essentially from the primordial trans-Uranian disk. Using Nbody simulations to investigate the effect of giant planet growth and inward Type-I migration, along with the current observed distribution of CM, CI, and comet-like P types bodies in the asteroid belt, we demonstrate that CI- and CM-like bodies must have been implanted at different times in the belt. In contrast, CI and comet-like bodies were implanted at the same time. These different implantation periods are imposed by the fact that the gas disk profile entirely governs the radial distribution of bodies implanted by aerodynamic drag in the asteroid belt. A preferred location coincides with the inner edge of a gap opened by Jupiter. Saturn's growth likely drove the migration of CM-like bodies. In contrast, CI and comet-like bodies were transported at a later stage during the outward migration of Uranus and Neptune, driven by remaining planetesimals. Since CM chondrites are chondrule-rich, it follows that chondrule formation occurred mostly inward of the ice giants formation zone (under 10 au). A byproduct of our simulations is that only CM-like, not CI-like, bodies contributed to the water budget of the telluric planets.</description>

      <title>Use of solid fused silica etalon with broadband metallic coatings for calibration of high-resolution optical spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wavelength calibration is a key factor for high-resolution spectroscopic measurements for precision radial velocities. Hollow-cathode lamps (e.g., ThAr), absorption cells (e.g., iodine cell), dielectric coated Fabry-P\'erot etalons and laser frequency combs have been implemented over the years for precise wavelength calibration and wavelength drift measurements. However, due to their various impediments as wavelength calibrators, investigations of alternative methods remain of prime interest. In this paper, we examined the feasibility of low-cost (~ $1000) commercially available solid fused silica etalon with a broadband metallic coating as a calibrator. We studied the behaviour for two cavity spacings (free spectral range of 1/cm and 0.5/cm) with temperature from theoretical derivation and experimental data. Our setup had a temperature stability of 0.8 mK for a calibrator system using an off-the-shelf dewar flask with active stabilisation. Our result from radial velocity drift measurements demonstrated that such a calibration system is capable of providing higher signal-to-noise calibration and better nightly drift measurement relative to ThAr in the wavelength range between 470 nm and 780 nm. A similar result has been previously found for Fabry-P\'erot etalons, and although the metalon solution lacks the efficiency of an etalon, it does offers a cost-effective broadband solution, which should be less prone to aging relative to complex dielectric mirror coatings. Nonetheless, long-term monitoring is required to understand the metalon behaviour in detail.</description>

      <title>Sulfur oxides tracing streamers and shocks at low mass protostellar disk-envelope interfaces</title>

Abstract: Accretion shocks are thought to play a crucial role in the early stages of star and planet formation, but their direct observational evidence remains elusive, particularly regarding the molecular tracers of these processes. In this work, we searched for features of accretion shocks by observing the emission of SO and SO$_2$ using ALMA in Band 6 towards nearby Class I protostars. We analyze the SO and SO$_2$ emission from Oph IRS 63, DK Cha, and L1527, which have different disk inclination angles, ranging from nearly face-on to edge-on. SO emission is found to be concentrated in rings at the centrifugal barriers of the infalling envelopes. These rings are projected onto the plane of the sky as ellipses or parallel slabs, depending on the inclination angles. Spiral-like streamers with SO emission are also common, with warm ($T_{\rm ex} &gt; 50$ K) and even hot ($T_{\rm ex} \gtrsim 100$ K) spots or segments of SO$_2$ observed near the centrifugal barriers. Inspired by these findings, we present a model that consistently explains the accretion shock traced by SO and SO$_2$, where the shock occurs primarily in two regions: (1) the centrifugal barriers, and (2) the surface of the disk-like inner envelope outside the centrifugal barrier. The outer envelope gains angular momentum through outflows, causing it to fall onto the midplane at or outside the centrifugal barrier, leading to a disk-like inner envelope that is pressure-confined by the accretion shock and moves in a rotating-and-infalling motion. We classify the streamers into two types--those in the midplane and those off the midplane. These streamers interact with the inner envelopes in different ways, resulting in different patterns of shocked regions. We suggest that the shock-related chemistry at the surfaces of the disk and the disk-like inner envelope warrants further special attention.</description>

      <title>Planets and planetesimals at cosmic dawn: Vortices as planetary nurseries</title>

Abstract: Low-mass, metal-enriched stars were likely present as early as cosmic dawn. In this work, we investigate whether these stars could have hosted planets in their protoplanetary disks. If so, these would have been the first planets to form in the Universe, emerging in systems with metallicities much lower than solar. In the core accretion model, planetesimals serve as the building blocks of planets, meaning that planetesimal formation is a prerequisite for planet formation. In a non-structured disk, planetesimal formation typically requires near-solar metallicities according to our current understanding. However, mechanisms that concentrate solid material can significantly lower this metallicity threshold. Here, we explore whether vortices can facilitate the formation of the first planets and planetesimals at cosmic dawn. Vortices are prime sites for planetesimal formation due to their ability to efficiently trap and concentrate dust. We conduct simulations spanning a range of metallicities, and identify a metallicity threshold at Z &gt;=~ 0.04 Zsun for planetesimal formation. If these planetesimals remain inside the vortex long enough to accrete the remaining trapped solids, Mercury-mass planets can form. The formation of Mars-mass planets or larger requires a metallicity of Z &gt;=~ 0.08 Zsun. These results assume a low level of disk turbulence, with higher turbulence levels leading to higher metallicity thresholds.</description>

Abstract: Neptune-sized exoplanets are key targets for atmospheric studies, yet their formation and evolution remain poorly understood due to their diverse characteristics and limited sample size. The so-called "Neptune desert", a region of parameter space with a dearth of short-period sub- to super-Neptunes, is a critical testbed for theories of atmospheric escape and migration. The HONEI program aims to confirm and characterize the best Neptune-sized candidates for composition, atmospheric and population studies. By measuring planetary masses with high precision, we want to provide the community with optimal targets whose atmosphere can be effectively explored with the JWST or by ground-based high-resolution spectroscopy. For this purpose, we started a radial velocity follow-up campaign, using the twin high-precision spectrographs HARPS and HARPS-N, to measure the masses of TESS Neptune-sized candidates and confirm their planetary nature. In this first paper of the series, we confirm the planetary nature of two candidates: TOI-5800b and TOI-5817b. TOI-5800b is a hot sub-Neptune ($R_p=2.44\pm0.29$ $R_\oplus$, $M_p=9.4\pm1.8$ $M_\oplus$, $T_{eq} = 1108\pm20$ K) located at the lower edges of the Neptune desert ($P=2.628$ days) and is the most eccentric planet ($e\sim0.3$) ever found within $P&lt;3$ d. TOI-5800b is expected to be still in the tidal migration phase with its parent star, a K3 V dwarf ($V=9.6$ mag), although its eccentricity could arise from interactions with another object in the system. Having a high-transmission spectroscopy metric ($TSM\sim103$), it represents a prime target for future atmospheric characterization. TOI-5817b is a relatively hot sub-Neptune ($R_p=3.08\pm0.14$ $R_\oplus$, $M_p=10.3\pm1.4$ $M_\oplus$, $T_{eq}=950\pm21$ K) located in the Neptune savanna ($P=15.610$ d) [...]</description>

Pandora will provide the first dataset of simultaneous, multiband (visible and NIR), long-baseline observations of exoplanets and their host stars. Pandora is an ambitious project that will fly a 0.44 m telescope in a small form factor. To achieve the scientific goals, the mission requires a departure from the traditional cost-schedule paradigm of half-meter-class observatories. Pandora achieves this by leveraging existing capabilities that necessitate minimal engineering development, disruptive and agile management, trusted partnerships with vendors, and strong support from the lead institutions. The Pandora team has developed a suite of high-fidelity parameterized simulation and modeling tools to estimate the performance of both imaging channels. This has enabled a unique bottom-up approach to deriving trades and system requirements. Pandora is a partnership between NASA and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The project completed its Critical Design Review in October 2023 and is slated for launch into Sun-synchronous, low-Earth orbit in Fall 2025.</description>
