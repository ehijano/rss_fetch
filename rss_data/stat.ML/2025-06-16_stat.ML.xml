      <title>A Framework for Non-Linear Attention via Modern Hopfield Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we propose an energy functional along the lines of Modern Hopfield Networks (MNH), the stationary points of which correspond to the attention due to Vaswani et al. [12], thus unifying both frameworks. The minima of this landscape form "context wells" - stable configurations that encapsulate the contextual relationships among tokens. A compelling picture emerges: across $n$ token embeddings an energy landscape is defined whose gradient corresponds to the attention computation. Non-linear attention mechanisms offer a means to enhance the capabilities of transformer models for various sequence modeling tasks by improving the model's understanding of complex relationships, learning of representations, and overall efficiency and performance. A rough analogy can be seen via cubic splines which offer a richer representation of non-linear data where a simpler linear model may be inadequate. This approach can be used for the introduction of non-linear heads in transformer based models such as BERT, [6], etc.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Prediction: To Join or To Disjoin Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the recent rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), the need of selecting high-quality dataset to improve machine learning models has garnered increasing attention. However, some part of this topic remains underexplored, even for simple prediction models. In this work, we study the problem of developing practical algorithms that select appropriate dataset to minimize population loss of our prediction model with high probability. Broadly speaking, we investigate when datasets from different sources can be effectively merged to enhance the predictive model's performance, and propose a practical algorithm with theoretical guarantees. By leveraging an oracle inequality and data-driven estimators, the algorithm reduces population loss with high probability. Numerical experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in both standard linear regression and broader machine learning applications.

      <title>Fast Bayesian Optimization of Function Networks with Partial Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization of function networks (BOFN) is a framework for optimizing expensive-to-evaluate objective functions structured as networks, where some nodes' outputs serve as inputs for others. Many real-world applications, such as manufacturing and drug discovery, involve function networks with additional properties - nodes that can be evaluated independently and incur varying costs. A recent BOFN variant, p-KGFN, leverages this structure and enables cost-aware partial evaluations, selectively querying only a subset of nodes at each iteration. p-KGFN reduces the number of expensive objective function evaluations needed but has a large computational overhead: choosing where to evaluate requires optimizing a nested Monte Carlo-based acquisition function for each node in the network. To address this, we propose an accelerated p-KGFN algorithm that reduces computational overhead with only a modest loss in query efficiency. Key to our approach is generation of node-specific candidate inputs for each node in the network via one inexpensive global Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical experiments show that our method maintains competitive query efficiency while achieving up to a 16x speedup over the original p-KGFN algorithm.</description>

      <title>On the performance of multi-fidelity and reduced-dimensional neural emulators for inference of physiologic boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving inverse problems in cardiovascular modeling is particularly challenging due to the high computational cost of running high-fidelity simulations. In this work, we focus on Bayesian parameter estimation and explore different methods to reduce the computational cost of sampling from the posterior distribution by leveraging low-fidelity approximations. A common approach is to construct a surrogate model for the high-fidelity simulation itself. Another is to build a surrogate for the discrepancy between high- and low-fidelity models. This discrepancy, which is often easier to approximate, is modeled with either a fully connected neural network or a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique that enables surrogate construction in a lower-dimensional space. A third possible approach is to treat the discrepancy between the high-fidelity and surrogate models as random noise and estimate its distribution using normalizing flows. This allows us to incorporate the approximation error into the Bayesian inverse problem by modifying the likelihood function. We validate five different methods which are variations of the above on analytical test cases by comparing them to posterior distributions derived solely from high-fidelity models, assessing both accuracy and computational cost. Finally, we demonstrate our approaches on two cardiovascular examples of increasing complexity: a lumped-parameter Windkessel model and a patient-specific three-dimensional anatomy.</description>

      <title>Using Deep Operators to Create Spatio-temporal Surrogates for Dynamical Systems under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal data, which consists of responses or measurements gathered at different times and positions, is ubiquitous across diverse applications of civil infrastructure. While SciML methods have made significant progress in tackling the issue of response prediction for individual time histories, creating a full spatial-temporal surrogate remains a challenge. This study proposes a novel variant of deep operator networks (DeepONets), namely the full-field Extended DeepONet (FExD), to serve as a spatial-temporal surrogate that provides multi-output response predictions for dynamical systems. The proposed FExD surrogate model effectively learns the full solution operator across multiple degrees of freedom by enhancing the expressiveness of the branch network and expanding the predictive capabilities of the trunk network. The proposed FExD surrogate is deployed to simultaneously capture the dynamics at several sensing locations along a testbed model of a cable-stayed bridge subjected to stochastic ground motions. The ensuing response predictions from the FExD are comprehensively compared against both a vanilla DeepONet and a modified spatio-temporal Extended DeepONet. The results demonstrate the proposed FExD can achieve both superior accuracy and computational efficiency, representing a significant advancement in operator learning for structural dynamics applications.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization with Inexact Acquisition: Is Random Grid Search Sufficient?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used iterative algorithm for optimizing black-box functions. Each iteration requires maximizing an acquisition function, such as the upper confidence bound (UCB) or a sample path from the Gaussian process (GP) posterior, as in Thompson sampling (TS). However, finding an exact solution to these maximization problems is often intractable and computationally expensive. Reflecting such realistic situations, in this paper, we delve into the effect of inexact maximizers of the acquisition functions. Defining a measure of inaccuracy in acquisition solutions, we establish cumulative regret bounds for both GP-UCB and GP-TS without requiring exact solutions of acquisition function maximization. Our results show that under appropriate conditions on accumulated inaccuracy, inexact BO algorithms can still achieve sublinear cumulative regret. Motivated by such findings, we provide both theoretical justification and numerical validation for random grid search as an effective and computationally efficient acquisition function solver.</description>

      <title>Learning Overspecified Gaussian Mixtures Exponentially Fast with the EM Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence properties of the EM algorithm when applied to overspecified Gaussian mixture models -- that is, when the number of components in the fitted model exceeds that of the true underlying distribution. Focusing on a structured configuration where the component means are positioned at the vertices of a regular simplex and the mixture weights satisfy a non-degeneracy condition, we demonstrate that the population EM algorithm converges exponentially fast in terms of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance. Our analysis leverages the strong convexity of the negative log-likelihood function in a neighborhood around the optimum and utilizes the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality to establish that an $\epsilon$-accurate approximation is achievable in $O(\log(1/\epsilon))$ iterations. Furthermore, we extend these results to a finite-sample setting by deriving explicit statistical convergence guarantees. Numerical experiments on synthetic datasets corroborate our theoretical findings, highlighting the dramatic acceleration in convergence compared to conventional sublinear rates. This work not only deepens the understanding of EM's behavior in overspecified settings but also offers practical insights into initialization strategies and model design for high-dimensional clustering and density estimation tasks.</description>

      <title>How do Probabilistic Graphical Models and Graph Neural Networks Look at Network Data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphs are a powerful data structure for representing relational data and are widely used to describe complex real-world systems. Probabilistic Graphical Models (PGMs) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) can both leverage graph-structured data, but their inherent functioning is different. The question is how do they compare in capturing the information contained in networked datasets? We address this objective by solving a link prediction task and we conduct three main experiments, on both synthetic and real networks: one focuses on how PGMs and GNNs handle input features, while the other two investigate their robustness to noisy features and increasing heterophily of the graph. PGMs do not necessarily require features on nodes, while GNNs cannot exploit the network edges alone, and the choice of input features matters. We find that GNNs are outperformed by PGMs when input features are low-dimensional or noisy, mimicking many real scenarios where node attributes might be scalar or noisy. Then, we find that PGMs are more robust than GNNs when the heterophily of the graph is increased. Finally, to assess performance beyond prediction tasks, we also compare the two frameworks in terms of their computational complexity and interpretability.</description>

      <title>Spectral Estimation with Free Decompression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing eigenvalues of very large matrices is a critical task in many machine learning applications, including the evaluation of log-determinants, the trace of matrix functions, and other important metrics. As datasets continue to grow in scale, the corresponding covariance and kernel matrices become increasingly large, often reaching magnitudes that make their direct formation impractical or impossible. Existing techniques typically rely on matrix-vector products, which can provide efficient approximations, if the matrix spectrum behaves well. However, in settings like distributed learning, or when the matrix is defined only indirectly, access to the full data set can be restricted to only very small sub-matrices of the original matrix. In these cases, the matrix of nominal interest is not even available as an implicit operator, meaning that even matrix-vector products may not be available. In such settings, the matrix is "impalpable," in the sense that we have access to only masked snapshots of it. We draw on principles from free probability theory to introduce a novel method of "free decompression" to estimate the spectrum of such matrices. Our method can be used to extrapolate from the empirical spectral densities of small submatrices to infer the eigenspectrum of extremely large (impalpable) matrices (that we cannot form or even evaluate with full matrix-vector products). We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach through a series of examples, comparing its performance against known limiting distributions from random matrix theory in synthetic settings, as well as applying it to submatrices of real-world datasets, matching them with their full empirical eigenspectra.</description>

      <title>Data Science: a Natural Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript provides a holistic (data-centric) view of what we term essential data science, as a natural ecosystem with challenges and missions stemming from the data universe with its multiple combinations of the 5D complexities (data structure, domain, cardinality, causality, and ethics) with the phases of the data life cycle. Data agents perform tasks driven by specific goals. The data scientist is an abstract entity that comes from the logical organization of data agents with their actions. Data scientists face challenges that are defined according to the missions. We define specific discipline-induced data science, which in turn allows for the definition of pan-data science, a natural ecosystem that integrates specific disciplines with the essential data science. We semantically split the essential data science into computational, and foundational. We claim that there is a serious threat of divergence between computational and foundational data science. Especially, if no approach is taken to rate whether a data universe discovery should be useful or not. We suggest that rigorous approaches to measure the usefulness of data universe discoveries might mitigate such a divergence.</description>

      <title>Complexity of normalized stochastic first-order methods with momentum under heavy-tailed noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose practical normalized stochastic first-order methods with Polyak momentum, multi-extrapolated momentum, and recursive momentum for solving unconstrained optimization problems. These methods employ dynamically updated algorithmic parameters and do not require explicit knowledge of problem-dependent quantities such as the Lipschitz constant or noise bound. We establish first-order oracle complexity results for finding approximate stochastic stationary points under heavy-tailed noise and weakly average smoothness conditions -- both of which are weaker than the commonly used bounded variance and mean-squared smoothness assumptions. Our complexity bounds either improve upon or match the best-known results in the literature. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Generalization Bound of Gradient Flow through Training Trajectory and Data-dependent Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient-based optimization methods have shown remarkable empirical success, yet their theoretical generalization properties remain only partially understood. In this paper, we establish a generalization bound for gradient flow that aligns with the classical Rademacher complexity bounds for kernel methods-specifically those based on the RKHS norm and kernel trace-through a data-dependent kernel called the loss path kernel (LPK). Unlike static kernels such as NTK, the LPK captures the entire training trajectory, adapting to both data and optimization dynamics, leading to tighter and more informative generalization guarantees. Moreover, the bound highlights how the norm of the training loss gradients along the optimization trajectory influences the final generalization performance. The key technical ingredients in our proof combine stability analysis of gradient flow with uniform convergence via Rademacher complexity. Our bound recovers existing kernel regression bounds for overparameterized neural networks and shows the feature learning capability of neural networks compared to kernel methods. Numerical experiments on real-world datasets validate that our bounds correlate well with the true generalization gap.</description>

      <title>Coefficient Shape Transfer Learning for Functional Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel transfer learning methodology to tackle the challenge of data scarcity in functional linear models. The methodology incorporates samples from the target model (target domain) alongside those from auxiliary models (source domains), transferring knowledge of coefficient shape from the source domains to the target domain. This shape-based knowledge transfer offers two key advantages. First, it is robust to covariate scaling, ensuring effectiveness despite variations in data distributions across different source domains. Second, the notion of coefficient shape homogeneity represents a meaningful advance beyond traditional coefficient homogeneity, allowing the method to exploit a wider range of source domains and achieve significantly improved model estimation. We rigorously analyze the convergence rates of the proposed estimator and examine the minimax optimality. Our findings show that the degree of improvement depends not only on the similarity of coefficient shapes between the target and source domains, but also on coefficient magnitudes and the spectral decay rates of the functional covariates covariance operators. To address situations where only a subset of auxiliary models is informative for the target model, we further develop a data-driven procedure for identifying such informative sources. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through comprehensive simulation studies and an application to occupation time analysis using physical activity data from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Home Field Advantage in Football: Learning from a Non-Stationary Causal Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In sports analytics, home field advantage is a robust phenomenon where the home team wins more games than the away team. However, discovering the causal factors behind home field advantage presents unique challenges due to the non-stationary, time-varying environment of sports matches. In response, we propose a novel causal discovery method, DYnamic Non-stAtionary local M-estimatOrs (DYNAMO), to learn the time-varying causal structures of home field advantage. DYNAMO offers flexibility by integrating various loss functions, making it practical for learning linear and non-linear causal structures from a general class of non-stationary causal processes. By leveraging local information, we provide theoretical guarantees for the identifiability and estimation consistency of non-stationary causal structures without imposing additional assumptions. Simulation studies validate the efficacy of DYNAMO in recovering time-varying causal structures. We apply our method to high-resolution event data from the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 English Premier League seasons, during which the former season had no audience presence. Our results reveal intriguing, time-varying, team-specific field advantages influenced by referee bias, which differ significantly with and without crowd support. Furthermore, the time-varying causal structures learned by our method improve goal prediction accuracy compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Node Splitting SVMs for Survival Trees Based on an L2-Regularized Dipole Splitting Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel, node-splitting support vector machine (SVM) for creating survival trees. This approach is capable of non-linearly partitioning survival data which includes continuous, right-censored outcomes. Our method improves on an existing non-parametric method, which uses at most oblique splits to induce survival regression trees. In the prior work, these oblique splits were created via a non-SVM approach, by minimizing a piece-wise linear objective, called a dipole splitting criterion, constructed from pairs of covariates and their associated survival information. We extend this method by enabling splits from a general class of non-linear surfaces. We achieve this by ridge regularizing the dipole-splitting criterion to enable application of kernel methods in a manner analogous to classical SVMs. The ridge regularization provides robustness and can be tuned. Using various kernels, we induce both linear and non-linear survival trees to compare their sizes and predictive powers on real and simulated data sets. We compare traditional univariate log-rank splits, oblique splits using the original dipole-splitting criterion and a variety of non-linear splits enabled by our method. In these tests, trees created by non-linear splits, using polynomial and Gaussian kernels show similar predictive power while often being of smaller sizes compared to trees created by univariate and oblique splits. This approach provides a novel and flexible array of survival trees that can be applied to diverse survival data sets.</description>

      <title>Recursive KalmanNet: Deep Learning-Augmented Kalman Filtering for State Estimation with Consistent Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State estimation in stochastic dynamical systems with noisy measurements is a challenge. While the Kalman filter is optimal for linear systems with independent Gaussian white noise, real-world conditions often deviate from these assumptions, prompting the rise of data-driven filtering techniques. This paper introduces Recursive KalmanNet, a Kalman-filter-informed recurrent neural network designed for accurate state estimation with consistent error covariance quantification. Our approach propagates error covariance using the recursive Joseph's formula and optimizes the Gaussian negative log-likelihood. Experiments with non-Gaussian measurement white noise demonstrate that our model outperforms both the conventional Kalman filter and an existing state-of-the-art deep learning based estimator.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of reduction matrices for Graph Coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph coarsening aims to diminish the size of a graph to lighten its memory footprint, and has numerous applications in graph signal processing and machine learning. It is usually defined using a reduction matrix and a lifting matrix, which, respectively, allows to project a graph signal from the original graph to the coarsened one and back. This results in a loss of information measured by the so-called Restricted Spectral Approximation (RSA). Most coarsening frameworks impose a fixed relationship between the reduction and lifting matrices, generally as pseudo-inverses of each other, and seek to define a coarsening that minimizes the RSA. In this paper, we remark that the roles of these two matrices are not entirely symmetric: indeed, putting constraints on the lifting matrix alone ensures the existence of important objects such as the coarsened graph's adjacency matrix or Laplacian. In light of this, in this paper, we introduce a more general notion of reduction matrix, that is not necessarily the pseudo-inverse of the lifting matrix. We establish a taxonomy of ``admissible'' families of reduction matrices, discuss the different properties that they must satisfy and whether they admit a closed-form description or not. We show that, for a fixed coarsening represented by a fixed lifting matrix, the RSA can be further reduced simply by modifying the reduction matrix. We explore different examples, including some based on a constrained optimization process of the RSA. Since this criterion has also been linked to the performance of Graph Neural Networks, we also illustrate the impact of this choices on different node classification tasks on coarsened graphs.</description>

Abstract: This tutorial provides a survey of algorithms for Defensive Forecasting, where predictions are derived not by prognostication but by correcting past mistakes. Pioneered by Vovk, Defensive Forecasting frames the goal of prediction as a sequential game, and derives predictions to minimize metrics no matter what outcomes occur. We present an elementary introduction to this general theory and derive simple, near-optimal algorithms for online learning, calibration, prediction with expert advice, and online conformal prediction.</description>

      <title>Scalable Generalized Bayesian Online Neural Network Training for Sequential Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce scalable algorithms for online learning and generalized Bayesian inference of neural network parameters, designed for sequential decision making tasks. Our methods combine the strengths of frequentist and Bayesian filtering, which include fast low-rank updates via a block-diagonal approximation of the parameter error covariance, and a well-defined posterior predictive distribution that we use for decision making. More precisely, our main method updates a low-rank error covariance for the hidden layers parameters, and a full-rank error covariance for the final layer parameters. Although this characterizes an improper posterior, we show that the resulting posterior predictive distribution is well-defined. Our methods update all network parameters online, with no need for replay buffers or offline retraining. We show, empirically, that our methods achieve a competitive tradeoff between speed and accuracy on (non-stationary) contextual bandit problems and Bayesian optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Momentum-Based Optimization Algorithms with Time-Varying Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a unified algorithm for stochastic optimization that makes use of a "momentum" term; in other words, the stochastic gradient depends not only on the current true gradient of the objective function, but also on the true gradient at the previous iteration. Our formulation includes the Stochastic Heavy Ball (SHB) and the Stochastic Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (SNAG) algorithms as special cases. In addition, in our formulation, the momentum term is allowed to vary as a function of time (i.e., the iteration counter). The assumptions on the stochastic gradient are the most general in the literature, in that it can be biased, and have a conditional variance that grows in an unbounded fashion as a function of time. This last feature is crucial in order to make the theory applicable to "zero-order" methods, where the gradient is estimated using just two function evaluations.
  We present a set of sufficient conditions for the convergence of the unified algorithm. These conditions are natural generalizations of the familiar Robbins-Monro and Kiefer-Wolfowitz-Blum conditions for standard stochastic gradient descent. We also analyze another method from the literature for the SHB algorithm with a time-varying momentum parameter, and show that it is impracticable.</description>

      <title>pLSTM: parallelizable Linear Source Transition Mark networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern recurrent architectures, such as xLSTM and Mamba, have recently challenged the Transformer in language modeling. However, their structure constrains their applicability to sequences only or requires processing multi-dimensional data structures, such as images or molecular graphs, in a pre-defined sequential order. In contrast, Multi-Dimensional RNNs (MDRNNs) are well suited for data with a higher level structure, like 2D grids, trees, and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). In this work, we extend the notion of multi-dimensionality to linear RNNs. We introduce parallelizable Linear Source Transition Mark networks (pLSTMs) using Source, Transition, and Mark gates that act on the line graph of a general DAG. This enables parallelization in analogy to parallel associative scans and the chunkwise-recurrent form of sequential linear RNNs, but for DAGs. For regular grids (1D and 2D), like images, this scheme can be efficiently implemented using einsum operations, concatenations, and padding in logarithmic time. pLSTMs tackle the vanishing/exploding activation/gradient problem for long distances in DAGs via two distinct modes: a directed propagation mode (P-mode) and a diffusive distribution mode (D-mode). To showcase the long-range capabilities of pLSTM, we introduce arrow-pointing extrapolation as a synthetic computer vision task that contains long-distance directional information. We demonstrate that pLSTMs generalize well to larger image sizes, whereas Transformers struggle to extrapolate. On established molecular graph and computer vision benchmarks, pLSTMs also show strong performance. Code and Datasets are available at: https://github.com/ml-jku/plstm_experiments.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a computationally efficient algorithm in system theory for solving inverse problems governed by linear partial differential equations (PDEs). We model solutions of linear PDEs using Gaussian processes with priors defined based on advanced commutative algebra and algebraic analysis. The implementation of these priors is algorithmic and achieved using the Macaulay2 computer algebra software. An example application includes identifying the wave speed from noisy data for classical wave equations, which are widely used in physics. The method achieves high accuracy while enhancing computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Guiding Time-Varying Generative Models with Natural Gradients on Exponential Family Manifold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimising probabilistic models is a well-studied field in statistics. However, its connection with the training of generative models remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we show that the evolution of time-varying generative models can be projected onto an exponential family manifold, naturally creating a link between the parameters of a generative model and those of a probabilistic model. We then train the generative model by moving its projection on the manifold according to the natural gradient descent scheme. This approach also allows us to efficiently approximate the natural gradient of the KL divergence without relying on MCMC for intractable models. Furthermore, we propose particle versions of the algorithm, which feature closed-form update rules for any parametric model within the exponential family. Through toy and real-world experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The code of the proposed algorithms can be found at https://github.com/anewgithubname/iNGD.</description>

      <title>Conformal Inference under High-Dimensional Covariate Shifts via Likelihood-Ratio Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13030v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of conformal prediction under covariate shift. Given labeled data from a source domain and unlabeled data from a covariate shifted target domain, we seek to construct prediction sets with valid marginal coverage in the target domain. Most existing methods require estimating the unknown likelihood ratio function, which can be prohibitive for high-dimensional data such as images. To address this challenge, we introduce the likelihood ratio regularized quantile regression (LR-QR) algorithm, which combines the pinball loss with a novel choice of regularization in order to construct a threshold function without directly estimating the unknown likelihood ratio. We show that the LR-QR method has coverage at the desired level in the target domain, up to a small error term that we can control. Our proofs draw on a novel analysis of coverage via stability bounds from learning theory. Our experiments demonstrate that the LR-QR algorithm outperforms existing methods on high-dimensional prediction tasks, including a regression task for the Communities and Crime dataset, an image classification task from the WILDS repository, and an LLM question-answering task on the MMLU benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of A/B testing, a widely used protocol for evaluating the potential improvement achieved by a new decision system compared to a baseline. This protocol segments the population into two subgroups, each exposed to a version of the system and estimates the improvement as the difference between the measured effects. In this work, we demonstrate that the commonly used difference-in-means estimator, while unbiased, can be improved. We introduce a family of unbiased off-policy estimators that achieves lower variance than the standard approach. Among this family, we identify the estimator with the lowest variance. The resulting estimator is simple, and offers substantial variance reduction when the two tested systems exhibit similarities. Our theoretical analysis and experimental results validate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Critical Influence of Overparameterization on Sharpness-aware Minimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17539v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) has attracted considerable attention for its effectiveness in improving generalization in deep neural network training by explicitly minimizing sharpness in the loss landscape. Its success, however, relies on the assumption that there exists sufficient variability of flatness in the solution space-a condition commonly facilitated by overparameterization. Yet, the interaction between SAM and overparameterization has not been thoroughly investigated, leaving a gap in understanding precisely how overparameterization affects SAM. Thus, in this work, we analyze SAM under varying degrees of overparameterization, presenting both empirical and theoretical findings that reveal its critical influence on SAM's effectiveness. First, we conduct extensive numerical experiments across diverse domains, demonstrating that SAM consistently benefits from overparameterization. Next, we attribute this phenomenon to the interplay between the enlarged solution space and increased implicit bias resulting from overparameterization. Furthermore, we show that this effect is particularly pronounced in practical settings involving label noise and sparsity, and yet, sufficient regularization is necessary. Last but not least, we provide other theoretical insights into how overparameterization helps SAM achieve minima with more uniform Hessian moments compared to SGD, and much faster convergence at a linear rate.</description>

      <title>Where is the Truth? The Risk of Getting Confounded in a Continual World</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A dataset is confounded if it is most easily solved via a spurious correlation, which fails to generalize to new data. In this work, we show that, in a continual learning setting where confounders may vary in time across tasks, the challenge of mitigating the effect of confounders far exceeds the standard forgetting problem normally considered. In particular, we provide a formal description of such continual confounders and identify that, in general, spurious correlations are easily ignored when training for all tasks jointly, but it is harder to avoid confounding when they are considered sequentially. These descriptions serve as a basis for constructing a novel CLEVR-based continually confounded dataset, which we term the ConCon dataset. Our evaluations demonstrate that standard continual learning methods fail to ignore the dataset's confounders. Overall, our work highlights the challenges of confounding factors, particularly in continual learning settings, and demonstrates the need for developing continual learning methods to robustly tackle these.</description>

      <title>A Rescaling-Invariant Lipschitz Bound Based on Path-Metrics for Modern ReLU Network Parameterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robustness with respect to weight perturbations underpins guarantees for generalization, pruning and quantization. Existing guarantees rely on Lipschitz bounds in parameter space, cover only plain feed-forward MLPs, and break under the ubiquitous neuron-wise rescaling symmetry of ReLU networks. We prove a new Lipschitz inequality expressed through the $\ell^1$-path-metric of the weights. The bound is (i) rescaling-invariant by construction and (ii) applies to any ReLU-DAG architecture with any combination of convolutions, skip connections, pooling, and frozen (inference-time) batch-normalization -- thus encompassing ResNets, U-Nets, VGG-style CNNs, and more. By respecting the network's natural symmetries, the new bound strictly sharpens prior parameter-space bounds and can be computed in two forward passes. To illustrate its utility, we derive from it a symmetry-aware pruning criterion and show -- through a proof-of-concept experiment on a ResNet-18 trained on ImageNet -- that its pruning performance matches that of classical magnitude pruning, while becoming totally immune to arbitrary neuron-wise rescalings.</description>

      <title>MindFlayer SGD: Efficient Parallel SGD in the Presence of Heterogeneous and Random Worker Compute Times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of minimizing the expectation of smooth nonconvex functions in a distributed setting with multiple parallel workers that are able to compute stochastic gradients. A significant challenge in this context is the presence of arbitrarily heterogeneous and stochastic compute times among workers, which can severely degrade the performance of existing parallel stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods. While some parallel SGD algorithms achieve optimal performance under deterministic but heterogeneous delays, their effectiveness diminishes when compute times are random - a scenario not explicitly addressed in their design. To bridge this gap, we introduce MindFlayer SGD, a novel parallel SGD method specifically designed to handle stochastic and heterogeneous compute times. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that MindFlayer SGD consistently outperforms existing baselines, particularly in environments with heavy-tailed noise. Our results highlight its robustness and scalability, making it a compelling choice for large-scale distributed learning tasks.</description>

We propose a novel model formulation and training procedure based on the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework for modeling time-series as a neural SDE. Unlike existing algorithms training neural SDEs as VAEs, our proposed algorithm only necessitates a Gaussian prior of the initial state of the latent stochastic process, rather than a Wiener process prior on the entire latent stochastic process. We develop two methodologies for modeling and estimating change points in time-series data with distribution shifts. Our iterative algorithm alternates between updating neural SDE parameters and updating the change points based on either a maximum likelihood-based approach or a change point detection algorithm using the sequential likelihood ratio test. We provide a theoretical analysis of this proposed change point detection scheme. Finally, we present an empirical evaluation that demonstrates the expressive power of our proposed model, showing that it can effectively model both classical parametric SDEs and some real datasets with distribution shifts.</description>

      <title>Proxy-informed Bayesian transfer learning with unknown sources</title>

Abstract: Generalization outside the scope of one's training data requires leveraging prior knowledge about the effects that transfer, and the effects that don't, between different data sources. Transfer learning is a framework for specifying and refining this knowledge about sets of source (training) and target (prediction) data. A challenging open problem is addressing the empirical phenomenon of negative transfer, whereby the transfer learner performs worse on the target data after taking the source data into account than before. We first introduce a Bayesian perspective on negative transfer, and then a method to address it. The key insight from our formulation is that negative transfer can stem from misspecified prior information about non-transferable causes of the source data. Our proposed method, proxy-informed robust method for probabilistic transfer learning (PROMPT), does not require prior knowledge of the source data (the data sources may be "unknown"). PROMPT is thus applicable when differences between tasks are unobserved, such as in the presence of latent confounders. Moreover, the learner need not have access to observations in the target task (may not have the ability to "fine-tune"), and instead makes use of proxy (indirect) information. Our theoretical results show that the threat of negative transfer does not depend on the informativeness of the proxy information, highlighting the usefulness of PROMPT in cases where only noisy indirect information, such as human feedback, is available.</description>

      <title>Joint Learning of Energy-based Models and their Partition Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy-based models (EBMs) offer a flexible framework for parameterizing probability distributions using neural networks. However, learning EBMs by exact maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is generally intractable, due to the need to compute the partition function (normalization constant). In this paper, we propose a novel formulation for approximately learning probabilistic EBMs in combinatorially-large discrete spaces, such as sets or permutations. Our key idea is to jointly learn both an energy model and its log-partition, both parameterized as a neural network. Our approach not only provides a novel tractable objective criterion to learn EBMs by stochastic gradient descent (without relying on MCMC), but also a novel means to estimate the log-partition function on unseen data points. On the theoretical side, we show that our approach recovers the optimal MLE solution when optimizing in the space of continuous functions. Furthermore, we show that our approach naturally extends to the broader family of Fenchel-Young losses, allowing us to obtain the first tractable method for optimizing the sparsemax loss in combinatorially-large spaces. We demonstrate our approach on multilabel classification and label ranking.</description>

      <title>Loss Functions and Operators Generated by f-Divergences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The logistic loss (a.k.a. cross-entropy loss) is one of the most popular loss functions used for multiclass classification. It is also the loss function of choice for next-token prediction in language modeling. It is associated with the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence and the softargmax operator. In this work, we propose to construct new convex loss functions based on $f$-divergences. Our loss functions generalize the logistic loss in two directions: i) by replacing the KL divergence with $f$-divergences and ii) by allowing non-uniform reference measures. We instantiate our framework for numerous $f$-divergences, recovering existing losses and creating new ones. By analogy with the logistic loss, the loss function generated by an $f$-divergence is associated with an operator, that we dub $f$-softargmax. We derive a novel parallelizable bisection algorithm for computing the $f$-softargmax associated with any $f$-divergence. On the empirical side, one of the goals of this paper is to determine the effectiveness of loss functions beyond the classical cross-entropy in a language model setting, including on pre-training, post-training (SFT) and distillation. We show that the loss function generated by the $\alpha$-divergence (which is equivalent to Tsallis $\alpha$-negentropy in the case of unit reference measures) with $\alpha=1.5$ performs well across several tasks.</description>

      <title>Teacher-student training improves accuracy and efficiency of machine learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are revolutionizing the field of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Recent MLIPs have tended towards more complex architectures trained on larger datasets. The resulting increase in computational and memory costs may prohibit the application of these MLIPs to perform large-scale MD simulations. Here, we present a teacher-student training framework in which the latent knowledge from the teacher (atomic energies) is used to augment the students' training. We show that the light-weight student MLIPs have faster MD speeds at a fraction of the memory footprint compared to the teacher models. Remarkably, the student models can even surpass the accuracy of the teachers, even though both are trained on the same quantum chemistry dataset. Our work highlights a practical method for MLIPs to reduce the resources required for large-scale MD simulations.</description>

      <title>Mixup Regularization: A Probabilistic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, mixup regularization has gained popularity as an effective way to improve the generalization performance of deep learning models by training on convex combinations of training data. While many mixup variants have been explored, the proper adoption of the technique to conditional density estimation and probabilistic machine learning remains relatively unexplored. This work introduces a novel framework for mixup regularization based on probabilistic fusion that is better suited for conditional density estimation tasks. For data distributed according to a member of the exponential family, we show that likelihood functions can be analytically fused using log-linear pooling. We further propose an extension of probabilistic mixup, which allows for fusion of inputs at an arbitrary intermediate layer of the neural network. We provide a theoretical analysis comparing our approach to standard mixup variants. Empirical results on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate the benefits of our proposed framework compared to existing mixup variants.</description>

      <title>The Sharpness Disparity Principle in Transformers for Accelerating Language Model Pre-Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19002v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers consist of diverse building blocks, such as embedding layers, normalization layers, self-attention mechanisms, and point-wise feedforward networks. Thus, understanding the differences and interactions among these blocks is important. In this paper, we uncover a clear Sharpness Disparity across these blocks, which emerges early in training and intriguingly persists throughout the training process. Motivated by this finding, we propose Blockwise Learning Rate (LR), a strategy that tailors the LR to each block's sharpness, accelerating large language model (LLM) pre-training. By integrating Blockwise LR into AdamW, we consistently achieve lower terminal loss and nearly $2\times$ speedup compared to vanilla AdamW. We demonstrate this acceleration across GPT-2 and LLaMA, with model sizes ranging from 0.12B to 2B and datasets of OpenWebText, MiniPile, and C4. Finally, we incorporate Blockwise LR into Adam-mini (Zhang et al., 2024), a recently proposed memory-efficient variant of Adam, achieving a combined $2\times$ speedup and $2\times$ memory saving. These results underscore the potential of exploiting the sharpness disparity to improve LLM training.</description>

      <title>Proximal Inference on Population Intervention Indirect Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Population intervention indirect effect (PIIE) is a novel mediation effect representing the indirect component of the population intervention effect. Unlike traditional mediation measures, such as the natural indirect effect, the PIIE holds particular relevance in observational studies involving unethical exposures, when hypothetical interventions that impose harmful exposures are inappropriate. Although prior research has identified PIIE under unmeasured confounders between exposure and outcome, it has not fully addressed the confounding that affects the mediator. This paper proposes a novel PIIE identification framework in settings where unmeasured confounders influence exposure-outcome, exposure-mediator, and mediator-outcome relationships. Specifically, we leverage observed covariates as proxy variables for unmeasured confounders, constructing three proximal identification strategies. Additionally, we characterize the semiparametric efficiency bound and develop multiply robust and locally efficient estimators. To handle high-dimensional nuisance parameters, we propose a debiased machine learning approach that achieves $\sqrt{n}$-consistency and asymptotic normality to estimate the true PIIE values, even when the machine learning estimators for the nuisance functions do not converge at $\sqrt{n}$-rate. In simulations, our estimators demonstrate higher confidence interval coverage rates than conventional methods across various model misspecifications. In a real data application, our approaches reveal an indirect effect of alcohol consumption on depression risk mediated by depersonalization symptoms.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Stochastic Approximation and Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new approach to proving the convergence of the Stochastic Approximation (SA) and the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithms. The new approach is based on a concept called GSLLN (Generalized Strong Law of Large Numbers), which extends the traditional SLLN. Using this concept, we provide sufficient conditions for convergence, which effectively decouple the properties of the function whose zero we are trying to find, from the properties of the measurement errors (noise sequence). The new approach provides an alternative to the two widely used approaches, namely the ODE approach and the martingale approach, and also permits a wider class of noise signals than either of the two known approaches. In particular, the ``noise'' or measurement error \textit{need not} have a finite second moment, and under suitable conditions, not even a finite mean. By adapting this method of proof, we also derive sufficient conditions for the convergence of zero-order SGD, wherein the stochastic gradient is computed using $2d$ function evaluations, but no gradient computations. The sufficient conditions derived here are the weakest to date, thus leading to a considerable expansion of the applicability of SA and SGD theory.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Graph Convolutional Neural Networks: A Probabilistic Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01213v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing graph-structured data, achieving remarkable success across diverse applications. However, the theoretical understanding of the stability of these models, i.e., their sensitivity to small changes in the graph structure, remains in rather limited settings, hampering the development and deployment of robust and trustworthy models in practice. To fill this gap, we study how perturbations in the graph topology affect GCNN outputs and propose a novel formulation for analyzing model stability. Unlike prior studies that focus only on worst-case perturbations, our distribution-aware formulation characterizes output perturbations across a broad range of input data. This way, our framework enables, for the first time, a probabilistic perspective on the interplay between the statistical properties of the node data and perturbations in the graph topology. We conduct extensive experiments to validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate their benefits over existing baselines, in terms of both representation stability and adversarial attacks on downstream tasks. Our results demonstrate the practical significance of the proposed formulation and highlight the importance of incorporating data distribution into stability analysis.</description>

      <title>Word Sense Detection Leveraging Maximum Mean Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Word sense analysis is an essential analysis work for interpreting the linguistic and social backgrounds. The word sense change detection is a task of identifying and interpreting shifts in word meanings over time. This paper proposes MMD-Sense-Analysis, a novel approach that leverages Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) to select semantically meaningful variables and quantify changes across time periods. This method enables both the identification of words undergoing sense shifts and the explanation of their evolution over multiple historical periods. To my knowledge, this is the first application of MMD to word sense change detection. Empirical assessment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Course Project Report: Comparing MCMC and Variational Inference for Bayesian Probabilistic Matrix Factorization on the MovieLens Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a course project report with complete methodology, experiments, references and mathematical derivations. Matrix factorization [1] is a widely used technique in recommendation systems. Probabilistic Matrix Factorization (PMF) [2] extends traditional matrix factorization by incorporating probability distributions over latent factors, allowing for uncertainty quantification. However, computing the posterior distribution is intractable due to the high-dimensional integral. To address this, we employ two Bayesian inference methods: Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) [3, 4] and Variational Inference (VI) [5, 6] to approximate the posterior. We evaluate their performance on MovieLens dataset [7] and compare their convergence speed, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that VI offers faster convergence, while MCMC provides more accurate posterior estimates.</description>
