      <title>Multiple Temporal Compression as a method to control the generation of bright and dark solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently published works have shown that the Multiple Temporal Compression (MTC) method is a more efficient approach for generation of multiple bright solitons in stacked waveguides, in comparison to the traditional soliton-fission technique. In the present paper, we performed systematic computer simulations of the appropriate generalized nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation to extend the MTC method for generation of dark solitons through controlled interactions of bright solitons in waveguiding systems with the normal group-velocity dispersion. Further, the generated dark solitons are demonstrated to be useful for accurately governing the dynamics of bright solitons generation in complex systems based on stacked waveguides. Therefore, we report scenarios that provide mitigation or switching of the energy transfer during bright-soliton collisions, along with the ability of the cascaded MTC processes to increase the number of the generated solitons. These results underscore the potential of the MTC as a versatile method for managing the propagation dynamics of multiple temporal bright and dark solitons produced by a single input pulse, with possible applications for the design of optical devices.</description>

      <title>Quasicrystals in pattern formation, Part I: Local existence and basic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general mechanism for the existence of quasicrystals in spatially extended systems (partial differential equations with Euclidean symmetry). We argue that the existence of quasicrystals with higher order rotational symmetry, icosahedral symmetry, etc, is a natural and universal consequence of spontaneous symmetry breaking, bypassing technical issues such as Diophantine properties and hard implicit function theorems. The diffraction diagrams associated with these quasicrystal solutions are not Delone sets, so strictly speaking they do not conform to the definition of a ``mathematical quasicrystal''. But they do appear to capture very well the features of the diffraction diagrams of quasicrystals observed in nature. For the Swift-Hohenberg equation, we obtain more detailed information, including that the $\ell^2$ norm of the diffraction diagram grows like the square root of the bifurcation parameter.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear shallow-water waves with vertical odd viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.09375v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The breaking of detailed balance in fluids through Coriolis forces or odd-viscous stresses has profound effects on the dynamics of surface waves. Here we explore both weakly and strongly non-linear waves in a three-dimensional fluid with vertical odd viscosity with and without the Coriolis effect. Our model describes the free surface of a shallow fluid composed of nearly vertical vortex filaments, which all stand perpendicular to the surface. We find that the odd viscosity in this configuration induces previously unexplored non-linear effects in shallow-water waves, arising from both stresses on the surface and stress gradients in the bulk. By assuming weak nonlinearity, we find reduced equations including Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), Ostrovsky, and Kadomtsev-Petviashvilli (KP) equations with modified coefficients. At sufficiently large odd viscosity, the dispersion changes sign, allowing for compact two-dimensional solitary waves. We show that odd viscosity and surface tension have the same effect on the free surface, but distinct signatures in the fluid flow. Our results describe the collective dynamics of many-vortex systems, which can also occur in oceanic and atmospheric geophysics.</description>
