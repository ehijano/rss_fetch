      <title>Bogolon mediated light absorption in multi-component BEC with $Z_2$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the light absorption process in a coherently coupled two-component Bose-Einstein condensate model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in different dimensionality at zero temperature. As the analogue of phonon in the solid state physics, the elementary excitation of the Bose-Einstein condensate is described by Bogoliubov quasiparticle or bogolon for short. Due to the small magnitude of the sound velocity of the bogolon, the light absorption process is prohibited by the conservation of energy and momentum. To surmount this depression, the additional degree of freedom must be considered inside of the simple Bose gas model. In this article, we develop a microscopical theory of electromagnetic power absorption by a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate and investigate the absorption rate dependence in different dimensions. Our calculation shows the possibility of manipulating the absorption property by tuning the parameters of the condensates.</description>

      <title>Vortex stability in interacting Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stability of vortices in a binary system of Bose-Einstein condensates, with their wave functions modeled by a set of coupled, time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Beginning with an effective two-dimensional system, we identify miscible and immiscible regimes characterized by the inter- and intra-atomic interactions and the initial configuration of the system. We then consider a binary system of Bose-Einstein condensates placed in a rotating harmonic trap and study the single vortex state in this system. We derive an approximate form for the energy of a single vortex in the binary system and the critical angular velocity for the global stability of a vortex at the center of the trap. We also compute the metastability onset angular velocity for the local stability of a vortex at the center of the trap. Numerical solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equations support these expressions. These rotational results inform us of a novel subphase within the miscible regime of the binary condensate system. We thus demonstrate the non-trivial aspects of vortex stability in interacting binary Bose-Einstein condensates as a result of their non-linear interactions.</description>

      <title>Kondo impurity in an attractive Fermi-Hubbard bath: Equilibrium and dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically equilibrium and dynamical properties of a Kondo impurity coupled to either 1D or 2D superconductors, modeled by the attractive Fermi-Hubbard model. By employing a non-Gaussian variational approach, we go beyond the approximation of a constant superconducting (SC) gap. We show that dynamical properties of the system can be modified qualitatively, when space and time dependent renormalization of the SC gap and electron-impurity hybridization are included. For the ground state, we find the singlet-doublet phase transition and $\pi$-phase shifts of the SC order parameter. For dynamics, first we consider spin dynamics following an abrupt connection of the polarized impurity to the 2D bath. We find rapid relaxation of impurity polarization and directional emission of a magnetization pulse, which becomes damped as it propagates into the bulk. Then we analyze transport between two SC leads coupled through the impurity at finite bias voltage. Here we go beyond analysis of the steady state to investigate full-time dynamics following an abrupt application of the bias voltage. We uncover four distinct regimes in the transient dynamics and transport properties: (I) the AC Josephson effect regime; (II) dynamical competition between charge-density-wave (CDW) and SC orders with transient Kondo correlations; (III) the coexistence of AC and DC currents facilitated by partial Kondo screening and dynamical stabilization of the SC order; (IV) DC Kondo transport regime modified by the SC order. Regime II exhibits a dynamical transition from SC to CDW order that locally restores the U(1) symmetry. We argue that our findings for regime IV provide a theoretical explanation for the experimentally observed anomalous enhancement of DC conductance and suppression of the AC Josephson current. Finally, we discuss the potential experimental realization with ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Chemistry in a cryogenic buffer gas cell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic buffer gas sources are ubiquitous for producing cold, collimated molecular beams for quantum science, chemistry, and precision measurements. The molecules are typically produced by laser ablating a metal target in the presence of a donor gas, where the radical of interest emerges among the reaction products due to a barrier-free process or under thermal or optical excitation. High-barrier reactions, such as between calcium and molecular hydrogen, should be precluded. Here, we study chemical reactions between Ca and three hydrogen isotopologues H$_2$, D$_2$, and HD in a cryogenic cell with helium buffer gas. Remarkably, we observe that H$_2$ can serve as both a reactant and a buffer gas, far outperforming D$_2$ and HD. Our results demonstrate a robust method for generating cold beams of alkaline-earth-metal hydrides for laser cooling and trapping. The observations are complemented by a reaction model, yielding qualitative agreement with the experiment.</description>

      <title>Production and stabilization of a spin mixture of ultracold dipolar Bose gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixtures of ultracold gases with long-range interactions are expected to open new avenues in the study of quantum matter. Natural candidates for this research are spin mixtures of atomic species with large magnetic moments. However, the lifetime of such assemblies can be strongly affected by the dipolar relaxation that occurs in spin-flip collisions. Here we present experimental results for a mixture composed of the two lowest Zeeman states of $^{162}$Dy atoms, that act as dark states with respect to a light-induced quadratic Zeeman effect. We show that, due to an interference phenomenon, the rate for such inelastic processes is dramatically reduced with respect to the Wigner threshold law. Additionally, we determine the scattering lengths characterizing the s-wave interaction between these states, providing all necessary data to predict the miscibility range of the mixture, depending on its dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Response of superfluid fermions at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A consistent finite-temperature microscopic theory for the response of strongly coupled superfluid fermionic systems is formulated. We start from the general many-body Hamiltonian with the vacuum (bare) two-fermion interaction and derive the equation of motion (EOM) for the thermally averaged two-time two-fermion correlation function, which determines the spectrum of the system under study. The superfluidity is introduced via the Bogoliubov transformation of the fermionic field operators, and the entire formalism is carried out in the basis of Bogoliubov's quasiparticles, keeping the complete $4\times 4$ block matrix structure of the two-fermion EOM. Static and dynamical interaction kernels of the resulting EOM are discussed. The least correlated static kernel reproduces the known finite-temperature quasiparticle random phase approximation, while the dynamical kernel was previously largely unknown in the finite-temperature superfluid theory. The major focus is then placed on the latter kernel, which is completed and advanced to a factorized form, enabling a minimal truncation of the many-body problem with keeping important effects of emergent collectivity and mapping to the quasiparticle-vibration coupling (qPVC). As in the zero-temperature and non-superfluid cases, the qPVC can be associated with a new order parameter, qPVC vertex. In the thermal superfluid theory, the latter vertex as well as the components of the dynamical kernel acquire an extended form including thermally unblocked transition amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Nucleation line in three-component Bose-Einstein condensates in Gross-Pitaevskii theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By means of Gross-Pitaevskii theory we investigate the possibility of wetting phase transition in three-component Bose-Einstein condensates within the strong segregation between components 1 and 2. Third component plays the role of a surfactant, which can wet the interface formed by components 1 and 2. The case of symmetry of components 1 and 2, the equation for nucleation line and wetting phase diagram are studied. By linearizing the set of three-coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations, the wave functions of the components are found. An analytical approximation for the surfactant thickness in the prewetting phase is presented. The results indicate that the surfactant thickness in the prewtting phase varies linearly with the chemical potential ratio in the logarithmic scale.</description>

      <title>Inherent quantum resources in stationary spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16974v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The standard way to generate many-body quantum correlations is via a dynamical protocol: an initial product state is transformed by interactions that generate non-classical correlations at later times. Here, we show that many-body Bell correlations are inherently present in the eigenstates of a variety of spin-1/2 chains. In particular, we show that the eigenstates and thermal states of the collective Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model possess many-body Bell correlations. We demonstrate that the Bell correlations can take on quantized values that change discontinuously with variations in the total magnetization. Finally, we show that these many-body Bell correlations persist even in the presence of both diagonal and off-diagonal disorder.</description>

      <title>Formations of generalized Wannier-Stark ladders: Theorem and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Wannier-Stark ladder (WSL) is a basic concept, supporting periodic oscillation, widely used in many areas of physics. In this paper, we investigate the formations of WSL in generalized systems, including strongly correlated and non-Hermitian systems. We present a theorem on the existence of WSL for a set of general systems that are translationally symmetric before the addition of a linear potential. For a non-Hermitian system, the WSL becomes complex but maintains a real energy level spacing. We illustrate the theorem using 1D extended Bose-Hubbard models with both real and imaginary hopping strengths. It is shown that the Bloch-Zener oscillations of correlated bosons are particularly remarkable under resonant conditions. Numerical simulations for cases with boson numbers $n=2$, $3$, and $4$ are presented. Analytical and numerical results for the time evolution of the $n$-boson-occupied initial state indicate that all evolved states exhibit quasi periodic oscillations, but with different profiles, depending on the Hermiticity and interaction strength.</description>
