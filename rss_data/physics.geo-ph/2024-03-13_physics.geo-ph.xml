      <title>Stationary phase analysis of ambient noise cross-correlations: Focusing on non-ballistic arrivals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stacked cross-correlation functions have become ubiquitous in the ambient seismic imaging and monitoring community as approximations to the Green's function between two receivers. While theoretical understanding of this approximation to the ballistic arrivals is well established, the equivalent analysis for the non-ballistic arrivals is alarmingly inadequate compared to the exponential growth of its applications. To provide a fundamental understanding of the cross-correlation functions beyond the ballistic arrivals, we derive analytical stationary phase solutions for ambient noise cross-correlations with a focus on non-ballistic arrivals. We establish the mathematical and corresponding physical conditions that drastically differentiate the non-ballistic arrivals in the stacked cross-correlation and the actual Green's functions. In ambient noise environments, the coda waves due to random medium scatterings of an impulsive source cannot be distinguished from the cross-talk artifacts due to overlapping random noise sources. Therefore, changes in the non-ballistic arrivals cannot be uniquely attributed to changes in the medium or changes in the noise source environment without additional constraints. The theoretical results demand that interpreting large-elapse-time arrivals in the stacked cross-correlation functions as coda waves for deterministic information about the propagation medium should be conducted only after the source influence is sufficiently ruled out. Once the source influence is eliminated, the stationary phase solutions for scattering waves provide a solid basis for extracting reliable scattering information from the noise correlation functions for higher-resolution imaging and monitoring.</description>

      <title>Learning on the correct class for domain inverse problems of gravimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider end-to-end learning approaches for inverse problems of gravimetry. Due to ill-posedness of the inverse gravimetry, the reliability of learning approaches is questionable. To deal with this problem, we propose the strategy of learning on the correct class. The well-posedness theorems are employed when designing the neural-network architecture and constructing the training set. Given the density-contrast function as a priori information, the domain of mass can be uniquely determined under certain constrains, and the domain inverse problem is a correct class of the inverse gravimetry. Under this correct class, we design the neural network for learning by mimicking the level-set formulation for the inverse gravimetry. Numerical examples illustrate that the method is able to recover mass models with non-constant density contrast.</description>

      <title>Pedophysics: an open-source python package for soil geophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces Pedophysics, an open-source Python package designed to facilitate solutions for users who work in the field of soil assessment using near-surface geophysical electromagnetic techniques. At the core of this software is the ability to translate geophysical data into specific soil properties (and vice-versa) using pedophysical models (PM). Pedophysical modelling techniques offer valuable insights into various realms including precision agriculture, soil health, resource prospecting, nutrient and land management, hydrogeology, and heritage conservation. In developing a tool for pedophysical modelling, some challenges emerged: selecting suitable PMs from the extensive literature, adapting these to specific conditions, and ensuring adequate data availability. While addressing these, we designed an automated workflow that implements robust PMs (selected after a throughout review), apply different modelling approaches based on soil characteristics and targeted properties, and employs pedotransfer functions and assumptions to integrate missing soil data into PMs. The capabilities of Pedophysics extend to handling complex scenarios such as fusing data from different instruments, incorporating continuous monitoring measurements, and soil calibration data. With these solutions, Pedophysics automates the process of deriving targeted soil and geophysical properties with state-of-art accuracy. Hereby, users can rely on Pedophysics to implement specific knowledge about pedophysical modeling. The software promotes global access to advanced soil geophysical solutions by being open-source and encouraging community contributions. Pedophysics is written in pure Python and has minimal dependencies. It can be easily installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI).</description>

      <title>Semi-brittle flow of rocks: Cracks, dislocations and strain hardening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain hardening is a key feature observed in many rocks deformed in the so-called ``semi-brittle'' regime, where both crystal plastic and brittle deformation mechanisms operate. Dislocation storage has long been recognised as a major process leading to strain hardening. Here, we suggest that tensile microcracks may be viewed as dislocation sinks, by offering internal free surfaces where dislocations can escape individual crystals within an aggregate. Strain hardening is modelled with a conventional approach, combining Taylor's equation relating stress to dislocation density, and a dislocation density evolution law based on dislocation mean-free path and dynamic recovery. The initiation of microcracks is modelled as a function dislocation density, assuming dislocation pile-ups at grain boundaries. Microcrack growth is modelled using linear elastic fracture mechanics. The model captures important qualitative features observed in calcite marble deformation experiments: pressure-dependency of strength in the ductile regime, and a reduction in hardening linked to an increase in crack growth with decreasing confining pressure. Grain-size dependency of strength and hardening is also captured but requires significant toughening (or limitation to crack growth) at small grain sizes. The model can be improved significantly once detailed, systematic microstructural observations become available.</description>

      <title>Tidal dissipation of binaries in asteroid pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal dissipation in a celestial body can be used to probe its internal structure. Tides govern the orbital evolution of binary systems and therefore constraints on the interior of binary system members can be derived by knowing the age and tidal state of the binary system. For asteroids, age estimates are challenging due to a lack of direct observation of their surface. However, the age of asteroid pairs formed by rotational fission of a parent body can be derived from dynamical modeling, and as such can be used to constrain the age of binary systems existing within asteroid pairs.We study 13 binary asteroid systems existing in asteroid pairs by modeling their tidal locking and eccentricity damping timescales from tidal dissipation in the primaries and secondaries. We consider the impact of thermal torques on these timescales from the YORP and BYORP effects. The resulting constraints on the tidal dissipation ratio Q/k2 are compared to monolithic and rubble pile asteroid theories, showing that all secondaries are consistent with rubble piles with regolith layers greater than 3m and suggest that Q/k2 for rubble piles increases with radius. A particular case is the first bound secondary of asteroid (3749) Balam, whose Q/k2 is constrained to be between 2.7x10^4 and 1.4x10^6, consistent with a rubble-pile with a regolith thickness between 30m and 100m.</description>

      <title>Learning earthquake sources using symmetric autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02404v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Symmetric Autoencoder (SymAE), a neural-network architecture designed to automatically isolate earthquake information from far-field seismic waves. SymAE represents the measured displacement field using a code that is partitioned into two interpretable components: source and path-scattering information. We achieve this source-path representation using the scale separation principle and stochastic regularization, which traditional autoencoding methods lack. According to the scale separation principle, the variations in far-field band-limited seismic measurements resulting from finite faulting occur across two spatial scales: a slower scale associated with the source processes and a faster scale corresponding to path effects. The primary challenge in leveraging SymAE to enhance our understanding of earthquake sources lies in the lack of direct interpretability of the latent code it generates. However, despite this hurdle, we present two strategies. Firstly, we employ clustering analysis of the source codes to reveal connections between the characteristics of various earthquakes. This method is less susceptible to variations in path effects, allowing us to assess the correlation in source properties between observed earthquakes and their corresponding finite-fault models. Secondly, we introduce the generation of virtual seismograms with desired source and path information. Through this approach, we engineer seismograms to incorporate the source characteristics of a specific earthquake from different azimuths while maintaining consistent subsurface scattering effects. We propose that these virtual seismograms may facilitate a comprehensive and precise examination of directivity effects for the earthquake in question. The paper conducts an analysis of nearly forty complex earthquake events along with synthetic earthquakes.</description>

      <title>Topological Signature of Stratospheric Poincare -- Gravity Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.12191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rotation of the earth breaks time-reversal and reflection symmetries in an opposite sense north and south of the equator, leading to a topological origin for certain atmospheric and oceanic equatorial waves. Away from the equator the rotating shallow water and stably stratified primitive equations exhibit Poincare inertio-gravity waves that have nontrivial topology as evidenced by their strict superinertial timescale and a phase singularity in frequency-wavevector space. This non-trivial topology then predicts, via the principle of bulk-interface correspondence, the existence of two equatorial waves along the equatorial interface, the Kelvin and Yanai waves. To directly test the nontrivial topology of Poincare-gravity waves in observations, we examine ERA5 reanalysis data and study cross-correlations between the wind velocity and geopotential height of the mid-latitude stratosphere at the 50 hPa height. We find the predicted vortex and anti-vortex in the relative phase of the geopotential height and velocity at the high frequencies of the waves. By contrast, lower-frequency planetary waves are found to have trivial topology also as expected from theory. These results demonstrate a new way to understand stratospheric waves, and provide a new qualitative tool for the investigation of waves in other components of the climate system.</description>

      <title>Probing the state of hydrogen in $\delta$-AlOOH at mantle conditions with machine learning potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hydrous and nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) are a fundamental class of solids of enormous significance to geophysics. They are the water carriers in the deep geological water cycle and impact structural, elastic, plastic, and thermodynamic properties and phase relations in Earth's forming aggregates (rocks). They play a critical role in the geochemical and geophysical processes that shape the planet. Their complexity has prevented predictive calculations of their properties, but progress in materials simulations ushered by machine learning potentials is transforming this state of affairs. Here, we adopt a hybrid approach that combines deep learning potentials (DP) with the SCAN meta-GGA functional to simulate a prototypical hydrous system. We illustrate the success of this approach to simulate $\delta$-AlOOH ($\delta$), a phase capable of transporting water down to near the core-mantle boundary of the Earth (~2,900 km depth and ~135 GPa) in subducting slabs. A high-throughput sampling of phase space using molecular dynamics simulations with DP-potentials sheds light on the hydrogen-bond behavior and proton diffusion at geophysical conditions. These simulations provide a pathway for a deeper understanding of these crucial components that shape Earth's internal state.</description>
