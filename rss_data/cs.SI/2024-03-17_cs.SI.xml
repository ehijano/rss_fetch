      <title>Estimating the history of a random recursive tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of estimating the order of arrival of the vertices in a random recursive tree. Specifically, we study two fundamental models: the uniform attachment model and the linear preferential attachment model. We propose an order estimator based on the Jordan centrality measure and define a family of risk measures to quantify the quality of the ordering procedure. Moreover, we establish a minimax lower bound for this problem, and prove that the proposed estimator is nearly optimal. Finally, we numerically demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms degree-based and spectral ordering procedures.</description>

      <title>Designing Sousveillance Tools for Gig Workers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As independently-contracted employees, gig workers disproportionately suffer the consequences of workplace surveillance, which include increased pressures to work, breaches of privacy, and decreased digital autonomy. Despite the negative impacts of workplace surveillance, gig workers lack the tools, strategies, and workplace social support to protect themselves against these harms. Meanwhile, some critical theorists have proposed sousveillance as a potential means of countering such abuses of power, whereby those under surveillance monitor those in positions of authority (e.g., gig workers collect data about requesters/platforms). To understand the benefits of sousveillance systems in the gig economy, we conducted semi-structured interviews and led co-design activities with gig workers. We use "care ethics" as a guiding concept to understand our interview and co-design data, while also focusing on empathic sousveillance technology design recommendations. Through our study, we identify gig workers' attitudes towards and past experiences with sousveillance. We also uncover the type of sousveillance technologies imagined by workers, provide design recommendations, and finish by discussing how to create empowering, empathic spaces on gig platforms.</description>

      <title>Graph Enhanced Reinforcement Learning for Effective Group Formation in Collaborative Problem Solving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of forming effective groups in collaborative problem-solving environments. Recognizing the complexity of human interactions and the necessity for efficient collaboration, we propose a novel approach leveraging graph theory and reinforcement learning. Our methodology involves constructing a graph from a dataset where nodes represent participants, and edges signify the interactions between them. We conceptualize each participant as an agent within a reinforcement learning framework, aiming to learn an optimal graph structure that reflects effective group dynamics. Clustering techniques are employed to delineate clear group structures based on the learned graph. Our approach provides theoretical solutions based on evaluation metrics and graph measurements, offering insights into potential improvements in group effectiveness and reductions in conflict incidences. This research contributes to the fields of collaborative work and educational psychology by presenting a data-driven, analytical approach to group formation. It has practical implications for organizational team building, classroom settings, and any collaborative scenario where group dynamics are crucial. The study opens new avenues for exploring the application of graph theory and reinforcement learning in social and behavioral sciences, highlighting the potential for empirical validation in future work.</description>

      <title>Less is More: One-shot Subgraph Reasoning on Large-scale Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To deduce new facts on a knowledge graph (KG), a link predictor learns from the graph structure and collects local evidence to find the answer to a given query. However, existing methods suffer from a severe scalability problem due to the utilization of the whole KG for prediction, which hinders their promise on large scale KGs and cannot be directly addressed by vanilla sampling methods. In this work, we propose the one-shot-subgraph link prediction to achieve efficient and adaptive prediction. The design principle is that, instead of directly acting on the whole KG, the prediction procedure is decoupled into two steps, i.e., (i) extracting only one subgraph according to the query and (ii) predicting on this single, query dependent subgraph. We reveal that the non-parametric and computation-efficient heuristics Personalized PageRank (PPR) can effectively identify the potential answers and supporting evidence. With efficient subgraph-based prediction, we further introduce the automated searching of the optimal configurations in both data and model spaces. Empirically, we achieve promoted efficiency and leading performances on five large-scale benchmarks. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/one-shot-subgraph.</description>

      <title>SocialGenPod: Privacy-Friendly Generative AI Social Web Applications with Decentralised Personal Data Stores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present SocialGenPod, a decentralised and privacy-friendly way of deploying generative AI Web applications. Unlike centralised Web and data architectures that keep user data tied to application and service providers, we show how one can use Solid -- a decentralised Web specification -- to decouple user data from generative AI applications. We demonstrate SocialGenPod using a prototype that allows users to converse with different Large Language Models, optionally leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation to generate answers grounded in private documents stored in any Solid Pod that the user is allowed to access, directly or indirectly. SocialGenPod makes use of Solid access control mechanisms to give users full control of determining who has access to data stored in their Pods. SocialGenPod keeps all user data (chat history, app configuration, personal documents, etc) securely in the user's personal Pod; separate from specific model or application providers. Besides better privacy controls, this approach also enables portability across different services and applications. Finally, we discuss challenges, posed by the large compute requirements of state-of-the-art models, that future research in this area should address. Our prototype is open-source and available at: https://github.com/Vidminas/socialgenpod/.</description>

      <title>Detection and Discovery of Misinformation Sources using Attributed Webgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Website reliability labels underpin almost all research in misinformation detection. However, misinformation sources often exhibit transient behavior, which makes many such labeled lists obsolete over time. We demonstrate that Search Engine Optimization (SEO) attributes provide strong signals for predicting news site reliability. We introduce a novel attributed webgraph dataset with labeled news domains and their connections to outlinking and backlinking domains. We demonstrate the success of graph neural networks in detecting news site reliability using these attributed webgraphs, and show that our baseline news site reliability classifier outperforms current SoTA methods on the PoliticalNews dataset, achieving an F1 score of 0.96. Finally, we introduce and evaluate a novel graph-based algorithm for discovering previously unknown misinformation news sources.</description>

      <title>Signed Diverse Multiplex Networks: Clustering and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper introduces a Signed Generalized Random Dot Product Graph (SGRDPG) model, which is a variant of the Generalized Random Dot Product Graph (GRDPG), where, in addition, edges can be positive or negative. The setting is extended to a multiplex version, where all layers have the same collection of nodes and follow the SGRDPG. The only common feature of the layers of the network is that they can be partitioned into groups with common subspace structures, while otherwise matrices of connection probabilities can be all different. The setting above is extremely flexible and includes a variety of existing multiplex network models as its particular cases. The paper fulfills two objectives. First, it shows that keeping signs of the edges in the process of network construction leads to a better precision of estimation and clustering and, hence, is beneficial for tackling real world problems such as, for example, analysis of brain networks. Second, by employing novel algorithms, our paper ensures strongly consistent clustering of layers and high accuracy of subspace estimation. In addition to theoretical guarantees, both of those features are demonstrated using numerical simulations and a real data example.</description>

      <title>Boosting Multitask Learning on Graphs through Higher-Order Task Affinities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14009v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting node labels on a given graph is a widely studied problem with many applications, including community detection and molecular graph prediction. This paper considers predicting multiple node labeling functions on graphs simultaneously and revisits this problem from a multitask learning perspective. For a concrete example, consider overlapping community detection: each community membership is a binary node classification task. Due to complex overlapping patterns, we find that negative transfer is prevalent when we apply naive multitask learning to multiple community detection, as task relationships are highly nonlinear across different node labeling. To address the challenge, we develop an algorithm to cluster tasks into groups based on a higher-order task affinity measure. We then fit a multitask model on each task group, resulting in a boosting procedure on top of the baseline model. We estimate the higher-order task affinity measure between two tasks as the prediction loss of one task in the presence of another task and a random subset of other tasks. Then, we use spectral clustering on the affinity score matrix to identify task grouping. We design several speedup techniques to compute the higher-order affinity scores efficiently and show that they can predict negative transfers more accurately than pairwise task affinities. We validate our procedure using various community detection and molecular graph prediction data sets, showing favorable results compared with existing methods. Lastly, we provide a theoretical analysis to show that under a planted block model of tasks on graphs, our affinity scores can provably separate tasks into groups.</description>
