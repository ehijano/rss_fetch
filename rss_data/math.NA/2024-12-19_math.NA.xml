      <title>Spectrally accurate fully discrete schemes for some nonlocal and nonlinear integrable PDEs via explicit formulas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct fully-discrete schemes for the Benjamin-Ono, Calogero-Sutherland DNLS, and cubic Szeg\H{o} equations on the torus, which are $\textit{exact in time}$ with $\textit{spectral accuracy}$ in space. We prove spectral convergence for the first two equations, of order $K^{-s+1}$ for initial data in $H^s(\mathbb T)$, with an error constant depending $\textit{linearly}$ on the final time instead of exponentially. These schemes are based on $\textit{explicit formulas}$, which have recently emerged in the theory of nonlinear integrable equations. Numerical simulations show the strength of the newly designed methods both at short and long time scales. These schemes open doors for the understanding of the long-time dynamics of integrable equations.</description>

      <title>Approximation by orthonormal polynomials associated with even exponential weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a quantitative approximation result by orthonormal polynomials associated to an exponential weight of the form e -$\Phi$ , where $\Phi$ is an even polynomial with positive leading coefficient. This result is a consequence of a recursion relation for the orthonormal polynomials and of the strong Poincar{\'e} inequality. Simulations are provided at the end of the article, on smooth, non-smooth functions as well as in the Gaussian and the double well case.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical proximal Galerkin: a fast $hp$-FEM solver for variational problems with pointwise inequality constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We leverage the proximal Galerkin algorithm (Keith and Surowiec, Foundations of Computational Mathematics, 2024, DOI: 10.1007/s10208-024-09681-8), a recently introduced mesh-independent algorithm, to obtain a high-order finite element solver for variational problems with pointwise inequality constraints. This is achieved by discretizing the saddle point systems, arising from the latent variable proximal point method, with the hierarchical $p$-finite element basis. This results in discretized sparse Newton systems that admit a simple and effective block preconditioner. The solver can handle both obstacle-type, $u \leq \varphi$, and gradient-type, $|\nabla u| \leq \varphi$, constraints. We apply the resulting algorithm to solve obstacle problems with $hp$-adaptivity, a gradient-type constrained problem, and the thermoforming problem, an example of an obstacle-type quasi-variational inequality. We observe $hp$-robustness in the number of Newton iterations and only mild growth in the number of inner Krylov iterations to solve the Newton systems. Crucially we also provide wall-clock timings that are faster than low-order discretization counterparts.</description>

      <title>Coupled Eikonal problems to model cardiac reentries in Purkinje network and myocardium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel partitioned scheme based on Eikonal equations to model the coupled propagation of the electrical signal in the His-Purkinje system and in the myocardium for cardiac electrophysiology. This scheme allows, for the first time in Eikonal-based modeling, to capture all possible signal reentries between the Purkinje network and the cardiac muscle that may occur under pathological conditions. As part of the proposed scheme, we introduce a new pseudo-time method for the Eikonal-diffusion problem in the myocardium, to correctly enforce electrical stimuli coming from the Purkinje network. We test our approach by performing numerical simulations of cardiac electrophysiology in a real biventricular geometry, under both pathological and therapeutic conditions, to demonstrate its flexibility, robustness, and accuracy.</description>

      <title>A convexity-like structure for polar decomposition with an application to distributed computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make a full landscape analysis of the (generally non-convex) orthogonal Procrustes problem. This problem is equivalent with computing the polar factor of a square matrix. We reveal a convexity-like structure, which explains the already established tractability of the problem and show that gradient descent in the orthogonal group computes the polar factor of a square matrix with linear convergence rate if the matrix is invertible and with an algebraic one if the matrix is singular. These results are similar to the ones of Alimisis and Vandereycken (2024) for the symmetric eigenvalue problem. We present an instance of a distributed Procrustes problem, which is hard to deal by standard techniques from numerical linear algebra. Our theory though can provide a solution.</description>

      <title>Adaptive randomized pivoting for column subset selection, DEIM, and low-rank approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a new adaptive leverage score sampling strategy for solving the Column Subset Selection Problem (CSSP). The resulting algorithm, called Adaptive Randomized Pivoting, can be viewed as a randomization of Osinsky's recently proposed deterministic algorithm for CSSP. It guarantees, in expectation, an approximation error that matches the optimal existence result in the Frobenius norm. Although the same guarantee can be achieved with volume sampling, our sampling strategy is much simpler and less expensive. To show the versatility of Adaptive Randomized Pivoting, we apply it to select indices in the Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method, in cross/skeleton approximation of general matrices, and in the Nystroem approximation of symmetric positive semi-definite matrices. In all these cases, the resulting randomized algorithms are new and they enjoy bounds on the expected error that match -- or improve -- the best known deterministic results. A derandomization of the algorithm for the Nystroem approximation results in a new deterministic algorithm with a rather favorable error bound.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-time Adaptive Anisotropic Image-to-mesh Conversion for Vascular Flow Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Presented is a path towards a fast and robust adaptive anisotropic mesh generation method that is designed to help streamline the discretization of complex vascular geometries within the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modeling process. The proposed method combines multiple software tools into a single pipeline to provide the following: (1) image-to-mesh conversion which satisfies quality, fidelity, and smoothness requirements, (2) the generation of a boundary layer grid over the high fidelity surface, (3) a parallel adaptive anisotropic meshing procedure which satisfies real-time requirements, and (4) robustness, which is satisfied by the pipeline's ability to process segmented images and CAD models. The proposed approach is tested with two brain aneurysm cases and is shown to satisfy all the aforementioned requirements. The next steps are to fully parallelize the remaining components of the pipeline to maximize potential performance and to test its integration within a CFD vascular flow simulation. Just as the parallel anisotropic adaptation procedure was tested within aerospace CFD simulations using CAD models, the method is expected to provide accurate results for CFD vascular flow simulations in real-time when executed on multicore cc-NUMA architectures.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Method for Optimal Path Planning on Manifolds via a Hopf-Lax Type Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of optimal path planning on a manifold which is the image of a smooth function. Optimal path-planning is of crucial importance for motion planning, image processing, and statistical data analysis. In this work, we consider a particle lying on the graph of a smooth function that seeks to navigate from some initial point to another point on the manifold in minimal time. We model the problem using optimal control theory, the dynamic programming principle, and a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We then design a novel primal dual hybrid gradient inspired algorithm that resolves the solution efficiently based on a generalized Hopf-Lax type formula. We present examples which demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate that, because the algorithm does not rely on grid-based numerical methods for partial differential equations, it scales well for high-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>A polynomial approximation scheme for nonlinear model reduction by moment matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a procedure for the numerical approximation of invariance equations arising in the moment matching technique associated with reduced-order modeling of high-dimensional dynamical systems. The Galerkin residual method is employed to find an approximate solution to the invariance equation using a Newton iteration on the coefficients of a monomial basis expansion of the solution. These solutions to the invariance equations can then be used to construct reduced-order models. We assess the ability of the method to solve the invariance PDE system as well as to achieve moment matching and recover a system's steady-state behaviour for linear and nonlinear signal generators with system dynamics up to $n=1000$ dimensions.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Analysis For Monotonically Forward-Backward Accelerated Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of gradient-based optimization, Nesterov's accelerated gradient method (NAG) is a landmark advancement, achieving an accelerated convergence rate that outperforms the vanilla gradient descent method for convex function. However, for strongly convex functions, whether NAG converges linearly remains an open question, as noted in the comprehensive review by Chambolle and Pock [2016]. This issue, aside from the critical step size, was addressed by Li et al. [2024a] using a high-resolution differential equation framework. Furthermore, Beck [2017, Section 10.7.4] introduced a monotonically convergent variant of NAG, referred to as M-NAG. Despite these developments, the Lyapunov analysis presented in [Li et al., 2024a] cannot be directly extended to M-NAG. In this paper, we propose a modification to the iterative relation by introducing a gradient term, leading to a new gradient-based iterative relation. This adjustment allows for the construction of a novel Lyapunov function that excludes kinetic energy. The linear convergence derived from this Lyapunov function is independent of both the parameters of the strongly convex functions and the step size, yielding a more general and robust result. Notably, we observe that the gradient iterative relation derived from M-NAG is equivalent to that from NAG when the position-velocity relation is applied. However, the Lyapunov analysis does not rely on the position-velocity relation, allowing us to extend the linear convergence to M-NAG. Finally, by utilizing two proximal inequalities, which serve as the proximal counterparts of strongly convex inequalities, we extend the linear convergence to both the fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (FISTA) and its monotonic counterpart (M-FISTA).</description>

      <title>PowerMLP: An Efficient Version of KAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a new network architecture known for its high accuracy in several tasks such as function fitting and PDE solving. The superior expressive capability of KAN arises from the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem and learnable spline functions. However, the computation of spline functions involves multiple iterations, which renders KAN significantly slower than MLP, thereby increasing the cost associated with model training and deployment. The authors of KAN have also noted that ``the biggest bottleneck of KANs lies in its slow training. KANs are usually 10x slower than MLPs, given the same number of parameters.'' To address this issue, we propose a novel MLP-type neural network PowerMLP that employs simpler non-iterative spline function representation, offering approximately the same training time as MLP while theoretically demonstrating stronger expressive power than KAN. Furthermore, we compare the FLOPs of KAN and PowerMLP, quantifying the faster computation speed of PowerMLP. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that PowerMLP generally achieves higher accuracy and a training speed about 40 times faster than KAN in various tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks, have transformed the landscape of image classification by autonomously extracting features directly from raw pixel data. This article introduces an innovative image classification model that employs three consecutive inception blocks within a convolutional neural networks framework, providing a comprehensive comparative analysis with well-established architectures such as Visual Geometry Group, Residual Network, and MobileNet. Through the utilization of benchmark datasets, including Canadian Institute for Advanced Researc, Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, and Fashion Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database, we assess the performance of our proposed model in comparison to these benchmarks. The outcomes reveal that our novel model consistently outperforms its counterparts across diverse datasets, underscoring its effectiveness and potential for advancing the current state-of-the-art in image classification. Evaluation metrics further emphasize that the proposed model surpasses the other compared architectures, thereby enhancing the efficiency of image classification on standard datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for the efficient and accurate computation of resonance modes in photonic waveguides. The framework is based on AAA rational approximation with the application of special light sources. It allows one to calculate only relevant modes, such as the fundamental resonance modes localized in the central core of the waveguides. We demonstrate the framework using an example from the literature, a hollow-core photonic crystal fiber. This waveguide supports many other modes, such as cladding modes and higher-order modes. These nonrelevant modes are not calculated, so that challenging post-processing with mode filtering is not required.</description>

      <title>A few sharp estimates of harmonic functions with applications to Steklov eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On smooth compact manifolds with smooth boundary, we first establish the sharp lower bounds for the restrictions of harmonic functions in terms of their frequency functions, by using a combination of microlocal analysis and frequency function techniques by Almgren and Garofalo-Lin. The lower bounds can be saturated by Steklov eigenfunctions on Euclidean balls and a family of symmetric warped product manifolds. Moreover, as in Sogge and Taylor, we analyze the interior behavior of harmonic functions by constructing a parametrix for the Poisson integral operator and calculate its composition with the spectral cluster. By using microlocal analysis, we obtain several sharp estimates for the harmonic functions whose traces are quasimodes on the boundary. As applications, we establish the almost-orthogonality, bilinear estimates and transversal restriction estimates for Steklov eigenfunctions, and discuss the numerical approximation of harmonic functions.</description>

Abstract: This article is concerned with an approximate analytical solution for the time fractional Kudryashov Sinelshchikov equation by using the reproducing kernel Hilbert space method. The main tools of this method are reproducing kernel theory, some important Hilbert spaces, the normal basis, orthogonalisation process, and homogenization. The effectiveness of reproduc ing kernel Hilbert space method is presented through the tables and graphs. These computa tional results indicate that this method is highly accurate and efficient for the time fractional Kudryashov Sinelshchikov equation. Also, it is demonstrated that the approximate solution uniformly converges to exact solution by using reproducing kernel Hilbert space method.</description>

      <title>Structure-preserving Kernel-based methods for solving dissipative PDEs on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17478v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general meshless structure-preserving Galerkin method for solving dissipative PDEs on surfaces. By posing the PDE in the variational formulation and simulating the solution in the finite-dimensional approximation space spanned by (local) Lagrange functions generated with positive definite kernels, we obtain a semi-discrete Galerkin equation that inherits the energy dissipation property. The fully-discrete structure-preserving scheme is derived with the average vector field method. We provide a convergence analysis of the proposed method for the Allen-Cahn equation. The numerical experiments also verify the theoretical analysis including the convergence order and structure-preserving properties.</description>

      <title>A Guide to Stochastic Optimisation for Large-Scale Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06342v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic optimisation algorithms are the de facto standard for machine learning with large amounts of data. Handling only a subset of available data in each optimisation step dramatically reduces the per-iteration computational costs, while still ensuring significant progress towards the solution. Driven by the need to solve large-scale optimisation problems as efficiently as possible, the last decade has witnessed an explosion of research in this area. Leveraging the parallels between machine learning and inverse problems has allowed harnessing the power of this research wave for solving inverse problems. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive account of the state-of-the-art in stochastic optimisation from the viewpoint of variational regularisation for inverse problems where the solution is modelled as minimising an objective function. We present algorithms with diverse modalities of problem randomisation and discuss the roles of variance reduction, acceleration, higher-order methods, and other algorithmic modifications, and compare theoretical results with practical behaviour. We focus on the potential and the challenges for stochastic optimisation that are unique to variational regularisation for inverse imaging problems and are not commonly encountered in machine learning. We conclude the survey with illustrative examples from imaging on linear inverse problems to examine the advantages and disadvantages that this new generation of algorithms bring to the field of inverse problems.</description>

      <title>Generation of Random (Generalized) Orthogonal Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an algorithmic method for generating random orthogonal matrices \(A\) that satisfy the property \(A^t S A = S\), where \(S\) is a fixed real invertible symmetric or skew-symmetric matrix. This method is significant as it generalizes the procedures for generating orthogonal matrices that fix a general fixed symmetric or skew-symmetric bilinear form. These include orthogonal matrices that fall to groups such as the symplectic group, Lorentz group, Poincar\'e group, and more generally the indefinite orthogonal group, to name a few. These classes of matrices play crucial roles in diverse fields such as theoretical physics, where they are used to describe symmetries and conservation laws, as well as in computational geometry, numerical analysis, and number theory, where they are integral to the study of quadratic forms and modular forms. The implementation of our algorithms can be accomplished using standard linear algebra libraries.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Discovery of Delay Differential Equations with Discrete Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) framework is a robust method for identifying governing equations, successfully applied to ordinary, partial, and stochastic differential equations. In this work we extend SINDy to identify delay differential equations by using an augmented library that includes delayed samples and Bayesian optimization. To identify a possibly unknown delay we minimize the reconstruction error over a set of candidates. The resulting methodology improves the overall performance by remarkably reducing the number of calls to SINDy with respect to a brute force approach. We also address a multivariate setting to identify multiple unknown delays and (non-multiplicative) parameters. Several numerical tests on delay differential equations with different long-term behavior, number of variables, delays, and parameters support the use of Bayesian optimization highlighting both the efficacy of the proposed methodology and its computational advantages. As a consequence, the class of discoverable models is significantly expanded.</description>

      <title>A node-based uniform strain virtual element method for elastoplastic solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10808v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recently proposed node-based uniform strain virtual element method (NVEM) is here extended to small strain elastoplastic solids. In the proposed method, the strain is averaged at the nodes from the strain of surrounding linearly precise virtual elements using a generalization to virtual elements of the node-based uniform strain approach for finite elements. The averaged strain is then used to sample the weak form at the nodes of the mesh leading to a method in which all the field variables, including state and history-dependent variables, are related to the nodes and thus they are tracked only at these locations during the nonlinear computations. Through various elastoplastic benchmark problems, we demonstrate that the NVEM is locking-free while enabling linearly precise virtual elements to solve elastoplastic solids with accuracy.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Random Evolution Equations of Parabolic type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an abstract framework to obtain convergence rates for the approximation of random evolution equations corresponding to a random family of forms determined by finite-dimensional noise. The full discretization error in space, time, and randomness is considered, where polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) is used for the semi-discretization in randomness. The main result are regularity conditions on the random forms under which convergence of polynomial order in randomness is obtained depending on the smoothness of the coefficients and the Sobolev regularity of the initial value. In space and time, the same convergence rates as in the deterministic setting are achieved. To this end, we derive error estimates for vector-valued PCE as well as a quantified version of the Trotter--Kato theorem for form-induced semigroups. We apply the abstract framework to an anisotropic diffusion model with random diffusion coefficients.</description>

      <title>Boundary-field formulation for transient electromagnetic scattering by dielectric scatterers and coated conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05367v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the transient scattered and transmitted fields generated when an incident electromagnetic wave impinges on a dielectric scatterer or a coated conductor embedded in an infinite space. By applying a boundary-field equation method, we reformulate the problem in the Laplace domain using the electric field equation inside the scatterer and a system of boundary integral equations for the scattered electric field in free space. To analyze this nonlocal boundary problem, we replace it by an equivalent boundary value problem. Existence, uniqueness and stability of the weak solution to the equivalent BVP are established in appropriate function spaces in terms of the Laplace transformed variable. The stability bounds are translated into time-domain estimates which determine the regularity of the solution in terms of the regularity of the problem data. These estimates can be easily converted into error estimates for a numerical discretization on the convolution quadrature for time evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a reformulation of the governing equations for incompressible multi-phase flow in the volume of fluid setting leads to a well defined energy rate. Weak nonlinear inflow-outflow and solid wall boundary conditions complement the development and lead to an energy estimate in terms of external data. The new formulation combined with summation-by-parts operators lead to provably nonlinear energy stability.</description>

      <title>Sinkhorn Algorithm for Sequentially Composed Optimal Transports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03120v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sinkhorn algorithm is the de-facto standard approximation algorithm for optimal transport, which has been applied to a variety of applications, including image processing and natural language processing. In theory, the proof of its convergence follows from the convergence of the Sinkhorn--Knopp algorithm for the matrix scaling problem, and Altschuler et al. show that its worst-case time complexity is in near-linear time. Very recently, sequentially composed optimal transports were proposed by Watanabe and Isobe as a hierarchical extension of optimal transports. In this paper, we present an efficient approximation algorithm, namely Sinkhorn algorithm for sequentially composed optimal transports, for its entropic regularization. Furthermore, we present a theoretical analysis of the Sinkhorn algorithm, namely (i) its exponential convergence to the optimal solution with respect to the Hilbert pseudometric, and (ii) a worst-case complexity analysis for the case of one sequential composition.</description>
