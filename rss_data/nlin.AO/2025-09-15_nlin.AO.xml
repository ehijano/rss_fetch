      <title>Generalizing thermodynamic efficiency of interactions: inferential, information-geometric and computational perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-organizing systems consume energy to generate internal order. The concept of thermodynamic efficiency, drawing from statistical physics and information theory, has previously been proposed to characterize a change in control parameter by relating the resulting predictability gain to the required amount of work. However, previous studies have taken a system-centric perspective and considered only single control parameters. Here, we generalize thermodynamic efficiency to multi-parameter settings and derive two observer-centric formulations. The first, an inferential form, relates efficiency to fluctuations of macroscopic observables, interpreting thermodynamic efficiency in terms of how well the system parameters can be inferred from observable macroscopic behaviour. The second, an information-geometric form, expresses efficiency in terms of the Fisher information matrix, interpreting it with respect to how difficult it is to navigate the statistical manifold defined by the control protocol. This observer-centric perspective is contrasted with the existing system-centric view, where efficiency is considered an intrinsic property of the system.</description>

      <title>Turing patterns on adaptive networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are surrounded by spatio-temporal patterns resulting from the interaction of the numerous basic units constituting natural or human-made systems. In presence of diffusive-like coupling, Turing theory has been largely applied to explain the formation of such self-organized motifs both on continuous domains or networked systems, where reactions occur in the nodes and the available links are used for species to diffuse. In many relevant applications, those links are not static, as very often assumed, but evolve in time and more importantly they adapt their weights to the states of the nodes. In this work, we make one step forward and we provide a general theory to prove the validity of Turing idea in the case of adaptive symmetric networks with positive weights. The conditions for the emergence of Turing instability rely on the spectral property of the Laplace matrix and the model parameters, thus strengthening the interplay between dynamics and network topology. A rich variety of patterns are presented by using two prototype models of nonlinear dynamical systems, the Brusselator and the FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Because many empirical networks adapt to changes in the system states, our results pave the way for a thorough understanding of self-organization in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Synergistic Motifs in Gaussian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-order interdependencies are central features of complex systems, yet a mechanistic explanation for their emergence remains elusive. Currently, it is unknown under what conditions high-order interdependencies, quantified by the information-theoretic construct of synergy, arise in systems governed by pairwise interactions. We solve this problem by providing precise sufficient and necessary conditions for when synergy prevails over low-order interdependencies, namely, we prove that antibalanced (highly frustrated) correlational structures in Gaussian systems are sufficient for synergy-dominance and that antibalanced interaction motifs in Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes are necessary for synergy-dominance. We validate the applicability of these analytical insights in Ising, oscillatory, and empirical networks from multiple domains. Our results demonstrate that pairwise interactions can give rise to synergistic information in the absence of explicit high-order mechanisms, and highlight structural balance theory as an instrumental conceptual framework to study high-order interdependencies.</description>
