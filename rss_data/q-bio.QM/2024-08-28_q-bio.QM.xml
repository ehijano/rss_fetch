      <title>Nonlinear memory in cell division dynamics across species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regulation of cell growth and division is essential to achieve cell-size homeostasis. Recent advances in imaging technologies, such as ``mother machines" for bacteria or yeast, have allowed long-term tracking of cell-size dynamics across many generations, and thus have brought major insights into the mechanisms underlying cell-size control. However, understanding the governing rules of cell growth and division within a quantitative dynamical-systems framework remains a major challenge. Here, we implement and apply a framework that makes it possible to infer stochastic differential equation (SDE) models with Poisson noise directly from experimentally measured time series for cellular growth and divisions. To account for potential nonlinear memory effects, we parameterize the Poisson intensity of stochastic cell division events in terms of both the cell's current size and its ancestral history. By applying the algorithm to experimentally measured cell size trajectories, we are able to quantitatively evaluate the linear one-step memory hypothesis underlying the popular ``sizer",``adder", and ``timer" models of cell homeostasis. For Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis bacteria, Schizosaccharomyces pombe yeast and Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae, we find that in many cases the inferred stochastic models have a substantial nonlinear memory component. This suggests a need to reevaluate and generalize the currently prevailing linear-memory paradigm of cell homeostasis. More broadly, the underlying inference framework is directly applicable to identify quantitative models for stochastic jump processes in a wide range of scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing overdispersion in longitudinal analyses with grouped nominal polytomous data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experiments in Agricultural Sciences often involve the analysis of longitudinal nominal polytomous variables, both in individual and grouped structures. Marginal and mixed-effects models are two common approaches. The distributional assumptions induce specific mean-variance relationships, however, in many instances, the observed variability is greater than assumed by the model. This characterizes overdispersion, whose identification is crucial for choosing an appropriate modeling framework to make inferences reliable. We propose an initial exploration of constructing a longitudinal multinomial dispersion index as a descriptive and diagnostic tool. This index is calculated as the ratio between the observed and assumed variances. The performance of this index was evaluated through a simulation study, employing statistical techniques to assess its initial performance in different scenarios. We identified that as the index approaches one, it is more likely that this corresponds to a high degree of overdispersion. Conversely, values closer to zero indicate a low degree of overdispersion. As a case study, we present an application in animal science, in which the behaviour of pigs (grouped in stalls) is evaluated, considering three response categories.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inference of Minimally Complex Models with Interactions of Arbitrary Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.00520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the model that best describes a high-dimensional dataset is a daunting task, even more so if one aims to consider all possible high-order patterns of the data, going beyond pairwise models. For binary data, we show that this task becomes feasible when restricting the search to a family of simple models, that we call Minimally Complex Models (MCMs). MCMs are maximum entropy models that have interactions of arbitrarily high order grouped into independent components of minimal complexity. They are simple in information-theoretic terms, which means they can only fit well certain types of data patterns and are therefore easy to falsify. We show that Bayesian model selection restricted to these models is computationally feasible and has many advantages. First, the model evidence, which balances goodness-of-fit against complexity, can be computed efficiently without any parameter fitting, enabling very fast explorations of the space of MCMs. Second, the family of MCMs is invariant under gauge transformations, which can be used to develop a representation-independent approach to statistical modeling. For small systems (up to 15 variables), combining these two results allows us to select the best MCM among all, even though the number of models is already extremely large. For larger systems, we propose simple heuristics to find optimal MCMs in reasonable times. Besides, inference and sampling can be performed without any computational effort. Finally, because MCMs have interactions of any order, they can reveal the presence of important high-order dependencies in the data, providing a new approach to explore high-order dependencies in complex systems. We apply our method to synthetic data and real-world examples, illustrating how MCMs portray the structure of dependencies among variables in a simple manner, extracting falsifiable predictions on symmetries and invariance from the data.</description>
