      <title>Computational Relative Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our capacity to process information depends on the computational power at our disposal. Information theory captures our ability to distinguish states or communicate messages when it is unconstrained with unrivaled elegance. For computationally bounded observers the situation is quite different. They can, for example, be fooled to believe that distributions are more random than they actually are. In our work, we go beyond the prevailing single-shot approach and take a new direction in computational quantum information theory that captures the essence of complexity-constrained information theory while retaining the look and feel of the unbounded asymptotic theory. As our foundational quantity, we define the computational relative entropy as the optimal error exponent in asymmetric hypothesis testing when restricted to polynomially many copies and quantum gates, defined in a mathematically rigorous way. Building on this foundation, we prove a computational analogue of Stein's lemma, establish computational versions of fundamental inequalities like Pinsker's bound, and demonstrate a computational smoothing property showing that computationally indistinguishable states yield equivalent information measures. We derive a computational entropy that operationally characterizes optimal compression rates for quantum states under computational limitations and show that our quantities apply to computational entanglement theory, proving a computational version of the Rains bound. Our framework reveals striking separations between computational and unbounded information measures, including quantum-classical gaps that arise from cryptographic assumptions, demonstrating that computational constraints fundamentally alter the information-theoretic landscape and open new research directions at the intersection of quantum information, complexity theory, and cryptography.</description>

      <title>Average-Case Complexity of Quantum Stabilizer Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random classical linear codes are widely believed to be hard to decode. While slightly sub-exponential time algorithms exist when the coding rate vanishes sufficiently rapidly, all known algorithms at constant rate require exponential time. By contrast, the complexity of decoding a random quantum stabilizer code has remained an open question for quite some time. This work closes the gap in our understanding of the algorithmic hardness of decoding random quantum versus random classical codes. We prove that decoding a random stabilizer code with even a single logical qubit is at least as hard as decoding a random classical code at constant rate--the maximally hard regime. This result suggests that the easiest random quantum decoding problem is at least as hard as the hardest random classical decoding problem, and shows that any sub-exponential algorithm decoding a typical stabilizer code, at any rate, would immediately imply a breakthrough in cryptography.
  More generally, we also characterize many other complexity-theoretic properties of stabilizer codes. While classical decoding admits a random self-reduction, we prove significant barriers for the existence of random self-reductions in the quantum case. This result follows from new bounds on Clifford entropies and Pauli mixing times, which may be of independent interest. As a complementary result, we demonstrate various other self-reductions which are in fact achievable, such as between search and decision. We also demonstrate several ways in which quantum phenomena, such as quantum degeneracy, force several reasonable definitions of stabilizer decoding--all of which are classically identical--to have distinct or non-trivially equivalent complexity.</description>

      <title>Algorithms and Complexity for Computing Nash Equilibria in Adversarial Team Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02129v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial team games model multiplayer strategic interactions in which a team of identically-interested players is competing against an adversarial player in a zero-sum game. Such games capture many well-studied settings in game theory, such as congestion games, but go well-beyond to environments wherein the cooperation of one team -- in the absence of explicit communication -- is obstructed by competing entities; the latter setting remains poorly understood despite its numerous applications. Since the seminal work of Von Stengel and Koller (GEB `97), different solution concepts have received attention from an algorithmic standpoint. Yet, the complexity of the standard Nash equilibrium has remained open.
  In this paper, we settle this question by showing that computing a Nash equilibrium in adversarial team games belongs to the class continuous local search (CLS), thereby establishing CLS-completeness by virtue of the recent CLS-hardness result of Rubinstein and Babichenko (STOC `21) in potential games. To do so, we leverage linear programming duality to prove that any $\epsilon$-approximate stationary strategy for the team can be extended in polynomial time to an $O(\epsilon)$-approximate Nash equilibrium, where the $O(\cdot)$ notation suppresses polynomial factors in the description of the game. As a consequence, we show that the Moreau envelop of a suitable best response function acts as a potential under certain natural gradient-based dynamics.</description>
