      <title>Formal Verification of Diffusion Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In diffusion auctions, sellers can leverage an underlying social network to broaden participation, thereby increasing their potential revenue. Specifically, sellers can incentivise participants in their auction to diffuse information about the auction through the network. While numerous variants of such auctions have been recently studied in the literature, the formal verification and strategic reasoning perspectives have not been investigated yet.
  Our contribution is threefold. First, we introduce a logical formalism that captures the dynamics of diffusion and its strategic dimension. Second, for such a logic, we provide model-checking procedures that allow one to verify properties as the Nash equilibrium, and that pave the way towards checking the existence of sellers' strategies. Third, we establish computational complexity results for the presented algorithms.</description>

      <title>Minimal Regret Walras Equilibria for Combinatorial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider combinatorial multi-item markets and propose the notion of a $\Delta$-regret Walras equilibrium, which is an allocation of items to players and a set of item prices that achieve the following goals: prices clear the market, the allocation is capacity-feasible, and the players' strategies lead to a total regret of $\Delta$. The regret is defined as the sum of individual player regrets measured by the utility gap with respect to the optimal item bundle given the prices. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of $\Delta$-regret equilibria, where we establish a connection to the duality gap and the integrality gap of the social welfare problem. For the special case of monotone valuations, the derived necessary and sufficient optimality conditions coincide and lead to a complete characterization of achievable $\Delta$-regret equilibria. For general valuations, we establish an interesting connection to the area of sensitivity theory in linear optimization. We show that the sensitivity gap of the optimal-value function of two (configuration) linear programs with changed right-hand side can be used to establish a bound on the achievable regret. Finally, we use these general structural results to translate known approximation algorithms for the social welfare optimization problem into algorithms computing low-regret Walras equilibria. We also demonstrate how to derive strong lower bounds based on integrality and duality gaps but also based on NP-complexity theory.</description>

      <title>Pricing Online LLM Services with Data-Calibrated Stackelberg Routing Game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has established LLM routing as a standard service delivery mechanism, where users select models based on cost, Quality of Service (QoS), among other things. However, optimal pricing in LLM routing platforms requires precise modeling for dynamic service markets, and solving this problem in real time at scale is computationally intractable. In this paper, we propose \PriLLM, a novel practical and scalable solution for real-time dynamic pricing in competitive LLM routing. \PriLLM models the service market as a Stackelberg game, where providers set prices and users select services based on multiple criteria. To capture real-world market dynamics, we incorporate both objective factors (\eg~cost, QoS) and subjective user preferences into the model. For scalability, we employ a deep aggregation network to learn provider abstraction that preserve user-side equilibrium behavior across pricing strategies. Moreover, \PriLLM offers interpretability by explaining its pricing decisions. Empirical evaluation on real-world data shows that \PriLLM achieves over 95\% of the optimal profit while only requiring less than 5\% of the optimal solution's computation time.</description>

      <title>Steering Noncooperative Games Through Conjecture Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dynamic noncooperative games, each player makes conjectures about other players' reactions before choosing a strategy. However, resulting equilibria may be multiple and do not always lead to desirable outcomes. These issues are typically addressed separately, for example, through opponent modelling and incentive design. Drawing inspiration from conjectural variations games, we propose an incentive design framework in which a coordinator first computes an equilibrium by optimizing a predefined objective function, then communicates this equilibrium as a target for the players to reach. In a centralized setting, the coordinator also optimizes the conjectures to steer the players towards the target. In decentralized settings, players independently compute conjectures and update their strategies based on individual targets. We provide a guarantee of equilibrium existence in both cases. This framework uses conjectures not only to guide the system towards desirable outcomes but also to decouple the game into independent optimization problems, enabling efficient computation and parallelization in large-scale settings. We illustrate our theoretical results on classical representative noncooperative games, demonstrating its application potential.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Impact of Proportionality in Approval-Based Multiwinner Elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite extensive theoretical research on proportionality in approval-based multiwinner voting, its impact on which committees and candidates can be selected in practice remains poorly understood. We address this gap by (i) analyzing the computational complexity of several natural problems related to the behavior of proportionality axioms, and (ii) conducting an extensive experimental study on both real-world and synthetic elections. Our findings reveal substantial variation in the restrictiveness of proportionality across instances, including previously unobserved high levels of restrictiveness in some real-world cases. We also introduce and evaluate new measures for quantifying a candidate's importance for achieving proportional outcomes, which differ clearly from assessing candidate strength by approval score.</description>

      <title>Energy-Workload Coupled Migration Optimization Strategy for Virtual Power Plants with Data Centers Considering Fuzzy Chance Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an energy-workload coupled migration optimization strategy for virtual power plants (VPPs) with data centers (DCs) to enhance resource scheduling flexibility and achieve precise demand response (DR) curve tracking. A game-based coupled migration framework characterized by antisymmetric matrices is first established to facilitate the coordination of cross-regional resource allocation between VPPs. To address the challenge posed to conventional probabilistic modeling by the inherent data sparsity of DC workloads, deterministic equivalent transformations of fuzzy chance constraints are derived based on fuzzy set theory, and non-convex stochastic problems are transformed into a solvable second-order cone program. To address the multi-player interest coordination problem in cooperative games, an improved Shapley value profit allocation method with the VPP operator as intermediary is proposed to achieve a balance between theoretical fairness and computational feasibility. In addition, the alternating direction method of multipliers with consensus-based variable splitting is introduced to solve the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem, transforming coupled antisymmetric constraints into separable subproblems with analytical solutions. Simulations based on real data from Google's multiple DCs demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving DR curve tracking precision and reducing operational costs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This book is an introductory textbook targeted towards computer science students who are completely new to the topic of automated negotiation. It does not require any prerequisite knowledge, except for elementary mathematics and basic programming skills.
  This book comes with an simple toy-world negotiation framework implemented in Python that can be used by the readers to implement their own negotiation algorithms and perform experiments with them. This framework is small and simple enough that any reader who does not like to work in Python should be able to re-implement it very quickly in any other programming language of their choice.</description>

      <title>Good-for-MDP State Reduction for Stochastic LTL Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stochastic planning problems in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with goals specified in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). The state-of-the-art approach transforms LTL formulas into good-for-MDP (GFM) automata, which feature a restricted form of nondeterminism. These automata are then composed with the MDP, allowing the agent to resolve the nondeterminism during policy synthesis. A major factor affecting the scalability of this approach is the size of the generated automata. In this paper, we propose a novel GFM state-space reduction technique that significantly reduces the number of automata states. Our method employs a sophisticated chain of transformations, leveraging recent advances in good-for-games minimisation developed for adversarial settings. In addition to our theoretical contributions, we present empirical results demonstrating the practical effectiveness of our state-reduction technique. Furthermore, we introduce a direct construction method for formulas of the form $\mathsf{G}\mathsf{F}\varphi$, where $\varphi$ is a co-safety formula. This construction is provably single-exponential in the worst case, in contrast to the general doubly-exponential complexity. Our experiments confirm the scalability advantages of this specialised construction.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Advice as a Strategic Signal on Competitive Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As algorithms increasingly mediate competitive decision-making, their influence extends beyond individual outcomes to shaping strategic market dynamics. In two preregistered experiments, we examined how algorithmic advice affects human behavior in classic economic games with unique, non-collusive, and analytically traceable equilibria. In Experiment 1 (N = 107), participants played a Bertrand price competition with individualized or collective algorithmic recommendations. Initially, collusively upward-biased advice increased prices, particularly when individualized, but prices gradually converged toward equilibrium over the course of the experiment. However, participants avoided setting prices above the algorithm's recommendation throughout the experiment, suggesting that advice served as a soft upper bound for acceptable prices. In Experiment 2 (N = 129), participants played a Cournot quantity competition with equilibrium-aligned or strategically biased algorithmic recommendations. Here, individualized equilibrium advice supported stable convergence, whereas collusively downward-biased advice led to sustained underproduction and supracompetitive profits - hallmarks of tacit collusion. In both experiments, participants responded more strongly and consistently to individualized advice than collective advice, potentially due to greater perceived ownership of the former. These findings demonstrate that algorithmic advice can function as a strategic signal, shaping coordination even without explicit communication. The results echo real-world concerns about algorithmic collusion and underscore the need for careful design and oversight of algorithmic decision-support systems in competitive environments.</description>

      <title>Prophet and Secretary at the Same Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many online problems are studied in stochastic settings for which inputs are samples from a known distribution, given in advance, or from an unknown distribution. Such distributions model both beyond-worst-case inputs and, when given, partial foreknowledge for the online algorithm. But how robust can such algorithms be to misspecification of the given distribution? When is this detectable, and when does it matter? When can algorithms give good competitive ratios both when the input distribution is as specified, and when it is not?
  We consider these questions in the setting of optimal stopping, where the cases of known and unknown distributions correspond to the well-known prophet inequality and to the secretary problem, respectively. Here we ask: Can a stopping rule be competitive for the i.i.d. prophet inequality problem and the secretary problem at the same time? We constrain the Pareto frontier of simultaneous approximation ratios $(\alpha, \beta)$ that a stopping rule can attain.
  We introduce a family of algorithms that give nontrivial joint guarantees and are optimal for the extremal i.i.d. prophet and secretary problems. We also prove impossibilities, identifying $(\alpha, \beta)$ unattainable by any adaptive stopping rule. Our results hold for both $n$ fixed arrivals and for arrivals from a Poisson process with rate $n$. We work primarily in the Poisson setting, and provide reductions between the Poisson and $n$-arrival settings that may be of broader interest.</description>

      <title>Colonel Blotto with Battlefield Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of two-player zero-sum Colonel Blotto games in which, after allocating soldiers across battlefields, players engage in (possibly distinct) normal-form games on each battlefield. Per-battlefield payoffs are parameterized by the soldier allocations. This generalizes the classical Blotto setting, where outcomes depend only on relative soldier allocations. We consider both discrete and continuous allocation models and examine two types of aggregate objectives: linear aggregation and worst-case battlefield value. For each setting, we analyze the existence and computability of Nash equilibrium. The general problem is not convex-concave, which limits the applicability of standard convex optimization techniques. However, we show that in several settings it is possible to reformulate the strategy space in a way where convex-concave structure is recovered. We evaluate the proposed methods on synthetic and real-world instances inspired by security applications, suggesting that our approaches scale well in practice.</description>

      <title>Nash-equilibrium Seeking Algorithm for Power-Allocation Games on Networks of International Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of international security, understanding the strategic interactions between countries within a networked context is crucial. Our previous research has introduced a ``games-on-signed graphs'' framework~\cite{LiMorse2022} to analyze these interactions. While the framework is intended to be basic and general, there is much left to be explored, particularly in capturing the complexity of strategic scenarios in international relations. Our paper aims to fill this gap in two key ways. First, we modify the existing preference axioms to allow for a more nuanced understanding of how countries pursue self-survival, defense of allies, and offense toward adversaries. Second, we introduce a novel algorithm that proves the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for these revised games. To validate our model, we employ historical data from the year 1940 as the game input and predict countries' survivability. Our contributions thus extend the real-world applicability of the original framework, offering a more comprehensive view of strategic interactions in a networked security environment.</description>

      <title>Dividing Indivisible Items for the Benefit of All: It is Hard to Be Fair Without Social Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In standard fair division models, we assume that all agents are selfish. However, in many scenarios, division of resources has a direct impact on the whole group or even society. Therefore, we study fair allocations of indivisible items that, at the same time, maximize social impact. In this model, each agent is associated with two additive functions that define their value and social impact for each item. The goal is to allocate items so that the social impact is maximized while maintaining some fairness criterion. We reveal that the complexity of the problem heavily depends on whether the agents are socially aware, i.e., they take into consideration the social impact functions. For socially unaware agents, we prove that the problem is NP-hard for a variety of fairness notions, and that it is tractable only for very restricted cases, e.g., if, for every agent, the valuation equals social impact and it is binary. On the other hand, social awareness allows for fair allocations that maximize social impact, and such allocations can be computed in polynomial time. Interestingly, the problem becomes again intractable as soon as the definition of social awareness is relaxed.</description>

      <title>ElicitationGPT: Text Elicitation Mechanisms via Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09363v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scoring rules evaluate probabilistic forecasts of an unknown state against the realized state and are a fundamental building block in the incentivized elicitation of information. This paper develops mechanisms for scoring elicited text against ground truth text by reducing the textual information elicitation problem to a forecast elicitation problem, via domain-knowledge-free queries to a large language model (specifically ChatGPT), and empirically evaluates their alignment with human preferences. Our theoretical analysis shows that the reduction achieves provable properness via black-box language models. The empirical evaluation is conducted on peer reviews from a peer-grading dataset, in comparison to manual instructor scores for the peer reviews.
  Our results suggest a paradigm of algorithmic artificial intelligence that may be useful for developing artificial intelligence technologies with provable guarantees.</description>

      <title>Game Theory and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Zonal Ancillary Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03288v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize zonal ancillary market coupling relying on noncooperative game theory. To that purpose, we formulate the ancillary market as a multi-leader single follower bilevel problem, that we subsequently cast as a generalized Nash game with side constraints and nonconvex feasibility sets. We determine conditions for equilibrium existence and show that the game has a generalized potential game structure. To compute market equilibrium, we rely on two exact approaches: an integrated optimization approach and Gauss-Seidel best-response, that we compare against multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. On real data from Germany and Austria, simulations indicate that multi-agent deep reinforcement learning achieves the smallest convergence rate but requires pretraining, while best-response is the slowest. On the economics side, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning results in smaller market costs compared to the exact methods, but at the cost of higher variability in the profit allocation among stakeholders. Further, stronger coupling between zones tends to reduce costs for larger zones.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In ethics, individual responsibility is often defined through Frankfurt's principle of alternative possibilities. This definition is not adequate in a group decision-making setting because it often results in the lack of a responsible party or "responsibility gap''. One of the existing approaches to address this problem is to consider group responsibility. Another, recently proposed, approach is "higher-order'' responsibility. The paper considers the problem of deciding if higher-order responsibility up to degree $d$ is enough to close the responsibility gap. The main technical result is that this problem is $\Pi_{2d+1}$-complete.</description>

      <title>When the Correct Model Fails: The Optimality of Stackelberg Equilibria with Follower Intention Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a two-player dynamic Stackelberg game between a leader and a follower whose intention is unknown to the leader. Classical formulations of the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) assume that the follower's best response (BR) function is known to the leader. However, this is not always true in practice. We study a setting in which the leader receives updated beliefs about the follower BR before the end of the game, such that the update prompts the leader and subsequently the follower to re-optimize their strategies. We characterize the optimality guarantees of the SE solutions under this belief update for both open loop and feedback information structures. Interestingly, we prove that in general, assuming an incorrect follower's BR can lead to more optimal leader costs over the entire game than knowing the true follower's BR. We support these results with numerical examples in a linear quadratic (LQ) Stackelberg game, and use Monte Carlo simulations to show that the instances of incorrect BR achieving lower leader costs are non-trivial in collision avoidance LQ Stackelberg games.</description>
