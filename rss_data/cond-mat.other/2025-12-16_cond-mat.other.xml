      <title>On the Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation for fermionic Hamiltonians without a linear part</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A self-contained treatment of the Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation for homogeneous fermionic Hamiltonians is presented. The aim is to provide a quick reference that may also serve as supplementary material for a graduate-level course, and that can be understood with quantum mechanics knowledge up to the level of the second quantization's rules. The objective of the transformation is to cast a quadratic Hamiltonian into a diagonal form that resembles the Hamiltonian of a system of non-interacting particles. To obtain this, the first step consists in putting its coefficient matrix into its canonical form; the transformation can always be performed on fermionic Hamiltonians, only some care must be taken when this form is singular. Having explained how to cast a general matrix into its standard form, a complete description of the transformation is provided; a novel procedure is proposed here for the singular matrix case.</description>

      <title>Electrical Readout Strategies of GFET Biosensors for Real-World Requirements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene Field-Effect Transistors (GFETs) are increasingly employed as biochemical sensors due to their exceptional electronic properties, surface sensitivity, and potential for miniaturization. A critical challenge in deploying GFETs is determining the optimal electrical readout strategy. GFETs are typically operated with either of two modalities: one measuring current in real time (amperometric) and the other monitoring the change in voltage for charge neutrality (potential potentiometric). Here, we undertake a systematic study of the two modalities to determine their relative advantages/disadvantages towards guiding the future use of GFETs in sensing. We focus on viral proteins in wastewater, given the matrix's complexity and the growing interest in the field of wastewater surveillance. Our results show that transconductance offers far superior limits of detection (LOD) but suffers from limited reproducibility, a narrower dynamic range, and is ineffective for some viral proteins. In comparison, we find that Dirac point tracking offers higher reproducibility and superior robustness, but at a higher LOD. Interestingly, both techniques exhibit similar sensitivity, highlighting the importance of the aptamers employed. Systematic experiments also help explain differences in dynamic range and limited functionality in detecting some proteins, resulting from hidden electrophoresis, and shifting the high transconductance point away from the active region. Thus, our findings provide crucial considerations for designing and operating resilient graphene biosensors suitable for real-time pathogen monitoring in environmental scenarios.</description>

      <title>Proximity effects and a topological invariant in a Chern insulator connected to leads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The observed robustly quantized Hall conductance in quantum Hall systems and Chern insulators (CI) have so far been understood in terms of the topology of isolated systems, which are not coupled to leads. It is assumed that the leads act as inert reservoirs that simply supply/absorb electrons to/from the sample. Within a model of a CI coupled to leads with a cylindrical geometry, we show that this is not true. In the proximity of the CI, the edge current leaks into the leads, with the Hall conductance quantized only if this novel proximity effect is taken into account. For a special choice of leads, we identify the conductance with a topological invariant of the system, in terms of the winding number of the phase of the reflection coefficients of the scattering states.</description>

      <title>The emergence of long-range entanglement and odd-even effect in periodic generalized cluster models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties in a generalized cluster model under periodic boundary condition. By evaluating the entanglement entropy and the quantum conditional mutual information entropy under three or four subsystem partitions, we identify clear signatures of long-range entanglement. Specifically, when both the system size $N$ and the interaction range $m$ are odd, the system exhibits nonzero four-part quantum conditional mutual information entropies. This non-vanishing four-part quantum conditional mutual information entropy directly signals the presence of long-range entanglement. In contrast, all other combination of $N$ and $m$ yield vanishing four-part quantum conditional mutual information entropy. Remarkably, in the case of $N, m \in \text{odd}$, these long-range entangled features persist even in the presence of a finite transverse field, demonstrating their robustness against quantum fluctuations. These results demonstrate how the interplay between system size and interaction range governs the emergence of long-range entanglement in one-dimensional spin systems.</description>

      <title>Dissipation Pathways in a Photosynthetic Complex</title>

Abstract: Determining how energy flows within and between molecules is crucial for understanding chemical reactions, material properties, and even vital processes such as photosynthesis. While the general principles of energy transfer are well established, elucidating the specific molecular pathways by which energy is funneled remains challenging as it requires tracking energy flow in complex molecular environments. Here, we demonstrate how photon excitation energy is partially dissipated in the light-harvesting Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, mediating the excitation energy transfer from light-harvesting chlorosomes to the photosynthetic reaction center in green sulfur bacteria. Specifically, we isolate the contribution of the protein and specific vibrational modes of the pigment molecules to the energy dynamics. For this, we introduce an efficient computational implementation of a recently proposed theory of dissipation pathways for open quantum systems. Using it and a state-of-the-art FMO model with highly structured and chromophore-specific spectral densities, we demonstrate that energy dissipation is dominated by low-frequency modes ($&lt;$ 800 cm$^{-1}$) as their energy range is near-resonance with the energy gaps between electronic states of the pigments. We identify the most important mode for dissipation to be in-plane breathing modes ($\sim$200 cm$^{-1}$) of the bacteriochlorophylls in the complex. Conversely, far-detuned intramolecular vibrations with higher frequencies ($&gt;$ 800 cm$^{-1}$) play no role in dissipation. Interestingly, the FMO complex first needs to borrow energy from the environment to release excess photonic energy, making the energy dissipation dynamics non-monotonic. Beyond their fundamental value, these insights can guide the development of artificial light-harvesting devices and, more broadly, engineer environments for chemical and quantum control tasks.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Dynamics of Spin-Orbit Entangled Excitons Coupled to Magnetic Ordering in van der Waals Antiferromagnet NiPS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04900</link>

Abstract: Spin-orbit entangled excitons (SOEE) in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnets provide direct access to explore unconventional many body interactions in correlated electron systems. In this work, we carry out a detailed investigation using non-degenerate isotropic and anisotropic pump-probe reflection spectroscopy to probe the ultrafast dynamics of SOEE and their coupling to spin fluctuations in NiPS3. Transient reflectivity data reveals acoustic phonon oscillations at ~ 27 GHz, along with two distinct relaxation timescales: fast (1-9 ps) and slower components (1-4 ns) associated with SOEE coherence and spin reordering, respectively. Both timescales exhibit pronounced temperature dependence near the exciton dissociation (TED = 120 K) and Neel (TN = 155 K) temperatures. The SOEE coherence shortens from ~ 8-9 ps at T &lt; TED to ~ 3 ps at T &gt; TED with a finite tail persisting beyond TN. The spin reordering time grows near 120 K, and shows critical slowing down around TN. Pump fluence studies further corroborate their spin origin. Our findings uncover the direct interplay between the excitonic and spin degrees of freedom across ultrafast and longer timescales, offering new opportunities to probe and engineer emergent many-body interactions in 2D antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08575v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation of the dynamics. This adaptive tVMC (atVMC) approach is specifically designed to enhance numerical stability when overparameterized variational ans\"atze lead to ill-conditioned equations of motion. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ans\"atze.</description>
