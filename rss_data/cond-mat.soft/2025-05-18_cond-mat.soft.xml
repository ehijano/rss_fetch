      <title>Spatially patterned phases in a reaction-time-symmetry-broken model of flocking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a Vicsek-like flocking model with a minimal form of time-delayed orientational interactions, in which the delays occur on a time scale that is well-separated from other time scales in the model. We achieve this by implementing an ``index-ordered'' update rule, mimicking a scenario in which agents have a distribution of times with which they react to information. This model retains the usual disorder-to-order transition common in flocking models, but we show that it also possesses a second transition, deep in the polar flocking phase, to a state with spatially patterned transverse velocities. We characterize this transition and its sensitivity to finite-size effects using the Binder cumulant, and demonstrate -- via direct measurements and by measuring a susceptibility of the phase to particle index permutations -- that the stability of this phase is directly tied to a subtle spatial organization of a slow-relaxing index-order field. These results highlight the potential for even seemingly insignificant temporal asymmetries to fundamentally alter the collective behavior of active matter.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of segment fluctuations in polymer and chromatin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate how center-of-mass (COM) motion influences polymer segment fluctuations. Cancellation of internal forces, together with spatially uncorrelated external noise, generally yields COM diffusivity scaling as $1/s$ with segment length $s$, regardless of fractal dimension, viscoelasticity, or activity. This introduces distinct dynamic scaling corrections to two-point fluctuations and quenched-induced tangential correlations, validated by theory, simulations, and chromatin imaging data. In the latter, the extracted dynamic exponent reveals topological constraints, thereby resolving the discrepancy between chromatin's crumpled structure and its Rouse-like dynamics.</description>

      <title>Delayed Active Swimmer in a Velocity Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-propelled active particles exhibit delayed responses to environmental changes, modulating their propulsion speed through intrinsic sensing and feedback mechanisms. This adaptive behavior fundamentally determines their dynamics and self-organization in active matter systems, with implications for biological microswimmers and engineered microrobots. Here, we investigate active Brownian particles whose propulsion speed is governed by spatially varying activity landscapes, incorporating a temporal delay between environmental sensing and speed adaptation. Through analytical solutions derived for both short-time and long-time delay regimes, we demonstrate that steady-state density and polarization profiles exhibit maxima at characteristic delays. Significantly, we observe that the polarization profile undergoes sign reversal when the swimming distance during the delay time exceeds the characteristic diffusion length, providing a novel mechanism for controlling particle transport without external fields. Our theoretical predictions, validated through experimental observations and numerical simulations, establish time delay as a crucial control parameter for particle transport and organization in active matter systems. These findings provide insights into how biological microorganisms might use response delays to gain navigation advantages and suggest design principles for synthetic microswimmers with programmable responses to heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <title>Chemically active droplets in crowded environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are essential for cellular organization and result from phase separation in systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Among various models, chemically active droplets play a significant role, consisting of proteins that switch between attractive and repulsive states via nonequilibrium chemical reactions. While field-based simulations have provided insights into their behavior, these coarse-grained approaches fail to capture molecular-scale effects, particularly in crowded cellular environments. Macromolecular crowding, a key feature of intracellular organization, strongly influences molecular transport within condensates, yet its quantitative impact remains underexplored. This study investigates the interplay between chemically active droplets and crowders by using particle-based models, that provide molecular insight, and a field-based model, that complements this picture. Surprisingly, crowding reduces droplet size while expanding the overall dense phase volume, challenging equilibrium-based expectations. This effect arises from the interplay between depletion interactions, diffusion hindrance, and nonequilibrium particle fluxes. Our findings provide a step towards a more comprehensive understanding of chemically active droplets in complex, realistic cellular environments.</description>

      <title>Microscopic description of the liquid-gas coexistence curve for Morse fluids in the immediate vicinity of the critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work is aimed at investigating the behavior of Morse fluids in the immediate vicinity of the critical point within the framework of a cell model. This region is of both fundamental and practical importance, yet presents analytical challenges due to the significant influence of order parameter fluctuations. An analytical procedure is developed to construct the upper part of the liquid-gas coexistence curve and calculate its diameter, incorporating the non-Gaussian (quartic) distribution of fluctuations. An explicit expression is derived for the temperature-dependent analytical term appearing in the expression for the rectilinear diameter. The numerical evaluation of the relevant quantities is carried out using Morse potential parameters representative of sodium. The coexistence curve is constructed both with and without the inclusion of the analytical temperature-dependent term in the calculation. A specific condition is identified under which the agreement between the presented binodal branches and Monte Carlo simulation data from other study, extrapolated to the immediate vicinity of the critical point, is improved. It is shown that better agreement is achieved when the analytical term is included in the calculation of the liquid branch and omitted in the gas branch. The proposed analytical approach may provide useful insight for the theoretical study of critical phenomena in more complex fluid systems.</description>

      <title>Structure and dynamics of ionic liquids under shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic behavior of ionic liquids under shear flow, using a coarse-grained model of C4mim-PF6 as a prototypical example. The importance of long-ranged electrostatics is assessed as a function of shear rate by comparing Ewald and reaction field treatments. An appropriate comparison is achieved through the implementation of the proper Lees-Edwards boundary conditions within the ESPResSo++ simulation software. Our results demonstrate that while structural properties are relatively insensitive to the electrostatic treatment, the more accurate treatment via the Ewald approach is essential for studies of dynamics, in particular, at lower shear rates. Furthermore, we identify a critical shear rate beyond which structural and dynamical properties begin to deviate from equilibrium behavior, while remaining largely unchanged below this threshold. Finally, we demonstrate that the dynamic heterogeneity of the liquid decreases as a function of increasing shear rate, which can be primarily explained by the faster dynamics induced by the shear flow. These results hold relevance for investigations of process-dependent properties of ionic-liquid-based materials.</description>

      <title>Normalized topological indices discriminate between architectures of branched macromolecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Branching architecture characterizes numerous systems, ranging from synthetic (hyper)branched polymers and biomolecules such as lignin, amylopectin, and nucleic acids to tracheal and neuronal networks. Its ubiquity reflects the many favourable properties that arise because of it. For instance, branched macromolecules are spatially compact and have a high surface functionality, which impacts their phase characteristics and self-assembly behaviour, among others. The relationship between branching and physical properties has been studied by mapping macromolecules to mathematical trees whose architecture can be characterized using topological indices. These indices, however, do not allow for a comparison of macromolecules that map to trees of different size, be it due to different mapping procedures or differences in their molecular weight. To alleviate this, we introduce a novel normalization of topological indices using estimates of their probability density functions. We determine two optimal normalized topological indices and construct a phase space that enables a robust discrimination between different architectures of branched macromolecules. We demonstrate the necessity of such a phase space on two practical applications, one being ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules with various branching topologies and the other different methods of coarse-graining branched macromolecules. Our approach can be applied to any type of branched molecules and extended as needed to other topological indices, making it useful across a wide range of fields where branched molecules play an important role, including polymer physics, green chemistry, bioengineering, biotechnology, and medicine.</description>

      <title>Connecting Shear Thinning and Dynamic Heterogeneity in Supercooled Liquids by Localized Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supercooled liquids exhibit complicated dynamical behaviors: At the microscopic level, the dynamics is heterogeneous spatially, known as dynamic heterogeneity. At the macroscopic level, the shear viscosity $\eta$ decreases as shear rate $\dot{\gamma}$ increases with a power law $\eta\sim\dot{\gamma}^{-\lambda}$, known as shear thinning. The relation between these two universal dynamical phenomena remains elusive. With simulations of several model liquids in two and three dimensions, we show that they are quantitatively bridged by localized elasticity embodied as transient clusters that elastically respond to shear. Prominent dynamic heterogeneity emerges right after the massive yielding of these clusters, which is initiated by shear transformation zones and facilitated by elasticity-mediated interaction. With this picture, a scaling law relating shear thinning to the characteristic length of dynamic heterogeneity is found.</description>

      <title>Atomistic mechanisms of viscosity in 2D liquid-like fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12522v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shear viscosity plays a fundamental role in fluid dynamics from heavy-ion collisions to biological processes. Still, its microscopic mechanisms at the individual particle kinetic level remain a subject of ongoing research, specially in dense systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the shear viscosity ($\eta$) of two-dimensional (2D) simple fluids using computer simulations of Lennard-Jones, Yukawa, and one-component plasma systems. By combining Frenkel's liquid description, consisting of solid-like quasi-harmonic vibrations interrupted by thermally activated hops, with the concept of lifetime of local atomic connectivity $\tau_{LC}$, we find a surprisingly simple formula for the kinematic viscosity that is solely determined by $\tau_{LC}$ and the average kinetic particle speed $\bar{v}_p$. The derived analytical expression provides a direct link between macroscopic and microscopic dynamics, which shows excellent agreement with the simulation data in the dense liquid-like regime in all the 2D fluids considered. Moreover, it is discovered that, $\tau_{LC}$ in 2D fluids is universally determined by the effective potential difference between the first peak and valley of the pair correlation function, implying a direct connection between macroscopic shear transport and microscopic structure. Finally, we demonstrate that the characteristic length scale $l_p= \bar{v}_p \tau_{LC}$, which governs the macroscopic shear viscosity, aligns with the elastic length-scale that defines the propagation limit of collective shear waves in liquids. These findings establish that shear viscosity in 2D fluids arises from the diffusive transport of average particle momentum across the elastic length scale. Moreover, they highlight that shear dynamics are fundamentally governed by localized configurational excitations within the atomic connectivity network.</description>

      <title>The crack pattern of indented cohesive granular media</title>

Abstract: Cohesive granular materials, like wet sand, retain their shape before yielding under stress. This solid-like behavior is associated with elasticity. As the loading increases, the material typically flows. However, cohesive materials can also develop cracks, similar to those observed in brittle materials. This study explores the formation of cracks during the indentation of a granular pile. A solid cylindrical indenter is pushed quasi-statically into the wet granular medium, causing radial cracks to appear. These cracks resemble mode I cracks observed in brittle solid materials. We characterize the crack pattern through direct observation and three-dimensional X-ray micro-tomography. Notably, we highlight the correlation between the dilation of the material during shearing and the appearance of cracks.</description>

      <title>Coarse-grained graph architectures for all-atom force predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01058v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a machine-learning framework termed coarse-grained all-atom force field (CGAA-FF), which incorporates coarse-grained message passing within an all-atom force field using equivariant nature of graph models. The CGAA-FF model employs grain embedding to encode atomistic coordinates into nodes representing grains rather than individual atoms, enabling predictions of both grain-level energies and atom-level forces. Tested on organic electrolytes, CGAA-FF achieves root-mean-square errors of 4.96 meV atom-1 for energy and 0.201 eV A-1 for force predictions. CGAA-FF significantly reduces computational costs, achieving about 22- and 14-fold improvements in simulation speed and memory efficiency, respectively, compared to the all-atom potential (SevenNet-0). Since this CGAA framework can be integrated into any equivariant architecture, we believe this work opens the door to efficient all-atom simulations of soft-matter systems.</description>

      <title>General Hamiltonian description of nonreciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05246v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active colloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in general nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy function, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we overcome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes auxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian yields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics based on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the original Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY spins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent to our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of Hamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a periodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a chain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal pairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual and methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian dynamics to nonreciprocal systems.</description>
