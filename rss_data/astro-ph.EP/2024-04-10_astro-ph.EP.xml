      <title>Atmospheric characterisation and tighter constraints on the orbital misalignment of WASP-94 A b with HARPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high spectral resolution observations of the hot Jupiter WASP-94 A b using the HARPS instrument on ESO's 3.6m telescope in La Silla, Chile. We probed for Na absorption in its atmosphere as well as constrained the previously reported misaligned retrograde orbit using the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. Additionally, we undertook a combined atmospheric retrieval analysis with previously published low-resolution data. We confirm the retrograde orbit as well as constrain the orbital misalignment with our measurement of a projected spin-orbit obliquity of $\lambda = 123.0 \pm 3.0 ^\circ$. We find a tentative detection of Na absorption in the atmosphere of WASP-94 A b, independent of the treatment of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect in our analysis (3.6$\sigma$ and 4.4$\sigma$). We combine our HARPS high resolution data with low resolution data from the literature and find that while the posterior distribution of the Na abundance results in a tighter constraint than using a single data set, the detection significance does not improve (3.2$\sigma$), which we attribute to degeneracies between the low and high resolution data.</description>

      <title>Differences between Stable and Unstable Architectures of Compact Planetary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a stability analysis of a large set of simulated planetary systems of three or more planets based on architectures of multiplanet systems discovered by \textit{Kepler} and \textit{K2}. We propagated 21,400 simulated planetary systems up to 5 billion orbits of the innermost planet; approximately 13% of these simulations ended in a planet-planet collision within that timespan. We examined trends in dynamical stability based on dynamical spacings, orbital period ratios, and mass ratios of nearest-neighbor planets as well as the system-wide planet mass distribution and the spectral fraction describing the system's short-term evolution. We find that instability is more likely in planetary systems with adjacent planet pairs that have period ratios less than two and in systems of greater variance of planet masses. Systems with planet pairs at very small dynamical spacings (less than $\sim10-12$ mutual Hill radius) are also prone to instabilities, but instabilities also occur at much larger planetary separations. We find that a large spectral fraction (calculated from short integrations) is a reasonable predictor of longer-term dynamical instability; systems that have a large number of Fourier components in their eccentricity vectors are prone to secular chaos and subsequent eccentricity growth and instabilities.</description>

      <title>Constraints on atmospheric water abundance and cloud deck pressure in the warm Neptune GJ 3470 b via CARMENES transmission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations of cooler atmospheres of super-Earths and Neptune sized objects often show flat transmission spectra. The most likely cause of this trend is the presence of aerosols (i.e. clouds and hazes) in the atmospheres of such objects. High-resolution spectroscopy provides an opportunity to test this hypothesis by targeting molecular species whose spectral line cores extend above the level of such opaque decks. In this work, we analyse high-resolution infrared observations of the warm Neptune GJ 3470 b taken over two transits using CARMENES (R $\sim$ 80,000) and look for signatures of H$_2$O (previously detected using HST WFC3+Spitzer observations) in these transits with a custom pipeline fully accounting for the effects of data cleaning on any potential exoplanet signal. We find that our data are potentially able to weakly detect ($\sim3\sigma$) an injected signal equivalent to the best-fit model from previous HST WFC3+Spitzer observations. However, we do not make a significant detection using the actual observations. Using a Bayesian framework to simultaneously constrain the H$_2$O Volume Mixing Ratio (VMR) and the cloud top pressure level, we select a family of models compatible with the non detection. These are either very high VMR, cloud-free models, solar-abundance models with a high cloud deck, or sub-solar abundance models with a moderate cloud deck. This is a broader range compared to published results from low-resolution spectroscopy, but is also compatible with them at a 1$\sigma$ level.</description>

      <title>JWST Spectrophotometry of the Small Satellites of Uranus and Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use 1.4-4.6 micron multi-band photometry of the small inner Uranian and Neptunian satellites obtained with the James Webb Space Telescope's near-infrared imager NIRCam to characterize their surface compositions. We find that the satellites of the ice giants have, to first-order, similar compositions to one another, with a 3.0 micron absorption feature possibly associated with an O-H stretch, indicative of water ice or hydrated minerals. Additionally, the spectrophotometry for the small ice giant satellites matches spectra of some Neptune Trojans and excited Kuiper belt objects, suggesting shared properties. Future spectroscopy of these small satellites is necessary to identify and better constrain their specific surface compositions.</description>

      <title>Star-planet interaction and its impact on the stellar rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar rotation has an essential role in modifying the structure of the star and, therefore, the way these different interplays arise. On the other hand, changes in orbits impact the star's rotation and its evolution. The evolution of the star's rotation accounts for the angular momentum exchange with the planet and follows the effects of the internal transport of angular momentum and metallicity. Several models in the literature have aimed to find a theoretical way to study these interactions between the planet's orbital evolution and the star's rotation. Our work is a promising attempt to investigate these interactions from a model based on a new statistical approach. To this end, we propose a ``tidal interaction index'' that carries all the parameters of the star-planet system that can affect the transport of angular momentum and, consequently, the evolution of stellar rotation. This index is similar to the ``magnetic braking index'' whose most successful value equals 3, which expresses the seminal Skumunich law. Our model is computed for masses of the host star less than the Kraft limit for three orbital-rotation period regimes and the semi-major axis less than 1 AU. We consider planets with masses between 0.4M$_{\oplus}$ and 20M$_{\rm J}$ with orbital periods between 0.3 and 225 days. We show that the tidal index $q$ segregated by stellar mass without wind magnetic braking during the main-sequence phase is strongly anti-correlated with planetary mass. Finally, we conclude that in cases where planets retain less than 84\% of the total angular momentum within the system, the magnetic braking mechanism proves to be more effective than tidal interactions, irrespective of whether the planets' angular momentum surpasses that of the host star.</description>

      <title>Relative Occurrence Rate Between Hot and Cold Jupiters as an Indicator to Probe Planet Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a second-order statistic parameter $\varepsilon$, the relative occurrence rate between hot and cold Jupiters ($\varepsilon=\eta_{\rm HJ}/\eta_{\rm CJ}$), to probe the migration of gas giants. Since the planet occurrence rate is the combined outcome of the formation and migration processes, a joint analysis of hot and cold Jupiter frequency may shed light on the dynamical evolution of giant planet systems. We first investigate the behavior of $\varepsilon$ as the stellar mass changes observationally. Based on the occurrence rate measurements of hot Jupiters ($\eta_{\rm HJ}$) from the TESS survey and cold Jupiters ($\eta_{\rm CJ}$) from the CLS survey, we find a tentative trend (97% confidence) that $\varepsilon$ drops when the stellar mass rises from $0.8$ to $1.4\ M_\odot$, which can be explained by different giant planet growth and disk migration timescales around different stars. We carry out planetesimal and pebble accretion simulations, both of which could reproduce the results of $\eta_{\rm HJ}$, $\eta_{\rm CJ}$ and $\varepsilon$. Our findings indicate that the classical core accretion + disk migration model can explain the observed decreasing trend of $\varepsilon$. We propose two ways to increase the significance of the trend and verify the anti-correlation. Future works are required to better constrain $\varepsilon$, especially for M dwarfs and for more massive stars.</description>

      <title>Mid-Infrared Spectrum of the Disk around the Forming Companion GQ Lup B Revealed by JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GQ Lup B is a forming brown dwarf companion ($M\sim10-30~M_J$) showing evidence for an infrared excess associated with a disk surronding the companion itself. Here we present mid-infrared (MIR) observations of GQ Lup B with the Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) on JWST, spanning $4.8-11.7~\mu$m. We remove the stellar contamination using reference differential imaging based on principal component analysis (PCA), demonstrating that the MRS can perform high-contrast science. Our observations provide a sensitive probe of the disk surrounding GQ Lup B. We find no sign of a silicate feature, similar to other disk surrounding very low mass objects, which likely implies significant grain growth ($a_{\mathrm{min}}\gtrsim5~\mu$m), and potentially dust settling. Additionally, we find that if the emission is dominated by an inner wall, the disk around the companion might have an inner cavity larger than the one set by sublimation. Conversely, if our data probe the emission from a thin flat disk, we find the disk to be very compact. More observations are required to confirm this finding and assess the vertical structure of the disk. This approach paves the path to the future study of circumplanetary disks and their physical properties. Our results demonstrate that MIR spectroscopic observations can reveal the physical characteristics of disks around forming companions, providing unique insights into the formation of giant planets, brown dwarfs and their satellites.</description>

      <title>Polluting White Dwarfs with Oort Cloud Comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations point to old white dwarfs (WDs) accreting metals at a relatively constant rate over 8~Gyrs. Exo-Oort clouds around WDs have been proposed as potential reservoirs of materials, with galactic tide as a mechanism to deliver distant comets to the WD's Roche limit. In this work, we characterise the dynamics of comets around a WD with a companion having semi-major axes on the orders of 10 - 100 AU. We develop simulation techniques capable of integrating a large number ($10^8$) of objects over a 1 Gyr timescale. Our simulations include galactic tide and are capable of resolving close-interactions with a massive companion. Through simulations, we study the accretion rate of exo-Oort cloud comets into a WD's Roche limit. We also characterise the dynamics of precession and scattering induced on a comet by a massive companion. We find that (i) WD pollution by an exo-Oort cloud can be sustained over a Gyr timescale, (ii) an exo-Oort cloud with structure like our own Solar System's is capable of delivering materials into an isolated WD with pollution rate $\sim 10^8 \mathrm{~g~s^{-1}}$, (iii) adding a planetary-mass companion reduces the pollution rate to $\sim 10^7 \mathrm{~g~s^{-1}}$, and (iv) if the companion is stellar-mass, with $M_p \gtrsim 0.1 M_\odot$, the pollution rate reduces to $\sim 3 \times 10^5 \mathrm{~g~s^{-1}}$ due to a combination of precession induced on a comet by the companion, a strong scattering barrier, and low-likelihood of direct collisions of comets with the companion.</description>

      <title>An efficient tidal dissipation mechanism via stellar magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work suggests that inwardly propagating internal gravity waves (IGWs) within a star can be fully converted to outward magnetic waves (MWs) if they encounter a sufficiently strong magnetic field. The resulting magnetic waves dissipate as they propagate outward to regions with lower Alfv\'{e}n velocity. While tidal forcing is known to excite IGWs, this conversion and subsequent damping of magnetic waves has not been explored as a tidal dissipation mechanism. In particular, stars with sufficiently strong magnetic fields could fully dissipate tidally excited waves, yielding the same tidal evolution as the previously-studied ``travelling wave regime''. Here, we evaluate the viability of this mechanism using stellar models of stars with convective cores (F-type stars in the mass range of $1.2$-$1.6M_\odot$) which were previously thought to be weakly tidally dissipative (due to the absence of nonlinear gravity wave breaking). The criterion for wave conversion to operate is evaluated for each stellar mass using the properties of each star's interior along with estimates of the magnetic field produced by a convective core dynamo under the assumption of equipartition between kinetic (convective) and magnetic energies. Our main result is that this previously unexplored source of efficient tidal dissipation can operate in stars within this mass range for significant fractions of their lifetimes. This tidal dissipation mechanism appears to be consistent with the observed inspiral of WASP-12b, and more generally could play an important role in the orbital evolution of hot Jupiters -- and to lower mass ultra-short period planets -- orbiting F-type stars.</description>

Abstract: Utilizing high-cadence and continuous g- and r-band data over three nights acquired from the 3.6-meter Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) aimed to find short-duration microlensing events, we conduct a systematic search for variables, transients, and asteroids across a $\sim1^\circ$ field of view of the Andromeda Galaxy (M 31). We present a catalog of 5859 variable stars, yielding the most extensive compilation of short-period variable sources of M 31. We also detected 19 flares, predominantly associated with foreground M dwarfs in the Milky Way. In addition, we discovered 17 previously unknown asteroid candidates, and we subsequently reported them to the Minor Planet Center. Lastly, we report a microlensing event candidate C-ML-1 and present a preliminary analysis.</description>

      <title>Tianyu: search for the second solar system and explore the dynamic universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Giant planets like Jupiter and Saturn, play important roles in the formation and habitability of Earth-like planets. The detection of solar system analogs that have multiple cold giant planets is essential for our understanding of planet habitability and planet formation. Although transit surveys such as Kepler and TESS have discovered thousands of exoplanets, these missions are not sensitive to long period planets due to their limited observation baseline. The Tianyu project, comprising two 1-meter telescopes (Tianyu-I and II), is designed to detect transiting cold giant planets in order to find solar system analogs. Featuring a large field of view and equipped with a high-speed CMOS camera, Tianyu-I will perform a high-precision photometric survey of about 100 million stars, measuring light curves at hour-long cadence. The candidates found by Tianyu-I will be confirmed by Tianyu-II and other surveys and follow-up facilities through multi-band photometry, spectroscopy, and high resolution imaging. Tianyu telescopes will be situated at an elevation about 4000 meters in Lenghu, China. With a photometric precision of 1% for stars with V &lt; 18 mag, Tianyu is expected to find more than 300 transiting exoplanets, including about 12 cold giant planets, over five years. A five-year survey of Tianyu would discover 1-2 solar system analogs. Moreover, Tianyu is also designed for non-exoplanetary exploration, incorporating multiple survey modes covering timescales from sub-seconds to months, with a particular emphasis on events occurring within the sub-second to hour range. It excels in observing areas such as infant supernovae, rare variable stars and binaries, tidal disruption events, Be stars, cometary activities, and interstellar objects. These discoveries not only enhance our comprehension of the universe but also offer compelling opportunities for public engagement in scientific exploration.</description>
