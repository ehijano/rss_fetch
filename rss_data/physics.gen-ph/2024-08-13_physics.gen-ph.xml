      <title>A note on diffeomorphism-invariance in gravitational field equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of diffeomorphism invariance and general covariance are conceptually delicate issues for the field equations and the actions. A thorough study on the original Einstein field equation and its two modifications by Einstein is presented. It is concluded that the cosmological constant and the unimodular condition are independent concepts, and the unimodular condition has no direct role in the derivation of the traceless field equation. Unimodular gravity with unambiguous action does not exist, and the derivation of traceless equation from the action principle is an open question.</description>

      <title>A new theory of tensor-scalar gravity coupled to Aharonov-Bohm electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor-scalar theories of gravitation are commonly employed as extensions of General Relativity that allow to describe a much wider phenomenology. They are also naturally generated as low energy limit of higher-dimensional or unified theories, and the gravitational scalar components can represent quantum corrections to the Einstein theory. The coupling of the scalars to an e.m. field does not introduce any relevant new physics if the e.m. action has the usual Maxwell form, implying a vanishing trace of the e.m. energy-momentum tensor. In the case of the extended Aharonov-Bohm electrodynamics some interesting new situations are possible, which in this work are analyzed in the gravitational weak-field approximation and for a basic version of tensor-scalar gravity involving only a Brans-Dicke field plus another scalar. Since the Aharonov-Bohm theory differs from Maxwell theory only in the presence of anomalous sources with local violation of charge conservation, which is thought to be possible only at a quantum level, the resulting formal framework can be useful to model interactions between gravitation and physical systems with macroscopic quantization. The theory contains some unknown parameters, the most important being the VEV $\psi_0$ of the second gravitational scalar and the level $\gamma$ of violation of local charge conservation in the e.m. sector. An attempt is done to relate these parameters to some experimental constraints. However, there is presently much space left for uncertainty.</description>

      <title>3-SAT solver for two-way quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While quantum computers assume existence of state preparation process $|0\rangle$, CPT symmetry of physics says that performing such process in CPT symmetry perspective, e.g. reversing used EM impulses ($V(t)\to V(-t)$), we should get its symmetric analog $\langle 0|$, referred here as state postparation - which should provide results as postselection, but with higher success rate. Two-way quantum computers (2WQC) assume having both $|0\rangle$ and $\langle 0|$ pre and postparation. In theory they allow to solve NP problems, however, basic approach would be more difficult than Shor algorithm, which is now far from being practical. This article discusses approach to make practical 2WQC 3-SAT solver, requiring exponential reduction of error rate, what should be achievable through linear increase of the numbers of gates. 2WQC also provides additional error correction capabilities, like more stable Grover algorithm, or mid-circuit enforcement of syndrome to zero, like proposed equalizer enforcing qubit equality.</description>

      <title>From new thermodynamics to classical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The laws of classical mechanics are rebuilt in the frame of new thermodynamics. Heat is the sum of kinetic energy, system work, and system potential of gas, while force is the linear gradients of heat variation. Exporters and importers of force are evident in terms of exotherm and endotherm. Temperature and volume gradients create asymmetric forces driving rotation and spin (self-rotation). It verifies that force transfer does not need a medium. As an outstanding achievement, a succinct and general equation is derived to predict the equilibrium distance of molecular interaction without using any assumption, such as van der Waals force and dispersion force. In addition, the origins and attributes of repulsion and attraction are disclosed. Predicting results are applausive. For example, at 298 K, Le for N2, O2, and CH4 are 3.11, 3.11, and 3.68 A, comparable to the data adopted in MD simulations of the literature. All these results indicate that the world is created by evaporation (sublimation)-condensation. It is believed that all objects, from tiny atoms to giant objects like planets, are thermal equilibrium systems. The new thermodynamics can describe them from the internal structure to the outer behaviors.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the Mystery of Quantum Measurement with A New Space-Time Approach to Relativistic Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.01026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.01026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum measurement is a fundamental concept in the field of quantum mechanics. The action of quantum measurement, leading the superposition state of the measured quantum system into a definite output state, not only reconciles contradictions between quantum and classical mechanics but also facilitates quantum state manipulations, including reading and resetting. Despite its significance, four fundamental issues -- randomness, instantaneousness, irreversibility, and preferred-basis -- continue to pose significant challenges to the broader application of quantum measurement and our overall understanding of quantum mechanics. In this work, we employ a new space-time approach to relativistic quantum mechanics to address these issues systematically. Our approach provides a comprehensive elucidation of the intricate connections between quantum measurement and quantum unitary evolution, as well as an in-depth analysis for the interdependence of non-local correlations and relativistic theories. We thereby reveal a more fundamental dynamical theory, beyond the traditional time-evolution equation in quantum mechanics, where the axioms of quantum measurement naturally emerge as a corollary. These findings contribute to the advancement of related fields, and our work holds potential implications for future research and applications in the realm of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of an $E_8$ model of elementary particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are many ways to embed the Lie groups of the Standard Model of Particle Physics in a Lie group of type $E_8$, but so far there is no convincing demonstration that the finite symmetries (and asymmetries) of weak hypercharge, three generations of electrons, three quarks in a proton, and photon polarisation can also be embedded correctly. I show that there is a unique way to embed these finite symmetries consistently, and that the gauge groups of the Standard Model are then uniquely determined. The model is automatically chiral, and the generation symmetry acts as a rotation in a real 2-space, so that the spinors for three generations have only twice as many degrees of freedom in total as the spinors for a single generation. In fact, two distinct generation symmetries arise from the restriction to the Standard Model, related by the CKM and/or PMNS matrices. It therefore appears that these two matrices are not independent. I further speculate on the implications for quantum gravity.</description>
