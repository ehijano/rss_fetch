      <title>Effect of vehicle groups on heterogeneous disordered traffic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In heterogeneous disordered traffic, where various vehicle types operate without strict lane discipline, self-organized vehicle groups often emerge. While the formation of such groups has been recognized, their influence on macroscopic traffic dynamics remains unclear. This study investigates how the prevalence and composition of vehicle groups affect flow-density relationships in heterogeneous disordered traffic. Using trajectory data from real-world video observations, we apply three distinct Passenger Car Unit (PCU) estimation methods to construct flow-density diagrams that account for traffic heterogeneity. The analysis reveals that group proportions, i.e., the proportion of vehicles that are classified as belonging to groups, have a nonlinear and traffic-situation-dependent impact on flow characteristics. Specifically, moderate group proportions (30-60%) are associated with higher flow rates in medium- and high-density conditions, whereas proportions exceeding 50% correspond to skewed traffic distributions toward low- or high-density extremes. Comparisons between vehicle-count-based and PCU-based group proportions indicate that normalization methods significantly affect the interpretation of group dynamics, particularly when groups consist mainly of small-PCU vehicles such as motorcycles. Additionally, lower group proportions enhance flow under free-flow conditions, while the entropy-based analysis indicates that the association between entropy alone and speed is not consistently observed across traffic situations. By contrasting representative trends and extreme high-flow cases, the results further suggest that traffic under similar density and group-proportion conditions can exhibit low-efficiency and high-efficiency modes.</description>

      <title>Beyond Individual Influence: The Role of Echo Chambers and Community Seeding in the Multilayer three state q-Voter Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The diffusion of complex opinions is severely hindered in multilayer social networks by echo chambers and cognitive consistency mechanisms. We investigate Influence Maximization strategies within the 3-state multilayer q-voter model. Utilizing the mABCD benchmark, we simulate social environments ranging from integrated Open Worlds to segregated Fortress Worlds. Our results reveal a topological paradox that we term the "Fortress Trap". In highly modular networks, strategies maximizing local density such as Clique Influence Maximization (CIM) and k-Shell fail to trigger global cascades, creating isolated bunkers of consensus due to the Overkill Effect. Furthermore, we identify a Redundancy Trap in perfectly aligned Clan topologies, where the structural overlap of layers creates a "Perfect Prison," rendering it the most resistant environment to diffusion. We demonstrate that VoteRank, a strategy that prioritizes diversity of reach over local intensity, consistently outperforms structure-based methods. These findings suggest that, for complex contagion, maximizing topological entropy is more effective than reinforcing local clusters.</description>

      <title>The Statistical Signature of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models generate text through probabilistic sampling from high-dimensional distributions, yet how this process reshapes the structural statistical organization of language remains incompletely characterized. Here we show that lossless compression provides a simple, model-agnostic measure of statistical regularity that differentiates generative regimes directly from surface text. We analyze compression behavior across three progressively more complex information ecosystems: controlled human-LLM continuations, generative mediation of a knowledge infrastructure (Wikipedia vs. Grokipedia), and fully synthetic social interaction environments (Moltbook vs. Reddit). Across settings, compression reveals a persistent structural signature of probabilistic generation. In controlled and mediated contexts, LLM-produced language exhibits higher structural regularity and compressibility than human-written text, consistent with a concentration of output within highly recurrent statistical patterns. However, this signature shows scale dependence: in fragmented interaction environments the separation attenuates, suggesting a fundamental limit to surface-level distinguishability at small scales. This compressibility-based separation emerges consistently across models, tasks, and domains and can be observed directly from surface text without relying on model internals or semantic evaluation. Overall, our findings introduce a simple and robust framework for quantifying how generative systems reshape textual production, offering a structural perspective on the evolving complexity of communication.</description>

      <title>A nonconservative kinetic framework for a closed-market society subject to shock events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, several events have shockingly impacted society, carrying tough consequences. However, not all individuals are similarly affected by shock events. Among other factors, the consequences can vary depending on the income class. In our presented work, the approach typical of kinetic theory is used to analyze the dynamics of a closed-market society exposed to various types of shock events. To achieve this, we introduce non-conservative equations, incorporating proliferative and destructive binary interactions as well as external actions. Specifically, the latter term reproduces the shock events, and to accomplish this, we introduce an appropriate external force field into the kinetic framework, modeled using Gaussian functions. Several numerical simulations are presented to illustrate the behavior of the solution predicted by the model and an application in comparison to real data relative to the Hurricane Katrina catastrophe is carried out.</description>

      <title>Self-reinforcing cascades: A spreading model for beliefs or products of varying intensity or quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00714v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of how things spread often assume that transmission mechanisms are fixed over time. However, social contagions--the spread of ideas, beliefs, innovations--can lose or gain in momentum as they spread: ideas can get reinforced, beliefs strengthened, products refined. We study the impacts of such self-reinforcement mechanisms in cascade dynamics. We use different mathematical modeling techniques to capture the recursive, yet changing nature of the process. We find a critical regime with a range of power-law cascade size distributions with non-universal scaling exponents. This regime clashes with classic models, where criticality requires fine tuning at a precise critical point. Self-reinforced cascades produce critical-like behavior over a wide range of parameters, which may help explain the ubiquity of power-law distributions in empirical social data.</description>

      <title>Generating temporal networks with the Ascona model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a queueing-based sampling framework for continuous-time temporal networks. We focus on a Markovian parametrization in which link start times follow a homogeneous Poisson process and link durations are exponentially distributed. We derive stochastic properties of the resulting link streams and exploit them to generate synthetic temporal networks with controllable smoothness and prescribed event patterns, relevant for the validation and interpretation of methods for community, scale, change-point, and periodicity detection. By coupling this temporal mechanism with block-structured endpoint distributions, we obtain a continuous-time analogue of stochastic block models. We also discuss extensions of the framework, including discrete-time and instantaneous-contact limits.</description>

      <title>Technological Understanding: On the cognitive skill involved in the design and use of technological artefacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although several accounts of scientific understanding exist, the concept of understanding in relation to technology remains underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a philosophical account of technological understanding: the type of understanding that is required for and reflected by successfully designing and using technological artefacts. We develop this notion by building on the concept of scientific understanding. Drawing on parallels between science and technology, and specifically between scientific theories and technological artefacts, we extend the idea of scientific understanding into the realm of technology. We argue that, just as scientific understanding involves the ability to explain a phenomenon using a theory, technological understanding involves the ability to use a technological artefact to realise a practical aim. Both theories and artefacts are tools, and using them successfully requires the cognitive skill of understanding. Technological understanding is thus conceived as the ability to recognise how a practical aim can be achieved by using a technological artefact. In a context of design, this general notion of technological understanding is specified as the ability to design an artefact that, by producing a phenomenon through its physical structure, achieves the intended aim. By analogy with De Regt's criterion of the intelligibility of theories, we give, as a precondition for technological understanding, a criterion for the intelligibility of a technological artefact. We illustrate our concept of technological understanding through two running examples: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and superconducting quantum computers. Our account highlights the epistemic dimension of engaging with technology and, by allowing for context-dependent specifications, provides guidance for testing and improving technological understanding in specific contexts.</description>
