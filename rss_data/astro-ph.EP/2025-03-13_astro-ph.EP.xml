      <title>Low 4.5 {\mu}m Dayside Emission Disfavors a Dark Bare-Rock scenario for the Hot Super-Earth TOI-431 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The full range of conditions under which rocky planets can host atmospheres remains poorly understood, especially in the regime of close-in orbits around late-type stars. One way to assess the presence of atmospheres on rocky exoplanets is to measure their dayside emission as they are eclipsed by their host stars. Here, we present Spitzer observations of the 4.5 $\mu$m secondary eclipses of the rocky super-Earth TOI-431 b, whose mass and radius indicate an Earth-like bulk composition (3.07 $\pm$ 0.35 M$_{\oplus}$, 1.28 $\pm$ 0.04 R$_{\oplus}$). Exposed to more than 2000 times the irradiation of Earth, dayside temperatures of up to 2400K are expected if the planet is a dark bare-rock without a significant atmosphere. Intriguingly, despite the strong stellar insolation, we measure a secondary eclipse depth of only 33 $\pm$ 22 ppm, which corresponds to a dayside brightness temperature of $1520_{-390}^{+360}$K. This notably low eclipse depth disagrees with the dark bare-rock scenario at the 2.5$\sigma$ level, and suggests either that the planet is surrounded by an atmosphere, or that it is a bare-rock with a highly reflective surface. In the atmosphere scenario, the low dayside emission implies the efficient redistribution of heat to the nightside, or by molecular absorption in the 4-5 $\mu$m bandpass. In the bare-rock scenario, a surface composition made of a high-albedo mineral species such as ultramafic rock can lead to reduced thermal emission consistent with low eclipse depth measurement. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the James Webb Space Telescope hold the key to constraining the nature of the planet.</description>

      <title>Improved Carbon and Nitrogen Isotopic Ratios for CH$_3$CN in Titan's Atmosphere Using ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Titan, Saturn's largest satellite, maintains an atmosphere composed primarily of nitrogen (N$_2$) and methane (CH$_4$) that leads to a complex organic chemistry. Some of the nitriles (CN-bearing organics) on Titan are known to have substantially enhanced $^{15}$N abundances compared to Earth and to Titan's dominant nitrogen (N$_2$) reservoir. The $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N isotopic ratio in Titan's nitriles can provide better constraints on the synthesis of nitrogen-bearing organics in planetary atmospheres as well as insights into the origin of Titan's large nitrogen abundance. Using high signal-to-noise ratio ($&gt;13$), disk-integrated observations obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 receiver (211-275 GHz), we measure the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N and $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C isotopic ratios of acetonitrile (CH$_3$CN) in Titan's stratosphere. Using the Nonlinear optimal Estimator for MultivariatE spectral analySIS (NEMESIS), we derived the CH$_3$CN/$^{13}$CH$_3$CN ratio to be 89.2 $\pm$ 7.0 and the CH$_3$CN/CH$_3$$^{13}$CN ratio to be 91.2 $\pm$ 6.0, in agreement with the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratio in Titan's methane, and other Solar System species. We found the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N isotopic ratio to be 68.9 $\pm$ 4.2, consistent with previously derived values for HCN and HC$_3$N, confirming an enhanced $^{15}$N abundance in Titan's nitriles compared with the bulk atmospheric N$_2$ value of $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N = 168, in agreement with chemical models incorporating isotope-selective photodissociation of N$_2$ at high altitudes.</description>

      <title>Dust shells and dark linear structures on dust tails of historical and recent long-period comets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Dust halos or shells, along with linear dark structures along the axes of dust tails, are commonly observed in many long-period comets near perihelion. Examples range from the recent C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) to historical comets such as the Great Comet of 1874, C/1874 H1 (Coggia).
  Aims. While dust halos can readily be modeled as spin-modulated activity originating from the comet nucleus, their possible connection to those dark linear features has, to our knowledge, not been investigated. The aim of this paper is to shed light on the formation of these remarkable structures by modeling a sample of six long-period comets, using similar dust physical properties and ejection parameters, to explore whether they share a common origin.
  Methods. To model the dust features, we employed a Monte Carlo procedure to generate synthetic images. The particles ejected from the comet nucleus follow a power-law size distribution and are released into interplanetary space at speeds determined by the ratio of solar radiation pressure to solar gravity, the heliocentric distance, and, as a new feature of the code, the solar zenith angle at the emission point.
  Results. We demonstrate that, in all the cases analyzed, the dust shells form as a result of short-term events characterized by cyclically varying ejection of very small particles from large surface areas on the rotating nucleus. These events are triggered as these areas become freshly exposed to solar radiation near perihelion due to the high obliquity of the spin axes of their nuclei. The dark linear stripes along the tail axes may arise from a specific dependence of the ejection speeds on the square root of the cosine of the zenith angle, as is predicted by hydrodynamical modeling, but their presence is also dependent on the extent of the latitude region of emission that defines the velocity vector field.</description>

      <title>Beyond monoculture: polydisperse moment methods for sub-stellar atmosphere cloud microphysics I. Examining properties of the exponential distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observational data provided by JWST instruments continue to challenge theories and models of cloud formation in sub-stellar atmospheres, requiring more sophisticated approaches in an effort to understand their spatial complexity. However, to date, most cloud microphysical models using the moment method for sub-stellar atmospheres have assumed a monodisperse size distribution, neglecting polydisperse properties. We aim to extend beyond the common assumption of a monodisperse size distribution and analyse cloud microphysical processes assuming an exponential distribution. We derive expressions for the zeroth and first moments of condensation/evaporation and collisional growth processes under the assumption of an exponential size distribution. We then compare the differences between monodisperse and exponential distribution microphysics using a simple one-dimensional (1D) column model applied to a Y-dwarf KCl cloud scenario. We find that adopting an exponential distribution modifies condensation/evaporation rates by a factor of $\approx$0.9 and collisional growth rates by factors of $\approx$1.1 (Kn $\ll$ 1) and $\approx$0.92 (Kn $\gg$ 1) for Brownian coagulation and $\approx$0.85 for gravitational coalescence, compared to the monodisperse case. In our specific test cases, we find relative differences of a maximum 10-12% in total number density and 2-3% in mean radius of the cloud particles between the monodisperse and exponential distributions. Our results offer a simple way to take into account an assumed exponential size distribution for sub-stellar atmospheric cloud microphysics using the two-moment method. In follow up studies, we will examine more complex distributions, such as the log-normal and gamma distributions, that require more than two moments to characterise self-consistently.</description>

      <title>C3PO IV: co-natal stars depleted in refractories are magnetically more active -- possible imprints of planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chemical abundance anomalies in twin stars have recently been considered tell-tale signs of interactions between stars and planets. While such signals are prevalent, their nature remains a subject of debate. On one hand, exoplanet formation may induce chemical depletion in host stars by locking up refractory elements. On the other hand, exoplanet engulfment can result in chemical enrichment, both processes potentially producing similar differential signals. In this study, we aim to observationally disentangle these processes by using the Ca II infrared triplet to measure the magnetic activity of 125 co-moving star pairs with high SNR, high-resolution spectra from the Magellan, Keck, and VLT telescopes. We find that co-natal star pairs in which the two stars exhibit significant chemical abundance differences also show differences in their magnetic activity, with stars depleted in refractories being magnetically more active. Furthermore, the strength of this correlation between differential chemical abundances and differential magnetic activity increases with condensation temperature. One possible explanation is that the chemical anomaly signature may be linked to planet formation, wherein refractory elements are locked into planets, and the host stars become more active due to more efficient contraction during the pre-main-sequence phase or star-planet tidal and magnetic interactions.</description>

      <title>Transit Timing Variations of the Sub-Saturn Exoplanet HAT-P-12b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Transit Timing Variations (TTVs) of HAT-P-12b, a low-density sub-Saturn mass planet orbiting a metal-poor K4 dwarf star. Using 14 years of observational data (2009-2022), our study incorporates 7 new ground-based photometric transit observations, three sectors of Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data, and 23 previously published light curves. A total of 46 light curves were analyzed using various analytical models, such as linear, orbital decay, apsidal precession, and sinusoidal models to investigate the presence of additional planets. The stellar tidal quality factor ($Q_\star' \sim$ 28.4) is lower than the theoretical predictions, making the orbital decay model an unlikely explanation. The apsidal precession model with a $\chi_r^2$ of 4.2 revealed a slight orbital eccentricity (e = 0.0013) and a precession rate of 0.0045 rad/epoch. Frequency analysis using the Generalized Lomb-Scargle (GLS) periodogram identified a significant periodic signal at 0.00415 cycles/day (FAP = 5.1$\times$10$^{-6}$ %), suggesting the influence of an additional planetary companion. The sinusoidal model provides the lowest reduced chi-squared value ($\chi_r^2$) of 3.2. Sinusoidal fitting of the timing residuals estimated this companion to have a mass of approximately 0.02 $M_J$ , assuming it is in a 2:1 Mean-Motion Resonance (MMR) with HAT-P-12b. Additionally, the Applegate mechanism, with an amplitude much smaller than the observed TTV amplitude of 156 s, confirms that stellar activity is not responsible for the observed variations.</description>

      <title>The dearth of high-mass hydrogen-atmosphere metal-polluted white dwarfs within 40 pc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a population synthesis model which addresses the different mass distributions of the metal-polluted and non-metal-polluted hydrogen-atmosphere white dwarfs identified in volume-limited samples. Specifically, metal-pollution has been observed to be rare in white dwarfs more massive than $\approx$0.7 $M_{\odot}$. Our population synthesis model invokes episodic accretion of planetary debris onto a synthetic population of white dwarfs. We find that the observed difference can be explained in the regime where most debris disks last for $10^4$$-$$10^6$ years. This is broadly consistent with observational estimates that disk lifetimes are on the order 10$^5$$-$10$^7$ years. We also invoke an alternate model which explores an upper limit on planetary system formation and survival around the intermediate-mass progenitors of the more massive white dwarfs. In this scenario, we find an upper limit on the polluted white dwarf mass of $M_{\rm wd}&lt;0.72^{+0.07}_{-0.03}$ M$_{\odot}$. This implies an empirical maximum progenitor mass of $M_{\rm ZAMS}^{\rm max}=2.9^{+0.7}_{-0.3}$ M$_{\odot}$. This value is consistent with the maximum reliable host star mass of currently known exoplanet systems. We conclude by imposing these two results on the sample of He-atmosphere white dwarfs within 40\,pc. We find that both scenarios are capable of providing a consistent solution to the full sample of H- and He-atmosphere white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Results from NASA's First Radio Telescope on the Moon: Terrestrial Technosignatures and the Low-Frequency Galactic Background Observed by ROLSES-1 Onboard the Odysseus Lander</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiowave Observations on the Lunar Surface of the photo-Electron Sheath instrument (ROLSES- 1) onboard the Intuitive Machines' Odysseus lunar lander represents NASA's first radio telescope on the Moon, and the first United States spacecraft landing on the lunar surface in five decades. Despite a host of challenges, ROLSES-1 managed to collect a small amount of data over fractions of one day during cruise phase and two days on the lunar surface with four monopole stacer antennas that were in a non-ideal deployment. All antennas recorded shortwave radio transmissions breaking through the Earth's ionosphere -- or terrestrial technosignatures -- from spectral and raw waveform data. These technosignatures appear to be modulated by density fluctuations in the Earth's ionosphere and could be used as markers when searching for extraterrestrial intelligence from habitable exoplanets. After data reduction and marshaling a host of statistical and sampling techniques, five minutes of raw waveforms from the least noisy antenna were used to generate covariances constraining both the antenna parameters and the amplitude of the low-frequency isotropic galactic spectrum. ROLSES- 2 and LuSEE-Night, both lunar radio telescopes launching later in the decade, will have significant upgrades from ROLSES-1 and will be set to take unprecedented measurements of the low-frequency sky, lunar surface, and constrain the cosmological 21-cm signal. ROLSES-1 represents a trailblazer for lunar radio telescopes, and many of the statistical tools and data reduction techniques presented in this work will be invaluable for upcoming lunar radio telescope missions.</description>

      <title>Polarized Signatures of the Earth Through Time: An Outlook for the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for life beyond the Solar System remains a primary goal of current and near-future missions, including NASA's upcoming Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO). However, research into determining the habitability of terrestrial exoplanets has been primarily focused on comparisons to modern-day Earth. Additionally, current characterization strategies focus on the unpolarized flux from these worlds, taking into account only a fraction of the informational content of the reflected light. Better understanding the changes in the reflected light spectrum of the Earth throughout its evolution, as well as analyzing its polarization, will be crucial for mapping its habitability and providing comparison templates to potentially habitable exoplanets. Here we present spectropolarimetric models of the reflected light from the Earth at six epochs across all four geologic eons. We find that the changing surface albedos and atmospheric gas concentrations across the different epochs allow the habitable and non-habitable scenarios to be distinguished, and diagnostic features of clouds and hazes are more noticeable in the polarized signals. We also discuss how using Mie scattering for naturally non-spherical particles, which is a common simplification for exoplanet modeling, affects the resulting planetary signals. Finally, our results suggest that pushing the HWO planet-to-star flux contrast limit down to 1 $\times$ 10$^{-13}$ could allow for the characterization in both unpolarized and polarized light of an Earth-like planet at any stage in its history.</description>
