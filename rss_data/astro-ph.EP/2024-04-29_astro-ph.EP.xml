      <title>A Volume-Limited Radio Search for Magnetic Activity in 140 Exoplanets with the Very Large Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from a search for radio emission in 77 stellar systems hosting 140 exoplanets, predominantly within 17.5 pc using the Very Large Array (VLA) at $4-8$ GHz. This is the largest and most sensitive search to date for radio emission in exoplanetary systems in the GHz frequency range. We obtained new observations of 58 systems, and analyzed archival observations of an additional 19 systems. Our choice of frequency and volume limit are motivated by radio detections of ultracool dwarfs (UCDs), including T dwarfs with masses at the exoplanet threshold of $\sim\!13\,M_J$. Our surveyed exoplanets span a mass range of $\approx\,10^{-3}-10\,M_J$ and semi-major axes of $\approx\,10^{-2}-10\,$AU. We detect a single target - GJ 3323 (M4) hosting two exoplanets with minimum masses of 2 and 2.3$\,M_\oplus$ - with a circular polarization fraction of $\approx\,40\%$; the radio luminosity agrees with its known X-ray luminosity and the G\"udel-Benz relation for stellar activity suggesting a likely stellar origin, but the high circular polarization fraction may also be indicative of star-planet interaction. For the remaining sources our $3\sigma$ upper limits are generally $L_\nu\lesssim\,10^{12.5}\,\mathrm{erg}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\,\mathrm{Hz}^{-1}$, comparable to the lowest radio luminosities in UCDs. Our results are consistent with previous targeted searches of individual systems at GHz frequencies while greatly expanding the sample size. Our sensitivity is comparable to predicted fluxes for some systems considered candidates for detectable star-planet interaction. Observations with future instruments such as the Square Kilometer Array and Next Generation Very Large Array will be necessary to further constrain emission mechanisms from exoplanet systems at GHz frequencies.</description>

      <title>Tau Herculids 2022 from the McDonald Observatory, Texas -- a progress report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As part of an intensive effort to observe the predicted 2022 Tau Herculids outburst, we recorded almost 800 individual meteor streaks on May 30th and 31st, 2022, using a high-sensitivity Sony~$\alpha$7 camera. The video recordings were obtained under perfect conditions at the McDonald Observatory, Texas, USA. The meteor sample is dominated by the predicted Tau Herculids shower, however, we also noted significant activity of sporadic meteors and other possible weak showers. We found that the time of the maximum activity matched very well the predictions, while we note the large fraction of faint meteors that were not detectable visually. We determined the radiant, and the time evolution of the activities and currently we are working on the determination of the brightness statistics.</description>

      <title>Terrestrial planet formation from a ring: long-term simulations accounting for the giant planet instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The process leading to the formation of the terrestrial planet remains elusive. In a previous publication, we have shown that, if the first generation of planetesimals forms in a ring at about 1 AU and the gas disk's density peaks at the ring location, planetary embryos of a few martian masses can grow and remain in the ring. In this work, we extend our simulations beyond the gas-disk stage, covering 200 Myr and accounting for the phase of giant planet instability, assumed to happen at different times. About half of the simulations form a pair of Venus and Earth analogues and, independently, about 10% form a Mars analogue. We find that the timing of the giant planet instability affects statistically the terrestrial system's excitation state and the timing of the last giant impacts. Hence a late instability (about 60 to 100 Myr after the Solar system's birth) is more consistent with a late Moon-formation time, as suggested by radioactive chronometers. However, the late veneer mass (LVM: mass accreted after the last giant impact) of Earth-sized planets suffering a giant impact after 80 My is usually an order of magnitude lower than the value inferred from geochemistry. In addition, the final angular momentum deficit (AMD) of the terrestrial planets tends to be too high. We tested the effect on the final AMD of the generation of debris during collisions and found that it is too small to change these conclusions. We argue that the best-case scenario is that the Moon-forming event occurred between 50 and 80 My, possibly just following the giant planet instability.</description>

      <title>An improved correction of radial-velocity systematic for the SOPHIE spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High precision spectrographs might exhibit temporal variations of their reference velocity or nightly zero point (NZP). One way to monitor the NZP is to measure bright stars, which are assumed to have an intrinsic radial velocity variation much smaller than the instrument's precision. While this method is effective in most cases, it does not fully propagate the uncertainty arising from NZP variations. We present a new method to correct for NZP variations in radial-velocity time series. This method uses Gaussian Processes based on ancillary information to model these systematic effects. It enables us to propagate the uncertainties of this correction into the overall error budget. Another advantage of this approach is that it relies on ancillary data collected simultaneously with the spectra rather than solely on dedicated observations of constant stars. We applied this method to the SOPHIE spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory using a few instrument's housekeeping data, such as the internal pressure and temperature variations. Our results demonstrate that this method effectively models the red noise of constant stars, even with a limited amount of housekeeping data, while preserving the signals of exoplanets. Using both simulations with mock planets and real data, we found that this method improves the false-alarm probability of detections by several orders of magnitude. By simulating numerous planetary signals, we were able to detect up to 10 percent more planets with small amplitude radial velocity signals. We used this new correction to reanalysed the planetary system around HD158259 and improved the detection of the outermost planets. We also suggest decreasing the observing cadence of the constant stars to optimise telescope time for scientific targets.</description>

      <title>The Most Common Habitable Planets III -- Modeling Temperature Forcing and Surface Conditions on Rocky Exoplanets and Exomoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small rocky planets, as well as larger planets that suffered extensive volatile loss, tend to be drier and have thinner atmospheres as compared to Earth. Such planets probably outnumber worlds better endowed with volatiles, being the most common habitable planets. For the subgroup of fast rotators following eccentric orbits, atmospheres suffer radiative forcing and their heat capacity provides a method for gauging atmospheric thickness and surface conditions. We further explore the model presented in a previous paper and apply it to real and hypothetical exoplanets in the habitable zone of various classes of stars, simulating atmospheric and orbital characteristics. For planetary eccentricities e ~0.3, the forcing-induced hypothetical temperature variation would reach ~80 K for airless planets and ~10 K for planets with substantial atmospheres. For Kepler-186 f and Kepler-442 b, assuming e ~0.1, temperature variations can reach ~24 K. We also consider habitable exomoons in circular orbits around gas giants within the habitable zone, which suffer radiative forcing due to their epicyclic motion. We study several combinations of parameters for the characterization of planets (mass, eccentricity and semi-major axis) and exomoons (mass, orbital radius, albedo and atmospheric characteristics) for different stellar types. For e ~0.3, exomoon temperature varies up to ~90 K, while for ~0.6 variations can reach ~200 K. Such exomoons may plausibly retain their volatiles by continued volcanic activity fueled by tidal dissipation. Although currently undetectable, such effects might be within reach of future ELT-class telescopes and space missions with mid-infrared and coronagraphic capabilities.</description>

      <title>The death of Vulcan: NEID reveals the planet candidate orbiting HD 26965 is stellar activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the long-studied radial velocity (RV) target HD26965 using recent observations from the NASA-NSF 'NEID' precision Doppler facility. Leveraging a suite of classical activity indicators, combined with line-by-line RV analyses, we demonstrate that the claimed 45-day signal previously identified as a planet candidate is most likely an activity-induced signal. Correlating the bulk (spectrally-averaged) RV with canonical line activity indicators confirms a multi-day 'lag' between the observed activity indicator time series and the measured RV. When accounting for this lag, we show that much of the observed RV signal can be removed by a linear detrending of the data. Investigating activity at the line-by-line level, we find a depth-dependent correlation between individual line RVs and the bulk RVs, further indicative of periodic suppression of convective blueshift causing the observed RV variability, rather than an orbiting planet. We conclude that the combined evidence of the activity correlations and depth dependence is consistent with a radial velocity signature dominated by a rotationally-modulated activity signal at a period of $\sim$42 days. We hypothesize that this activity signature is due to a combination of spots and convective blueshift suppression. The tools applied in our analysis are broadly applicable to other stars, and could help paint a more comprehensive picture of the manifestations of stellar activity in future Doppler RV surveys.</description>

      <title>Forming Mercury from excited initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mercury is notoriously difficult to form in solar system simulations, due to its small mass and iron-rich composition. Smooth particle hydrodynamics simulations of collisions have found that a Mercury-like body could be formed by one or multiple giant impacts, but due to the chaotic nature of collisions it is difficult to create a scenario where such impacts will take place. Recent work has found more success forming Mercury analogues by adding additional embryos near Mercury's orbit. In this work, we aim to form Mercury by simulating the formation of the solar system in the presence of the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn. We test out the effect of an inner disk of embryos added on to the commonly-used narrow annulus of initial material. We form Mercury analogues with core-mass fractions (CMF) $&gt; 0.4$ in $\sim 10\%$ of our simulations, and twice that number of Mercury analogues form during the formation process, but are unstable and do not last to the end of the simulations. Mercury analogues form at similar rates for both disks with and without an inner component, and most of our Mercury analogues have lower CMF than that of Mercury, $\sim 0.7$, due to significant accretion of debris material. We suggest that a more in-depth understanding of the fraction of debris mass that is lost to collisional grinding is necessary to understand Mercury's formation, or some additional mechanism is required to stop this debris from accreting.</description>

      <title>Precise Mass, Orbital motion and Stellar properties of the M-dwarf binary LP 349-25AB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LP~349$-$25 is a well studied close stellar binary system comprised of two late M dwarf stars, both stars close to the limit between star and brown dwarf. This system was previously identified as a source of GHz radio emission. We observed LP~349$-$25AB in 11 epochs in 2020$-$2022, detecting both components in this nearby binary system using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). We fit simultaneously the VLBA absolute astrometric positions together with existing relative astrometric observations derived from optical/infrared observations with a set of algorithms that use non-linear least-square, Genetic Algorithm and Markov Chain Montecarlo methods to determine the orbital parameters of the two components. We find the masses of the primary and secondary components to be 0.08188 $\pm$ 0.00061 $M\odot$, and 0.06411 $\pm$ 0.00049 $M_\odot$, respectively, representing one of the most precise mass estimates of any UCDs to date. The primary is an UCD of 85.71$\pm$0.64 M$_{Jup}$, while the secondary has a mass consistent with being a Brown Dwarf of 67.11 $\pm$ 0.51 $M_{Jup}$. This is one of the very few direct detections of a Brown Dwarf with VLBA observations. We also find a distance to the binary system of 14.122 $\pm$ 0.057 pc. Using Stellar Evolutionary Models, we find the model-derived stellar parameters of both stars. In particular, we obtain a model-derived age of 262 Myr for the system, which indicates that LP~349$-$25AB is composed of two pre-main-sequence stars. In addition, we find that the secondary star is significantly less evolved that the primary star.</description>

      <title>A new approach to analyse single-site video observations: A Tau Her 2022 case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we present a continuation of the work that was based on video observations of the Tau Her 2022 outburst from the McDonald Observatory, Texas, US. On the night of the maximum in 2022 we detected 626 individual Tau Her meteors, for which we estimated photovisual magnitudes and analysed their distribution on the sky to determine the radiant position in an innovative way. The derived population index is $5.56 \pm 1.83$, while the radiant position for the mid-time of the observations is: $\mathrm{RA} = 209.71 ^\circ \pm 1.01 ^\circ$, $\mathrm{Dec} = 27.73 ^\circ \pm 0.07 ^\circ$. Both measurements are in good agreement with other results in the literature, although our population index seems to be higher than most of the published values. We speculate this might be due to the higher sensitivity of our equipment to fainter meteors.</description>

      <title>X-ray variability of the triplet star system LTT1445 and evaporation history of the exoplanets around its A component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17303v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The high-energy environment of the host stars could be deleterious for their planets. It is crucial to ascertain this contextual information to fully characterize the atmospheres of terrestrial exoplanets. We aim to fully characterize a unique triple system, LTT1445, with three known rocky exoplanets around LTT 1445A. The X-ray irradiation and flaring of this system are studied through a new 50 ks Chandra observation, which is divided into 10 ks, 10 ks, and 30 ks segments conducted two days apart, and two months apart, respectively. This is complemented by an archival Chandra observation approximately one year earlier and repeated observations with eROSITA (extended ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array), the soft X-ray instrument on the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission, enabling the investigation of X-ray flux behavior across multiple time scales. With the observed X-ray flux from the exoplanet host star A, we estimate the photo-evaporation mass loss of each exoplanet. With the planet modeling package, VPLanet, we predict the evolution and anticipated current atmospheric conditions. Our Chandra observations indicate LTT 1445C as the dominant X-ray source, with additional contribution from LTT 1445B. LTT 1445A, a slowly-rotating star, exhibits no significant flare activity in the new Chandra dataset. Comparing the flux incident on the exoplanets, LTT 1445BC components do not pose a greater threat to the planets orbiting LTT 1445A than the emission from A itself. According to the results from the simulation, LTT 1445Ad might have the capacity to retain its water surface.</description>
