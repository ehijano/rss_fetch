      <title>Low degree conjecture implies sharp computational thresholds in stochastic block model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate implications of the (extended) low-degree conjecture (recently formalized in [MW23]) in the context of the symmetric stochastic block model. Assuming the conjecture holds, we establish that no polynomial-time algorithm can weakly recover community labels below the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold. In particular, we rule out polynomial-time estimators that, with constant probability, achieve correlation with the true communities that is significantly better than random. Whereas, above the KS threshold, polynomial-time algorithms are known to achieve constant correlation with the true communities with high probability[Mas14,AS15].
  To our knowledge, we provide the first rigorous evidence for the sharp transition in recovery rate for polynomial-time algorithms at the KS threshold. Notably, under a stronger version of the low-degree conjecture, our lower bound remains valid even when the number of blocks diverges. Furthermore, our results provide evidence of a computational-to-statistical gap in learning the parameters of stochastic block models.
  In contrast to prior work, which either (i) rules out polynomial-time algorithms for hypothesis testing with 1-o(1) success probability [Hopkins18, BBK+21a] under the low-degree conjecture, or (ii) rules out low-degree polynomials for learning the edge connection probability matrix [LG23], our approach provides stronger lower bounds on the recovery and learning problem.
  Our proof combines low-degree lower bounds from [Hopkins18, BBK+21a] with graph splitting and cross-validation techniques. In order to rule out general recovery algorithms, we employ the correlation preserving projection method developed in [HS17].</description>

      <title>On the Hardness of the Drone Delivery Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast shipping and efficient routing are key problems of modern logistics. Building on previous studies that address package delivery from a source node to a destination within a graph using multiple agents (such as vehicles, drones, and ships), we investigate the complexity of this problem in specialized graphs and with restricted agent types, both with and without predefined initial positions. Particularly, in this paper, we aim to minimize the delivery time for delivering a package. To achieve this, we utilize a set of collaborative agents, each capable of traversing a specific subset of the graph and operating at varying speeds. This challenge is encapsulated in the recently introduced Drone Delivery Problem with respect to delivery time (DDT).
  In this work, we show that the DDT with predefined initial positions on a line is NP-hard, even when considering only agents with two distinct speeds. This refines the results presented by Erlebach, et al.[ELS22], who demonstrated the NP-hardness of DDT on a line with agents of arbitrary speeds. Additionally, we examine DDT in grid graphs without predefined initial positions, where each drone can freely choose its starting position. We show that the problem is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of $O(n^{1-\varepsilon}$), where $n$ is the size of the grid, even when all agents are restricted to two different speeds as well as rectangular movement areas. We conclude by providing an easy $O(n)$ approximation algorithm.</description>

      <title>List Decoding Quotient Reed-Muller Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reed-Muller codes consist of evaluations of $n$-variate polynomials over a finite field $\mathbb{F}$ with degree at most $d$. Much like every linear code, Reed-Muller codes can be characterized by constraints, where a codeword is valid if and only if it satisfies all \emph{degree-$d$} constraints.
  For a subset $\tilde{X} \subseteq \mathbb{F}^n$, we introduce the notion of \emph{$\tilde{X}$-quotient} Reed-Muller code. A function $F : \tilde{X} \rightarrow \mathbb{F}$ is a valid codeword in the quotient code if it satisfies all the constraints of degree-$d$ polynomials \emph{lying in $\tilde{X}$}. This gives rise to a novel phenomenon: a quotient codeword may have \emph{many} extensions to original codewords. This weakens the connection between original codewords and quotient codewords which introduces a richer range of behaviors along with substantial new challenges.
  Our goal is to answer the following question: what properties of $\tilde{X}$ will imply that the quotient code inherits its distance and list-decoding radius from the original code? We address this question using techniques developed by Bhowmick and Lovett [BL14], identifying key properties of $\mathbb{F}^n$ used in their proof and extending them to general subsets $\tilde{X} \subseteq \mathbb{F}^n$. By introducing a new tool, we overcome the novel challenge in analyzing the quotient code that arises from the weak connection between original and quotient codewords. This enables us to apply known results from additive combinatorics and algebraic geometry [KZ18, KZ19, LZ21] to show that when $\tilde{X}$ is a \emph{high rank variety}, $\tilde{X}$-quotient Reed-Muller codes inherit the distance and list-decoding parameters from the original Reed-Muller codes.</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithms for collecting the statistics of large-scale IP address data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.04000v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compiling the statistics of large-scale IP address data is an essential task in network traffic measurement. The statistical results are used to evaluate the potential impact of user behaviors on network traffic. This requires algorithms that are capable of storing and retrieving a high volume of IP addresses within time and memory constraints. In this paper, we present two efficient algorithms for collecting the statistics of large-scale IP addresses that balance time efficiency and memory consumption. The proposed solutions take into account the sparse nature of the statistics of IP addresses while building the hash function and maintain a dynamic balance among layered memory blocks. There are two layers in the first proposed method, each of which contains a limited number of memory blocks. Each memory block contains 256 elements of size $256 \times 8$ bytes for a 64-bit system. In contrast to built-in hash mapping functions, the proposed solution completely avoids expensive hash collisions while retaining the linear time complexity of hash-based solutions. Moreover, the mechanism dynamically determines the hash index length according to the range of IP addresses, and can balance the time and memory constraints. In addition, we propose an efficient parallel scheme to speed up the collection of statistics. The experimental results on several synthetic datasets show that the proposed method substantially outperforms the baselines with respect to time and memory space efficiency.</description>

      <title>Disjoint covering of bipartite graphs with $s$-clubs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a positive integer $s$, an $s$-club in a graph $G$ is a set of vertices inducing a subgraph with diameter at most $s$. As generalizations of cliques, $s$-clubs offer a flexible model for real-world networks. This paper addresses the problems of partitioning and disjoint covering of vertices with $s$-clubs on bipartite graphs. First we prove that for any fixed $s \geq 6$ and fixed $k \geq 5$, determining whether the vertices of $G$ can be partitioned into at most $k$ disjoint $s$-clubs is NP-complete even for bipartite graphs. Note that our NP-completeness result is stronger than the one in Abbas and Stewart (1999), as we assume that both $s$ and $k$ are constants and not part of the input.
  Additionally, we study the Maximum Disjoint $(t,s)$-Club Covering problem (MAX-DCC($t,s$)), which aims to find a collection of vertex-disjoint $(t,s)$-clubs (i.e. $s$-clubs with at least $t$ vertices) that covers the maximum number of vertices in $G$. We prove that it is NP-hard to achieve an approximation factor of $\frac{95}{94} $ for MAX-DCC($t,3$) for any fixed $t\geq 8$ and for MAX-DCC($t,2$) for any fixed $t\geq 5$ even for bipartite graphs. Previously, results were known only for MAX-DCC($3,2$). Finally, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm for MAX-DCC($2,2$).</description>

      <title>Directed branch-width: A directed analogue of tree-width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.08903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.08903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gurski and Wanke showed that a graph class C has bounded tree-width if and only if its associated class of directed line graphs has bounded clique-width. Inevitably -- asking whether this relationship lifts to directed graphs -- we introduce a new digraph width measure: we obtain it by investigating digraphs whose directed line graphs have bounded cliquewidth. Thus, to generalize Gurski and Wanke's aforementioned result, we introduce a natural generalization of branch-width to digraphs and we name it accordingly.
  Directed branch-width is a genuinely directed width-measure insofar as it cannot be used to bound the value of the underlying undirected tree-width. Despite this, the two measures are still closely related: the directed branch-width of a digraph D can differ from the branch-width of its underlying undirected graph only at sources and sinks. This relationship allows us to extend a range of algorithmic results from directed graphs with bounded underlying treewidth to the strictly larger class of digraphs having bounded directed branch-width.</description>

      <title>Ask, and it shall be given: On the Turing completeness of prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the success of GPT, large language models (LLMs) have been revolutionizing machine learning and have initiated the so-called LLM prompting paradigm. In the era of LLMs, people train a single general-purpose LLM and provide the LLM with different prompts to perform different tasks. However, such empirical success largely lacks theoretical understanding. Here, we present the first theoretical study on the LLM prompting paradigm to the best of our knowledge. In this work, we show that prompting is in fact Turing-complete: there exists a finite-size Transformer such that for any computable function, there exists a corresponding prompt following which the Transformer computes the function. Furthermore, we show that even though we use only a single finite-size Transformer, it can still achieve nearly the same complexity bounds as that of the class of all unbounded-size Transformers. Overall, our result reveals that prompting can enable a single finite-size Transformer to be efficiently universal, which establishes a theoretical underpinning for prompt engineering in practice.</description>
