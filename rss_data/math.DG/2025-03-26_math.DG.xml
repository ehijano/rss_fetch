      <title>T-duality for transgressive fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the notion of topological T-duality from oriented sphere bundles to transgressive fibrations, a more general type fibration characterised by the abundance of transgressive elements. Examples of transgressive fibrations include principal $\mathrm{U}(n)$-bundles therefore our notion of T-duality belongs to the realm of non-Abelian T-duality. We prove that transgressive T-duals have isomorphic twisted cohomology. We then introduce Clifford--Courant algebroids, show that one can assign such an algebroid to a transgressive fibration and that transgressive T-duals have isomorphic Clifford--Courant algebroids. We provide several examples illustrating different properties of T-dual spaces.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of Ricci flow with scaling invariant estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we prove uniqueness for complete non-compact Ricci flow with scaling invariant curvature bound. This generalizes the earlier work of Chen-Zhu, Kotschwar and covers most of the example of Ricci flows with unbounded curvature. In dimension three, we use it to show that complete Ricci flow starting from uniformly non-collapsed, non-negatively curved manifold is unique, extending the strong uniqueness Theorem of Chen. This is based on solving Ricci-harmonic map heat flow in unbounded curvature background.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Payne-P\'olya-Weinberger inequalities are known to be exclusive to bounded Euclidean domains with Dirichlet boundary condition. In this paper, we discuss the corresponding inequalities on Riemannian manifolds of dimension $n \geq3$, and we prove explicit bounds in terms of geometric quantities such as scalar curvature, Yamabe constant, isoperimetric constant and conformal volume.</description>

      <title>Bordism categories and orientations of moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To define enumerative invariants in geometry, one often needs orientations on moduli spaces of geometric objects. This monograph develops a new bordism-theoretic point of view on orientations of moduli spaces. Let $X$ be a manifold with geometric structure, and $\cal M$ a moduli space of geometric objects on $X$. Our theory aims to answer the questions:
  (i) Can we prove $\cal M$ is orientable for all $X,\cal M$?
  (ii) If not, can we give computable sufficient conditions on $X$ that guarantee $\cal M$ is orientable?
  (iii) Can we specify extra data on $X$ which allow us to construct a canonical orientation on $\cal M$?
  We define 'bordism categories', such as $Bord_n^{Spin}(BG)$ with objects $(X,P)$ for $X$ a compact spin $n$-manifold and $P\to X$ a principal $G$-bundle, for $G$ a Lie group. Bordism categories can be understood by computing bordism groups of classifying spaces using Algebraic Topology. Orientation problems are encoded in functors from a bordism category to ${\mathbb Z}_2$-torsors.
  We apply our theory to study orientability and canonical orientations for moduli spaces of $G_2$-instantons and associative 3-folds in $G_2$-manifolds, for moduli spaces of Spin(7)-instantons and Cayley 4-folds in Spin(7)-manifolds, and for moduli spaces of coherent sheaves on Calabi-Yau 4-folds. The latter are needed to define Donaldson-Thomas type invariants of Calabi-Yau 4-folds. In many cases we prove orientability of $\cal M$, and show canonical orientations can be defined using a 'flag structure'.</description>

      <title>Contact Lie systems on Riemannian and Lorentzian spaces: from scaling symmetries to curvature-dependent reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an adaptation of the notion of scaling symmetries for the case of Lie-Hamilton systems, allowing their subsequent reduction to contact Lie systems. As an illustration of the procedure, time-dependent frequency oscillators and time-dependent thermodynamic systems are analyzed from this point of view. The formalism provides a novel method for constructing contact Lie systems on the three-dimensional sphere, derived from recently established Lie-Hamilton systems arising from the fundamental four-dimensional representation of the symplectic Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sp}(4,\mathbb{R})$. It is shown that these systems are a particular case of a larger hierarchy of contact Lie systems on a special class of three-dimensional homogeneous spaces, namely the Cayley-Klein spaces. These include Riemannian spaces (sphere, hyperbolic and Euclidean spaces), pseudo-Riemannian spaces (anti-de Sitter, de Sitter and Minkowski spacetimes), as well as Newtonian or non-relativistic spacetimes. Under certain topological conditions, some of these systems retrieve well-known two-dimensional Lie-Hamilton systems through a curvature-dependent reduction.</description>

      <title>K\"{a}hler Gradient Ricci Solitons with Large Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(M, g, J, f)$ be an irreducible non-trivial K\"{a}hler gradient Ricci soliton of real dimension $2n$. We show that its group of isometries is of dimension at most $n^2$ and the case of equality is characterized. As a consequence, our framework shows the uniqueness of $U(n)$-invariant K\"{a}hler gradient Ricci solitons constructed earlier. There are corollaries regarding the groups of automorphisms or affine transformations and a general version for almost Hermitian GRS. The approach is based on a connection to the geometry of an almost contact metric structure.</description>

      <title>The width of embedded circles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12939v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a Morse-Lusternik-Schnirelmann theory for the distance between two points of a smoothly embedded circle in a complete Riemannian manifold. This theory suggests very naturally a definition of width that generalises the classical definition of the width of plane curves. Pairs of points of the circle realising the width bound one or more minimising geodesics that intersect the curve in special configurations. When the circle bounds a totally convex disc, we classify the possible configurations under a further geometric condition. We also investigate properties and characterisations of curves that can be regarded as the Riemannian analogues of plane curves of constant width.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05681v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of generalized complex structures on the six-dimensional sphere $\mathbb S^6$. We work with the generalized tangent bundle $\mathbb T\mathbb S^6\to \mathbb S^6$ and define the integrability of generalized geometric structures in terms of the Dorfman bracket. Specifically, we prove that there is not a direct way to induce a generalized complex structure on $\mathbb S^6$ from its usual nearly K\"ahler structure inherited from the octonions product.</description>

      <title>Manifolds with a commutative and associative product structure that encodes superintegrable Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that two natural and a priori unrelated structures encapsulate the same data, namely certain commutative and associative product structures and a class of superintegrable Hamiltonian systems. More precisely, consider a Euclidean space of dimension at least three, equipped with a commutative and associative product structure that satisfies the conditions of a Manin-Frobenius manifold, plus one additional compatibility condition. We prove that such a product structure encapsulates precisely the conditions of a so-called abundant structure. Such a structure provides the data needed to construct a family of second-order (maximally) superintegrable Hamiltonian systems of second order. We prove that all abundant superintegrable Hamiltonian systems on Euclidean space of dimension at least three arise in this way. As an example, we present the Smorodinski-Winternitz Hamiltonian system.</description>

      <title>Mechanical presymplectic structures and Marsden-Weinstein reduction of time-dependent Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1986, Albert proposed a Marsden-Weinstein reduction process for cosymplectic structures. In this paper, we present the limitations of this theory in the application of the reduction of symmetric time-dependent Hamiltonian systems. As a consequence, we conclude that cosymplectic geometry is not appropriate for this reduction. Motived for this fact, we replace cosymplectic structures by more general structures: mechanical presymplectic structures. Then, we develop Marsden-Weinstein reduction for this kind of structures and we apply this theory to interesting examples of time-dependent Hamiltonian systems for which Albert's reduction method doesn't work.</description>

      <title>Symbols in Noncommutative Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove that the classical Lie bracket of vector fields can be generalized to the noncommutative setting by antisymmetrizing (in a suitable noncommutative sense) their compositions. This construction turns out to depend on the representability of linear differential operators, as it relies on the interpretation of vector fields as differential operators. In particular we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for (noncommutative) jet modules to be representing objects for differential operators. Furthermore, the primary ingredient for guaranteeing the closure of a bracket operation is a treatment of symbols, which classically represent, in an intrinsic way, the highest-order term of a differential operator. Thus, we provide an extensive theory of symbols herein.</description>

      <title>The porous medium equation on noncompact manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature: a Green function approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the porous medium equation (PME) on complete noncompact manifolds $M$ of nonnegative Ricci curvature. We require nonparabolicity of the manifold and construct a natural space $X$ of functions, strictly larger than $L^1$, in which the Green function on $M$ appears as a weight, such that the PME admits a solution in the weak dual (i.e. potential) sense whenever the initial datum $u_0$ is nonnegative and belongs to $X$. Smoothing estimates are also proved to hold both for $L^1$ data, where they take into account the volume growth of Riemannian balls giving rise to bounds which are shown to be sharp in a suitable sense, and for data belonging to $X$ as well.</description>

      <title>Smoothing effects and extinction in finite time for fractional fast diffusions on Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonnegative solutions to the Cauchy problem for the Fractional Fast Diffusion Equation on a suitable class of connected, noncompact Riemannian manifolds. This parabolic equation is both singular and nonlocal: the diffusion is driven by the (spectral) fractional Laplacian on the manifold, while the nonlinearity is a concave power that makes the diffusion singular, so that solutions lose mass and may extinguish in finite time. Existence of mild solutions follows by nowadays standard nonlinear semigroups techniques, and we use these solutions as the building blocks for a more general class of so-called weak dual solutions, which allow for data both in the usual $L^1$ space and in a larger weighted space, determined in terms of the fractional Green function. We focus in particular on a priori smoothing estimates (also in weighted $L^p$ spaces) for a quite large class of weak dual solutions. We also show pointwise lower bounds for solutions, showing in particular that solutions have infinite speed of propagation. Finally, we start the study of how solutions extinguish in finite time, providing suitable sharp extinction rates.</description>
