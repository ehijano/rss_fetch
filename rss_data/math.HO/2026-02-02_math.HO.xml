      <title>Proliferating series by Jean Barraqu\'e: a study and classification in mathematical terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barraqu\'e's proliferating series give an interesting turn on the concept of classic serialism by creating a new invariant when it comes to constructing the series: rather than the intervals between consecutive notes, what remains unaltered during the construction of the proliferations of the given base series is the permutation of the notes which happens between two consecutive series, that is to say, the transformation of the order of the notes in the series. This presents new possibilities for composers interested in the serial method, given the fact that the variety of intervals obtained by this method is far greater than that of classic serialism. In this manuscript, we will study some unexplored possibilities that the proliferating series offer from a mathematical point of view, which will allow composers to gain much more familiarity with them and potentially result in the creation of pieces that take serialism to the next level.</description>

      <title>Learning and Teaching Calculus Through Its History</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper frames calculus as a global, centuries-long development rather than a subject that began only with Newton and Leibniz. Drawing on ideas from Greek, Indian, Islamic, and later European mathematics, it highlights how concepts like infinity, area, motion, and continuous change slowly evolved through solving problems and cultural exchange. I argue that bringing this history into the classroom helps students see calculus as more than a set of procedures: it becomes a story of human creativity and persistence. By revisiting the questions early mathematicians struggled with, students can better appreciate and better understand the core ideas behind the formulas they use today.</description>

      <title>The Tautochrone of Huygens and Abel: From Constructive Geometry to Fractional Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the connections between Christiaan Huygens and Niels Henrik Abel through the tautochrone problem. The problem -- determining the curve along which a particle descends under gravity in the same time, regardless of its starting point -- has been a central topic at the intersection of physics, geometry, and analysis. Though these two major figures are separated by nearly two centuries, they approached the problem in radically different ways. While Huygens proposed a physical solution based on geometric construction, Abel approached the problem within the analytic framework of integral equations, employing a procedure that can be seen as anticipating and paving the way for the development of differential calculus of arbitrary order. This contrast highlights a broader historical narrative: the transformation of mathematical thinking from constructive geometry to abstract analysis.</description>
