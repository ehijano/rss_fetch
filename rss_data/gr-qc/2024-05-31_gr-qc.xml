      <title>Listening to Quantum Gravity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental progresses in controlling classical and quantum fluids have made it possible to realize acoustic analogues of gravitational black holes, where a flowing fluid provides an effective spacetime on which sound waves propagate, demonstrating Hawking-like radiation and Penrose superradiance. We propose the exciting possibility that new hydrodynamic systems might provide insights to help resolve mysteries associated with quantum gravity, including the black hole information-loss paradox and the removal of spacetime singularities.</description>

      <title>Tempered Multifidelity Importance Sampling for Gravitational Wave Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the parameters of compact binaries which coalesce and produce gravitational waves is a challenging Bayesian inverse problem. Gravitational-wave parameter estimation lies within the class of multifidelity problems, where a variety of models with differing assumptions, levels of fidelity, and computational cost are available for use in inference. In an effort to accelerate the solution of a Bayesian inverse problem, cheaper surrogates for the best models may be used to reduce the cost of likelihood evaluations when sampling the posterior. Importance sampling can then be used to reweight these samples to represent the true target posterior, incurring a reduction in the effective sample size. In cases when the problem is high dimensional, or when the surrogate model produces a poor approximation of the true posterior, this reduction in effective samples can be dramatic and render multifidelity importance sampling ineffective. We propose a novel method of tempered multifidelity importance sampling in order to remedy this issue. With this method the biasing distribution produced by the low-fidelity model is tempered, allowing for potentially better overlap with the target distribution. There is an optimal temperature which maximizes the efficiency in this setting, and we propose a low-cost strategy for approximating this optimal temperature using samples from the untempered distribution. In this paper, we motivate this method by applying it to Gaussian target and biasing distributions. Finally, we apply it to a series of problems in gravitational wave parameter estimation and demonstrate improved efficiencies when applying the method to real gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Fractional Relativistic Polytropic Gas Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many stellar configurations, including white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes, supermassive stars, and star clusters, rely on relativistic effects. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation of the polytropic gas sphere is ultimately a hydrostatic equilibrium equation developed from the general relativity framework. In the modified Rieman Liouville (mRL) frame, we formulate the fractional TOV (FTOV) equations and introduce an analytical solution. Using power series expansions to solve the fractional TOV equations yields a limited physical range to the convergent power series solution. Therefore, the two techniques of Euler-Abel transformation and Pade approximation have been combined to improve the convergence of the obtained series solutions. For all possible values of the relativistic parameters (\sigma), we calculated twenty fractional gas models for the polytropic indexes n=0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2. Investigating the impacts of fractional and relativistic parameters on the models revealed fascinating phenomena; the two effects for n=0.5 are that the sphere's volume and mass decrease with increasing \sigma and the fractional parameter (\alpha). For n=1, the volume decreases when \sigma=0.1 and then increases when \sigma=0.2 and 0.3. The volume of the sphere reduces as both \sigma and \alpha increase for n=1.5 and n=2. We calculated the maximum mass and the corresponding minimum radius of the white dwarfs modeled with polytropic index n=3 and several fractional and relativistic parameter values. We obtained a mass limit for the white dwarfs somewhat near the Chandrasekhar limit for the integer models with small relativistic parameters (\alpha=1, \sigma=0.001). The situation is altered by lowering the fractional parameter; the mass limit increases to Mlimit=1.63348 M at \alpha=0.95 and \sigma=0.001.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional hierarchical tests of general relativity with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tests of general relativity with gravitational waves typically introduce parameters for putative deviations and combine information from multiple events by characterizing the population distribution of these parameters through a hierarchical model. Although many tests include multiple such parameters, hierarchical tests have so far been unable to accommodate this multidimensionality, instead restricting to separate one-dimensional analyses and discarding information about parameter correlations. In this paper, we extend population tests of general relativity to handle an arbitrary number of dimensions. We demonstrate this framework on the two-dimensional inspiral-merger-ringdown consistency test, and derive new constraints from the latest LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog, GWTC-3. We obtain joint constraints for the two parameters introduced by the classic formulation of this test, revealing their correlation structure both at the individual-event and population levels. We additionally propose a new four-dimensional formulation of the inspiral-merger-ringdown test that we show contains further information. As in past work, we find the GW190814 event to be an outlier; the 4D analysis yields further insights on how the low mass and spin of this event biases the population results. Without (with) this event, we find consistency with general relativity at the 60\% (92\%) credible level in the 2D formulation, and 76\% (80\%) for the 4D formulation. This multi-dimensional framework can be immediately applied to other tests of general relativity in any number of dimensions, including the parametrized post-Einsteinian tests and ringdown tests.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant formulation for the gravitational wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gauge-invariant formulation for the gravitational wave equations is presented. Using this approach, weak, plane wave solutions in a vacuum are derived in various theories. These include general relativity with two modes of polarization with helicity $\pm 2$, Yang's theory with three modes of polarization with helicity $\pm 2$ and $0$, and so-called "general metric theories" with six modes of polarization with helicity $\pm 2$, $\pm 1$, and two $0$'s. To identify the polarizations of gravitational waves, it is explicitly demonstrated how the gauge-invariant approach reproduces the earlier results.</description>

      <title>Space-time superpositions as fluctuating geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superpositions of black holes can be described geometrically using a combined canonical formulation for space-time and quantum states. A previously introduced black-hole model that includes quantum fluctuations of metric components is shown here to give full access to the corresponding space-time geometry of weak-field gravity in terms of suitable line elements with quantum corrections. These results can be interpreted as providing covariant formulations of the gravitational force implied by a distribution of black holes in superposition. They can also be understood as a distribution of quantum matter constituents in superposition for a single black hole. A detailed analysis in the weak-field limit reveals quantum corrections to Newton's potential in generic semiclassical states, as well as new bounds on quantum fluctuations, implied by the covariance condition, rather than the usual uncertainty principle. These results provide additional control on quantum effects in Newton's potential that can be used in a broad range of predictions to be compared with observations.</description>

      <title>Time-delay interferometry with onboard optical delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-delay interferometry (TDI) is a data processing technique for space-based gravitational-wave detectors to create laser-noise-free equal-optical-path-length interferometers virtually on the ground. It relies on the interspacecraft signal propagation delays, which are delivered by intersatellite ranging monitors. Also delays due to onboard signal propagation and processing have a nonnegligible impact on the TDI combinations. However, these onboard delays were only partially considered in previous TDI-related research; onboard optical path lengths have been neglected so far. In this paper, we study onboard optical path lengths in TDI. We derive analytical models for their coupling to the second-generation TDI Michelson combinations and verify these models numerically. Furthermore, we derive a compensation scheme for onboard optical path lengths in TDI and validate its performance via numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Love-C relations for elastic hybrid stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) provide a unique laboratory to study matter under extreme densities. Recent observations from gravitational and electromagnetic waves have enabled constraints on NS properties, such as tidal deformability (related to the tidal Love number) and stellar compactness. Although each of these two NS observables depends strongly on the stellar internal structure, the relation between them (called the Love-C relation) is known to be equation-of-state insensitive. In this study, we investigate the effects of a possible crystalline phase in the core of hybrid stars (HSs) on the mass-radius and Love-C relations, where HSs are a subclass of NS models with a quark matter core and a nuclear matter envelope with a sharp phase transition in between. We find that both the maximum mass and the corresponding radius increase as one increases the stiffness of the quark matter core controlled by the speed of sound, while the density discontinuity at the nuclear-quark matter transition effectively softens the equations of state. Deviations of the Love-C relation for elastic HSs from that of fluid NSs become more pronounced with a larger shear modulus, lower transition pressure, and larger density gap and can be as large as 60%. These findings suggest a potential method for testing the existence of distinct phases within HSs, though deviations are not large enough to be detected with current measurements of the tidal deformability and compactness.</description>

      <title>Alleviating the $H_0$ and $\sigma_8$ tensions in the interacting cubic covariant Galileon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between dark matter and dark energy has become a focal point in contemporary cosmological research, particularly in addressing current cosmological tensions. This study explores the cubic Galileon model's interaction with dark matter, where the interaction potential in the dark sector is proportional to the dark energy density of the Galileon field. By employing dimensionless variables, we transform the field equations into an autonomous dynamical system. We calculate the critical points of the corresponding autonomous systems and demonstrate the existence of a stable de Sitter epoch. Our investigation proceeds in two phases. First, we conduct a detailed analysis of the exact interacting cubic Galileon (ICG) model, derived from the precise solution of the equations of motion. Second, we explore an approximate tracker solution, labeled TICG, assuming a small coupling parameter between dark matter and dark energy. We evaluate the evolution of these models using data from two experiments, aiming to resolve the tensions surrounding $H_0$ and $S_8$. The analysis of the TICG model indicates a preference for a phantom regime and provides a negative coupling parameter in the dark sector at a $68\%$ confidence level. This model also shows that the current tensions regarding $H_0$ and $S_8$ are alleviated. Conversely, the ICG model, despite its preference for the phantom regime, is plagued by an excess in today's matter density and a higher expansion rate, easing only the $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{k}$ be a nontrivial finite-dimensional Lie algebra of vector fields on a manifold M, and consider the family of Lorentzian metrics on M whose Killing algebra contains $\mathfrak{k}$. We show that scalar relative differential invariants, with respect to a Lie algebra of vector fields on M preserving $\mathfrak{k}$, can be used to detect the horizons of several well-known black holes. In particular, using the Lie algebra structure of $\mathfrak{k}$, we construct a general relative differential invariant of order 0 that always vanishes on $\mathfrak{k}$-invariant Killing horizons.</description>

      <title>Motivating Emissions from Positive Energy Warp Bubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research has proposed that advanced propulsion mechanisms such as warp drives are more physically feasible than previously thought, using positive energy sources potentially sourced by known classical physics. Motivated by this, we hypothesize that an advanced inter-planetary or interstellar civilization using warp drives at sub-luminal or super-luminal speeds will broadcast detectable emissions of their travels. These technosignatures would be of significant astronomical, physical, and technological interest. This paper seeks to motivate signatures from warp drive emissions due to intrinsic and extrinsic processes across several messenger types (electromagnetic, particle, and gravitational) and propose a research program to simulate such emissions in sufficient detail to search for their signatures through coordinated analyses across multiple observatories.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Production of Completely Dark Photons with Nonminimal Couplings to Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photons are a theorized massive spin-1 particle which can be produced via various mechanisms, including cosmological gravitational particle production (GPP) in the early universe. In this work, we extend previous results for GPP of dark photons to include nonminimal couplings to gravity. We find that nonminimal couplings can induce a ghost instability or lead to runaway particle production at high momentum and discuss the constraints on the parameter space such that the theory is free of instabilities. Within the instability-free regime we numerically calculate the particle production and find that the inclusion of nonminimal couplings can lead to an enhancement of the particle number. As a result, GPP of nonminimally coupled dark photons can open the parameter space for production of a cosmological relevant relic density (constituting all or part of the dark matter) as compared to the minimally-coupled theory. These results are independent of the choice of inflation model, which we demonstrate by repeating the analysis for a class of rapid-turn multi-field inflation models.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction from self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Merging compact objects such as binary black holes provide a promising probe for the physics of dark matter (DM). The gravitational waves emitted during inspiral potentially allow to detect DM spikes around black holes. This is because the dynamical friction force experienced by the inspiraling black hole alters the orbital period and thus the gravitational wave signal. Aims. The dynamical friction arising from DM can potentially differ from the collisionless case when DM is subject to self-interactions. This paper aims to understand how self-interactions impact dynamical friction. Methods. To study the dynamical friction force, we use idealized N-body simulations, where we include self-interacting dark matter. Results. We find that the dynamical friction force for inspiraling black holes would be typically enhanced by DM self-interactions compared to a collisionless medium (ignoring differences in the DM density). At lower velocities below the sound speed, we find that the dynamical friction force can be reduced by the presence of self-interactions. Conclusions. DM self-interactions have a significant effect on the dynamical friction for black hole mergers. Assuming the Chandrasekhar formula may underpredict the deceleration due to dynamical friction.</description>

      <title>Hall-like behaviour of higher rank Chern-Simons theory of fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fracton phases of matter constitute an interesting point of contact between condensed matter and high-energy physics. The limited mobility property of fracton quasiparticles finds applications in many different contexts, including quantum information, spin liquids, elasticity, hydrodynamics, gravity and holography. In this paper we adopt a field theoretical approach to investigate the three dimensional action of a rank-2 symmetric tensor field invariant under the covariant fracton symmetry. The theory appears as a non-topological higher rank generalization of the ordinary Chern-Simons model, depending only on the traceless part of the tensor gauge field. After defining a field strength, a rank-2 traceless ``electric'' field and a ``magnetic'' vector field are identified, in analogy with the standard Chern-Simons ones. Once matter is introduced, a Hall-like behaviour with fractonic features emerges. In particular, our model shows a Hall-like dipole current, together with a vectorial ``flux-attachment'' relation for dipoles. This gives a possible starting point for a fracton - vortex duality. A gauge-fixing term is then introduced, from which propagators are computed and the counting of the degrees of freedom is performed. Finally, the energy-momentum tensor is shown to be conserved and the integrated energy density is proved to be zero, which reminds the topological nature of the standard Chern-Simons model.</description>

      <title>Constraining small-scale primordial magnetic fields from the abundance of primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of magnetic fields in the early universe affects the cosmological processes, leading to the distinct signature, which allows constraining their properties and the genesis mechanisms. In this study, we revisit the method to constrain the amplitude of the magnetic fields on small scales in the radiation-dominated era from the abundance of primordial black holes. Constraints in the previous work were based on the fact that the density perturbations sourced by stronger magnetic fields become large enough to gravitationally collapse to form PBHs. However, we demonstrate that this picture is incomplete because magnetic fields also increase the threshold value of the density contrast required for PBH formation. The increase in threshold density contrast is more pronounced on smaller scales, and in extreme cases, it might even prevent PBH production despite the presence of significant magnetic field. Taking into account the relevant physical effects on the magnetized overdense region, we establish an upper-limit on the amplitude of comoving magnetic fields, approximately $0.12-0.14 {\rm \mu G}$ at a scale of $10^{17} {\rm Mpc}^{-1}$. Additionally, we compare our constraints with various small-scale probes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is reporting unexpectedly massive high redshift galaxies that appear challenging from the $\Lambda$CDM perspective. Interpreted as a problem of cosmological origin, this necessitates Planck underestimating either matter density $\Omega_m$ or physical matter density $\Omega_m h^2$ at higher redshifts. Through standard frequentist profile likelihoods, we identify corroborating quasar (QSO) and gamma-ray burst (GRB) data sets where $\Omega_m$ increases with effective redshift $z_{\textrm{eff}}$, with $\Omega_m$ remaining anomalously large at higher redshifts. While the variation of $\Omega_m$ with $z_{\textrm{eff}}$ is at odds with the $\Lambda$CDM model, demarcating frequentist confidence intervals through differences in $\chi^2$ in profile likelihoods, the prevailing technique in the literature, points to $3.9 \sigma$ and $7.9 \sigma$ tensions between GRBs and QSOs, respectively, and Planck-$\Lambda$CDM. We explain the approximations inherent in the existing profile likelihood literature, and highlight fresh methodology that generalises the prescription. We show that alternative methods, including Bayesian approaches, lead to similar tensions.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological observables in perturbation theory turn out to be plagued with infrared divergences, which represents both a conceptual and computational challenge. In this paper we present a proof of concept for a systematic procedure to remove these divergences in a large class of scalar cosmological integrals and consistently define an infrared safe computable in perturbation theory. We provide diagrammatic rules which are based on the nestohedra underlying the asymptotic structure of such integrals.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating scalar-tensor theory and the Qi-Xiu</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the parity-violating scalar-tensor theory and pay special attention to terms that are free of the Ostrogradsky ghost in the unitary gauge, i.e., when the scalar field possesses a timelike gradient. We exhaustively identify the generally covariant scalar-tensor theory (GST) monomials with parity violation up to $d=4$, where $d$ is the total number of derivatives in the unitary gauge. According to the correspondence between GST terms and the spatially covariant gravity (SCG) terms in the unitary gauge, we also exhaustively identify the SCG monomials with parity violation up to $d=4$, where the Lie derivatives of the extrinsic curvature and the lapse function are necessarily introduced. We find a total of 9 independent parity-violating SCG monomials, of which 7 contain no higher-order Lie derivatives and are thus automatically free of ghosts, while 2 involve Lie derivatives of the extrinsic curvature and the lapse function and are thus potentially dangerous. By explicitly deriving their generally covariant correspondence, we obtain 7 independent scalar-tensor terms dubbed the ``Qi-Xiu'' Lagrangians, which are the most general parity-violating scalar-tensor theories that are ghost-free in the unitary gauge up to $d=4$. Our results include the existing theories in the literature, such as the Chern-Simons term and the chiral scalar-tensor theories, as special cases.</description>

      <title>Role of Spatial Curvature in a Dark Energy Interacting Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of spatial curvature in a model where dark matter and dark energy interact. The analysis employs a range of datasets, including CMB, BAO, Type Ia Supernova, $H(z)$ from cosmic chronometers, $H_0$ measurements from Megamasers and SH0ES, growth rate data and strong lensing time delay measurements, to assess the model's fit and explore the late-time dynamics of the interacting dark sector in a non-flat cosmological framework. The study indicates that introducing curvature can significantly impact the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the structure growth parameter ($S_8$), potentially easing tensions between early and late universe observations. The observational data shows an indication for a closed universe. This implies that the presence of curvature and its influence cannot be neglected entirely.</description>

Abstract: Soft hairs are intrinsically infrared features of a black hole, which may also affect near-horizon physics. In this work, we study one of the primary observables through which we can study the effects of a particular type of soft hair in Einstein's gravity: the shadow of a non-rotating black hole implanted with linear {\it regular} superrotational hair. We show that such soft hairs deform the shadow from the characteristic circular shape of bald Schwarzschild black holes into ellipses. Such a unique effect can be observed in future black hole imaging projects. This starkly contrasts with the supertranslated counterpart, for which the only changes are the static shift of the circular shadow's position and thus cannot be detectable. Our results demonstrate the richness of observable effects due to the infrared structures of Einstein's gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When gravitational waves travel from their source to an observer, they interact with matter structures along their path, causing distinct deformations in their waveforms. In this study we introduce a novel theoretical framework for wave optics effects in gravitational lensing, addressing the limitations of existing approaches. We achieve this by incorporating the proper time technique, typically used in field theory studies, into gravitational lensing. This approach allows us to extend the standard formalism beyond the eikonal and paraxial approximations, which are traditionally assumed, and to account for polarization effects, which are typically neglected in the literature. We demonstrate that our method provides a robust generalization of conventional approaches, including them as special cases. Our findings enhance our understanding of gravitational wave propagation, which is crucial for accurately interpreting gravitational wave observations and extracting unbiased information about the lenses from the gravitational wave waveforms.</description>

Abstract: We propose mixed boundary conditions for 3d conformal gravity consistent with variational principle in its second-order formalism that admit the chiral $\Lambda$-$\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra as their asymptotic symmetry algebra. This algebra is one of the four chiral $\mathcal W$-algebra extensions of $\mathfrak{so}(2,3)$ and is a generalisation of the chiral $\mathfrak{bms}_4$ algebra responsible for soft theorems of graviton MHV amplitudes in ${\mathbb R}^{1,3}$ gravity to the case of non-zero negative cosmological constant. The corresponding charges calculated using the modified covariant phase space formalism are shown to be finite and integrable, and realise this non-linear ${\cal W}$-algebra.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing in More Realistic Dark Matter Halo Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate gravitational lensing within the framework of more realistic dark matter halo models, transcending the limitations of spherical-collapse approximations. Through analytical computations utilizing diverse mass functions, we address critical factors typically overlooked in the standard Press-Schechter formalism, including ellipsoidal-collapse conditions, angular momentum dynamics, dynamical friction, and the cosmological constant. Our analysis incorporates two widely recognized halo density profiles, the Navarro-Frenk-White and Einasto profiles, considering both spherical and ellipsoidal-collapse scenarios. We present relevant calculations of pivotal gravitational lensing observables, such as Einstein radii, lensing optical depths, and time delays, spanning a wide range of redshifts and masses across two distinct lensing models: the point mass and singular isothermal sphere (SIS) lens models. Our findings illuminate that adopting more realistic dark matter halo models leads to heightened lensing effects compared to their spherical-collapse counterparts. Furthermore, our analyses of lensing optical depths and time delays reveal distinct characteristics between point mass and SIS lens models. These outcomes highlight the need for more realistic halo descriptions instead of simple approximations when modeling gravitational lensing, as this approach can potentially better reveal the complex structures of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Interacting Fields at Spatial Infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the properties of massive fields extrapolated to the blowup of spatial infinity ($\hat{i}^0$), extending the program initiated in arXiv:2207.06406. In the free theory, we find an explicit representation of boundary two-point functions and boundary to bulk two-point functions, and also present an HKLL-type reconstruction formula for local bulk operators in terms of smeared boundary operators. We study interacting Wightman correlators and find that, generically, interacting massive fields decay slower than free fields as one approaches $\hat{i}^0$. We propose that meaningful correlators at $\hat{i}^0$ can be obtained through an LSZ-like prescription that isolates the on-shell part of bulk Wightman correlators before extrapolating them to $\hat{i}^0$. We show that a natural basis for operators at $\hat{i}^0$, defined via this prescription, is given by the average of "in" and "out" operators defined at $i^-$ and $i^+$ respectively. Therefore, correlators at $\hat{i}^0$ and cross correlators between $\hat{i}^0$, $i^-$ and $i^+$ can be represented within the class of asymptotic observables studied by Caron-Huot et al. in arXiv:2308.02125. We present several sample calculations.</description>

      <title>Optimization of entanglement depends on whether a black hole is extremal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a massless, minimally coupled scalar field in a $(1+1)$ dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole spacetime. In particular, one of the detectors, corresponding to $Alice$, is moving along an outgoing null trajectory. While the other detector carried by $Bob$ is static. With this set-up, we investigate the entangling condition and the measure of the entanglement, concurrence, in the nonextremal and extremal scenarios. Our observations suggest, as expected, a qualitative similarity in characteristics of the entanglement between these two scenarios. However, we find quantitative differences between the nonextremal and extremal concurrences for a broad range of black hole charges. With moderately large detector transition energy, the extremal background always accounts for the larger entanglement than the nonextremal one. In contrast, with low detector transition energy, entanglement on the nonextremal background can be greater. Therefore, by adjusting the detector transition energy, one can perceive optimum entanglement from either the extremal or the nonextremal background.</description>

      <title>Strong cosmic censorship for the spherically symmetric Einstein-Maxwell-charged-Klein-Gordon system with positive $\Lambda$: stability of the Cauchy horizon and $H^1$ extensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interior of a dynamical black hole as described by the Einstein-Maxwell-charged-Klein-Gordon system of equations with a cosmological constant, under spherical symmetry. In particular, we consider a characteristic initial value problem where, on the outgoing initial hypersurface, interpreted as the event horizon $\mathcal{H}^+$ of a dynamical black hole, we prescribe: a) initial data asymptotically approaching a fixed sub-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter solution; b) an exponential Price law upper bound for the charged scalar field. After showing local well-posedness for the corresponding first-order system of partial differential equations, we establish the existence of a Cauchy horizon $\mathcal{CH}^+$ for the evolved spacetime, extending the bootstrap methods used in the case $\Lambda = 0$ by Van de Moortel. In this context, we show the existence of $C^0$ spacetime extensions beyond $\mathcal{CH}^+$. Moreover, if the scalar field decays at a sufficiently fast rate along $\mathcal{H}^+$, we show that the renormalized Hawking mass remains bounded for a large set of initial data. With respect to the analogous model concerning an uncharged and massless scalar field, we are able to extend the known range of parameters for which mass inflation is prevented, up to the optimal threshold suggested by the linear analyses by Costa-Franzen and Hintz-Vasy. In this no-mass-inflation scenario, which includes near-extremal solutions, we further prove that the spacetime can be extended across the Cauchy horizon with continuous metric, Christoffel symbols in $L^2_{\text{loc}}$ and scalar field in $H^1_{\text{loc}}$. By generalizing the work by Costa-Gir\~ao-Nat\'ario-Silva to the case of a charged and massive scalar field, our results reveal a potential failure of the Christodoulou-Chru\'sciel version of the strong cosmic censorship under spherical symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17130v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wide binary stars are used to test the modified gravity called Scalar-Tensor-Vector Gravity or MOG. This theory is based on the additional gravitational degrees of freedom, the scalar field $G=G_N(1+\alpha)$, where $G_N$ is Newton's constant, and the massive (spin-1 graviton) vector field $\phi_\mu$. The wide binaries have separations of 2-30 kAU. The MOG acceleration law, derived from the MOG field equations and equations of motion of a massive test particle for weak gravitational fields, depends on the enhanced gravitational constant $G=G_N(1+\alpha)$ and the effective running mass $\mu$. The magnitude of $\alpha$ depends on the physical length scale or averaging scale $\ell$ of the system. The modified MOG acceleration law for weak gravitational fields predicts that for the solar system and for the wide binary star systems gravitational dynamics follows Newton's law.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear extensions of classical Maxwell's electromagnetism are among the prominent candidates for theories admitting regular black hole solutions. A quest for such examples has been fruitful, but mostly unsystematic and littered by the introduction of physically unrealistic Lagrangians. We provide a procedure which admits the reconstruction of a nonlinear electromagnetic Lagrangian, consistent with the Euler--Heisenberg Lagrangian in the weak-field limit, from a given metric representing a regular, magnetically charged black hole.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we prove analytic bounds on the equation of state of a cosmological fluid composed of an arbitrary number of canonical scalars evolving in a negative multi-exponential potential. Because of the negative energy, the universe is contracting and eventually undergoes a big crunch. A contracting universe is a fundamental feature of models of ekpyrosis and cyclic universes, which are a proposed alternative to cosmic inflation to solve the flatness and horizon problems. Our analytic bounds set quantitative constraints on general effective theories of ekpyrosis. When applied to specific top-down constructions, our bounds can be used to determine whether ekpyrosis could in principle be realized. We point out some possible sources of tension in realizing the ekpyrotic universe in controlled constructions of string theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Causal set theory is perhaps the most minimalistic approach to quantum gravity, in the sense that it makes next to zero assumptions about the structure of spacetime below the Planck scale. Yet even with this minimalism, the continuum limit is still a major challenge in causal sets. One aspect of this challenge is the measurement of distances in causal sets. While the definition and estimation of time-like distances is relatively straightforward, dealing with space-like distances is much more problematic. Here we introduce an approach to measure distances between space-like separated events based on their causal overlap. We show that the distance estimation errors in this approach vanish in the continuum limit even for smallest distances of the order of the Planck length. These results are expected to inform the causal set geometrogenesis in general, and in particular the development of evolving causal set models in which space emerges from causal dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we utilize the effective corrections of the $\bar{\mu}$-scheme in loop quantum black holes to obtain a 4-dimensional spherically symmetric metric with a cosmological constant. By imposing the areal gauge on the components of Ashtekar variables in the classical theory and applying the holonomy corrections, we derive the equations of motion, which can be solved to obtain the expression for the effective metric in the Painlev\'{e}-Gullstrand coordinates. Compared to the classical dS (AdS) spacetime, the LQG correction sets an upper bound on the cosmological constant as $\Lambda&lt;\frac{3}{\gamma^2\Delta}$. The thermodynamic properties of black holes have also been calculated. We interestingly found that for a small black hole, the temperature of the LQG black hole decreases as the mass decreases, which is quite different with the classical scenario. Moreover, our result shows that a logarithmic term appeared as the leading order correction to the Beikenstein-Hawking entropy. Furthermore, the LQG corrections also introduce an extra phase transition in the black hole's heat capacity at smaller radius.</description>

      <title>Hubble Diagrams in Statistically Homogeneous, Anisotropic Universes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the form of Hubble diagrams that would be constructed by observers in universes that are homogeneous but anisotropic, when averaged over suitably large length-scales. This is achieved by ray-tracing in different directions on the sky in families of exact inhomogeneous cosmological solutions of Einstein's equations, in order to determine the redshifts and luminosity distances that observers in these space-times would infer for distant astrophysical objects. We compare the results of this procedure to the Hubble diagrams that would be obtained by direct use of the large-scale-averaged anisotropic cosmological models, and find that observables calculated in the averaged model closely agree with those obtained from ray-tracing in all cases where a statistical homogeneity scale exists. In contrast, we find that in cosmologies with spaces that contain no statistical homogeneity scale that Hubble diagrams inferred from the averaged cosmological model can differ considerably from those that observers in the space-time would actually construct. We hope that these results will be of use for understanding and interpreting recent observations that suggest that large-scale anisotropy may have developed in the late Universe.</description>

      <title>A new look at AdS black holes with conformal scalar hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit static, spherically symmetric solutions to AdS-Einstein gravity with a conformally coupled scalar field (and no self-interaction potential) in four dimensions. We first observe that a convenient choice of coordinates leads to a significant simplification of the field equations, which enables one to identify various roots of the indicial equations and thus distinct branches of solutions. Next, we construct an explicit 2-parameter hairy black hole solution in terms of an infinite power series around the event horizon. The black hole is non-extremal with a regular scalar field on and outside the event horizon, and it reduces to the Schwarzschild-AdS metric in the limit of vanishing hair. Its properties are illustrated for various values of the parameters and compared with previous numerical results by other authors. In addition, the analysis reveals the presence of a photon sphere and how the scalar field affects its size and the angular radius of the corresponding shadow. The thermodynamics of the solution is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Emergent Cosmology in 4D Einstein Gauss Bonnet Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01355v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, in an FLRW background and a perfect fluid equation of state, we explore the possibility of the realization of an emergent scenario in a 4D regularized extension of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, with the field equations particularly expressed in terms of scalar-tensor degrees of freedom. By assuming non-zero spatial curvature ($k = \pm 1$), the stability of the Einstein static universe (ESU) and its subsequent exit into the standard inflationary system is tested through different approaches. In terms of dynamical systems, a spatially closed universe rather than an open universe shows appealing behaviour to exhibit a graceful transition from the Einstein static universe to standard cosmological history. We found that under linear homogeneous perturbations, for some constraints imposed on the model parameters, the Einstein static universe is stable under those perturbations. Moreover, it is noted that for a successful graceful transition, the equation of state $\omega$ must satisfy the conditions $-1 &lt; \omega &lt;0$ and $\omega &lt; -1$ for closed and open universes, respectively. Also, under density perturbations, the Einstein static universe is unstable if the fluid satisfies the strong energy condition but is stable if it violates it, for both closed and open universes. Furthermore, the Einstein static universe is seen to be stable under vector perturbations and tensor perturbations, regardless of whether the fluid obeys or violates the SEC.</description>

      <title>Parametrized Black Hole Quasinormal Ringdown Formalism for Higher Overtones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the parametrized black hole quasinormal ringdown formalism, which is a robust framework used to analyze quasinormal modes in systems that closely resemble general relativity, paying particular attention to the higher overtones. We find that larger deviations from the general relativity case typically appear in the quasinormal frequencies for the higher overtones. This growing tendency for higher overtones can be understood using an analytical method, and its relations to previous works are briefly discussed. Our findings indicate that we can impose a strong constraint on gravity theories by considering the overtones of quasinormal modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the measurement correlation between the effective spin and the effective tidal deformability in gravitational wave signals from binary neutron star mergers. We exploit the fact that the tidal effects in a binary system are prominent when the components are closer during the late-inspiral. Thus, we indicate to a computationally efficient strategy of extracting the tidal information compressed within seconds before the merger. We report our observations for \texttt{GW170817} and explore the suitability of our approach for the upcoming observation scenarios. Fast and accurate measurements of the tidal deformability parameters can be used to inform astronomers in prioritizing the electromagnetic follow-up efforts for such sources.</description>

      <title>Well-defined $f(Q)$ Gravity, Reconstruction of FLRW Spacetime and Unification of Inflation with Dark Energy Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate the convenient and mimetic $f(Q)$ gravities in terms of the metric and four scalar fields with the $Q$ being the non-metricity scalar. As a result, it is shown that the obtained field equations are well-defined. By using the field equations, we show how the $f(Q)$ models which realise any given FLRW spacetime may be reconstructed. We construct convenient $f(Q)$ gravity and mimetic $f(Q)$ gravity, which describe the inflation and dark energy epochs and even unify the inflation and dark energy. Moreover, a radiation-dominated epoch and early dark energy may be easily included in the above theories as is explicitly shown. It is shown that the inflationary spectral index $n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ are consistent with Planck data for some models of $f(Q)$ gravity. Corresponding asymptotic forms of $f(Q)$ and mimetic $f(Q)$ are given. Finally, some remarks on possible reconstruction for spherically symmetric spacetime are given.</description>

Abstract: Toric Ricci--flat metrics in dimension four correspond to certain holomorphic vector bundles over a twistor space. We construct these bundles explicitly, by exhibiting and characterising their patching matrices, for the five--parameter family of Riemannian ALF metrics constructed by Chen and Teo. The Chen--Teo family contains a two--parameter family of asymptotically flat gravitational instantons. The patching matrices for these instantons take a simple rational form.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction via magnetic reconnection in magnetized black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Comisso-Asenjo mechanism is a novel mechanism proposed recently to extract energy from black holes through magnetic reconnection of the surrounding charged plasma, in which the magnetic field plays a crucial role. In this work, we revisit this process by taking into account the backreaction of the magnetic field on the black hole's geometry. We employ the Kerr-Melvin metric to describe the local near-horizon geometry of the magnetized black hole. By analyzing the circular orbits in the equatorial plane, energy extraction conditions, power and efficiency of the energy extraction, we found that while a stronger magnetic field can enhance plasma magnetization and aid energy extraction, its backreaction on the spacetime may hinder the process, with a larger magnetic field posing a greater obstacle. Balancing these effects, an optimal moderate magnetic field strength is found to be most conducive to energy extraction. Moreover, there is a maximum limit to the magnetic field strength associated with the black hole's spin, beyond which circular orbits in the equatorial plane are prohibited, thereby impeding energy extraction in the current scenario.</description>

      <title>Can interacting dark energy with dynamical coupling resolve the Hubble tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $H_0$ tension between low- and high- redshift measurements is definitely a serious issue faced by current cosmologists since it ranges from 4$\sigma$ to 6$\sigma$. To relieve this tension, in this paper we propose a new interacting dark energy model with time varying coupling parameter by parameterizing the densities of dark matter and dark energy, this parametric approach for interacting dark sectors are inspired by our previous work concerning the coupled generalized three-form dark energy model in which dark matter and dark energy behave like two uncoupled dark sectors with effective equation of state when the three-form $|\kappa X|\gg1$, for this reason, we reconstruct coupled generalized three-form dark energy from such parametric model under the condition $|\kappa X_0|\gg1$. In the end, we place constraints on three parametric models in light of the Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) distance priors, baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) data and the Pantheon compilation of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) data by assuming the parameter $k$ as 0,5,10 respectively. The fitting results show that, for all the observational data sets, the parametric models with $k=0,5,10$ relieve the Hubble tension with the latest local determinations of the Hubble constant from ${\rm SH_0ES}$ team, i.e. the so called R22, to 2.3 $\sigma$, 1.9 $\sigma$ and 1.3 $\sigma$ with $\chi_{\rm min}^2=10.43,10.47,10.48$ respectively, revealing that $k$ is positive correlated to the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian metric spaces and their Gromov-Hausdorff convergence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.14384v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an abstract approach to Lorentzian Gromov-Hausdorff distance and convergence, and an alternative approach to Lorentzian length spaces that does not use auxiliary ``positive signature'' metrics or other unobserved fields. We begin by defining a notion of (abstract) bounded Lorentzian-metric space which is sufficiently general to comprise compact causally convex subsets of globally hyperbolic spacetimes and causets. We define the Gromov-Hausdorff distance and show that two bounded Lorentzian-metric spaces at zero GH distance are indeed both isometric and homeomorphic. Then we show how to define from the Lorentzian distance, beside topology, the causal relation and the causal curves for these spaces, obtaining useful limit curve theorems. Next, we define Lorentzian (length) prelength spaces via suitable (maximal) chronal connectedness properties. These definitions are proved to be stable under GH limits. Furthermore, we define bounds on sectional curvature for our Lorentzian length spaces and prove that they are also stable under GH limits. We conclude with a (pre)compactness theorem.</description>

      <title>Unstable Anisotropic Neutron Stars: Probing the Limits of Gravitational Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.02439v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are incredibly versatile for studying various important aspects of high-energy and compact-object physics. These celestial objects contain extreme matter at incredibly high densities in their interiors, leading to the risk of instabilities that may cause them to collapse into a black hole (BH). This paper focuses on exploring the stability and gravitational collapse of NSs. For a more realistic approach we have considered the pressure to be locally anisotropic. We utilize the BL-Model to describe the anisotropy inside the NS. The presence of quarks in the core of an NS can heavily affect its stability. Hence, along with pure hadronic EOSs, we have also considered Hadron-Quark phase transition (HQPT) EOSs for this paper's analysis. We subject the anisotropic NSs to radial perturbations to study their stability against radial oscillations. NSs exhibiting imaginary eigen-frequencies are identified as unstable, and their inevitable destiny is gravitational collapse, resulting in the formation of a BH. We consider the interior of these unstable anisotropic NSs to be a non-ideal fluid in a non-adiabatic background in order to study its dynamical evolution during the collapse. We examine the temporal evolution of key properties of NSs, such as mass, density, heat flux, and anisotropy during the process of gravitational collapse. We present an innovative and viable approach to detect such high-energy gravitational collapse events, providing valuable insights into the properties of the static NS before its collapse.</description>

      <title>GRMHD simulations of accretion flows onto massive binary black hole mergers embedded in a thin slab of gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of merging equal-mass, spinning black holes embedded in an equatorial thin slab of magnetized gas. We evolve black holes either non-spinning, with spins aligned to the orbital angular momentum, and with misaligned spins. The rest-mass density of the gas slab follows a Gaussian profile symmetric relative to the equatorial plane and it is initially either stationary or with Keplerian rotational support. As part of our diagnostics, we follow the accretion of matter onto the black hole horizons and the Poynting luminosity. Throughout the inspiral phase, the configurations with non-zero spins display modulations in the mass accretion rate that are proportional to the orbital frequency and its multiples. Our frequency analysis suggests that these modulations are influenced by the initial geometry and angular momentum of the gas distribution. In contrast to binary models evolved in the gas cloud scenario, we do not observe a significant increase in the mass accretion rate after the merger in any of our simulations. This observation brings attention to a potential link between the electromagnetic signatures of massive binary black hole mergers and the geometrical distribution of the surrounding gas. It also suggests the possibility of not detecting a peak luminosity at the time of merger in future electromagnetic observations.</description>

      <title>State-independent Black Hole Interiors from the Crossed Product</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05912v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Opinion is divided about the nature of state dependence in the black hole interior. Some argue that it is a necessary feature, while others argue it is a bug. In this paper, we consider the extended half-sided modular translation $U(s_0)$ (with $s_0 &gt; 0$) of Leutheusser and Liu that takes us inside the horizon. We note that we can use this operator to construct a modular Hamiltonian $H$ and a conjugation $J$ on the infalling time-evolved wedges. The original thermofield double translates to a new cyclic and separating vector in the shifted algebra. We use these objects and the Connes cocycle to repeat Witten's crossed product construction in this new setting, and to obtain a Type II$_\infty$ algebra that is independent of the various choices, in particular that of the cyclic separating vector. Our emergent times are implicitly boundary-dressed. But if one admits an ``extra'' observer in the interior, we argue that the (state-independent) algebra can be Type I or Type II$_1$ instead of Type II$_\infty$, depending on whether the observer's light cone contains an entire Cauchy slice or not. Along with these general considerations, we present some specific calculations in the setting of the Poincare BTZ black hole. We identify a generalization of modular translations in BTZ-Kruskal coordinates that is pointwise (as opposed to non-local) and is analytically tractable, exploiting a connection with the covering AdS-space. These evolutions can reach the singularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we follow the framework given in the article {\it Physica A}, \textbf{158}, pg 58-63 (1989) by R. Laflamme to derive the thermofield double state for a causal diamond using the Euclidean path integral formalism, and subsequently derive the causal diamond temperature. The interpretation of the physical and fictitious system in the thermofield double state arises naturally from the boundary conditions of the fields defined on the Euclidean sections of the cylindrical background geometry $S^{1}_{\beta}\times \mathbb{R}$, where $\beta$ defines the periodicity of the Euclidean time coordinate and $S^{1}_{\beta}$ is a circumference of length $\beta$. The temperature detected by a static diamond observer at $x=0$ matches with the thermofield double temperature derived via this path integral procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00051v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown that (near-)extremal Kerr black holes are sensitive probes of small higher-derivative corrections to general relativity. In particular, these corrections produce diverging tidal forces on the horizon in the extremal limit. We show that adding a black hole charge makes this effect qualitatively stronger. Higher-derivative corrections to the Kerr-Newman solution produce tidal forces that scale inversely in the black hole temperature. We find that, unlike the Kerr case, for realistic values of the black hole charge large tidal forces can arise before quantum corrections due to the Schwarzian mode become important, so that the near-horizon behavior of the black hole is dictated by higher-derivative terms in the effective theory.</description>

      <title>The Schwarzschild Black Hole from Perturbation Theory to all Orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13216v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Applying the quantum field theoretic perturbiner approach to Einstein gravity, we compute the metric of a Schwarzschild black hole order by order in perturbation theory. Using recursion, this calculation can be carried out in de Donder gauge to all orders in Newton's constant. The result is a geometric series which is convergent outside a disk of finite radius, and it agrees within its region of convergence with the known de Donder gauge metric of a Schwarzschild black hole. It thus provides a first all-order perturbative computation in Einstein gravity with a matter source, and this series converges to the known non-perturbative expression in the expected range of convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [1] we pointed out that in the Dark Dimension scenario [2] theoretical issues arise when the prediction for the vacuum energy $\rho$, that is obtained from swampland conjectures in string theory, is confronted with the corresponding result for $\rho$ in the field theory limit. One of the problems arises from the field theory side and is due to previous results for $\rho$ that, according to our analysis, turn out to be incorrect, although widely spread. Our work was challenged in [3]. Here we show why in our opinion the claims in [3] are inconsistent, actually based on arguments deprived of physical meaning, providing further support to our findings. We conclude by discussing ideas on the physical mechanism that could trigger the suppression of large UV contributions to $\rho$.</description>
