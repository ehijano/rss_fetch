      <title>gghic: A Versatile R Package for Exploring and Visualizing 3D Genome Organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: The three-dimensional (3D) organization of the genome plays a critical role in regulating gene expression and maintaining cellular homeostasis. Disruptions in this spatial organization can result in abnormal chromatin interactions, contributing to the development of various diseases including cancer. Advances in chromosome conformation capture technologies, such as Hi-C, have enabled researchers to study genome architecture at high resolution. However, the efficient visualization and interpretation of these complex datasets remain a major challenge, particularly when integrating genomic annotations and inter-chromosomal interactions.
  Results: We present gghic, an R package that extends the ggplot2 framework to enable intuitive and customizable visualization of genomic interaction data. gghic introduces novel layers for generating triangular heatmaps of chromatin interactions and annotating them with features such as chromatin loops, topologically associated domains (TADs), gene/transcript models, and data tracks (e.g., ChIP-seq signals). The package supports data from multiple chromosomes, facilitating the exploration of inter-chromosomal interactions. Built to integrate seamlessly with the R/Bioconductor ecosystem, gghic is compatible with widely used genomic data formats, including HiCExperiment and GInteractions objects. We demonstrate the utility of gghic by replicating a published figure showing a translocation event in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), highlighting its ability to integrate genomic annotations and generate publication-quality figures.
  Availability and implementation: The R package can be accessed at https://github.com/jasonwong-lab/gghic and is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 3.0.</description>

      <title>Timestamp calibration for time-series single cell RNA-seq expression data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Timestamp automatic annotation (TAA) is a crucial procedure for analyzing time-series ScRNA-seq data, as they unveil dynamic biological developments and cell regeneration process. However, current TAA methods heavily rely on manual timestamps, often overlooking their reliability. This oversight can significantly degrade the performance of timestamp automatic annotation due to noisy timestamps. Nevertheless, the current approach for addressing this issue tends to select less critical cleaned samples for timestamp calibration. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a novel timestamp calibration model called ScPace for handling noisy labeled time-series ScRNA-seq data. This approach incorporates a latent variable indicator within a base classifier instead of probability sampling to detect noisy samples effectively. To validate our proposed method, we conducted experiments on both simulated and real time-series ScRNA-seq datasets. Cross-validation experiments with different artificial mislabeling rates demonstrate that ScPace outperforms previous approaches. Furthermore, after calibrating the timestamps of the original time-series ScRNA-seq data using our method, we performed supervised pseudotime analysis, revealing that ScPace enhances its performance significantly. These findings suggest that ScPace is an effective tool for timestamp calibration by enabling reclassification and deletion of detected noisy labeled samples while maintaining robustness across diverse ranges of time-series ScRNA-seq datasets.

      <title>iSEEtree: interactive explorer for hierarchical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02882v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\textbf{Motivation:}$ Hierarchical data structures are prevalent across several fields of research, as they represent an organised and efficient approach to study complex interconnected systems. Their significance is particularly evident in microbiome analysis, where microbial communities are classified at various taxonomic levels along the phylogenetic tree. In light of this trend, the R/Bioconductor community has established a reproducible analytical framework for hierarchical data, which relies on the highly generic and optimised TreeSummarizedExperiment data container. However, using this framework requires basic proficiency in programming.
  $\textbf{Results:}$ To reduce the entry requirements, we developed iSEEtree, an R shiny app which provides a visual interface for the analysis and exploration of TreeSummarizedExperiment objects, thereby expanding the interactive graphics capabilities of related work to hierarchical structures. This way, users can interactively explore several aspects of their data without the need for extensive knowledge of R programming. We describe how iSEEtree enables the exploration of hierarchical multi-table data and demonstrate its functionality with applications to microbiome analysis.
  $\textbf{Availability and Implementation:}$ iSEEtree was implemented in the R programming language and is available on Bioconductor at https://bioconductor.org/packages/iSEEtree under an Artistic 2.0 license.

      <title>Single-Cell Omics Arena: A Benchmark Study for Large Language Models on Cell Type Annotation Using Single-Cell Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, the revolution in single-cell sequencing has enabled the simultaneous molecular profiling of various modalities across thousands of individual cells, allowing scientists to investigate the diverse functions of complex tissues and uncover underlying disease mechanisms. Among all the analytical steps, assigning individual cells to specific types is fundamental for understanding cellular heterogeneity. However, this process is usually labor-intensive and requires extensive expert knowledge. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their ability to efficiently process and synthesize vast corpora of text to automatically extract essential biological knowledge, such as marker genes, potentially promoting more efficient and automated cell type annotations. To thoroughly evaluate the capability of modern instruction-tuned LLMs in automating the cell type identification process, we introduce SOAR, a comprehensive benchmarking study of LLMs for cell type annotation tasks in single-cell genomics. Specifically, we assess the performance of 8 instruction-tuned LLMs across 11 datasets, spanning multiple cell types and species. Our study explores the potential of LLMs to accurately classify and annotate cell types in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, while extending their application to multiomics data through cross-modality translation. Additionally, we evaluate the effectiveness of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques in generating detailed biological insights during the annotation process. The results demonstrate that LLMs can provide robust interpretations of single-cell data without requiring additional fine-tuning, advancing the automation of cell type annotation in genomics research.</description>
