      <title>Stability Enhancement of a Self-Amplified Spontaneous Emission Free-electron Laser with Bunching Containment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE) mechanism, the fundamental operating principle of numerous free-electron laser (FEL) facilities, is driven by electron beam shot noise and leads to significant fluctuations in the output pulse energy. This study presents a robust method for improving pulse energy stability by incorporating a dispersion element that introduces longitudinal dispersion into the electron beam during the exponential growth phase of the SASE process. At this phase, the density modulation of the electron beam, characterized by the bunching factor, undergoes large fluctuations, resulting in substantial variations in the emitted radiation power. The introduction of longitudinal dispersion allows for controlled manipulation of the bunching distribution, suppressing fluctuations and enhancing pulse energy stability. The stabilization mechanism is explained in this paper, and its impact on the radiation properties is analyzed for both the standard SASE scheme and advanced lasing setups, such as a two-stage lasing process for two-color pulse generation, with the initial stage operating in SASE mode.</description>

      <title>Symplectic tracking through curved three dimensional fields by a method of generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symplectic integrator plays a pivotal role in the long-term tracking of charged particles within accelerators. To get symplectic maps in accurate simulation of single-particle trajectories, two key components are addressed: precise analytical expressions for arbitrary electromagnetic fields and a robust treatment of the equations of motion. In a source-free region, the electromagnetic fields can be decomposed into harmonic functions, applicable to both scalar and vector potentials, encompassing both straight and curved reference trajectories. These harmonics are constructed according to the boundary surface's field data due to uniqueness theorem. Finding generating functions to meet the Hamilton-Jacobi equation via a perturbative ansatz, we derive symplectic maps that are independent of the expansion order. This method yields a direct mapping from initial to final coordinates in a large step, bypassing the transition of intermediate coordinates. Our developed particle-tracking algorithm translates the field harmonics into beam trajectories, offering a high-resolution integration method in accelerator simulations.</description>

      <title>Compact Accelerator-Based Production of Carrier-free $^{177}$Lu From 18 MeV $D^+$ on [$^{176}$Yb]Yb$_2$O$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use experimental and simulated excitation functions to estimate the yield of deuteron activations on a [$^{176}$Yb]Yb$_2$O$_3$ target enriched to 99%. Subsequent calculations are used to determine the production of radiotherapeutic $^{177}$Lu according to a 10 mA, 18 MeV $D^+$ compact linear accelerator. The design comprises a single radio-frequency quadrupole accelerator (RFQ) and seven drift tube linacs (DTLs) that achieve a beam efficiency of 99.5% over a length of $12\,\text{m}$. Our results show that a 5-day irradiation can yield more than $1$ mg of $^{177}$Lu, exceeding $4.4$ TBq. After a 2 day processing period, it is estimated that the sample will have a radiopurity greater than 99.8% (carrier-free). Given recent EMA and FDA approvals of $^{177}$Lu-DOTATATE and $^{177}$Lu-PSMA-617, our results confirm the viability of accelerator-based $^{177}$Lu production and provide a promising clinical alternative to reactor-based methods.</description>
