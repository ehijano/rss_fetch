      <title>Distributed agency in second language learning and teaching through generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI offers significant opportunities for language learning. Tools like ChatGPT can provide informal second language practice through chats in written or voice forms, with the learner specifying through prompts conversational parameters such as proficiency level, language register, and discussion topics. AI can be instructed to give corrective feedback, create practice exercises, or develop an extended study plan. Instructors can use AI to build learning and assessment materials in a variety of media. AI is likely to make immersive technologies more powerful and versatile, moving away from scripted interactions. For both learners and teachers, it is important to understand the limitations of AI systems that arise from their purely statistical model of human language, which limits their ability to deal with nuanced social and cultural aspects of language use. Additionally, there are ethical concerns over how AI systems are created as well as practical constraints in their use, especially for less privileged populations. The power and versatility of AI tools are likely to turn them into valuable and constant companions in many peoples lives (akin to smartphones), creating a close connection that goes beyond simple tool use. Ecological theories such as sociomaterialism are helpful in examining the shared agency that develops through close user-AI interactions, as are the perspectives on human-object relations from Indigenous cultures.</description>

      <title>A Picture is Worth 500 Labels: A Case Study of Demographic Disparities in Local Machine Learning Models for Instagram and TikTok</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mobile apps have embraced user privacy by moving their data processing to the user's smartphone. Advanced machine learning (ML) models, such as vision models, can now locally analyze user images to extract insights that drive several functionalities. Capitalizing on this new processing model of locally analyzing user images, we analyze two popular social media apps, TikTok and Instagram, to reveal (1) what insights vision models in both apps infer about users from their image and video data and (2) whether these models exhibit performance disparities with respect to demographics. As vision models provide signals for sensitive technologies like age verification and facial recognition, understanding potential biases in these models is crucial for ensuring that users receive equitable and accurate services.
  We develop a novel method for capturing and evaluating ML tasks in mobile apps, overcoming challenges like code obfuscation, native code execution, and scalability. Our method comprises ML task detection, ML pipeline reconstruction, and ML performance assessment, specifically focusing on demographic disparities. We apply our methodology to TikTok and Instagram, revealing significant insights. For TikTok, we find issues in age and gender prediction accuracy, particularly for minors and Black individuals. In Instagram, our analysis uncovers demographic disparities in the extraction of over 500 visual concepts from images, with evidence of spurious correlations between demographic features and certain concepts.</description>

      <title>EmoScan: Automatic Screening of Depression Symptoms in Romanized Sinhala Tweets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the utilization of Romanized Sinhala social media data to identify individuals at risk of depression. A machine learning-based framework is presented for the automatic screening of depression symptoms by analyzing language patterns, sentiment, and behavioural cues within a comprehensive dataset of social media posts. The research has been carried out to compare the suitability of Neural Networks over the classical machine learning techniques. The proposed Neural Network with an attention layer which is capable of handling long sequence data, attains a remarkable accuracy of 93.25% in detecting depression symptoms, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods. These findings underscore the efficacy of this approach in pinpointing individuals in need of proactive interventions and support. Mental health professionals, policymakers, and social media companies can gain valuable insights through the proposed model. Leveraging natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, this work offers a promising pathway for mental health screening in the digital era. By harnessing the potential of social media data, the framework introduces a proactive method for recognizing and assisting individuals at risk of depression. In conclusion, this research contributes to the advancement of proactive interventions and support systems for mental health, thereby influencing both research and practical applications in the field.</description>

      <title>FairRAG: Fair Human Generation via Fair Retrieval Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing text-to-image generative models reflect or even amplify societal biases ingrained in their training data. This is especially concerning for human image generation where models are biased against certain demographic groups. Existing attempts to rectify this issue are hindered by the inherent limitations of the pre-trained models and fail to substantially improve demographic diversity. In this work, we introduce Fair Retrieval Augmented Generation (FairRAG), a novel framework that conditions pre-trained generative models on reference images retrieved from an external image database to improve fairness in human generation. FairRAG enables conditioning through a lightweight linear module that projects reference images into the textual space. To enhance fairness, FairRAG applies simple-yet-effective debiasing strategies, providing images from diverse demographic groups during the generative process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FairRAG outperforms existing methods in terms of demographic diversity, image-text alignment, and image fidelity while incurring minimal computational overhead during inference.</description>

      <title>TFB: Towards Comprehensive and Fair Benchmarking of Time Series Forecasting Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time series are generated in diverse domains such as economic, traffic, health, and energy, where forecasting of future values has numerous important applications. Not surprisingly, many forecasting methods are being proposed. To ensure progress, it is essential to be able to study and compare such methods empirically in a comprehensive and reliable manner. To achieve this, we propose TFB, an automated benchmark for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods. TFB advances the state-of-the-art by addressing shortcomings related to datasets, comparison methods, and evaluation pipelines: 1) insufficient coverage of data domains, 2) stereotype bias against traditional methods, and 3) inconsistent and inflexible pipelines. To achieve better domain coverage, we include datasets from 10 different domains: traffic, electricity, energy, the environment, nature, economic, stock markets, banking, health, and the web. We also provide a time series characterization to ensure that the selected datasets are comprehensive. To remove biases against some methods, we include a diverse range of methods, including statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning methods, and we also support a variety of evaluation strategies and metrics to ensure a more comprehensive evaluations of different methods. To support the integration of different methods into the benchmark and enable fair comparisons, TFB features a flexible and scalable pipeline that eliminates biases. Next, we employ TFB to perform a thorough evaluation of 21 Univariate Time Series Forecasting (UTSF) methods on 8,068 univariate time series and 14 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) methods on 25 datasets. The benchmark code and data are available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/TFB.</description>

      <title>Optimal Hospital Capacity Management During Demand Surges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15738v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective hospital capacity management is pivotal for enhancing patient care quality, operational efficiency, and healthcare system resilience, notably during demand spikes like those seen in the COVID-19 pandemic. However, devising optimal capacity strategies is complicated by fluctuating demand, conflicting objectives, and multifaceted practical constraints. This study presents a data-driven framework to optimize capacity management decisions within hospital systems during surge events. Two key decisions are optimized over a tactical planning horizon: allocating dedicated capacity to surge patients and transferring incoming patients between emergency departments (EDs) of hospitals to better distribute demand. The optimization models are formulated as robust mixed-integer linear programs, enabling efficient computation of optimal decisions that are robust against demand uncertainty. The models incorporate practical constraints and costs, including setup times and costs for adding surge capacity, restrictions on ED patient transfers, and relative costs of different decisions that reflect impacts on care quality and operational efficiency. The methodology is evaluated retrospectively in a hospital system during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic to demonstrate the potential impact of the recommended decisions. The results show that optimally allocating beds and transferring just 32 patients over a 63 day period around the peak, about one transfer every two days, could have reduced the need for surge capacity in the hospital system by nearly 90%. Overall, this work introduces a practical tool to transform capacity management decision-making, enabling proactive planning and the use of data-driven recommendations to improve outcomes.</description>
