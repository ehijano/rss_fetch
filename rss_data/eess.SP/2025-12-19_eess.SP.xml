      <title>Multiple Source Localization via Local Radio Map Construction in Urban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately and efficiently addressing the multiple source localization (MSL) problem in urban environments, particularly designing a general method adaptable to an arbitrary number of sources, plays a crucial role in various fields such as cognitive radio (CR).
  Existing methods either fail to effectively utilize received signal strength (RSS) information without redundancy or lack generalizability to an arbitrary number of sources.
  In this work, we propose the Local Radio Map-Aided Multiple Source Localization Framework (LRM-MSL), which is a general method capable of handling an arbitrary number of sources.
  First, this framework constructs a local radio map that retains only the RSS information around the sources and binarizes it. Then, the connected component analysis tool is applied to the binarized map, which implements multi-source separation, transforming the MSL problem into a series of single-source localization (SSL) tasks.
  Finally, we design a numerical coordinate regression network to perform the SSL tasks.
  Since there is no publicly available RSS dataset for MSL, we construct the VaryTxLoc dataset to evaluate the performance of LRM-MSL. Experimental results demonstrate that LRM-MSL is an accurate and effective method, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches. Our code and dataset can be downloaded from https://github.com/hereis77/LRM-MSL.</description>

      <title>TinyMyo: a Tiny Foundation Model for Flexible EMG Signal Processing at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface electromyography (EMG) is a non-invasive sensing modality used in several domains, including biomechanics, rehabilitation, prosthetic control, and emerging human-machine interaction paradigms. Despite decades of use, significant challenges remain in achieving robust generalization across subjects, recording systems, and acquisition protocols. To tackle these challenges, foundation models (FMs) are gaining traction when targeting end-to-end applications based on EMG signals. Yet, existing EMG FMs remain limited to single downstream tasks and lack deployability on embedded platforms. In this work, we present TinyMyo, a lightweight FM based on a Transformer encoder architecture. The model is pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on publicly available datasets and achieves high reconstruction fidelity with only 3.6M parameters. With minimal task-specific head adaptations, the same backbone is used to tackle multiple downstream tasks, leveraging datasets acquired from diverse sensing locations and hardware platforms. We demonstrate generalization across hand gesture classification, hand kinematic regression, speech production and recognition, with performance comparable to or surpassing the state of the art (SoA), and model size below 5M parameters. We achieve SoA results compared to previous FM-based works on the NinaPro DB5 ($89.4\pm0.16\%$), UCI-EMG ($97.56\pm0.32\%$), and EPN-612 ($96.74\pm0.09\%$) datasets. We report, to the best of our knowledge, the first deployment of an EMG FM on an ultra-low-power microcontroller (GAP9), achieving an average power envelope of 36.45mW. By open-sourcing the pre-trained and the downstream task architectures (https://github.com/pulp-bio/BioFoundation), we aim to provide a flexible resource that can accelerate future research and serve as a common foundation for the EMG community.</description>

      <title>HiLTS: Human in the Loop Therapeutic System: A Wireless-enabled Precision Medicine Platform for Brainwave Entrainment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Epileptic seizures arise from abnormally synchronised neural activity and remain a major global health challenge, affecting more than 50 million people worldwide. Despite advances in pharmacological interventions, a significant proportion of patients continue to experience uncontrolled seizures, underscoring the need for alternative neuromodulation strategies. Rhythmic neural entrainment has recently emerged as a promising mechanism for disrupting pathological synchrony, but most existing systems rely on complex analogue electronics or high-power stimulation hardware. This study investigates a minimal digital custom-designed chip that generates a stable 6 Hz oscillation capable of entraining epileptic seizure activity. Using a publicly available EEG seizure dataset, we extracted and averaged analogue seizure waveforms, digitised them to emulate neural front-ends, and directly interfaced the digitised signals with digital output recordings acquired from the chip using a Saleae Logic analyser. The chip pulse train was resampled and low-pass-reconstructed to produce an analogue 6 Hz waveform, allowing direct comparison between seizure morphology, its digitised representation, and the entrained output. Frequency-domain and time-domain analyses demonstrate that the chip imposes a narrow-band 6 Hz rhythm that overrides the broadband spectral profile of seizure activity. These results provide a proof-of-concept for low-power digital custom-designed entrainment as a potential pathway toward simplified, wearable seizure-interruption devices for precision medicine and future healthcare devices.</description>

      <title>Concurrence: A dependence criterion for time series, applied to biological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the statistical dependence between observed signals is a primary tool for scientific discovery. However, biological systems often exhibit complex non-linear interactions that currently cannot be captured without a priori knowledge or large datasets. We introduce a criterion for dependence, whereby two time series are deemed dependent if one can construct a classifier that distinguishes between temporally aligned vs. misaligned segments extracted from them. We show that this criterion, concurrence, is theoretically linked with dependence, and can become a standard approach for scientific analyses across disciplines, as it can expose relationships across a wide spectrum of signals (fMRI, physiological and behavioral data) without ad-hoc parameter tuning or large amounts of data.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Secrecy and Covert Communications (SSACC) in Mobility-Aware RIS-Aided Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a simultaneous secrecy and covert communications (SSACC) scheme in a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided network with a cooperative jammer. The scheme enhances communication security by maximizing the secrecy capacity and the detection error probability (DEP). Under a worst-case scenario for covert communications, we consider that the eavesdropper can optimally adjust the detection threshold to minimize the DEP. Accordingly, we derive closedform expressions for both average minimum DEP (AMDEP) and average secrecy capacity (ASC). To balance AMDEP and ASC, we propose a new performance metric and design an algorithm based on generative diffusion models (GDM) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The algorithm maximizes data rates under user mobility while ensuring high AMDEP and ASC by optimizing power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves faster convergence and superior performance compared to conventional deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) methods, thereby validating its effectiveness in balancing security and capacity performance.</description>

      <title>Fast Collaborative Inference via Distributed Speculative Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by allowing a small draft model to predict multiple future tokens for verification by a larger target model. In AI-native radio access networks (AI-RAN), this enables device-edge collaborative inference but introduces significant uplink overhead, as existing distributed speculative decoding schemes transmit full vocabulary logits at every step. We propose a sparsify-then-sample strategy, Truncated Sparse Logits Transmission (TSLT), which transmits only the logits and indices of a truncated candidate set. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the acceptance rate is preserved under TSLT. TSLT is further extended to multi-candidate case, where multiple draft candidates per step increase acceptance probability. Experiments show that TSLT significantly reduces uplink communication while maintaining end-to-end inference latency and model quality, demonstrating its effectiveness for scalable, communication-efficient distributed LLM inference in future AI-RAN systems.</description>

      <title>CPMamba: Selective State Space Models for MIMO Channel Prediction in High-Mobility Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel prediction is a key technology for improving the performance of various functions such as precoding, adaptive modulation, and resource allocation in MIMO-OFDM systems. Especially in high-mobility scenarios with fast time-varying channels, it is crucial for resisting channel aging and ensuring communication quality. However, existing methods suffer from high complexity and the inability to accurately model the temporal variations of channels. To address this issue, this paper proposes CPMamba -- an efficient channel prediction framework based on the selective state space model. The proposed CPMamba architecture extracts features from historical channel state information (CSI) using a specifically designed feature extraction and embedding network and employs stacked residual Mamba modules for temporal modeling. By leveraging an input-dependent selective mechanism to dynamically adjust state transitions, it can effectively capture the long-range dependencies between the CSIs while maintaining a linear computational complexity. Simulation results under the 3GPP standard channel model demonstrate that CPMamba achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy across all scenarios, along with superior generalization and robustness. Compared to existing baseline models, CPMamba reduces the number of parameters by approximately 50 percent while achieving comparable or better performance, thereby significantly lowering the barrier for practical deployment.</description>

      <title>An active-set algorithm for spectral unmixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear spectral unmixing under nonnegativity and sum-to-one constraints is a convex optimization problem for which many algorithms were proposed. In practice, especially for supervised unmixing (i.e., with a large dictionary), solutions tend to be sparse due to the nonnegativity of the abundances, thereby motivating the use of an active-set solver. Given the problem specific features, it seems advantageous to design a dedicated algorithm in order to gain computational performance compared to generic solvers. In this paper, we propose to derive such a specific algorithm, while extending the nonnegativity constraints to broader minimum abundance constraints.</description>

      <title>Robust 6G OFDM High-Mobility Communications Using Delay-Doppler Superimposed Pilots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, a novel receiver architecture for orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communications in 6G high-mobility scenarios is developed. In particular, a delay-Doppler superimposed pilot (SP) scheme is used for channel estimation (CE) by adding a single pilot in the delay-Doppler domain. Unlike previous research on delay-Doppler superimposed pilots in OFDM systems, intercarrier interference (ICI) effects, fractional delays, and Doppler shifts are considered. Consequently, a disjoint fractional delay-Doppler estimation algorithm is derived, and a reduced-complexity equalization method based on the Landweber iteration, which exploits intrinsic channel structure, is proposed. Simulation results reveal that the proposed receiver architecture achieves robust communication performance across various mobility conditions, with speeds of up to 1000 km/h, and increases the effective throughput compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Efficient Precoding for LEO Satellites: A Low-Complexity Matrix Inversion Method via Woodbury Matrix Identity and arSVD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of massive active antenna arrays in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites necessitates computationally efficient and adaptive precoding techniques to mitigate dynamic channel variations and enhance spectral efficiency. Regularized zero-forcing (RZF) precoding is widely used in multi-user MIMO systems; however, its real-time implementation is limited by the computationally intensive inversion of the Gram matrix. In this work, we develop a low-complexity framework that integrates the Woodbury (WB) formula with adaptive randomized singular value decomposition (arSVD) to efficiently update the Gram matrix inverse as the satellite moves along its orbit. By leveraging low-rank perturbations, the WB formula reduces inversion complexity, while arSVD dynamically extracts dominant singular components, further enhancing computational efficiency. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed method achieves computational savings of up to 61\% compared to conventional RZF precoding with full matrix inversion, while incurring only a modest degradation in sum-rate performance. These results demonstrate that WB-arSVD offers a scalable and efficient solution for next-generation satellite communications, facilitating real-time deployment in power-constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Channel State Information Preprocessing for CSI-based Physical-Layer Authentication Using Reconciliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an adaptive preprocessing technique to enhance the accuracy of channel state information-based physical layer authentication (CSI-PLA) alleviating CSI variations and inconsistencies in the time domain. To this end, we develop an adaptive robust principal component analysis (A-RPCA) preprocessing method based on robust principal component analysis (RPCA). The performance evaluation is then conducted using a PLA framework based on information reconciliation, in which Gaussian approximation (GA) for Polar codes is leveraged for the design of short codelength Slepian Wolf decoders. Furthermore, an analysis of the proposed A-RPCA methods is carried out. Simulation results show that compared to a baseline scheme without preprocessing and without reconciliation, the proposed A-RPCA method substantially reduces the error probability after reconciliation and also substantially increases the detection probabilities that is also 1 in both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. We have compared against state-of the-art preprocessing schemes in both synthetic and real datasets, including principal component analysis (PCA) and robust PCA, autoencoders and the recursive projected compressive sensing (ReProCS) framework and we have validated the superior performance of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Misspecified Crame-Rao Bound for AoA Estimation at a ULA under a Spoofing Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A framework is presented for analyzing the impact of active attacks to location-based physical layer authentication (PLA) using the machinery of misspecified Cram\'er--Rao bound (MCRB). In this work, we focus on the MCRB in the angle-of-arrival (AoA) based authentication of a single antenna user when the verifier posseses an $M$ antenna element uniform linear array (ULA), assuming deterministic pilot signals; in our system model the presence of a spoofing adversary with an arbitrary number $L$ of antenna elements is assumed. We obtain a closed-form expression for the MCRB and demonstrate that the attack introduces in it a penalty term compared to the classic CRB, which does not depend on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) but on the adversary's location, the array geometry and the attacker precoding vector.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Specific Emitter Identification via Integrated Complex Variational Mode Decomposition and Spatial Attention Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specific emitter identification (SEI) utilizes passive hardware characteristics to authenticate transmitters, providing a robust physical-layer security solution. However, most deep-learning-based methods rely on extensive data or require prior information, which poses challenges in real-world scenarios with limited labeled data. We propose an integrated complex variational mode decomposition algorithm that decomposes and reconstructs complex-valued signals to approximate the original transmitted signals, thereby enabling more accurate feature extraction. We further utilize a temporal convolutional network to effectively model the sequential signal characteristics, and introduce a spatial attention mechanism to adaptively weight informative signal segments, significantly enhancing identification performance. Additionally, the branch network allows leveraging pre-trained weights from other data while reducing the need for auxiliary datasets. Ablation experiments on the simulated data demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of the model. An accuracy comparison on a public dataset reveals that our method achieves 96% accuracy using only 10 symbols without requiring any prior knowledge.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces in Practical Systems: Security and Privacy Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a transformative technology capable of reshaping wireless environments through dynamic manipulation of electromagnetic waves. While extensive research has explored their theoretical benefits for communication and sensing, practical deployments in smart environments such as homes, vehicles, and industrial settings remain limited and under-examined, particularly from security and privacy perspectives. This survey provides a comprehensive examination of RIS applications in real-world systems, with a focus on the security and privacy threats, vulnerabilities, and defensive strategies relevant to practical use. We analyze scenarios with two types of systems (with and without legitimate RIS) and two types of attackers (with and without malicious RIS), and demonstrate how RIS may introduce new attacks to practical systems, including eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing attacks. In response, we review defenses against RIS-related attacks in these systems, such as applying additional security algorithms, disrupting attackers, and early detection of unauthorized RIS. We also discuss scenarios in which the legitimate user applies an additional RIS to defend against attacks. To support future research, we also provide a collection of open-source tools, datasets, demos, and papers at: https://awesome-ris-security.github.io/. By highlighting RIS's functionality and its security/privacy challenges and opportunities, this survey aims to guide researchers and engineers toward the development of secure, resilient, and privacy-preserving RIS-enabled practical wireless systems and environments.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Radio Frequency Based Wireless Sensing of Lead Contamination in Soil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Widespread Pb (lead) contamination of urban soil significantly impacts food safety and public health and hinders city greening efforts. However, most existing technologies for measuring Pb are labor-intensive and costly. In this study, we propose SoilScanner, a radio frequency-based wireless system that can detect Pb in soils. This is based on our discovery that the propagation of different frequency band radio signals is affected differently by different salts such as NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in the soil. In a controlled experiment, manually adding NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in clean soil, we demonstrated that different salts reflected signals at different frequencies in distinct patterns. In addition, we confirmed the finding using uncontrolled field samples with a machine learning model. Our experiment results show that SoilScanner can classify soil samples into low-Pb and high-Pb categories (threshold at 200 ppm) with an accuracy of 72%, with no sample with &gt; 500 ppm of Pb being misclassified. The results of this study show that it is feasible to build portable and affordable Pb detection and screening devices based on wireless technology.</description>

      <title>BUILD with Precision: Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning the structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from observational data is a central problem in causal discovery, statistical signal processing, and machine learning. Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Silicon Photonics Extreme Learning Machine with Random Non-linearities as Neural Processor and Physical Unclonable Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An alternative extreme learning machine -ELM- paradigm is presented exploiting random non-linearities -RN, named RN-ELM, instead of a conventional fixed node non-linearity. This method is implemented on a hybrid neural engine, with the physical layer realized by an integrated silicon photonic mesh and the digital layer by a simple regression algorithm. Non-linearities are intrinsically non-power depended and are generated through non-linear frequency to power mapping offered by optical filters. The numerical evaluation is based on an experimentally derived transfer function of an all-pass filter, implemented on a silicon reconfigurable photonic integrated chip -RPIC. RN-ELM is evaluated in a twofold manner; first as a machine learning scheme, where the expressivity offered by multiple, yet random, activation functions lead to a compact and highly simplified design with 5 optical filters, offering state-of-the-art performance in time-series prediction tasks with minimum hardware requirements. The second scenario entails its deployment as a physical unclonable function -PUF, for authentication applications directly in the physical layer. In this case, the random activation functions are associated with unavoidable, fabrication related waveguide imperfections that can act as hardware signatures. Numerical results reveal a probability of cloning as low as 10e-15, which corresponds to a highly secure authentication token.</description>

      <title>Batch Normalization-Free Fully Integer Quantized Neural Networks via Progressive Tandem Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantised neural networks (QNNs) shrink models and reduce inference energy through low-bit arithmetic, yet most still depend on a running statistics batch normalisation (BN) layer, preventing true integer-only deployment. Prior attempts remove BN by parameter folding or tailored initialisation; while helpful, they rarely recover BN's stability and accuracy and often impose bespoke constraints. We present a BN-free, fully integer QNN trained via a progressive, layer-wise distillation scheme that slots into existing low-bit pipelines. Starting from a pretrained BN-enabled teacher, we use layer-wise targets and progressive compensation to train a student that performs inference exclusively with integer arithmetic and contains no BN operations. On ImageNet with AlexNet, the BN-free model attains competitive Top-1 accuracy under aggressive quantisation. The procedure integrates directly with standard quantisation workflows, enabling end-to-end integer-only inference for resource-constrained settings such as edge and embedded devices.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Radio Frequency Fingerprints for Device Identification: Tackling Cross-receiver Challenges in the Source-data-free Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of edge computing, Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) has become increasingly important for secure device authentication. However, practical deployment of deep learning-based RFFI models is hindered by a critical challenge: their performance often degrades significantly when applied across receivers with different hardware characteristics due to distribution shifts introduced by receiver variation. To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI.</description>

      <title>Subspace tracking: a novel measurement method to test the standard phase noise model of optical frequency combs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of digital signal processing (DSP) assisted coherent detection has been a cornerstone of modern fiber-optic communication systems. The ability to digitally, i.e. after analogue-to-digital converter, compensate for chromatic dispersion, polarization mode dispersion, and phase noise has rendered traditional analog feedback loops largely obsolete. While analog techniques remain prevalent for phase noise characterization of single-frequency lasers, the phase noise characterization of optical frequency combs presents a greater challenge. This complexity arises from different number of phase noise sources affecting an optical frequency comb. Here, we show how a phase noise measurement techniques method based on multi-heterodyne coherent detection and DSP-based subspace tracking can be used to identify, measure and quantify various phase noise sources associated with an optical frequency comb.</description>

      <title>Coordinated Anti-Jamming Resilience in Swarm Networks via Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reactive jammers pose a severe security threat to robotic-swarm networks by selectively disrupting inter-agent communications and undermining formation integrity and mission success. Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments.</description>

      <title>Tri-timescale Beamforming Design for Tri-hybrid Architectures with Reconfigurable Antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03620v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable antennas possess the capability to dynamically adjust their fundamental operating characteristics, thereby enhancing system adaptability and performance. To fully exploit this flexibility in modern wireless communication systems, this paper considers a novel tri-hybrid beamforming architecture, which seamlessly integrates pattern-reconfigurable antennas with both analog and digital beamforming. The proposed tri-hybrid architecture operates across three layers: (\textit{i}) a radiation beamformer in the electromagnetic (EM) domain for dynamic pattern alignment, (\textit{ii}) an analog beamformer in the radio-frequency (RF) domain for array gain enhancement, and (\textit{iii}) a digital beamformer in the baseband (BB) domain for multi-user interference mitigation. To establish a solid theoretical foundation, we first develop a comprehensive mathematical model for the tri-hybrid beamforming system and formulate the signal model for a multi-user multi-input single-output (MU-MISO) scenario. The optimization objective is to maximize the sum-rate while satisfying practical constraints. Given the challenges posed by high pilot overhead and computational complexity, we introduce an innovative tri-timescale beamforming framework, wherein the radiation beamformer is optimized over a long-timescale, the analog beamformer over a medium-timescale, and the digital beamformer over a short-timescale. This hierarchical strategy effectively balances performance and implementation feasibility. Simulation results validate the performance gains of the proposed tri-hybrid architecture and demonstrate that the tri-timescale design significantly reduces pilot overhead and computational complexity, highlighting its potential for future wireless communication systems.</description>

      <title>Blinding the Wiretapper: RIS-Enabled User Occultation in the ISAC Era</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An undesirable consequence of the foreseeable proliferation of sophisticated integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) technologies is the enabling of spoofing, by malicious agents, of situational information (such as proximity, direction or location) of legitimate users of wireless systems. In order to mitigate this threat, we present a novel ISAC scheme that, aided by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), enables the occultation of the positions of user equipment (UE) from wiretappers, while maintaining both sensing and desired communication performance between the UEs and a legitimate base station (BS). To that end, we first formulate an RIS phase-shift optimization problem that jointly maximizes the sum-rate performance of the UEs (communication objective), while minimizing the projection of the wiretapper's effective channel onto the legitimate channel (hiding objective), thereby disrupting the attempts by a wiretapper of localizing the UEs. Then, in order to efficiently solve the resulting non-convex joint optimization problem, a novel manifold optimization algorithm is derived, whose effectiveness is validated by numerical results, which demonstrate that the proposed approach preserves legitimate ISAC performance while significantly degrading the wiretapper's sensing capability.</description>

      <title>Joint Power Allocation and Reflecting-Element Activation for Energy Efficiency Maximization in IRS-Aided Communications Under CSI Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the joint power allocation and reflecting element (RE) activation to maximize the energy efficiency (EE) in communication systems assisted by an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS), taking into account imperfections in channel state information (CSI). The robust optimization problem is mixed integer, i.e., the optimization variables are continuous (transmit power) and discrete (binary states of REs). In order to solve this challenging problem we develop two algorithms. The first one is an alternating optimization (AO) method that attains a suboptimal solution with low complexity, based on the Lambert W function and a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. The second one is a branch-and-bound (B&amp;B) method that uses AO as its subroutine and is formally guaranteed to achieve a globally optimal solution. Both algorithms do not require any external optimization solver for their implementation. Furthermore, numerical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform the baseline schemes, AO achieves near-optimal performance in most cases, and B&amp;B has low computational complexity on average.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Port Selection and Beamforming Design for Integrated Data and Energy Transfer Assisted by Fluid Antennas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) is considered as a key enabler of 6G, as it can provide both wireless energy transfer (WET) and wireless data transfer (WDT) services towards low power devices. Thanks to the extra degree of freedom provided by fluid antenna (FA), incorporating FA into IDET systems presents a promising approach to enhance energy efficiency performance. This paper investigates a FA assisted IDET system, where the transmitter is equipped with multiple FAs and transmits wireless signals to the data receiver (DR) and the energy receiver (ER), which are both equipped with a single traditional antenna. The switching delay and energy consumption induced by port selection are taken into account in IDET system for the first time. We aim to obtain the optimal beamforming vector and the port selection strategy at the transmitter, in order to maximize the short-term and long-term WET efficiency, respectively. The instant sub-optimal solution is obtained by alternatively optimizing the beamforming vector and port selection in each transmission frame, while a novel constrained soft actor critic (C-SAC) algorithm is proposed to find the feasible policy of port selection from the long-term perspective. Simulation results demonstrate that our scheme is able to achieve greater gain in terms of both the short-term and long-term WET efficiency compared to other benchmarks, while not degrading WDT performance.</description>

      <title>Dual-Channel Tomographic Tactile Skin with Pneumatic Pressure Sensing for Improved Force Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tactile skins based on Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) enable large-area contact localization with few electrodes, but suffer from nonuniform sensitivity that limits force estimation accuracy. This work introduces a dual-channel tactile skin that integrates an EIT layer with a pneumatic pressure layer and a calibration framework that leverages their complementary strengths. The EIT layer provides robust multi-contact localization, while the pneumatic pressure layer supplies a stable scalar measurement that serves as contact force estimation. A location-aware correction method is introduced, learning smooth spatial gain and offset fields from a single-session calibration, enabling spatially consistent multi-contact force estimation. The proposed system achieves accurate force estimation across diverse contact configurations, generalizes to varying indenter sizes, and preserves EIT's inherent advantages in multi-contact localization. By letting the pneumatic pressure layer handle the force estimation and using the EIT layer to determine where each contact occurs, the method avoids the need for large datasets, complicated calibration setups, and heavy machine-learning pipelines often required by previous EIT-only approaches. This dual-channel design provides a practical, scalable, and easy-to-calibrate solution for building large-area robotic skins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15612v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Cartan-geometric, jet bundle formulation of curvature-aware variance bounds in parametric statistical estimation is developed. Building on our earlier extrinsic Hilbert space approach to the Cram\'er-Rao and Bhattacharyya-type inequalities, we show that the curvature corrections induced by the square root embedding of a statistical model admit a canonical intrinsic interpretation via jet geometry and Cartan's prolongation theory.
  For a scalar-parameter family with square root map $s_\theta=\sqrt{f(\cdot;\theta)}\in L^2(\mu)$, we regard $s_\theta$ as a section of the statistical bundle $E=\Theta\times L^2(\mu)$ and study its finite-order prolongations. We point out that the classical algebraic efficiency condition--that the estimator residual $(T-\theta)s_\theta$ lies in the span of derivatives of $s_\theta$ up to order $m$--is equivalent to the existence of a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) of order $m$ satisfied by the square root map. Geometrically, this means the prolonged section lies in an ODE-defined submanifold of the jet bundle and is an integral curve of the restricted Cartan vector field.
  The obstruction to such finite-order integrability is identified with the vertical component of the canonical Ehresmann connection on the jet tower, which coincides with the curvature correction term in variance bounds. This establishes a direct correspondence between algebraic projection conditions in $L^2(\mu)$ and intrinsic holonomy properties of statistical sections, yielding a unified geometric interpretation of higher-order information inequalities.</description>

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia, and its clinical assessment requires accurate characterization of atrial electrical activity. Noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) combined with deep learning (DL) approaches for estimating intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) from body surface potentials (BSPMs) has shown promise, but progress is hindered by the limited availability of paired BSPM-EGM datasets. To address this limitation, we investigate variational autoencoders (VAEs) for the generation of synthetic multichannel atrial EGMs. Two models are proposed: a sinus rhythm-specific VAE (VAE-S) and a class-conditioned VAE (VAE-C) trained on both sinus rhythm and AF signals. Generated EGMs are evaluated using morphological, spectral, and distributional similarity metrics. VAE-S achieves higher fidelity with respect to in silico EGMs, while VAE-C enables rhythm-specific generation at the expense of reduced sinus reconstruction quality. As a proof of concept, the generated EGMs are used for data augmentation in a downstream noninvasive EGM reconstruction task, where moderate augmentation improves estimation performance. These results demonstrate the potential of VAE-based generative modeling to alleviate data scarcity and enhance deep learning-based ECGI pipelines.</description>
