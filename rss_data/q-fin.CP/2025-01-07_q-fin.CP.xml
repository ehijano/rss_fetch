      <title>Finite Element Method for HJB in Option Pricing with Stock Borrowing Fees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mathematical finance, many derivatives from markets with frictions can be formulated as optimal control problems in the HJB framework. Analytical optimal control can result in highly nonlinear PDEs, which might yield unstable numerical results. Accurate and convergent numerical schemes are essential to leverage the benefits of the hedging process. In this study, we apply a finite element approach with a non-uniform mesh for the task of option pricing with stock borrowing fees, leading to an HJB equation that bypasses analytical optimal control in favor of direct PDE discretization. The time integration employs the theta-scheme, with initial modifications following Rannacher`s procedure. A Newton-type algorithm is applied to address the penalty-like term at each time step. Numerical experiments are conducted, demonstrating consistency with a benchmark problem and showing a strong match. The CPU time needed to reach the desired results favors P2-FEM over FDM and linear P1-FEM, with P2-FEM displaying superior convergence. This paper presents an efficient alternative framework for the HJB problem and contributes to the literature by introducing a finite element method (FEM)-based solution for HJB applications in mathematical finance.</description>

      <title>High-frequency lead-lag relationships in the Chinese stock index futures market: tick-by-tick dynamics of calendar spreads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lead-lag relationships, integral to market dynamics, offer valuable insights into the trading behavior of high-frequency traders (HFTs) and the flow of information at a granular level. This paper investigates the lead-lag relationships between stock index futures contracts of different maturities in the Chinese financial futures market (CFFEX). Using high-frequency (tick-by-tick) data, we analyze how price movements in near-month futures contracts influence those in longer-dated contracts, such as next-month, quarterly, and semi-annual contracts. Our findings reveal a consistent pattern of price discovery, with the near-month contract leading the others by one tick, driven primarily by liquidity. Additionally, we identify a negative feedback effect of the "lead-lag spread" on the leading asset, which can predict returns of leading asset. Backtesting results demonstrate the profitability of trading based on the lead-lag spread signal, even after accounting for transaction costs. Altogether, our analysis offers valuable insights to understand and capitalize on the evolving dynamics of futures markets.</description>

      <title>Hype-Adjusted Probability Measure for NLP Stock Return Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript introduces the Hype-Adjusted Probability Measure developed in the context of a new Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach for stock return and volatility forecasting. A novel sentiment score equation is presented to capture component and memory effects and assign dynamic parameters, enhancing the impact of intraday news data on forecasting next-period volatility for selected U.S. semiconductor tickers. This approach integrates machine learning techniques to analyze and improve the predictive value of news. Building on the research of Geman et al [6], this work improves forecast accuracy by addressing news bias, memory, and weight, and incorporating shifts in senti-ment direction. Finally, we propose the Hype-Adjusted Probability Measure, proving its existence and uniqueness, and discuss its theoretical applications in finance for NLP-based stock return forecasting, outlining future research pathways inspired by its concepts.</description>
