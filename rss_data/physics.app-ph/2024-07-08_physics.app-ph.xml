      <title>Out-of-Plane Polarization from Spin Reflection Induces Field-Free Spin-Orbit Torque Switching in Structures with Canted NiO Interfacial Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing deterministic current-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) magnetization switching, especially in systems exhibiting perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), typically requires the application of a collinear in-plane field, posing a challenging problem. In this study, we successfully achieve field-free SOT switching in the CoFeB/MgO system. In a Ta/CoFeB/MgO/NiO/Ta structure, spin reflection at the NiO interface, characterized by noncollinear spin structures with canted magnetization, generates a spin current with an out-of-plane spin polarization {\sigma}z. We confirm the contribution of {\sigma}z to the field-free SOT switching through measurements of the shift effect in the out-of-plane magnetization hysteresis loops under different currents. The incorporation of NiO as an antiferromagnetic insulator, mitigates the current shunting effect and ensures excellent thermal stability of the device. The sample with 0.8 nm MgO and 2 nm NiO demonstrates an impressive optimal switching ratio approaching 100% without an in-plane field. This breakthrough in the CoFeB/MgO system promises significant applications in spintronics, advancing us closer to realizing innovative technologies.</description>

      <title>Simulating carbon mineralization at pore scale in capillary networks of digital rock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the geometrical evolution of the pore space in geological formations due to fluid-solid interactions has applications in reservoir engineering, oil recovery, and geological storage of carbon dioxide. However, modeling frameworks that combine fluid flow with physical and chemical processes at a rock's pore scale are scarce. Here, we report a method for modeling a rock's pore space as a network of connected capillaries and to simulate the capillary diameter modifications caused by reactive flow processes. Specifically, we model mineral erosion, deposition, dissolution, and precipitation processes by solving the transport equations iteratively, computing diameter changes within each capillary of the network simultaneously. Our automated modeling framework enables simulations on digital rock samples as large as (1.125mm)$^3$ with 125$\times 10^6$ voxels within seconds of CPU time per iteration. As an application of the computational method, we have simulated brine injection and calcium carbonate precipitation in sandstone. For quantitatively comparing simulation results obtained with models predicting either a constant or a flow-rate dependent precipitation, we track the time-dependent capillary diameter distribution as well as the permeability of the connected pore space. For validation and reuse, we have made the automated simulation workflow, the reactive flow model library, and the digital rock samples available in public repositories.</description>

      <title>Giant Second Harmonic Generation from Wafer-Scale Aligned Chiral Carbon Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are direct-gap semiconductors with optical properties governed by one-dimensional excitons with enormous oscillator strengths. Each species of chiral CNTs has an enantiomeric pair of left- and right-handed CNTs with nearly identical properties, but enantiomer-dependent phenomena can emerge, especially in nonlinear optical processes. Theoretical studies have predicted strong second-order nonlinearities for chiral CNTs, but there has been no experimental verification due to the lack of macroscopically ordered assemblies of single-enantiomer chiral CNTs. Here for the first time, we report the synthesis of centimeter-scale films of densely packed and aligned single-enantiomer chiral CNTs that exhibit micro-fabrication compatibility. We observe giant second harmonic generation (SHG) emission from the chiral CNT film, which originates from the intrinsic chirality and inversion symmetry breaking of the atomic structure of chiral CNTs. The observed value of the dominant element of the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibility tensor reaches $1.5\times 10^{3}$ pm/V at a pump wavelength of 1030 nm, corresponding to the lowest-energy excitonic resonance. Our calculations based on many-body theory correctly estimate the spectrum and magnitude of such excitonically enhanced optical nonlinearity. These results are promising for developing scalable chiral-CNT electronics, nonlinear photonics and photonic quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Surface-Functionalization of Oleate-Capped Nano-Emitters for Stable Dispersion in 3D-Printable Polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-photon polymerization (2PP) 3D printing is a well-known technique for fabricating passive micro/nanoscale structures, such as microlenses and inversely designed polarization splitters. The integration of light emitting nanoparticle (NP) dopants, such as quantum dots (QDs) and rare-earth doped nanoparticles (RENPs), into a polymer resist would enable 3D printing of active polymer micro-photonic devices, including sensors, lasers, and solid-state displays. Many NPs are stabilized with oleic acid ligands to prevent degradation, but oleate-capped NPs (oc-NPs) tend to agglomerate in nonpolar media despite the hydrophobicity of the ligand. This results in an uneven distribution of NPs in polymers and increased optical extinction properties. In this work, we propose a general approach for dispersing various oc-NPs in commercial 3D printable polymers. We achieve controlled growth of small carbon chains around the oc-NPs by functionalizing the NPs with methyl-methacrylate monomers. The proposed approach is validated on RENPs (~65 nm) and CdSe/ZnS quantum dots (~12 nm) using different commercial polymer resists (IP-Dip and IP-Visio). Dispersions of functionalized NPs (f-NPs) have improved NP density by an order of magnitude and are shown to be stable for several weeks with minimal impact on printing quality. Our approach is generalizable to a variety of oc-NPs and ultimately leads to higher quality polymer-based optical and electronic devices.</description>

      <title>AI Driven Laser Parameter Search: Inverse Design of Photonic Surfaces using Greedy Surrogate-based Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic surfaces designed with specific optical characteristics are becoming increasingly important for use in in various energy harvesting and storage systems. , In this study, we develop a surrogate-based optimization approach for designing such surfaces. The surrogate-based optimization framework employs the Random Forest algorithm and uses a greedy, prediction-based exploration strategy to identify the laser fabrication parameters that minimize the discrepancy relative to a user-defined target optical characteristics. We demonstrate the approach on two synthetic benchmarks and two specific cases of photonic surface inverse design targets. It exhibits superior performance when compared to other optimization algorithms across all benchmarks. Additionally, we demonstrate a technique of inverse design warm starting for changed target optical characteristics which enhances the performance of the introduced approach.</description>

      <title>Barium Titanate and Lithium Niobate Permittivity and Pockels Coefficients from MHz to Sub-THz Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pockels effect is essential for controlling optical signals at the highest speeds. We present the first measurements of the Pockels coefficients and permittivity in lithium niobate (LN) and barium titanate (BTO) over a continuous frequency range from 100 MHz to 330 GHz. These properties are constant across this frequency range in LN but have a significant frequency dependence in BTO. Still, our measurements show that BTO ($\varepsilon$ = 1136, $r_{42}$ = 481 pm/V, $r_{33}$ = 125 pm/V at 100 MHz, $\varepsilon$ = 453, $r_{42}$ = 191 pm/V, $r_{33}$ = 60 pm/V at 330 GHz) has remarkably large electro-optic properties compared to LN ($\varepsilon$ = 27, $r_{42}$ = 15 pm/V, $r_{33}$ = 27 pm/V). Furthermore, we show how BTO devices can be designed with a flat electro-optic frequency response despite the Pockels coefficient dispersion. Finally, we expound our method for broadband characterization of these vital electro-optic properties, utilizing specialized integrated electro-optic phase shifters. Altogether, this work is foundational to designing high-speed BTO devices and to developing new electro-optic materials.</description>

      <title>Engineering Nonreciprocal Responses in Travelling-Wave Spacetime Crystals via Clausius-Mossotti Homogenization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we investigate the effective response of three-dimensional spacetime crystals formed by spherical scatterers under a travelling-wave modulation. We develop an analytical formalism to homogenize the spacetime crystals that extends the renowned Clausius-Mossotti formula to time-varying platforms. Our formalism shows that travelling-wave spacetime crystals can be used to engineer a wide range of classes of nonreciprocal bianisotropic couplings in the long wavelength limit. In particular, our theory reveals the possibility of realizing a purely isotropic Tellegen response in crystals formed by interlaced sub-lattices of scatterers subjected to different modulation velocities. Furthermore, we introduce a class of generalized Minkowskian crystals that displays invariance under arbitrary Lorentz boosts aligned with a fixed spatial direction. We prove that such systems are formed by pseudo-uniaxial materials with the principal axis aligned parallel to the modulation velocity. The electromagnetic response of such generalized Minkowskian crystals is indistinguishable from that of moving photonic crystals.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile reconfigurable polarization rotator at datacom wavelengths based on a Sb2Se3/Si waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04477v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon photonics has become a key platform for photonic integrated circuits (PICs) due to its high refractive index and compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor manufacturing. However, the inherent birefringence in silicon waveguides requires efficient polarization management. Here, we report a reconfigurable polarization rotator (PR) using a Sb2Se3/Si waveguide operating at datacom wavelengths (1310 nm), providing nonvolatile switching with zero static power consumption. The polarization conversion relies on the interference of hybrid electric-magnetic (EH) modes, which can be reconfigured by changing the Sb2Se3 state between amorphous and crystalline. Our experimental device exhibits a polarization conversion efficiency (PCE) and a polarization extinction ratio (PER) as high as -0.08 dB and 17.65 dB, respectively, in a compact footprint of just 21$\mu$m length. Therefore, the proposed reconfigurable PR offers a compact and energy-efficient solution for polarization management in silicon photonics, with potential applications in data communication networks and emerging applications benefiting from polarization information encodings, such as optical neural networks and quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal optical phonons in photonic time crystals containing a stationary charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentzian-type media support optical phonons that oscillate with longitudinal polarization parallel to the wave direction, at a wave vector-independent frequency at which the permittivity becomes zero. Here, we study the interactions between the longitudinal optical phonons and Lorentzian medium-based dispersive photonic time crystals (PTCs). We demonstrate that a stationary charge embedded in the PTCs can excite these longitudinal modes through the conversion of the static polarization field induced by the charge. Furthermore, the PTCs can develop a momentum bandgap across the entire wave vector space to amplify the longitudinal modes. Remarkably, this infinite momentum bandgap can be established with minimal temporal modulation of the refractive index when creating the PTCs. Our approach expands the range of waves that can be manipulated in PTCs and shows potential for observing momentum bandgap phenomenon in realistic optical experiments, where the modulation depth of the refractive index is severely constrained.</description>

      <title>Suitability of Common Ingestible Antennas for Multiplexed Gastrointestinal Biosensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ingestible sensor devices, which are increasingly used for internal health monitoring, rely on antennas to perform sensing functions and simultaneously to communicate with external devices. Despite the development of various ingestible antennas, there has been no comprehensive comparison of their performance as biosensors. This paper addresses this gap by examining and comparing the suitability of three common types of ingestible antennas -- dipole, patch, and loop -- as biosensors for distinguishing gastrointestinal tissues (stomach, small intestine, and large intestine) based on their electromagnetic properties. The antennas studied in this work conform to the inner surface of biocompatible polylactic acid capsules with varying shell thicknesses and operate in the 433 MHz Industrial, Scientific, and Medical band. The comparison is performed in gastrointestinal tissues using several antenna parameters: 1) Sensing Capability: Changes in the phase of the reflection coefficient in the tissues are selected as the sensing parameter. 2) Robustness: The frequency interval (f_i) in which the antennas are matched (|S11| &lt; -10 dB) in all the tissues and the maximum change in the center frequency (f_c) in different tissues are examined. 3) Radiation Performance: The gain and radiation efficiency of the antennas are examined. The effect of shell thickness on gain and radiation efficiency at 434 MHz is presented. Additionally, the radiation efficiency at various frequencies allocated for medical communications is compared with the theoretical maximum achievable efficiencies. These comprehensive data provide valuable information for making engineering decisions when designing multiplexed biosensor antennas for ingestible applications.</description>

      <title>Tunable kHz distributed feedback fiber laser enabled by glass additive-manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For short sections of fibers tailored to a specific application, fast laser-based manufacturing techniques can be an attractive alternative to the often-cumbersome traditional manufacturing routes. Short, high gain fibers can be used in e.g., distributed feedback fiber lasers (DFFL) that offer sought after performance suitable for a broad range of applications in modern photonics. DFFLs offer superior stability and narrower linewidth compared to conventional fiber lasers. Tunable, narrow laser sources with output in eye-safe spectrum are desired for sensing, signal multiplexing, LIDAR systems etc. In this work we present DFFL obtained using Laser-Powder-Deposition made Er-doped silica fiber. Milliwatt level, ultra-narrow laser line (less than 4 kHz) was obtained using phase-shifted grating in 16 mm long fiber. The backward slope efficiency was as high as 24% when pumping at 976 nm. The results presented in this work showcase new possibilities in fiber fabrication that were unlocked through laser-assisted AM. This fiber laser sets the stage for the future of rapid fabrication of advanced fiber devices through unconventional manufacturing routes.</description>

      <title>Median Mishaps between Chirality and Spin-Orbit Torques via Asymmetric Hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Averaged observations of physical phenomena have been utilized for comprehending specific occurrences in nature; however, these may overlook the crucial characteristics of individual events, thereby leading to diverse conclusions. For example, individual wave occurrences such as superposition and interference yield markedly divergent outcomes when viewed in detail. Similarly, this study enhances the comprehensive framework of spin-orbit torque (SOT) within the hysteresis loop shift measurement by employing the average of effective magnetic fields arising from two distinct magnetic reversals. This approach facilitates the presentation of a physically descriptive SOT model, previously characterized only by single chirality qualitatively. By integrating this model with established measurement methodologies and theoretical paradigms, we advance a theoretical framework based on the magnetic domain-wall chirality of individual polarizations and aim to elucidate the phenomena of SOT with clarity. The anticipated outcomes include the rectification of inaccuracies in widely employed measurement methodologies and the enhancement of our comprehension of the fundamental physics, which are expected to propel advancements in next-generation spintronics materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Resistive switching suppression in metal/Nb:SrTiO$_3$ Schottky contacts prepared by room-temperature Pulsed Laser Deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepening the understanding of interface-type Resistive Switching (RS) in metal/oxide heterojunctions is a key step for the development of high-performance memristors and Schottky rectifiers. In this study, we address the role of metallization technique by fabricating prototypical metal/Nb-doped SrTiO$_3$ (M/NSTO) Schottky contacts via Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD). Ultrathin Pt and Au electrodes are deposited by PLD onto single-crystal (001)-terminated NSTO substrates and interfacial transport is characterized by conventional macroscale methods and nanoscale Ballistic Electron Emission Microscopy. We show that PLD metallization gives Schottky contacts with highly reversible current-voltage characteristics under cyclic polarization. Room-temperature transport is governed by thermionic emission with Schottky barrier height $\phi_B$(Pt/NSTO)=0.71-0.75eV, $\phi_B$(Au/NSTO)=0.70-0.83eV and ideality factors as small as n(Pt/NSTO)=1.1 and n(Au/NSTO)=1.6. RS remains almost completely suppressed upon imposing broad variations of the Nb doping and of the external stimuli (polarization bias, working temperature, ambient air exposure). At the nanoscale, we find that both systems display high spatial homogeneity of $\phi_B$(&lt;50meV), which is only partially affected by the NSTO mixed termination (|$\phi_B$ (M/SrO) - $\phi_B$ (M/TiO$_2$)|&lt;35meV). Experimental evidences and theoretical arguments indicate that the PLD metallization mitigates interfacial layer effects responsible for RS. This occurs thanks either to a reduction of the interfacial layer thickness and to the creation of an effective barrier against the permeation of ambient gas species affecting charge trapping and redox reactions. This description allows to rationalize interfacial aging effects, observed upon several-months-exposure to ambient air, in terms of interfacial re-oxidation.</description>

      <title>A peridynamic investigation of particle oxidation, size and material during cold-spray</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cold spray technology, distinguished by its unique ability to deposit particles in a solid state, offers unparalleled potential for applications such as coating, repair, and additive manufacturing. In this research, we employed a peridynamic modeling approach to systematically analyze the effects of key powder features on deposit properties. Notably, our model incorporates the explicit modeling of nanometer-sized oxide layers, providing a more accurate representation of real-world conditions. We assessed the influence of parameters such as particle size, oxidation conditions, and material type on crucial deposition indicators like critical velocity and compression ratio. Our results demonstrated excellent agreement with reported experimental data, affirming the effectiveness of the proposed numerical framework. Specifically, our findings highlighted that, for a given impact velocity, smaller particles, thicker oxide layers, and harder materials contribute to limited oxide removal and a decreased likelihood of successful adhesion. Additionally, we present a predictive framework that establishes a correlation between particle size and critical velocity, providing valuable insights for optimizing cold spray deposition parameters. This innovative approach not only enhances our understanding of the intricate interplay between powder features and deposit properties but also paves the way for a more efficient and cost-effective optimization process in cold spray applications.</description>

      <title>Beyond the blur: using experimentally determined point spread functions to improve scanning Kelvin probe imaging</title>

Abstract: Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy (SKPM) is a powerful technique for investigating the electrostatic properties of material surfaces, enabling the imaging of variations in work function, topology, surface charge density, or combinations thereof. Regardless of the underlying signal source, SKPM results in a voltage image which is spatially distorted due to the finite size of the probe, long-range electrostatic interactions, mechanical and electrical noise, and the finite response time of the electronics. In order to recover the underlying signal, it is necessary to deconvolve the measurement with an appropriate point spread function (PSF) that accounts the aforementioned distortions, but determining this PSF is difficult. Here we describe how such PSFs can be determined experimentally, and show how they can be used to recover the underlying information of interest. We first consider the physical principles that enable SKPM, and discuss how these affect the system PSF. We then show how one can experimentally measure PSFs by looking at well defined features, and that these compare well to simulated PSFs, provided scans are performed extremely slowly and carefully. Next, we work at realistic scan speeds, and show that the idealised PSFs fail to capture temporal distortions in the scan direction. While simulating PSFs for these situations would be quite challenging, we show that measuring PSFs with similar scan conditions works well. Our approach clarifies the basic principles of and inherent challenges to SKPM measurements, and gives practical methods to improve results</description>

      <title>Percolation Effect Induced Significant Change of Complex Permittivity and Permeability for Silver-Epoxy Nano-Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13419</link>

Abstract: The intricate interplay between complex permittivity and permeability constitutes the cornerstone of electromagnetic (EM) applications, enabling precise customization for various uses. This study employed silver-epoxy nano-composites to exemplify a conductor-insulator composite, leveraging silver's exceptional attributes, such as high conductivity and low reactivity. The determination of complex permittivity and permeability was conducted via the transmission/reflection method. At lower concentrations of dispersed silver particles, these nano-particles within the epoxy resin act as modest dipoles, augmenting permittivity. This regime aligns closely with the effective medium theory (EMT) and comprises the focus of much research. However, nearing the percolation threshold, a percolation effect emerges, drastically accelerating enhancement rates beyond the predictions of EMT. Simultaneously, long-wavelength electromagnetic waves induce diamagnetic currents within loops formed by metal grains. This diamagnetic effect intensifies with increasing volume fraction, leading to a reduction in permeability. This study observed percolation power law behavior near the threshold with calculated critical exponents. Consequently, the dielectric constant of the silver-epoxy nano-composite reached a maximum of 515. Regarding permeability, the lowest recorded value was 0.31. These findings were obtained within the X-band (8.2 GHz~12.4 GHz) region.</description>

      <title>Inference through innovation processes tested in the authorship attribution task</title>

Abstract: Urn models for innovation capture fundamental empirical laws shared by several real-world processes. The so-called urn model with triggering includes, as particular cases, the urn representation of the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet process and the Dirichlet process, seminal in Bayesian non-parametric inference. In this work, we leverage this connection to introduce a general approach for quantifying closeness between symbolic sequences and test it within the framework of the authorship attribution problem. The method demonstrates high accuracy when compared to other related methods in different scenarios, featuring a substantial gain in computational efficiency and theoretical transparency. Beyond the practical convenience, this work demonstrates how the recently established connection between urn models and non-parametric Bayesian inference can pave the way for designing more efficient inference methods. In particular, the hybrid approach that we propose allows us to relax the exchangeability hypothesis, which can be particularly relevant for systems exhibiting complex correlation patterns and non-stationary dynamics.</description>

      <title>Comparison between InAs-based and GaSb-based Interband cascade lasers with hybrid superlattice plasmon-enhanced claddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06525v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare InAs-based and GaSb-based interband cascade lasers (ICLs) with the same 12 stages active region designed to emit at a wavelength of 4.6 {\mu}m. They employ a hybrid cladding architecture with the same geometry and inner claddings consisting of InAs/AlSb superlattices but different outer claddings: The InAs-based ICL employs plasmon enhanced n-type doped InAs layers while the GaSb-based ICL employs plasmon-enhanced n-type doped InAs_0.915 Sb_0.085 claddings lattice matched to GaSb. Due to the lower refractive index of n+-InAsSb (n=2.88) compared to n+-InAs (n=3.10) and higher refractive index of separate confinement layers, the GaSb-based ICL shows a 3.8 % higher optical mode confinement in the active region compared to the InAs-based ICL. Experimentally, the GaSb-based ICL shows a 17.3 % lower threshold current density in pulsed operation at room temperature. Also presented is the influence of geometry and doping variation on confinement factors and calculated free carrier absorption losses in the GaSb-based ICL.</description>
