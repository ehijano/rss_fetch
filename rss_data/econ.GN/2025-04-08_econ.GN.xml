      <title>Who Gets to Come In? How Political Engagement Shapes Views on Legal Immigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines how political engagement shapes public attitudes toward legal immigration in the United States. Using nationally weighted data from the 2024 ANES Pilot Study, we construct a novel Political Engagement Index (PAX) based on five civic actions: discussing politics, online sharing, attending rallies, wearing political symbols, and campaign volunteering. By applying weighted ordered logistic regression models, we find that higher engagement predicts greater support for easing legal immigration, even after adjusting for education, gender, age, partisanship, income, urban residence, and generalized social trust. To capture the substantive effect, we visualize predicted probabilities across levels of engagement. In full-sample models, the likelihood of supporting "a lot harder" immigration drops from 26% to 13% as engagement rises, while support for "a lot easier" increases from 10% to 21%. Subgroup analyses by partisanship show consistent directionality, with notable shifts among Republicans. Social trust and education are also consistently associated with more open attitudes, while older respondents tend to support less lenient pathways to legal immigration policies. These findings suggest that a cumulative increase in political participation is linked to support for legal immigration pathways, with varying intensity across partisan identities and socio-demographic characteristics.</description>

      <title>Sustainable Aviation Fuels: Opportunities, Alternatives and Challenges for Decarbonizing the Aviation Industry and Foster the Renewable Chemicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) are pivotal in the global effort to decarbonize the aviation sector and meet greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction targets established by international frameworks such as CORSIA and Brazil ProBioQAV. This study evaluates SAF potential to reduce lifecycle carbon emissions by up to 80% while being compatible with existing aviation infrastructure. Through bibliometric analysis, scenario evaluation, legal and regulatory framework analysis and economic modeling, the research examines two key SAF production technologies: Hydroprocessed Esters and Fatty Acids Synthetic Paraffinic Kerosene (HEFA-SPK) and Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) pathways in the Brazilian context. The findings reveal significant economic challenges, particularly high feedstock and production costs, which hinder SAF competitiveness with fossil fuels at recent and current market prices in Brazil, leading to the analysis of potential incentives and commercial conditions aiming to increase economic attractiveness of SAF production. Based on interviews with relevant stakeholders and decision makers in the industry, scenarios incorporating tax incentives, carbon credits, capital grants, and premium pricing for SAF and its biogenic by-products demonstrate that combined policy interventions and commercial arrangements, along with a regulated Carbon Market are essential for SAF economic viability. Future research is suggested to look at regional assessments of feedstock availability, supply chain logistics, and global market eligibility. This research provides insights for guiding public policy and private investment to support the transition to sustainable aviation in Brazil and beyond.</description>

      <title>The Labor Market Incidence of New Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a general framework for evaluating the incidence of labor market shocks, focusing particularly on automation and artificial intelligence. Unequal labor market shocks are shared among workers across occupations depending on their substitutability. Central to our theory is the concept of distance-dependent elasticity of substitution (DIDES), where substitutability between occupations declines with their distance in skill space. Our analysis reveals that automation and AI cluster in skill-adjacent occupations, generating limited employment shifts but significant wage disparities. Furthermore, the dynamic model demonstrates that limited mobility persists both during the transition and in the long run, limiting the labor market's capacity to absorb rapid technological progress.</description>

      <title>Optimal macroprudential policy with preemptive bailouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I study the optimal regulation of a financial sector where individual banks face self-enforcing constraints countering their default incentives. The constrained-efficient social planner can improve over the unregulated equilibrium in two dimensions. First, by internalizing the impact of banks' portfolio decisions on the prices of assets and liabilities that affect the enforcement constraints. Second, by redistributing future net worth from new entrants to surviving banks, which increases the current forward-looking value of all banks, relaxing their enforcement constraints and decreasing the probability of banking crises. The latter can be accomplished with systemic preemptive bailouts that are time consistent and unambiguously welfare improving. Unregulated banks can be both overleveraged and underleveraged depending on the state of the economy, thus macroprudential policy requires both taxes and subsidies, while minimum bank capital requirements are generally ineffective.</description>

      <title>Underreporting of Intimate Partner Violence in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to WHO (2013), in general 30% of all women worldwide who have been in a relationship have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by their intimate partner. However, only a small percentage of intimate partner violence (IPV) victims report it to the police. This phenomenon of under-reporting is known as ``dark figure''. This paper aims to investigate the factors associated with the reporting decision of IPV victims to the police in Brazil using the third wave of the ``Pesquisa de Condi\c{c}\~{o}es Socioecon\^{o}micas e Viol\^{e}ncia Dom\'{e}stica e Familiar contra a Mulher ($PCSVDF^{Mulher}$)''. Using a bivariate probit regression model with sample selection, we found that older white women, those who do not tolerate domestic violence, and women who have experienced physical violence are more likely to report IPV to the police. In contrast, married women, those with partners who abuse alcohol and those who witnessed or knew that their mothers had experienced IPV, are less likely to report it to law enforcement.</description>

      <title>A model-based analysis of the AggregateEU mechanism: Implications of overbidding and non-commitment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AggregateEU is a new centralised mechanism that provides a no-commitment platform to trade natural gas in the European Union. Throughout the consultation process, AggregateEU has been mocked as `Tinder of the European gas markets' as it helps consumers and suppliers to find partners, but leaves it up to the matched partners to decide whether or not to contract on the possible trade. The non-commitment nature leads to substantial overbidding and many non-realised matches.
  We propose a quantitative modelling framework to study the effect of overbidding in the AggergateEU demand aggregation or joint purchasing mechanism. We conclude that the mechanism is prone to overbidding and that overbidding has ambiguous effects on trade. Depending on the parameters, overbidding may facilitate trade, but may also result in highly inefficient outcomes when overbidding is combined with a miscoordination over the delivery points.
  Suggested remedies include allowing for convex bids, restrictions on overbidding, or giving up part of the non-binding character of the market. %Ideally, the traditional mechanisms of gas exchanges should be augmented by features of AggregateEU. Our results sugge</description>

      <title>Modelling bounded rational decision-making through Wasserstein constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling bounded rational decision-making through information constrained processing provides a principled approach for representing departures from rationality within a reinforcement learning framework, while still treating decision-making as an optimization process. However, existing approaches are generally based on Entropy, Kullback-Leibler divergence, or Mutual Information. In this work, we highlight issues with these approaches when dealing with ordinal action spaces. Specifically, entropy assumes uniform prior beliefs, missing the impact of a priori biases on decision-makings. KL-Divergence addresses this, however, has no notion of "nearness" of actions, and additionally, has several well known potentially undesirable properties such as the lack of symmetry, and furthermore, requires the distributions to have the same support (e.g. positive probability for all actions). Mutual information is often difficult to estimate. Here, we propose an alternative approach for modeling bounded rational RL agents utilising Wasserstein distances. This approach overcomes the aforementioned issues. Crucially, this approach accounts for the nearness of ordinal actions, modeling "stickiness" in agent decisions and unlikeliness of rapidly switching to far away actions, while also supporting low probability actions, zero-support prior distributions, and is simple to calculate directly.</description>

      <title>BlockingPy: approximate nearest neighbours for blocking of records for entity resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entity resolution (probabilistic record linkage, deduplication) is a key step in scientific analysis and data science pipelines involving multiple data sources. The objective of entity resolution is to link records without identifiers that refer to the same entity (e.g., person, company). However, without identifiers, researchers need to specify which records to compare in order to calculate matching probability and reduce computational complexity. One solution is to deterministically block records based on some common variables, such as names, dates of birth or sex. However, this approach assumes that these variables are free of errors and completely observed, which is often not the case. To address this challenge, we have developed a Python package, BlockingPy, which utilises blocking via modern approximate nearest neighbour search and graph algorithms to significantly reduce the number of comparisons. In this paper, we present the design of the package, its functionalities and two case studies related to official statistics. We believe the presented software will be useful for researchers (i.e., social scientists, economists or statisticians) interested in linking data from various sources.</description>

      <title>Are Men Less Generous to a Smarter Woman? Evidence from a Dictator Game Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.04591v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although evidence suggests men are more generous to women than to men, it may stem from paternalism and could reverse when women excel in important skills for one's career success, such as cognitive skills. Using a dictator game, this paper studies whether male dictators allocate less to female receivers than to male receivers when these receivers have higher IQs than dictators. By exogenously varying the receivers' IQ relative to the dictators', I do not find evidence consistent with this hypothesis; if anything, male dictators allocate slightly more to female receivers with higher IQs than to male receivers with equivalent IQs. The results hold both in mean and distribution and are robust to the so-called ``beauty premium.'' Also, female dictators' allocations are qualitatively similar to male dictators. These findings suggest that women who excel in cognitive skills may not receive less favorable treatment than equally intelligent men in the labor market.</description>

      <title>Arbitraging Narrow Bracketers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2101.04529v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many important economic outcomes result from the combined effects of several choices, so the best option is not determined from each choice in isolation, but depends on how each choice alters total outcomes. We formally show that narrow bracketing -- treating choices in isolation -- can be distinguished from broad bracketing -- combining the choices -- if and only if there exist price variation across context: there is some bundle for which a person is willing to pay more in one choice than in another. In this case, a narrow bracketer can be arbitraged, buying the bundle when it is expensive and selling when it is cheap in simultaneous choices. We design and run two experiments to identify bracketing from price variation. In a between-subjects design where we vary the amount of work to generate price variation, we reject broad bracketing and fail to reject narrow bracketing. In a within-subject design we directly test bracketing by attempting to arbitrage our participants. For price variation coming from varying amounts of money, 50.3% of subjects are classified as narrow bracketers, and only 14.6% as broad bracketers, the remainder being inconsistent with both. This changes for price variation coming from violations of expected utility -- 13.6% narrow vs 46.3% broad -- and of the weak axiom of revealed preference -- 26.3% narrow vs 38.1% broad.</description>

      <title>Interconnected Markets: Exploring the Dynamic Relationship Between BRICS Stock Markets and Cryptocurrency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to examine the intricate dynamics between BRICS traditional stock assets and the evolving landscape of cryptocurrencies. Using a time-varying parameter vector autoregression model (TVP-VAR), we have analyzed data from the BRICS stock market index, cryptocurrencies, and indicators from January 6, 2015, to June 29, 2023. The results show that three out of the five BRICS stock markets serve as primary sources of shocks that subsequently affect the financial network. The transcontinental (TCI) value derived from the dynamic conditional connectedness using the TVP-VAR model demonstrates a higher explanatory power than the static connectedness observed using the standard VAR model. The discoveries from this study offer valuable insights for corporations, investors, and regulators concerning systematic risk and investment strategies.</description>

      <title>Prices and Concentration: A U-shape? Theory and Evidence from Renewables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03504v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that when firms compete via supply functions, transferring high-cost capacity to the largest, most efficient firm--thereby diversifying its production technologies while increasing concentration--can lower prices by prompting the leader to expand output and competitors to aggressively defend market shares. However, large transfers prove anticompetitive, as sizable capacity differences discourage price undercutting. Exploiting renewable intermittencies in Colombia's electricity market, where firms are technology-diversified, we consistently find a U-shape relationship between prices and concentration. Counterfactually reallocating 30% of competitors' high-cost capacities to the leader cuts prices 10%, while larger transfers raise them, revealing how capacity and efficiency influence market power.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12924v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antitrust authorities routinely rely on concentration measures to evaluate the potential negative impacts of mergers on consumer welfare. Using a first-order approximation argument with logit and CES demand, I characterize a simple formula that shows the welfare effect of a merger on consumer surplus is proportional to the change in the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), where the proportionality coefficient depends on the price responsiveness parameter, market size, and the distribution of market shares within and across the merging firms. My results imply that merger harm is correlated with the merger-induced change in HHI but not the level of pre-merger HHI. I provide numerical evidence on the accuracy of my formula.</description>

      <title>Process and Policy Insights from an Intercomparison of Open Electricity System Capacity Expansion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study performs a detailed intercomparison of four open-source electricity capacity expansion models - Temoa, Switch, GenX, and USENSYS - to evaluate 1) how closely the results of these models align when inputs and configurations are harmonized, and 2) the degree to which varying model configurations affect outputs. We harmonize the inputs to each model using PowerGenome and use clearly defined scenarios (policy conditions) and configurations (model setup choices). This allows us to isolate how differences in model structure affect policy outcomes and investment decisions. Our framework allows each model to be tested on identical assumptions for policy, technology costs, and operational constraints, allowing us to focus on differences that arise from inherent model structures. Key findings highlight that, when harmonized, models produce very similar capacity portfolios under current policies and net-zero scenarios, with less than 1% difference in system costs for most configurations. This agreement among models allows us to focus on how configuration choices affect model results. For instance, configurations with unit commitment constraints or economic retirement yield different investments and system costs compared to simpler configurations. Our findings underscore the importance of aligning input data and transparently defining scenarios and configurations to provide robust policy insights.</description>

      <title>Critical Mathematical Economics and Progressive Data Science</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06015v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to present elements and discuss the potential of a research program at the intersection between mathematics and heterodox economics, which we call Criticial Mathematical Economics (CME). We propose to focus on the mathematical and model-theoretic foundations of controversies in economic policy, and aim at providing an entrance to the literature as an invitation to mathematicians that are potentially interested in such a project.
  From our point of view, mathematics has been partly misused in mainstream economics to justify `unregulated markets'. We identify two key parts of CME, which leads to a natural structure of this article: The first part focusses on an analysis and critique of mathematical models used in mainstream economics, like e.g. the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) in Macroeconomics and the so-called ``Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu''-Theorems.
  The aim of the second part is to improve and extend heterodox models using ingredients from modern mathematics and computer science, a method with strong relation to Complexity Economics. We exemplify this idea by describing how methods from Non-Linear Dynamics have been used in Post-Keynesian Macroeconomics', and also discuss (Pseudo-) Goodwin cycles and possible Micro- and Mesofoundations.
  Finally, we outline in which areas a collaboration between mathematicians and heterodox economists could be most promising, and discuss both existing projects in such a direction as well as areas where new models for policy advice are most needed. In an outlook, we discuss the role of (ecological) data, and the need for what we call Progressive Data Science.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Damped Harmonic Oscillator in DSGE Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper integrates the damped harmonic oscillator into DSGE models to better capture delayed economic adjustments. By introducing a damping coefficient, I model economic recoveries as under-damped, critically damped, or over-damped processes. Numerical simulations illustrate how different damping levels affect recovery speed and stability. This approach enhances DSGE models' realism, offering insights into historical economic crises and improving macroeconomic forecasting.</description>

      <title>Exchange Rate Sensitivity in Free Zone Trade: An Empirical Study of the Istanbul Ataturk Airport Free Zone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study as part of an ongoing research effort, empirically examines the relationship between foreign trade in the Istanbul Ataturk Airport Free Zone and exchange rate movements. Monthly data from 2003 to 2016 were analyzed through stationarity tests (Unit Root), followed by the Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model, Cointegration Analysis, and the Toda-Yamamoto Causality Test. The findings indicate that the exchange rate does not significantly affect imports and exports in the free zone. This result suggests that free zones, due to their structural characteristics and operational framework, may be relatively insulated from exchange rate fluctuations. The study contributes to the literature by providing a focused analysis of a specific free zone in Turkiye, highlighting the potential independence of free zone trade from exchange rate volatility.</description>

      <title>Slowing Climate Change and Ocean Acidification by Converting Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide to Graphite (CD2G)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01033v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere may slow climate change and ocean acidification. My approach converts atmospheric carbon dioxide into graphite (CD2G). The net profit for this conversion is ~$381/ton CO2 removed from the atmosphere. At the gigaton scale, CD2G factories will increase the affordability and availability of graphite. Since graphite can be used to make thermal batteries and electrodes for fuel cells and batteries, CD2G factories will help lower the cost of storing renewable energy, which will accelerate the transition to renewable energy. Replacing fossil fuel energy with renewable energy will slow the release of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, also slowing climate change. Converting atmospheric carbon dioxide into graphite will both generate a profit and slow climate change.</description>
