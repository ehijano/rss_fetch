      <title>Fault tolerance for metric dimension and its variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hernando et al. (2008) introduced the fault-tolerant metric dimension $\text{ftdim}(G)$, which is the size of the smallest resolving set $S$ of a graph $G$ such that $S-\left\{s\right\}$ is also a resolving set of $G$ for every $s \in S$. They found an upper bound $\text{ftdim}(G) \le \dim(G) (1+2 \cdot 5^{\dim(G)-1})$, where $\dim(G)$ denotes the standard metric dimension of $G$. It was unknown whether there exists a family of graphs where $\text{ftdim}(G)$ grows exponentially in terms of $\dim(G)$, until recently when Knor et al. (2024) found a family with $\text{ftdim}(G) = \dim(G)+2^{\dim(G)-1}$ for any possible value of $\dim(G)$. We improve the upper bound on fault-tolerant metric dimension by showing that $\text{ftdim}(G) \le \dim(G)(1+3^{\dim(G)-1})$ for every connected graph $G$. Moreover, we find an infinite family of connected graphs $J_k$ such that $\dim(J_k) = k$ and $\text{ftdim}(J_k) \ge 3^{k-1}-k-1$ for each positive integer $k$. Together, our results show that \[\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \left( \max_{G: \text{ } \dim(G) = k} \frac{\log_3(\text{ftdim}(G))}{k} \right) = 1.\] In addition, we consider the fault-tolerant edge metric dimension $\text{ftedim}(G)$ and bound it with respect to the edge metric dimension $\text{edim}(G)$, showing that \[\lim_{k \rightarrow \infty} \left( \max_{G: \text{ } \text{edim}(G) = k} \frac{\log_2(\text{ftedim}(G))}{k} \right) = 1.\] We also obtain sharp extremal bounds on fault-tolerance for adjacency dimension and $k$-truncated metric dimension. Furthermore, we obtain sharp bounds for some other extremal problems about metric dimension and its variants. In particular, we prove an equivalence between an extremal problem about edge metric dimension and an open problem of Erd\H{o}s and Kleitman (1974) in extremal set theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for every $k$-dimensional linear code $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$ there exists a set $S\subseteq [n]$ of size at most $n/2+O(\sqrt{nk})$ such that the projection of $\mathcal{C}$ onto $S$ has distance at least $\frac12\mathrm{dist}(\mathcal{C})$. As a consequence we show that any connected graph $G$ with $m$ edges and $n$ vertices has at least $2^{m-(n-1)}$ many $1/2$-thin subgraphs.</description>

      <title>Positive matching decompositions of the cartesian product of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma=(V,E)$ be a finite simple graph. A matching $M \subseteq E$ is positive if there exists a weight function on $V$ such that the matching $M$ is characterized by those edges with positive weights. A positive matching decomposition (pmd) of $\Gamma$ with $p$ parts is an ordered partition $E_1,\ldots,E_p$ of $E$ such that $E_i$ is a positive matching of $(V, E \setminus \bigcup_{j=1}^{i-1} E_j)$, for $i = 1, \ldots, p$. The smallest $p$ for which $\Gamma$ admits a pmd with $p$ parts is denoted by $\mathrm{pmd}(\Gamma)$. We study the pmd of the Cartesian product of graphs and give sharp upper bounds for them in terms of the pmds and chromatic numbers of their components. In special cases, we compute the pmd of grid graphs that is the Cartesian product of paths and cycles.</description>

      <title>On the Boson-Fermion Correspondence for Factorial Schur Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an algebraic (non-analytic) proof of the deformed boson-fermion Fock space construction of Molev's double supersymmetric Schur functions, among other results, from our previous paper. In other words, we make no assumptions on the variables and parameters. By specializing to a finite number of variables and shifting parameters, we recover the factorial Schur functions. Furthermore, we realize the bosonic construction through a representation of a completion of the infinite rank general linear Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>On a trace formula of counting Eulerian cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We make connections of a counting problem of Eulerian cycles for undirected graphs to homological spectral graph theory, and formulate explicitly a trace formula that identifies the number of Eulerian circuits on an Eulerian graph with the trace sum of certain twisted vertex and edge adjacency matrices of the graph. Moreover, we show that reduction of computation can be achieved by taking into account symmetries related to twisted adjacency matrices induced by spectral antisymmetry and graph automorphisms.</description>

      <title>Transposes in the $q$-deformed modular group and their applications to $q$-deformed rational numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (right) $q$-deformed rational numbers was originally introduced by Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko, and its left variant by Bapat, Becker and Licata. These notions are based on continued fractions and the $q$-deformed modular group actions. For any matrix in this group, Leclere and Morier-Genoud showed that its trace is a palindromic polynomial whose coefficients are all non-negative (up to $\pm q^{N}$ times ). In this paper, we define the $q$-transpose for matrices in this group. Using this, we give new proofs of the above result and some others. We also give arithmetic properties on the left $q$-rational numbers. Finally, we show that the conjecture of \Oguz on circular fence posets implies a conjecture on the normalized Jones polynomials of rational links.</description>

      <title>Double boxes and double dimers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a combinatorial proof of a result in rank 2 Donaldson-Thomas theory, which states that the generating function for certain plane-partition-like objects, called double-box configurations, is equal to a product of MacMahon's generating function for (boxed) plane partitions. In our proof, we first give the correspondence between double-box configurations and double-dimer configurations on the hexagon lattice with a particular tripartite node pairing. Using this correspondence, we apply graphical condensation and double-dimer condensation to prove the result.</description>

      <title>Satisfying sequences for rainbow partite matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal F_1,\ldots, \mathcal F_s\subset [n]^k$ be a collection of $s$ families. In this paper, we address the following question: for which sequences $f_1,\ldots, f_s$ the conditions $|\ff_i|&gt;f_i$ imply that the families contain a rainbow matching, that is, there are pairwise disjoint $F_1\in \ff_1,\ldots F_s\in \ff_s$? We call such sequences {\em satisfying}. Kiselev and the first author verified the conjecture of Aharoni and Howard and showed that $f_1 = \ldots = f_s=(s-1)n^{k-1}$ is satisfying for $s&gt;470$. This is the best possible if the restriction is uniform over all families. However, it turns out that much more can be said about asymmetric restrictions. In this paper, we investigate this question in several regimes and in particular answer the questions asked by Kiselev and Kupavskii. We use a variety of methods, including concentration and anticoncentration results, spread approximations, and Combinatorial Nullstellenzats.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for any set $A \subset \mathbb{N}$ with positive upper density and any $\ell,m \in \mathbb{N}$, there exist an infinite set $B\subset \mathbb{N}$ and some $t\in \mathbb{N}$ so that $\{mb_1 + \ell b_2 \colon b_1,b_2\in B\ \text{and}\ b_1&lt;b_2 \}+t \subset A,$ verifying a conjecture of Kra, Moreira, Richter and Robertson. We also consider the patterns $\{mb_1 + \ell b_2 \colon b_1,b_2\in B\ \text{and}\ b_1 \leq b_2 \}$, for infinite $B\subset \mathbb{N}$ and prove that any set $A\subset \mathbb{N}$ with lower density $\underline{d}(A)&gt;1/2$ contains such configurations up to a shift. We show that the value $1/2$ is optimal and obtain analogous results for values of upper density and when no shift is allowed.</description>

      <title>Subgroups of Bestvina-Brady groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In "Subgroups of Graph Groups", 1987, J. Alg., Droms proved that all the subgroups of a right-angled Artin group (RAAG) defined by a finite simplicial graph $\Gamma$ are themselves RAAGs if, and only if, $\Gamma$ has no induced square graph nor line-graph of length $3$. The present work provides a similar result for specific normal subgroups of RAAGs, called Bestvina-Brady groups: We characterize those graphs in which every subgroup of such a group is itself a RAAG. In turn, we confirm several Galois theoretic conjectures for the pro-$p$ completions of these groups.</description>

      <title>The $\chi$-binding function of $d$-directional segment graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a positive integer $d$, the class $d$-DIR is defined as all those intersection graphs formed from a finite collection of line segments in ${\mathbb R}^2$ having at most $d$ slopes. Since each slope induces an interval graph, it easily follows for every $G$ in $d$-DIR with clique number at most $\omega$ that the chromatic number $\chi(G)$ of $G$ is at most $d\omega$. We show for every even value of $\omega$ how to construct a graph in $d$-DIR that meets this bound exactly. This partially confirms a conjecture of Bhattacharya, Dvo\v{r}\'ak and Noorizadeh. Furthermore, we show that the $\chi$-binding function of $d$-DIR is $\omega \mapsto d\omega$ for $\omega$ even and $\omega \mapsto d(\omega-1)+1$ for $\omega$ odd. This extends an earlier result by Kostochka and Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, which treated the special case $d=2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Azam and Richmond arXiv:2107.09149 obtained a recursion for the generating function of \(P_\lambda(y)\), itself a generating function enumerating by length partitions in the lower ideal \([0,\lambda]\) in the Young lattice. We show that this recursion can be extended to a multi-graded version. This is done by interpreting the original problem as enumerating plane partitions with two rows. We can then use the well-developed theory of lattice points in polyhedral cones to determine some properties of the generating function. We also relate Azam and Richmond's result to those obtained by Andrews and Paule using MacMahons Omega-operator.</description>

      <title>On the on-line coloring of unit interval graphs with proper interval representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05648v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the problem as a two-player game between Algorithm and Builder. The game is played in rounds. Each round, Builder presents an interval that is neither contained in nor contains any previously presented interval. Algorithm immediately and irrevocably assigns the interval a color that has not been assigned to any interval intersecting it. The set of intervals form an interval representation for a unit interval graph and the colors form a proper coloring of that graph. For every positive integer $\omega$, we define the value $R(\omega)$ as the maximum number of colors for which Builder has a strategy that forces Algorithm to use $R(\omega)$ colors with the restriction that the unit interval graph constructed cannot contain a clique of size $\omega$. In 1981, Chrobak and \'{S}lusarek showed that $R(\omega)\leq2\omega -1$. In 2005, Epstein and Levy showed that $R(\omega)\geq\lfloor{3\omega/2\rfloor}$. This problem remained unsolved for $\omega\geq 3$. In 2022, Bir\'o and Curbelo showed that $R(3)=5$. In this paper, we show that $R(4)=7$</description>

      <title>Spectral bipartite Turan problems on linear hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a graph, and let $\mathcal{B}_r(F)$ be the class of $r$-uniform Berge-$F$ hypergraphs. In this paper, we establish a relationship between the spectral radius of the adjacency tensor of a uniform hypergraph and its local structure through walks. Based on the relationship, we give a spectral asymptotic bound for $\mathcal{B}_{r}(C_3)$-free linear $r$-uniform hypergraphs and upper bounds for the spectral radii of $\mathcal{B}_{r}(K_{2,t})$-free or $\{\mathcal{B}_{r}(K_{s,t}),\mathcal{B}_{r}(C_{3})\}$-free linear $r$-uniform hypergraphs, where $C_{3}$ and $K_{s,t}$ are respectively the triangle and the complete bipartite graph with one part having $s$ vertices and the other part having $t$ vertices. Our work implies an upper bound for the number of edges of $\{\mathcal{B}_{r}(K_{s,t}),\mathcal{B}_{r}(C_{3})\}$-free linear $r$-uniform hypergraphs and extends some of the existing research on (spectral) extremal problems of hypergraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the minimization problem of relaxed submodular functions. For a positive integer $k$, a set function is called $k$-distant submodular if the submodular inequality holds for every pair whose symmetric difference is at least $k$. This paper provides a polynomial time algorithm to minimize $k$-distant submodular functions for a fixed positive integer $k$. This result generalizes the tractable result of minimizing 2/3-submodular functions, which satisfy the submodular inequality for at least two pairs formed from every distinct three sets.</description>

      <title>Orientable and negative orientable sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00672v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analogously to de Bruijn sequences, orientable sequences have application in automatic position-location applications and, until recently, studies of these sequences focused on the binary case. In recent work by Alhakim et al., a range of methods of construction were described for orientable sequences over arbitrary finite alphabets; some of these methods involve using negative orientable sequences as a building block. In this paper we describe three techniques for generating such negative orientable sequences, as well as upper bounds on their period. We then go on to show how these negative orientable sequences can be used to generate orientable sequences with period close to the maximum possible for every non-binary alphabet size and for every tuple length. In doing so we use two closely related approaches described by Alhakim et al.</description>

      <title>The Polymatroid Representation of a Greedoid, and Associated Galois Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The greedoid is a significant abstraction of the matroid allowing for a more flexible analysis of structures in which the greedy algorithm "works." However, their diverse structure imposes difficulties towards their application in combinatorial optimization [Sze21]. In response, we revisit the polymatroid greedoid [KL85a] to characterize it by properties approximating those of matroids, by using the submodularity of its polymatroid representation in particular. Towards doing so, our main contribution is a full description of this class. Specifically, we show that a greedoid is a polymatroid greedoid if and only if it is an optimistic interval greedoid whose kernels are closed under intersection. This constitutes the first necessary and sufficient characterization of the polymatroid greedoid in terms of its combinatorial attributes, thereby resolving a central open question of Korte and Lov\'asz [KL85a]. Here, we introduce the optimism property to approximate properties of a matroid's continuations which are implied by the closure axioms of its span, which no longer hold for greedoids. And, because the kernels of an interval greedoid are in many ways an extension of a matroid's closed sets, our direction of necessity is a direct generalization of Birkhoff and Edmond's characterization of the meet in the lattice of a matroid's closed sets [Bir35, Edm03]. Towards achieving this result, our main technical insights arise from relating the lattice of flats of a polymatroid greedoid to that of the closed sets of its representation through order preserving mappings. Specifically, we will show the novel insight that the notion of polymatroid representation considered in [KL85a] is equivalent to the existence of a certain Galois connection. As a consequence, the representation of a greedoid via a polymatroid is an order theoretic concept in disguise.</description>

      <title>The Shortest Interesting Binary Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I will show that there exist two binary words (one of length 4 and one of length 6) that play a special role in many different problems in combinatorics on words. They can therefore be considered \textit{the shortest interesting binary words}. My claim is supported by the fact that these two words appear in dozens of papers in combinatorics on words.</description>

      <title>The Lehmer complex of a Bruhat interval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Lehmer codes, with immersions in the Bruhat order, for several finite Coxeter groups, including all the classical Weyl groups. This allows to associate to each lower Bruhat interval of these groups a multicomplex whose f-polynomial is the Poincar\'e polynomial of the interval. Via a general construction, we prove that these polynomials are h-polynomials of vertex-decomposable simplicial complexes. Moreover we provide a classification, in terms of unimodal permutations, of Poincar\'e polynomials of smooth Schubert varieties in flag manifolds.</description>

      <title>Hindrance from a wasteful common independent set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For (potentially infinite) matroids $ M $ and $ N $, an $ (M,N) $-hindrance is a set $ H$ that is independent but not spanning in $ N.\mathsf{span}_M(H) $. This concept was introduced by Aharoni and Ziv in the very first paper investigating Nash-Williams' Matroid Intersection Conjecture. They proved that the conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the non-existence of hindrances implies the existence of an $ M $-independent spanning set of $ N $.
  In this paper we present a breakthrough towards the Matroid Intersection Conjecture. Namely, we found a matroidal generalization of the `popular vertex' approach applied in the proof of the infinite version of K\"onig's theorem. The main result of this paper is an application of this new approach to show that if $ M $ and $ N $ admit a common independent set $ I $ that is ``wasteful'' in the sense that $ r(M/I)&lt;r(N/I) $, then there exists an $ (M,N) $-hindrance.</description>

      <title>Information Inequalities via Ideas from Additive Combinatorics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11017v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ruzsa's equivalence theorem provided a framework for converting certain families of inequalities in additive combinatorics to entropic inequalities (which sometimes did not possess stand-alone entropic proofs). In this work, we first establish formal equivalences between some families (different from Ruzsa) of inequalities in additive combinatorics and entropic ones. As a first step to further these equivalences, we establish an information-theoretic characterization of the magnification ratio that could also be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Cluster structures on spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the homogeneous coordinate rings of partial flag varieties and Grassmannians in their Pl\"ucker embeddings and exhibit an embedding of the former into the latter. Both rings are cluster algebras and the embedding respects the cluster algebra structures in the sense that there exists a seed for the Grassmannian that restricts to a seed for the partial flag variety (\textit{i.e.} it is obtained by freezing and deleting some cluster variables).
  The motivation for this project stems from the application of cluster algebras in scattering amplitudes: spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties describe massless scattering without assuming dual conformal symmetry. Both may be obtained from Grassmanninas which model the dual conformal case. They are instances of partial flag varieties and their cluster structures reveal information for the scattering amplitudes. As an application of our main result we exhibit the relation between these cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Tropicalizing binary geometries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The type A cluster configuration space, commonly known as $\mathcal M_{0,n}$, is the very affine part of the binary geometry associated with the associahedron. The tropicalization of $\mathcal M_{0,n}$ can be realized as the space of phylogenetic trees and its signed tropicalizations as the dual-associahedron subfans. We give a concise overview of this construction and propose an extension to type C. The type C cluster configuration space $\mathcal M_{\mathrm C_l}$ arises from the binary geometry associated with the cyclohedron. We define a space of axially symmetric phylogenetic trees containing many dual-associahedron and dual-cyclohedron subfans. We conjecturally realize the tropicalization of $\mathcal M_{\mathrm C_l}$ as the defined space and its signed tropicalizations as the aforementioned subfans.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00307v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph is called integral if its eigenvalues are integers. In this article, we provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for a Cayley graph over a finite symmetric algebra $R$ to be integral. This generalizes the work of So who studies the case where $R$ is the ring of integers modulo $n.$ We also explain some number-theoretic constructions of finite symmetric algebras arising from global fields, which we hope could pave the way for future studies on Paley graphs associated with a finite Hecke character.</description>

      <title>Random permutations acting on $k$--tuples have near--optimal spectral gap for $k=\mathrm{poly}(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Friedman's theorem to show that, for any fixed $r$, the random $2r$--regular Schreier graphs depicting the action of $r$ random permutations of $[n]$ on $k_{n}$--tuples of distinct elements in $[n]$ are a.a.s. weakly Ramanujan, for any $k_{n}\leq n^{\frac{1}{12}-\epsilon}.$ Previously this was known only for $k$--tuples where $k$ is fixed. In fact, we prove the stronger result of strong convergence of random matrices in irreducible representations of $S_{n}$ of quasi--exponential dimension.
  We also give a new bound for the expected stable irreducible character of a random permutation obtained via a word map, showing that $\mathbb{E}\left[\chi^{\mu}\left(w(\sigma_{1},\dots,\sigma_{r})\right)\right]=O\left(n^{-k}\right)$, where $k$ is the number of boxes outside the first row of the Young diagram $\mu,$ solving one aspect of a conjecture of Hanany and Puder. We obtain this bound using an extension of Wise's $w$--cycle conjecture.</description>
