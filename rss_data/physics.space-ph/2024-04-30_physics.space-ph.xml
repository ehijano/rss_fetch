      <title>Effects of an Explicit Time-Dependent Radiation Pressure Force on Trajectories of Primary Neutral Hydrogen in the Heliosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiation pressure exerted by solar photon output is salient to the motion of primary neutral hydrogen atoms streaming into the inner heliosphere directly from the Local Interstellar Medium (LISM). The action of a time-dependent radiation pressure force, when coupled with the usual gravitational force, changes the characteristic velocities, and therefore energies, of the atoms when they reach regions in which explorer probes are present. A study is presented that uses a 2D code to backtrace neutral hydrogen trajectories from representative target points located 1 au from the Sun. It makes use of both a radiation pressure function and a function for the photoionization rate at 1 au that oscillate with time based on measurements over a typical solar cycle, as well as a time-independent charge exchange ionization rate at 1 au. Assuming a Maxwellian distribution in the distant upwind direction, phase space data is calculated at the target points, at different moments in time. The dependence of the force on the radial particle velocity has been omitted in the analysis, such that the emphasis is on the effects of the global solar UV intensity variations through the solar cycle. This process allows for analysis of direct and indirect Maxwellian components through time and space in the time-dependent force environment. Additionally, pseudo-bound orbits caused by energy losses associated with this force environment are observed and their properties evaluated with the aim of determining their effects on potential measurements by explorer probes.</description>

      <title>Summary of SatHub, and the current observational status of satellite constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SatHub is one of the four hubs of the IAU Centre for the Protection of the Dark and Quiet Sky from Satellite Constellation Interference (CPS). It focuses on observations, data analysis, software, and training materials to improve our understanding of the impact of satellite constellations on astronomy and observers worldwide. As a preface to more in-depth IAUS385 sessions, we gave a summary of some recent work by SatHub members and the current status of satellite constellations, including optical and radio observations. We shared how the audience can join or get more involved, e.g., via the CPS Slack for asynchronous collaboration. We also touched on what a future with hundreds of thousands of constellation satellites might look like.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the type-III radiation observed near the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: AIMS 1. To use Parker Solar Probe (PSP) data to test the accepted theory that type-III radiation is produced by counter-streaming Langmuir waves that coalesce to produce the electromagnetic wave at twice the Langmuir frequency. 2. If this theory is found to be incorrect, to replace it with a description of type-III generation that is consistent with the PSP data.
  METHODS To obtain new properties of the Langmuir wave and its harmonics, their phase velocities and density fluctuations were measured. If the harmonic wave was electromagnetic, as in the accepted theory, these quantities would not be measurable. However, in an electrostatic wave, they would be measurable by the PSP instruments.
  RESULTS The Langmuir wave and its harmonics at frequencies of n{\omega}p, where {\omega}p = 2PI*125 kHz is the Langmuir frequency and n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, were measured in an active type-III event. The lowest harmonics contained density fluctuations, so they were electrostatic waves and not type-III emissions. This result was bolstered by measuring their very slow phase velocities (~2000 km/sec) which are not those of a type-III wave. Thus, the harmonic waves were not a result of the three-wave interaction (as required by the accepted theory) but they were electrostatic antenna waves produced by radiation of the Langmuir wave. As at least the first harmonic wave evolved through density irregularities, its wave number decreased and it became the electromagnetic wave that was the type-III radiation.</description>
