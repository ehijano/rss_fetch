      <title>FinPos: A Position-Aware Trading Agent System for Real Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exceptional potential of large language models (LLMs) in handling text information has garnered significant attention in the field of financial trading. However, current trading agents primarily focus on single-step trading tasks and lack awareness of continuous position management. Therefore, we propose a position-aware trading task designed to simulate a more realistic market. To address this task, we develop a trading agent system, FinPos, optimized for position management. FinPos is able to interpret various types of market information from a professional perspective, providing a reliable basis for positioning decisions. To mitigate the substantial market risks arising from position fluctuations, FinPos employs dual decision agents. Furthermore, the continuous nature of position management necessitates our adoption of multi-timescale rewards, which in turn empowers FinPos to effectively balance short-term fluctuations against long-term trends. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FinPos surpasses state-of-the-art trading agents in the position-aware trading task, which closely mirrors real market conditions. More importantly, our findings reveal that LLM-centered agent systems exhibit a vast, largely unexplored potential in long-term market decision-making.</description>

      <title>LAFA: Agentic LLM-Driven Federated Analytics over Decentralized Data Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18477v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise in automating data analytics tasks by interpreting natural language queries and generating multi-operation execution plans. However, existing LLM-agent-based analytics frameworks operate under the assumption of centralized data access, offering little to no privacy protection. In contrast, federated analytics (FA) enables privacy-preserving computation across distributed data sources, but lacks support for natural language input and requires structured, machine-readable queries. In this work, we present LAFA, the first system that integrates LLM-agent-based data analytics with FA. LAFA introduces a hierarchical multi-agent architecture that accepts natural language queries and transforms them into optimized, executable FA workflows. A coarse-grained planner first decomposes complex queries into sub-queries, while a fine-grained planner maps each subquery into a Directed Acyclic Graph of FA operations using prior structural knowledge. To improve execution efficiency, an optimizer agent rewrites and merges multiple DAGs, eliminating redundant operations and minimizing computational and communicational overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that LAFA consistently outperforms baseline prompting strategies by achieving higher execution plan success rates and reducing resource-intensive FA operations by a substantial margin. This work establishes a practical foundation for privacy-preserving, LLM-driven analytics that supports natural language input in the FA setting.</description>

      <title>The Denario project: Deep knowledge AI agents for scientific discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Denario, an AI multi-agent system designed to serve as a scientific research assistant. Denario can perform many different tasks, such as generating ideas, checking the literature, developing research plans, writing and executing code, making plots, and drafting and reviewing a scientific paper. The system has a modular architecture, allowing it to handle specific tasks, such as generating an idea, or carrying out end-to-end scientific analysis using Cmbagent as a deep-research backend. In this work, we describe in detail Denario and its modules, and illustrate its capabilities by presenting multiple AI-generated papers generated by it in many different scientific disciplines such as astrophysics, biology, biophysics, biomedical informatics, chemistry, material science, mathematical physics, medicine, neuroscience and planetary science. Denario also excels at combining ideas from different disciplines, and we illustrate this by showing a paper that applies methods from quantum physics and machine learning to astrophysical data. We report the evaluations performed on these papers by domain experts, who provided both numerical scores and review-like feedback. We then highlight the strengths, weaknesses, and limitations of the current system. Finally, we discuss the ethical implications of AI-driven research and reflect on how such technology relates to the philosophy of science. We publicly release the code at https://github.com/AstroPilot-AI/Denario. A Denario demo can also be run directly on the web at https://huggingface.co/spaces/astropilot-ai/Denario, and the full app will be deployed on the cloud.</description>

      <title>Design for One, Deploy for Many: Navigating Tree Mazes with Multiple Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maze-like environments, such as cave and pipe networks, pose unique challenges for multiple robots to coordinate, including communication constraints and congestion. To address these challenges, we propose a distributed multi-agent maze traversal algorithm for environments that can be represented by acyclic graphs. It uses a leader-switching mechanism where one agent, assuming a head role, employs any single-agent maze solver while the other agents each choose an agent to follow. The head role gets transferred to neighboring agents where necessary, ensuring it follows the same path as a single agent would. The multi-agent maze traversal algorithm is evaluated in simulations with groups of up to 300 agents, various maze sizes, and multiple single-agent maze solvers. It is compared against strategies that are na\"ive, or assume either global communication or full knowledge of the environment. The algorithm outperforms the na\"ive strategy in terms of makespan and sum-of-fuel. It is superior to the global-communication strategy in terms of makespan but is inferior to it in terms of sum-of-fuel. The findings suggest it is asymptotically equivalent to the full-knowledge strategy with respect to either metric. Moreover, real-world experiments with up to 20 Pi-puck robots confirm the feasibility of the approach.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Integrated Estimation-Guidance for Simultaneous Interception of Moving Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a cooperative integrated estimation-guidance framework for simultaneous interception of a non-maneuvering target using a team of unmanned autonomous vehicles, assuming only a subset of vehicles are equipped with dedicated sensors to measure the target's states. Unlike earlier approaches that focus solely on either estimation or guidance design, the proposed framework unifies both within a cooperative architecture. To circumvent the limitation posed by heterogeneity in target observability, sensorless vehicles estimate the target's state by leveraging information exchanged with neighboring agents over a directed communication topology through a prescribed-time observer. The proposed approach employs true proportional navigation guidance (TPNG), which uses an exact time-to-go formulation and is applicable across a wide spectrum of target motions. Furthermore, prescribed-time observer and controller are employed to achieve convergence to true target's state and consensus in time-to-go within set predefined times, respectively. Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework under various engagement scenarios.</description>

      <title>Challenges in Credit Assignment for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Open Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), understanding the dynamics of open systems is crucial. Openness in MARL refers to the dynam-ic nature of agent populations, tasks, and agent types with-in a system. Specifically, there are three types of openness as reported in (Eck et al. 2023) [2]: agent openness, where agents can enter or leave the system at any time; task openness, where new tasks emerge, and existing ones evolve or disappear; and type openness, where the capabil-ities and behaviors of agents change over time. This report provides a conceptual and empirical review, focusing on the interplay between openness and the credit assignment problem (CAP). CAP involves determining the contribution of individual agents to the overall system performance, a task that becomes increasingly complex in open environ-ments. Traditional credit assignment (CA) methods often assume static agent populations, fixed and pre-defined tasks, and stationary types, making them inadequate for open systems. We first conduct a conceptual analysis, in-troducing new sub-categories of openness to detail how events like agent turnover or task cancellation break the assumptions of environmental stationarity and fixed team composition that underpin existing CAP methods. We then present an empirical study using representative temporal and structural algorithms in an open environment. The results demonstrate that openness directly causes credit misattribution, evidenced by unstable loss functions and significant performance degradation.</description>

      <title>Social learning moderates the tradeoffs between efficiency, stability, and equity in group foraging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social learning shapes collective search by influencing how individuals use peer information. Empirical and computational studies show that optimal information sharing that is neither too localized nor too diffuse, can enhance resource detection and coordination. Building on these insights, we develop a randomized search model that integrates social learning with area-restricted search (ARS) to investigate how communication distance affects collective foraging. The model includes three behavioral modes: exploration, exploitation, and targeted walk, which are governed by a single parameter, $\rho$, that balances exploration and exploitation at the group level. We quantify how $\rho$ influences group efficiency ($\eta$), temporal variability/burstiness ($B$), and agent variability/equity in resource distribution ($\sigma$), revealing a clear trade-off among these outcomes. When $\rho \to 0$, agents explore independently, maximizing collective exploration. As $\rho$ increases, individuals preferentially exploit patches discovered by others: $\eta$ first rises and then declines, while $B$ shows the opposite trend. Group efficiency is optimized at interior $\rho$ values that balance exploration and exploitation. At the largest $\rho$, equality among agents is highest, but efficiency declines and burstiness is maximized too. Finally, by introducing negative rewards, we examine how social learning mitigates risk.</description>

      <title>PartnerMAS: An LLM Hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework for Business Partner Selection on High-Dimensional Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional decision-making tasks, such as business partner selection, involve evaluating large candidate pools with heterogeneous numerical, categorical, and textual features. While large language models (LLMs) offer strong in-context reasoning capabilities, single-agent or debate-style systems often struggle with scalability and consistency in such settings. We propose PartnerMAS, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes evaluation into three layers: a Planner Agent that designs strategies, Specialized Agents that perform role-specific assessments, and a Supervisor Agent that integrates their outputs. To support systematic evaluation, we also introduce a curated benchmark dataset of venture capital co-investments, featuring diverse firm attributes and ground-truth syndicates. Across 140 cases, PartnerMAS consistently outperforms single-agent and debate-based multi-agent baselines, achieving up to 10--15\% higher match rates. Analysis of agent reasoning shows that planners are most responsive to domain-informed prompts, specialists produce complementary feature coverage, and supervisors play an important role in aggregation. Our findings demonstrate that structured collaboration among LLM agents can generate more robust outcomes than scaling individual models, highlighting PartnerMAS as a promising framework for high-dimensional decision-making in data-rich domains.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Application of Utility Theory in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As a unifying concept in economics, game theory, and operations research, even in the Robotics and AI field, the utility is used to evaluate the level of individual needs, preferences, and interests. Especially for decision-making and learning in multi-agent/robot systems (MAS/MRS), a suitable utility model can guide agents in choosing reasonable strategies to achieve their current needs and learning to cooperate and organize their behaviors, optimizing the system's utility, building stable and reliable relationships, and guaranteeing each group member's sustainable development, similar to the human society. Although these systems' complex, large-scale, and long-term behaviors are strongly determined by the fundamental characteristics of the underlying relationships, there has been less discussion on the theoretical aspects of mechanisms and the fields of applications in Robotics and AI. This paper introduces a utility-orient needs paradigm to describe and evaluate inter and outer relationships among agents' interactions. Then, we survey existing literature in relevant fields to support it and propose several promising research directions along with some open problems deemed necessary for further investigations.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Agent Symmetries for Performance Analysis of Distributed Optimization Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that, in many settings, the worst-case performance of a distributed optimization algorithm is independent of the number of agents in the system, and can thus be computed in the fundamental case with just two agents. This result relies on a novel approach that systematically exploits symmetries in worst-case performance computation, framed as Semidefinite Programming (SDP) via the Performance Estimation Problem (PEP) framework. Harnessing agent symmetries in the PEP yields compact problems whose size is independent of the number of agents in the system. When all agents are equivalent in the problem, we establish the explicit conditions under which the resulting worst-case performance is independent of the number of agents and is therefore equivalent to the basic case with two agents. Our compact PEP formulation also allows the consideration of multiple equivalence classes of agents, and its size only depends on the number of equivalence classes. This enables practical and automated performance analysis of distributed algorithms in numerous complex and realistic settings, such as the analysis of the worst agent performance. We leverage this new tool to analyze the performance of the EXTRA algorithm in advanced settings and its scalability with the number of agents, providing a tighter analysis and deeper understanding of the algorithm performance.</description>

      <title>CogPlanner: Unveiling the Potential of Agentic Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation with Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (MRAG) systems have shown promise in enhancing the generation capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). However, existing MRAG frameworks primarily adhere to rigid, single-step retrieval strategies that fail to address real-world challenges of information acquisition and query reformulation. In this work, we introduce the task of Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation Planning (MRAG Planning) that aims at effective information seeking and integration while minimizing computational overhead. Specifically, we propose CogPlanner, an agentic plug-and-play framework inspired by human cognitive processes, which iteratively determines query reformulation and retrieval strategies to generate accurate and contextually relevant responses. CogPlanner supports parallel and sequential modeling paradigms. Furthermore, we introduce CogBench, a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the MRAG Planning task and facilitate lightweight CogPlanner integration with resource-efficient MLLMs, such as Qwen2-VL-7B-Cog. Experimental results demonstrate that CogPlanner significantly outperforms existing MRAG baselines, offering improvements in both accuracy and efficiency with minimal additional computational costs.</description>

      <title>GenSwarm: Scalable Multi-Robot Code-Policy Generation and Deployment via Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of control policies for multi-robot systems traditionally follows a complex and labor-intensive process, often lacking the flexibility to adapt to dynamic tasks. This has motivated research on methods to automatically create control policies. However, these methods require iterative processes of manually crafting and refining objective functions, thereby prolonging the development cycle. This work introduces \textit{GenSwarm}, an end-to-end system that leverages large language models to automatically generate and deploy control policies for multi-robot tasks based on simple user instructions in natural language. As a multi-language-agent system, GenSwarm achieves zero-shot learning, enabling rapid adaptation to altered or unseen tasks. The white-box nature of the code policies ensures strong reproducibility and interpretability. With its scalable software and hardware architectures, GenSwarm supports efficient policy deployment on both simulated and real-world multi-robot systems, realizing an instruction-to-execution end-to-end functionality that could prove valuable for robotics specialists and non-specialists alike.The code of the proposed GenSwarm system is available online: https://github.com/WindyLab/GenSwarm.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Objective-Driven Dynamical Stochastic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fields offer a versatile approach for describing complex systems composed of interacting and dynamic components. In particular, some of these dynamical and stochastic systems may exhibit goal-directed behaviors aimed at achieving specific objectives, which we refer to as $\textit{intelligent fields}$. However, due to their inherent complexity, it remains challenging to develop a formal theoretical description of such systems and to effectively translate these descriptions into practical applications. In this paper, we propose three fundamental principles to establish a theoretical framework for understanding intelligent fields: complete configuration, locality, and purposefulness. Moreover, we explore methodologies for designing such fields from the perspective of artificial intelligence applications. This initial investigation aims to lay the groundwork for future theoretical developments and practical advances in understanding and harnessing the potential of such objective-driven dynamical stochastic fields.</description>
