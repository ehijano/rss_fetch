      <title>Hybrid Quantum-Classical Detection for RIS-Assisted SC-FDE via Grover Adaptive Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wideband and low-latency requirements in sixth-generation (6G) networks demand detectors that approach maximum-likelihood (ML) performance without incurring exponential complexity. This work develops a hybrid quantum-classical detection framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted single-carrier (SC) frequency-domain equalization (FDE) over frequency-selective channels. The ML detection objective is reformulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and solved via Grover adaptive search (GAS). To accelerate convergence, we introduce a frequency-domain MMSE threshold that exploits the circulant structure of SC-FDE channels, yielding low-complexity initialization. The framework is evaluated across varying channel lengths and RIS sizes, confirming robustness and scalability. In addition, GAS requirements are quantified through register widths and gate counts, and its query complexity is analyzed to characterize the algorithm's cost for block transmission in frequency-selective channels. Quantum circuit simulations are conducted in Qiskit under both ideal and noisy conditions. In the ideal case, the detector achieves near-optimal performance while benefiting from Grover's quadratic speedup, reducing the search cost from from O(M^N) exhaustive evaluations to O(SQRT(M^N)) oracle queries. Under noise, the shallow depth of the GAS circuits, aided by MMSE initialization, makes depolarizing errors negligible, while readout errors introduce moderate degradation yet still preserve performance close to the MMSE baseline. These results establish the feasibility of quantum-enhanced detection for RIS-assisted broadband communications, highlighting both algorithmic scalability and practical robustness for 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Improving dynamic congestion isolation in data-center networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of distributed AI and large-scale applications has impacted the communication operations of data-center and Supercomputer interconnection networks, leading to dramatic incast or in-network congestion scenarios and challenging existing congestion control mechanisms, such as injection throttling (e.g., DCQCN) or congestion isolation (CI). While DCQCN provides a scalable traffic rate adjustment for congesting flows at end nodes (which is slow) and CI effectively isolates these flows in special network resources (which requires extra logic in the switches), their combined use, although it diminishes their particular drawbacks, leads to false congestion scenarios identification and signaling, excessive throttling, and inefficient network resource utilization. In this paper, we propose a new CI mechanism, called Improved Congestion Isolation (ICI), which efficiently combines CI and DCQCN so that the information of the isolated congesting flows is used to guide the ECN marking performed by DCQCN in a way that victim flows do not end up being marked. This coordination reduces false-positive congestion detection, suppresses unnecessary closed-loop feedback (i.e., wrong congestion notifications), and improves responsiveness to communication microbursts. Evaluated under diverse traffic patterns, including incast and Data-center workloads, ICI reduces the number of generated BECNs by up to 32x and improves tail latency by up to 31%, while maintaining high throughput and scalability.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning with Gramian Angular Fields for Privacy-Preserving ECG Classification on Heterogeneous IoT Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a federated learning (FL) framework for privacy-preserving electrocardiogram (ECG) classification in Internet of Things (IoT) healthcare environments. By transforming 1D ECG signals into 2D Gramian Angular Field (GAF) images, the proposed approach enables efficient feature extraction through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while ensuring that sensitive medical data remain local to each device. This work is among the first to experimentally validate GAF-based federated ECG classification across heterogeneous IoT devices, quantifying both performance and communication efficiency. To evaluate feasibility in realistic IoT settings, we deployed the framework across a server, a laptop, and a resource-constrained Raspberry Pi 4, reflecting edge-cloud integration in IoT ecosystems. Experimental results demonstrate that the FL-GAF model achieves a high classification accuracy of 95.18% in a multi-client setup, significantly outperforming a single-client baseline in both accuracy and training time. Despite the added computational complexity of GAF transformations, the framework maintains efficient resource utilization and communication overhead. These findings highlight the potential of lightweight, privacy-preserving AI for IoT-based healthcare monitoring, supporting scalable and secure edge deployments in smart health systems.</description>

      <title>Disaggregated Architectures and the Redesign of Data Center Ecosystems: Scheduling, Pooling, and Infrastructure Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hardware disaggregation seeks to transform Data Center (DC) resources from traditional server fleets into unified resource pools. Despite existing challenges that may hinder its full realization, significant progress has been made in both industry and academia. In this article, we provide an overview of the motivations and recent advancements in hardware disaggregation. We further discuss the research challenges and opportunities associated with disaggregated architectures, focusing on aspects that have received limited attention. We argue that hardware disaggregation has the potential to reshape the entire DC ecosystem, impacting application design, resource scheduling, hardware configuration, cooling, and power system optimization. Additionally, we present a numerical study to illustrate several key aspects of these challenges.</description>

      <title>Age of Job Completion Minimization with Stable Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a time-slotted job-assignment system with a central server, N users and a machine which changes its state according to a Markov chain (hence called a Markov machine). The users submit their jobs to the central server according to a stochastic job arrival process. For each user, the server has a dedicated job queue. Upon receiving a job from a user, the server stores that job in the corresponding queue. When the machine is not working on a job assigned by the server, the machine can be either in internally busy or in free state, and the dynamics of these states follow a binary symmetric Markov chain. Upon sampling the state information of the machine, if the server identifies that the machine is in the free state, it schedules a user and submits a job to the machine from the job queue of the scheduled user. To maximize the number of jobs completed per unit time, we introduce a new metric, referred to as the age of job completion. To minimize the age of job completion and the sampling cost, we propose two policies and numerically evaluate their performance. For both of these policies, we find sufficient conditions under which the job queues will remain stable.</description>

      <title>TIMESAFE: Timing Interruption Monitoring and Security Assessment for Fronthaul Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 5G and beyond cellular systems embrace the disaggregation of Radio Access Network (RAN) components, exemplified by the evolution of the fronthaul (FH) connection between cellular baseband and radio unit equipment. Crucially, synchronization over the FH is pivotal for reliable 5G services. In recent years, there has been a push to move these links to an Ethernet-based packet network topology, leveraging existing standards and ongoing research for Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN). However, TSN standards, such as Precision Time Protocol (PTP), focus on performance with little to no concern for security. This increases the exposure of the open FH to security risks. Attacks targeting synchronization mechanisms pose significant threats, potentially disrupting 5G networks and impairing connectivity.
  In this paper, we demonstrate the impact of successful spoofing and replay attacks against PTP synchronization. We show how a spoofing attack is able to cause a production-ready O-RAN and 5G-compliant private cellular base station to catastrophically fail within 2 seconds of the attack, necessitating manual intervention to restore full network operations. To counter this, we design a Machine Learning (ML)-based monitoring solution capable of detecting various malicious attacks with over 97.5% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Energy and Latency in 6G Smart Cities with Edge CyberTwins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of IoT devices in smart cities challenges 6G networks with conflicting energy-latency requirements across heterogeneous slices. Existing approaches struggle with the energy-latency trade-off, particularly for massive scale deployments exceeding 50,000 devices km. This paper proposes an edge-aware CyberTwin framework integrating hybrid federated learning for energy-latency co-optimization in 6G network slicing. Our approach combines centralized Artificial Intelligence scheduling for latency-sensitive slices with distributed federated learning for non-critical slices, enhanced by compressive sensing-based digital twins and renewable energy-aware resource allocation. The hybrid scheduler leverages a three-tier architecture with Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) based security attestation achieving 99.7% attack detection accuracy. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate 52% energy reduction for non-real-time slices compared to Diffusion-Reinforcement Learning baselines while maintaining 0.9ms latency for URLLC applications with 99.1% SLA compliance. The framework scales to 50,000 devices km with CPU overhead below 25%, validated through NS-3 hybrid simulations across realistic smart city scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Modular DTaaS Architecture for Predictive Slice Management in 6G Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks will require fundamentally new orchestration paradigms to meet stringent requirements for ultra-low latency, high reliability, and pervasive intelligence. Network slicing emerges as a key enabler to support diverse services with customized quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees. However, dynamic and fine-grained slice management poses significant challenges in terms of real-time provisioning, SLA assurance, and cross-layer observability. In this paper, we propose a novel Digital Twin as a Service (DTaaS) framework that embeds per-slice digital twins (SDTs) into the orchestration loop. Each SDT maintains a synchronized, real-time representation of its slice, leveraging multi-domain telemetry and deep sequential models to predict traffic evolution and SLA risks. The framework introduces modular intelligence layers, programmable interfaces, and edge-embedded decision-making to enable proactive provisioning, adaptive scaling, and closed-loop SLA assurance. Mathematical formulations for fidelity measurement, predictive control, and optimization objectives are provided to ensure rigor and transparency. Evaluation results demonstrate that DTaaS significantly improves SLA compliance ratio, reduces resource over-provisioning, and lowers average SLA violation probability, offering a scalable and reliable orchestration approach for 6G networks.</description>
