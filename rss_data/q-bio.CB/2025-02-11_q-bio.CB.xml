      <title>MultistageOT: Multistage optimal transport infers trajectories from a snapshot of single-cell data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA-sequencing captures a temporal slice, or a snapshot, of a cell differentiation process. A major bioinformatical challenge is the inference of differentiation trajectories from a single snapshot, and methods that account for outlier cells that are unrelated to the differentiation process have yet to be established. We present MultistageOT: a Multistage Optimal Transport-based framework for trajectory inference in a snapshot (https://github.com/dahlinlab/MultistageOT). Application of optimal transport has proven successful for many single-cell tasks, but classical bimarginal optimal transport for trajectory inference fails to model temporal progression in a snapshot. Representing a novel generalization of optimal transport, MultistageOT addresses this major limitation by introducing a temporal dimension, allowing for high resolution modeling of intermediate differentiation stages. We challenge MultistageOT with snapshot data of cell differentiation, demonstrating effectiveness in pseudotime ordering, detection of outliers, and significantly improved fate prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>DCENWCNet: A Deep CNN Ensemble Network for White Blood Cell Classification with LIME-Based Explainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White blood cells (WBC) are important parts of our immune system, and they protect our body against infections by eliminating viruses, bacteria, parasites and fungi. The number of WBC types and the total number of WBCs provide important information about our health status. A traditional method, convolutional neural networks (CNN), a deep learning architecture, can classify the blood cell from a part of an object and perform object recognition. Various CNN models exhibit potential; however, their development often involves ad-hoc processes that neglect unnecessary layers, leading to issues with unbalanced datasets and insufficient data augmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel ensemble approach that integrates three CNN architectures, each uniquely configured with different dropout and max-pooling layer settings to enhance feature learning. This ensemble model, named DCENWCNet, effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off. When evaluated on the widely recognized Rabbin-WBC dataset, our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art networks, achieving highest mean accuracy. Additionally, it demonstrates superior performance in precision, recall, F1-score, and Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) across all categories. To delve deeper into the interpretability of classifiers, we employ reliable post-hoc explanation techniques, including Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). These methods approximate the behavior of a black-box model by elucidating the relationships between feature values and predictions. Interpretable results enable users to comprehend and validate the model's predictions, thereby increasing their confidence in the automated diagnosis.</description>
