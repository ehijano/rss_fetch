      <title>Mass-manufactured Gradient Plasmonic Metasurfaces for Enhanced Mid-IR Spectrochemical Analysis of Complex Biofluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared spectroscopy offers powerful label-free molecular analysis capabilities but faces significant challenges when analyzing complex biological samples. Here, we present a transformative surface-enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) platform that overcomes fundamental limitations through key innovations. First, we demonstrate high-throughput wafer-scale fabrication of mid-IR plasmonic micro-hole-array (MHA) metasurfaces on free-standing silicon nitride membranes, yielding approximately 400 sensor chips per 6-inch wafer. Second, our gradient MHA metasurface design supports spectrally cascaded plasmonic modes, generating over 400 sharp resonance peaks across the 1200-2000 cm-1 fingerprint region. This approach enables comprehensive molecular fingerprinting using simple imaging optics in transmission mode. Third, we validate our SEIRAS platform using a model polymer system and clinical peritoneal fluid samples from ovarian cancer patients, demonstrating its capability to resolve complex molecular signatures in real biological specimens. The platform's dense spectral coverage ensures optimal on-resonance enhancement across the broad fingerprint region, revealing previously obscured vibrational bands that conventional IR spectroscopy cannot distinguish. By combining high-throughput fabrication with simplified optical readout and the capability to analyze complex biological samples, our work establishes a foundation for translating SEIRAS technology into practical biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Nanocavity-Enhanced Second-Harmonic Generation from Colossal Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are an attractive medium for nonlinear optics and deterministic heterogeneous integration with photonic devices. Their intrinsic nonlinearities can be strengthened further by coupling QDs to low mode-volume photonic nanocavities, enabling low-power, on-chip nonlinear optics. In this paper, we demonstrated cavity-enhanced second harmonic generation via integration of colossal QDs with a silicon nitride nanobeam cavity. By pumping the cavity-QD system with an ultrafast pulsed laser, we observed a strong second harmonic generation from the cavity-coupled QD, and we estimate an enhancement factor of ~3,040. Our work, coupled with previously reported deterministic positioning of colossal QDs, can enable a scalable QD-cavity platform for low-power nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Selective Tweezing and Immobilization of Colloids for Dexterous Manipulation of Biological Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assembly of arbitrary 3D structures using nano- to micron-scale colloidal building blocks has broad applications in photonics, electronics, and biology. Combining optical tweezers (OT) with two-photon polymerization (TPP) enables 3D selective tweezing and immobilization of colloids (STIC) without requiring specialized particle functionalization. Unlike traditional approaches, we demonstrate that high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser pulses, rather than continuous-wave lasers, allow optical tweezing at intensities below the TPP threshold. This dual functionality enables both OT and TPP using a single laser source. This platform was applied on S. aureus cells into desired configurations, highlighting its potential for advanced cell patterning. TPP was further used to fabricate intricate 3D microstructures, including microgrooves and cylindrical constructs, facilitating spatially resolved studies of single-cell dynamics and interactions. This work highlights the potential of STIC as a versatile tool for advanced biological applications, including tissue engineering and microbial research.</description>

      <title>Tunable Absorption in Near Infrared Based on Indium Tin Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a serrated ultra-broadband infrared absorber based on the multi-layer repetitive stacking of indium tin oxide (ITO) and silicon materials. This absorber achieves continuously tunable absorption within a wide infrared light range. By changing the size and materials of the absorber, its average absorption rate can reach a relatively high level. Simulation results reveal wavelength-dependent electric field localization: shorter wavelengths concentrate in narrower upper regions, while longer wavelengths localize in wider lower areas. This design offers potential applications in near-infrared detectors, optical communication, and smart windows.</description>

      <title>A 262 TOPS Hyperdimensional Photonic AI Accelerator powered by a Si3N4 microcomb laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ever-increasing volume of data has necessitated a new computing paradigm, embodied through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Large Language Models (LLMs). Digital electronic AI computing systems, however, are gradually reaching their physical plateaus, stimulating extensive research towards next-generation AI accelerators. Photonic Neural Networks (PNNs), with their unique ability to capitalize on the interplay of multiple physical dimensions including time, wavelength, and space, have been brought forward with a credible promise for boosting computational power and energy efficiency in AI processors. In this article, we experimentally demonstrate a novel multidimensional arrayed waveguide grating router (AWGR)-based photonic AI accelerator that can execute tensor multiplications at a record-high total computational power of 262 TOPS, offering a ~24x improvement over the existing waveguide-based optical accelerators. It consists of a 16x16 AWGR that exploits the time-, wavelength- and space- division multiplexing (T-WSDM) for weight and input encoding together with an integrated Si3N4-based frequency comb for multi-wavelength generation. The photonic AI accelerator has been experimentally validated in both Fully-Connected (FC) and Convolutional NN (NNs) models, with the FC and CNN being trained for DDoS attack identification and MNIST classification, respectively. The experimental inference at 32 Gbaud achieved a Cohen's kappa score of 0.867 for DDoS detection and an accuracy of 92.14% for MNIST classification, respectively, closely matching the software performance.</description>

      <title>Group Delay Dispersion Measurements of Novel Multilayer Interference Coatings in the Mid-Infrared Spectral Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the methods and results for broadband group delay dispersion measurements for all-monocrystalline and amorphous-crystalline hybrid supermirrors, as well as an all-amorphous mirror in the wavelength range from \SIrange{2.5}{4.8}{\micro \metre}. Measurements are performed using a custom-built white light interferometer that allows for balanced and unbalanced measurement configurations. We compare the results to theoretical transfer-matrix method simulations and an alternative measurement using a commercial Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer. Additionally, we investigate group delay dispersion by direct differentiation using a local polynomial smoothing approach (Savitzky-Golay filter) and find strong consistency between our results, the theoretical prediction and the estimation using this method.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal-symmetry bounds on electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For linear electromagnetic systems possessing time-reversal symmetry, we present an approach to bound ratios of internal fields excited from different ports, using only the scattering matrix (S matrix), improving upon previous related bounds by Sounas and Al\`u (2017). By reciprocity, emitted-wave amplitudes from internal dipole sources are bounded in a similar way. When applied to coupled-resonant systems, our method constrains ratios of resonant coupling/decay coefficients. We also obtain a relation for the relative phase of fields excited from the two ports and the ratio of field intensities in a two-port system. In addition, although lossy systems do not have time-reversal symmetry, we can still approximately bound loss-induced non-unitarity of the S matrix using only the lossless S matrix. We show numerical validations of the near-tightness of our bounds in various scattering systems.</description>

      <title>Bicircular Light Induced Multi-State Geometric Current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the photocurrent induced by bicircular light (BCL) in materials, with a focus on its multi-state geometric nature. BCL, a combination of left- and right-circularly polarized light, can generate both injection and shift currents, originating from the geometric properties of gauge-invariant shift vectors, quantum geometric tensors, and triple-phase products. Crucially, the real parts of the quantum geometric tensors and triple-phase products remain nonzero in centrosymmetric systems, facilitating photocurrent generation in contrast to the traditional shift current bulk photovoltaic effect. Using a diagrammatic approach, we systematically analyze the BCL-induced photocurrents and demonstrate the multi-state geometric nature within a one-dimensional three-site Rice-Mele model. Our findings provide a quantum geometric understanding of BCL-induced photocurrents, underscoring the importance of considering multi-band contributions in real materials.</description>

      <title>The influence of shot noise on the performance of phase singularity-based refractometric sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological singularities of optical response functions -- such as reflection amplitudes -- enable elegant practical applications ranging from analog signal processing to novel molecular sensing approaches. A phase singularity-based refractometric sensor monitors the rapidly evolving argument of the optical field near the point of phase singularity, in contrast to the reflection zero in traditional surface plasmon polariton sensors. This raises a natural question: What happens with the sensitivity and resolution of such a sensor when it operates close to a zero of the response function, where the detected signal may be greatly influenced by various noise sources? In this paper, we systematically study the effect of the shot noise on the performance of a generic phase singularity-based refractometric sensor. We develop a theoretical model of a spectroscopic ellipsometry-based system operating near a phase singularity and couple the macroscopic optical picture of the detection with a quantum shot noise model. Within the developed model, we illustrate how the shot noise of the detector comes into play and study its effect on the sensitivity and resolution of the refractometric sensor. Our results suggest that such an ellipsometry-based phase singularity sensor remains stable even in the presence of shot noise near the point of zero reflection.</description>

Abstract: We report an all-lossy index-guided dual-core photonic crystal fiber (PCF) that hosts a second-order exceptional point (EP) in the systems parameter space. By appropriately selecting a parametric encirclement scheme around the EP, the interaction between the coupled modes has been studied, and the mode conversion is subsequently observed.</description>

      <title>Uncovering hidden resonances in non-Hermitian systems with scattering thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The points where diffraction orders emerge or vanish in the propagating spectrum of periodic non-Hermitian systems are referred to as scattering thresholds. Close to these branch points, resonances from different Riemann sheets can tremendously impact the optical response. However, these resonances were so far elusive for two reasons. First, their contribution to the signal is partially obscured, and second, they are inaccessible for standard computational methods. Here, we explore the interplay of scattering thresholds with resonances and introduce a multi-valued rational approximation to access the hidden resonances. Our theoretical and numerical approach is used to analyze the resonances of a plasmonic line grating. This work elegantly explains the occurrence of pronounced spectral features at scattering thresholds applicable to many nanophotonic systems of contemporary and future interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a generalized nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation simulation model of an extreme learning machine based on optical fiber propagation. Using handwritten digit classification as a benchmark, we study how accuracy depends on propagation dynamics, as well as parameters governing spectral encoding, readout, and noise. Test accuracies of over 91% and 93% are found for propagation in the anomalous and normal dispersion regimes respectively. Our simulation results also suggest that quantum noise on the input pulses introduces an intrinsic penalty to ELM performance.</description>

      <title>Manipulate intrinsic light-matter interaction with bound state in the continuum in van der Waals metasurfaces by artificial etching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent demonstrations of van der Waals (vdW) nanophotonics have opened new pathways for manipulating the light-matter interaction in an intrinsic manner, leading to fascinating achievements in tunable magneto-optics by self-hybrid polaritons, indirect bandgap lasering, and exceptionally enhanced optical nonlinearity. However, the anisotropic atomic lattice, chemically active side walls, and distinct enthalpies of formation across vdW materials, pose significant challenges in nanofabrication and material choices, hindering the realization of high-Q resonant mode on arbitrary materials. In this work, we propose an etch-free vdW structure that mimics the shallow etching, termed "artificial etching". This approach utilizes a low refractive index (LRI) perturbation layer made of photoresist, drastically reducing radiation loss and experimentally achieving a remarkable Q factor of up to 348, which is comparable to the highest values reported in vdW nanophotonics. We demonstrate room-temperature polaritons in etch-free structures using four representative materials (WS$_2$, MoS$_2$, WSe$_2$, and MoSe$_2$) through self-hybridization of high-Q (quasi-)bound states in the continuum (BIC) modes and excitons, achieving a Rabi-splitting of approximately 80 meV, which significantly surpasses the intrinsic excitonic loss. Furthermore, we showcase optical modulation of indirect bandgap emission in bulk WS$_2$ and direct exciton emission in heterostructures, achieving substantial polarization-dependent enhancement of their emission efficiencies. The proposed etch-free vdW structure provides a versatile platform for high-Q nanophononics while preserving material integrity, advancing applications in photoelectronic and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Embedding Matrices in Programmable Photonic Networks with Flexible Depth and Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that programmable photonic circuit architectures composed of alternating mixing layers and active layers offer a high degree of flexibility. This alternating configuration enables the systematic tailoring of both the network's depth (number of layers) and width (size of each layer) without compromising computational capabilities. From a mathematical perspective, our approach can be viewed as embedding an arbitrary target matrix into a higher-dimensional matrix, which can then be represented with fewer layers and larger active elements. We derive a general relation for the width and depth of a network that guarantees representing all $N \times N$ complex matrix operations. Remarkably, we show that just two such active layers, interleaved with passive mixing layers, are sufficient to universally implement arbitrary matrix transformations. This result promises a more adaptable and scalable route to photonic matrix processors.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Hologram Generation with Automatic Differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We designed an automatic differentiation-based strategy to generate optical trap arrays that change smoothly in time. Instead of repeatedly regenerating the holograms for each time step, we derive the differential form of the phase dynamics that enables the continuous evolution of the trap coordinates. This differential form is derived from the implicit differentiation of the fixed point of the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm, which is computationally efficient. We carried out numerical and laboratory experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the phase continuity and reducing the computational burden compared to the traditional pure interpolation techniques. By combining the method with the spatial light modulator, the method is promising for the dynamic manipulation of particles in real experiments.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen and hydrogen intercalation into crystalline fullerite C$_{60}$ and photoluminescent studies in a wide temperature range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical properties of fullerite C$_{60}$ single crystals saturated with hydrogen and nitrogen molecules were studied in the temperature range from 20 K to 230 K using the spectral-luminescent method. Saturation was carried out under a pressure of 30 atm at various temperatures from 470 K to 720 K. At saturation temperatures above 520 K for hydrogen and 690 K for nitrogen, chemical interaction of impurity molecules and the fullerene matrix occurs, forming new chemical compounds. The results of a study of the photoluminescent properties of a new substances are presented for the first time.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent DFT-based study of bacteriochlorophyll a optical properties within the B800 part of Rhodoblastus acidophilus light-harvesting complex</title>

Abstract: We use time-dependent density functional theory-based approaches, TD-DFT and TD-DFTB, to investigate the optical absorption of B800 part of Rhodoblastus acidophilus light-harvesting complex 2 (LH2). Both methods are shown to give qualitative agreement with experimental spectra for a single BChl a molecule and for the optimized structure of B800 complex containing nine of such molecules. We proved the absence of any sizable effects originating from the interaction between adjacent molecules, thus optical features of B800 LH2 part should not be attributed to the structural organization of pigments. In addition, time-dependent procedure itself was found to be crucial for the correct description of BChl a absorption spectrum.</description>

Abstract: True random numbers are extracted through measurements of vacuum fluctuations in quantum state components. We propose an improved scheme utilizing an optimization-based simulation methodology to enhance the temporal resolution of quantum state detection and processing efficiency of vacuum fluctuation signals in continuous-variable quantum random number generators (CV-QRNGs), while simultaneously maximizing the entropy content of quantum noise sources. This work presents the first application of optimization simulation methodology to balanced homodyne detector (BHD) circuit design, with particular emphasis on improving high-frequency transmission characteristics. The design framework prioritizes system stability and S-parameter sensitivity to optimize both circuit architecture and critical component parameters. The AC amplifier circuit was implemented through ADS high-frequency simulations using two ABA-52563 RF amplifiers in a cascaded configuration, with circuit modeling performed on Rogers 4350 substrate optimized for high-frequency applications. This approach enabled the development of a switched-configuration BHD featuring: 1) 1.9 GHz bandwidth, 2) 41.5 dB signal-to-noise ratio at 1.75 GHz, 3) 30 dB common-mode rejection ratio at 100 MHz, and 4) frequency response flatness within 1.5 dB across 1.3-1.7 GHz. Additionally, the Husimi function is employed for entropy analysis to reconstruct vacuum state phase-space distributions, validating the detector's quantum measurement fidelity. The implemented system demonstrates a collective generation rate of 20.0504 Gbps across four parallel channels, with all output streams successfully passing NIST SP 800-22 statistical testing requirements.</description>

      <title>Efficient detection of entanglement by stimulated disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard detection of entanglement relies on local measurements of the individual particles, evaluating their correlations in post-processing. For time-energy entangled photons, either times $(t_{1},t_{2})$ or energies $(E_{1},E_{2})$ are measured, but not both due to the mutual quantum uncertainty, providing only partial information of the entanglement. In principle, a global detector could recover the complete information of entanglement in a single shot if it could measure the combined correlated variables $(t_{1}-t_{2})$ and $(E_{1}+E_{2})$ without measuring the individual energies or times. Such a global measurement is possible using the reverse disentangling interaction, like sum-frequency generation (SFG), but nonlinear interactions at the single-photon level are ridiculously inefficient. We overcome this barrier by stimulating the nonlinear SFG interaction with a strong pump, thereby measuring both the energy-sum (SFG spectrum) and the time-difference (response to group delay/dispersion) simultaneously and efficiently. We generate bi-photons with extreme time-energy entanglement (octave-spanning spectrum of 113THz) and measure a relative uncertainty between time-difference and energy-sum of $\Delta(t_1-t_2)\Delta(E_1+E_2)\approx\!2\!\cdot\!10^{-13}h$, violating the classical bound by &gt;12 orders of magnitude. The presented coherent SFG dramatically enhances the detection SNR compared to standard methods since it ideally rejects erroneous coincidences in both time and energy, paving the way for sensing applications, such as quantum illumination (radar) and more.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17917v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light-dressed materials hold enormous potential for generating new electronic properties. The band structure resulting from light-dressing can exhibit starkly different quantum and topological phenomena. So far, optical control of charge within a light-dressed band structure has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate optical control of electrons in light-dressed graphene. By focusing circularly polarized femtosecond laser pulses at 1550 nm on monolayer graphene, we generate a Floquet topological insulator (FTI). With a phase-locked second harmonic field, we dynamically control electrons in this FTI state. For the first time, we observe photocurrent circular dichroism, the all-optical anomalous Hall effect, and FTI valley-polarized currents. The photocurrents show strong sub-cycle phase-sensitivity, opening the door to ultrafast control within topologically protected electronics (topotronics), spectroscopy, and attosecond physics in novel quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Time Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study plasmonic time crystals, an extension of dielectric-based photonic time crystals to plasmonic media. Remarkably, we demonstrate that such systems may amplify both longitudinal and transverse modes. In particular, we show that plasmonic time crystals support \emph{collective resonances} of longitudinal modes, which occur independently of the wave vector $k$, even in the presence of significant dissipation. These resonances originate from the coupling between the positive- and negative-frequency branches of the plasmonic dispersion relation of the unmodulated system and from the divergence of the density of states near the plasma ($\varepsilon$-near zero) frequency $\omega_p$. The strongest resonance arises at a modulation frequency $\Omega = 2 \omega_p$, corresponding to a direct interband transition. We demonstrate these resonances for various periodic modulation profiles and provide a generic perturbative formula for resonance widths in the weak modulation limit. Furthermore, we propose transparent conducting oxides as promising platforms for realizing plasmonic time crystals, as they enable significant modulation of the electron effective mass while maintaining moderate dissipation levels. Our findings provide new insights into leveraging time-modulated plasmonic media to enhance optical gain and control wave dynamics at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>New Generalized Expressions for the Electromagnetic Fields of the Hybrid Modes of an Optical Fiber Using Complex and Bi-Complex Mathematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00027v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electromagnetic fields of the hybrid modes of an optical fiber are reformulated using bi-complex mathematics, which leads to simpler expressions relative to those found using the widely used, conventional complex formulation. Generalized expressions for the electromagnetic fields are also found using both formulations for comparative purposes. Furthermore, the feasibility of bi-complex mathematics is investigated for the derivation of the modal powers, orthogonality relations, and the weakly-guided fiber approximation.</description>

      <title>SPRING: an effective and reliable framework for image reconstruction in single-particle Coherent Diffraction Imaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07413v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to gain images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established phase retrieval algorithms. In this work, we present SPRING, an analysis framework tailored to X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) single-shot single-particle diffraction data that implements the Memetic Phase Retrieval method to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional algorithms. We benchmark the approach on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal unprecedented stability and resilience of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in conditions hardly treatable so far with conventional methods. A user-friendly implementation of SPRING is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the coherent diffraction imaging community at XFEL and synchrotron facilities.</description>

      <title>Noise Constraints for Nonlinear Exceptional Point Sensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are singularities in the parameter space of a non-Hermitian system where eigenenergies and eigenstates coincide. They hold promise for enhancing sensing applications, but this is limited by the divergence of shot noise near EPs. According to recent studies, EP sensors operating in the nonlinear regime may avoid these limitations. By analyzing an exemplary nonlinear system, we show that the interplay of noise and nonlinearity introduces previously-unidentified obstacles to enhanced sensing. The noise effectively displaces the EP in parameter space and reduces its order, thereby eliminating the sought-for divergence in the signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the noise near the nonlinear EP experiences a stronger divergence than predicted by standard calculations of the Petermann noise factor, due to the properties of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian governing the fluctuations. Our semi-analytical estimates for the noise level agree quantitatively with the results of stochastic numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manipulating optical vortices at ultrafast spatiotemporal coupled domain is still a great challenge in photonics. Especially, the single- or few-cycle level short pulses carrying stable vortex topological charge, called helical pulses, have never been experimentally realized. Here, we introduce two complementary methods for experimentally generating such space-time nonseparable helical pulses (SNHPs) across optical and microwave spectral regimes. We achieve few-cycle quasi-linearly polarized SNHPs through the polarization decomposition of optical toroidal pulses. We also generated exactly single-cycle nontransverse SNHPs directly from a microwave ultrawideband spiral emitter. These approaches not only enable the experimental realization of SNHPs but also provide a platform for further investigation into their properties and applications, such as nontrivial light-matter interactions and optical communications, marking a significant step forward in the field of structured light.</description>
