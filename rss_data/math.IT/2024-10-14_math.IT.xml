      <title>Riemannian Gradient Descent Method to Joint Blind Super-Resolution and Demixing in ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) has emerged as a promising technology for next-generation wireless networks. In this work, we tackle an ill-posed parameter estimation problem within ISAC, formulating it as a joint blind super-resolution and demixing problem. Leveraging the low-rank structures of the vectorized Hankel matrices associated with the unknown parameters, we propose a Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) method. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed method achieves linear convergence to the target matrices under standard assumptions. Additionally, extensive numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Multiple Polarizations in Extra Large Holographic MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of large multi-antenna configurations operating in high frequency bands has recently challenged the conventional far-field, rich-scattering paradigm of wireless channels. Extra large antenna arrays must usually work in the near field and in the absence of multipath, which are far from traditional assumptions in conventional wireless communication systems. The present study proposes to analyze the spatial multiplexing capabilities of large multi-antenna configurations under line-of-sight, near field conditions by considering the use of multiple orthogonal diversities at both transmitter and receiver. The analysis is carried out using a holographic approximation to the problem, whereby the number of radiating elements is assumed to become large while their separation becomes asymptotically negligible. This emulates the operation of a continuous aperture of infinitesimal radiating elements, also recently known as holographic surfaces. The present study characterizes the asymptotic MIMO channel as seen by extra large uniform linear and planar arrays, as well as their associated achievable rates assuming access to perfect channel state information (CSI). It is shown, in particular, that for a given distance between the receiver and the center of the array and a given signal quality, there exists an optimum dimension of the multi-antenna surface that maximizes the spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Neural Estimation of Indirect Rate-Distortion Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rate-distortion function (RDF) has long been an information-theoretic benchmark for data compression. As its natural extension, the indirect rate-distortion function (iRDF) corresponds to the scenario where the encoder can only access an observation correlated with the source, rather than the source itself. Such scenario is also relevant for modern applications like remote sensing and goal-oriented communication. The iRDF can be reduced into a standard RDF with the distortion measure replaced by its conditional expectation conditioned upon the observation. This reduction, however, leads to a non-trivial challenge when one needs to estimate the iRDF given datasets only, because without statistical knowledge of the joint probability distribution between the source and its observation, the conditional expectation cannot be evaluated. To tackle this challenge, starting from the well known fact that conditional expectation is the minimum mean-squared error estimator and exploiting a Markovian relationship, we identify a functional equivalence between the reduced distortion measure in the iRDF and the solution of a quadratic loss minimization problem, which can be efficiently approximated by neural network approach. We proceed to reformulate the iRDF as a variational problem corresponding to the Lagrangian representation of the iRDF curve, and propose a neural network based approximate solution, integrating the aforementioned distortion measure estimator. Asymptotic analysis guarantees consistency of the solution, and numerical experimental results demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>Improved List Size for Folded Reed-Solomon Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Folded Reed-Solomon (FRS) codes are variants of Reed-Solomon codes, known for their optimal list decoding radius. We show explicit FRS codes with rate $R$ that can be list decoded up to radius $1-R-\epsilon$ with lists of size $\mathcal{O}(1/ \epsilon^2)$. This improves the best known list size among explicit list decoding capacity achieving codes.
  We also show a more general result that for any $k\geq 1$, there are explicit FRS codes with rate $R$ and distance $1-R$ that can be list decoded arbitrarily close to radius $\frac{k}{k+1}(1-R)$ with lists of size $(k-1)^2+1$.
  Our results are based on a new and simple combinatorial viewpoint of the intersections between Hamming balls and affine subspaces that recovers previously known parameters. We then use folded Wronskian determinants to carry out an inductive proof that yields sharper bounds.</description>

      <title>Variational Source-Channel Coding for Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication technology emerges as a pivotal bridge connecting AI with classical communication. The current semantic communication systems are generally modeled as an Auto-Encoder (AE). AE lacks a deep integration of AI principles with communication strategies due to its inability to effectively capture channel dynamics. This gap makes it difficult to justify the need for joint source-channel coding (JSCC) and to explain why performance improves. This paper begins by exploring lossless and lossy communication, highlighting that the inclusion of data distortion distinguishes semantic communication from classical communication. It breaks the conditions for the separation theorem to hold and explains why the amount of data transferred by semantic communication is less. Therefore, employing JSCC becomes imperative for achieving optimal semantic communication. Moreover, a Variational Source-Channel Coding (VSCC) method is proposed for constructing semantic communication systems based on data distortion theory, integrating variational inference and channel characteristics. Using a deep learning network, we develop a semantic communication system employing the VSCC method and demonstrate its capability for semantic transmission. We also establish semantic communication systems of equivalent complexity employing the AE method and the VAE method. Experimental results reveal that the VSCC model offers superior interpretability compared to AE model, as it clearly captures the semantic features of the transmitted data, represented as the variance of latent variables in our experiments. In addition, VSCC model exhibits superior semantic transmission capabilities compared to VAE model. At the same level of data distortion evaluated by PSNR, VSCC model exhibits stronger human interpretability, which can be partially assessed by SSIM.</description>

      <title>Minimax Hypothesis Testing for the Bradley-Terry-Luce Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model is one of the most widely used models for ranking a collection of items or agents based on pairwise comparisons among them. Given $n$ agents, the BTL model endows each agent $i$ with a latent skill score $\alpha_i &gt; 0$ and posits that the probability that agent $i$ is preferred over agent $j$ is $\alpha_i/(\alpha_i + \alpha_j)$. In this work, our objective is to formulate a hypothesis test that determines whether a given pairwise comparison dataset, with $k$ comparisons per pair of agents, originates from an underlying BTL model. We formalize this testing problem in the minimax sense and define the critical threshold of the problem. We then establish upper bounds on the critical threshold for general induced observation graphs (satisfying mild assumptions) and develop lower bounds for complete induced graphs. Our bounds demonstrate that for complete induced graphs, the critical threshold scales as $\Theta((nk)^{-1/2})$ in a minimax sense. In particular, our test statistic for the upper bounds is based on a new approximation we derive for the separation distance between general pairwise comparison models and the class of BTL models. To further assess the performance of our statistical test, we prove upper bounds on the type I and type II probabilities of error. Much of our analysis is conducted within the context of a fixed observation graph structure, where the graph possesses certain ``nice'' properties, such as expansion and bounded principal ratio. Additionally, we derive several auxiliary results, such as bounds on principal ratios of graphs, $\ell^2$-bounds on BTL parameter estimation under model mismatch, stability of rankings under the BTL model, etc. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets and propose a data-driven permutation testing approach to determine test thresholds.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Intelligent Reffecting Surface Aided Near-Field THz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) operating in the terahertz (THz) band has recently gained considerable interest due to its high spectrum bandwidth. Due to the exploitation of large scale of IRS, there is a high probability that the transceivers will be situated within the near-field region of the IRS. Thus, the near-field beam split effect poses a major challenge for the design of wideband IRS beamforming, which causes the radiation beam to deviate from its intended location, leading to significant gain losses and limiting the efficient use of available bandwidths. While delay-based IRS has emerged as a potential solution, current beamforming schemes generally assume unbounded range time delays (TDs). In this letter, we first investigate the near-field beam split issue at the IRS. Then, we extend the piece-wise far-field model to the IRS, based on which, a double-layer delta-delay (DLDD) IRS beamforming scheme is proposed. Specifically, we employ an element-grouping strategy and the TD imposed on each sub-surface of IRS is achieved by a series of TD modules. This method significantly reduces the required range of TDs. Numerical results show that the proposed DLDD IRS beamforming scheme can effectively mitigate the near-field beam split and achieve near-optimal performance.</description>

      <title>GAI-Enabled Explainable Personalized Federated Semi-Supervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a commonly distributed algorithm for mobile users (MUs) training artificial intelligence (AI) models, however, several challenges arise when applying FL to real-world scenarios, such as label scarcity, non-IID data, and unexplainability. As a result, we propose an explainable personalized FL framework, called XPFL. First, we introduce a generative AI (GAI) assisted personalized federated semi-supervised learning, called GFed. Particularly, in local training, we utilize a GAI model to learn from large unlabeled data and apply knowledge distillation-based semi-supervised learning to train the local FL model using the knowledge acquired from the GAI model. In global aggregation, we obtain the new local FL model by fusing the local and global FL models in specific proportions, allowing each local model to incorporate knowledge from others while preserving its personalized characteristics. Second, we propose an explainable AI mechanism for FL, named XFed. Specifically, in local training, we apply a decision tree to match the input and output of the local FL model. In global aggregation, we utilize t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) to visualize the local models before and after aggregation. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed XPFL framework.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Hypothesis Testing under Zero-rate Communication Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trade-offs between error probabilities in quantum hypothesis testing are by now well-understood in the centralized setting, but much less is known for distributed settings. Here, we study a distributed binary hypothesis testing problem to infer a bipartite quantum state shared between two remote parties, where one of these parties communicates classical information to the tester at zero-rate (while the other party communicates classical or quantum information to the tester at zero-rate or higher). As our main contribution, we derive an efficiently computable single-letter formula for the Stein's exponent of this problem, when the state under the alternative is product. For the general case, we show that the Stein's exponent is given by a multi-letter expression involving max-min optimization of regularized measured relative entropy. While this becomes single-letter for the fully classical case, we further prove that this already does not happen in the same way for classical-quantum states in general. As a key tool for proving the converse direction of our results, we develop a quantum version of the blowing-up lemma which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2108.13488v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the indirect source coding problem with side information at both the encoder and decoder, as well as only at the decoder. We first derive structural properties of the two rate distortion functions (RDFs) for general abstract spaces and identify conditions under which the RDFs coincide. For multivariate jointly Gaussian random variables with square-error fidelity, we establish structural properties of the optimal test channels, show that side information at both the encoder and decoder does not reduce compression, and provide water-filling solutions using parallel Gaussian channel realizations. This paper uses a novel realization theory approach to establish achievability of the converse coding theorem lower bounds of the two RDFs.</description>

      <title>Optimization of the Downlink Spectral- and Energy-Efficiency of RIS-aided Multi-user URLLC MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16434v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern wireless communication systems are expected to provide improved latency and reliability. To meet these expectations, a short packet length is needed, which makes the first-order Shannon rate an inaccurate performance metric for such communication systems. A more accurate approximation of the achievable rates of finite-block-length (FBL) coding regimes is known as the normal approximation (NA). It is therefore of substantial interest to study the optimization of the FBL rate in multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, in which each user may transmit and/or receive multiple data streams. Hence, we formulate a general optimization problem for improving the spectral and energy efficiency of multi-user MIMO-aided ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC) systems, which are assisted by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). We show that an RIS is capable of substantially improving the performance of multi-user MIMO-aided URLLC systems. Moreover, the benefits of RIS increase as the packet length and/or the tolerable bit error rate are reduced. This reveals that RISs can be even more beneficial in URLLC systems for improving the FBL rates than in conventional systems approaching Shannon rates.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Measures on Lattices for High-Order Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional models based solely on pairwise associations often fail to capture the complex statistical structure of multivariate data. Existing approaches for identifying information shared among groups of $d&gt;3$ variables are frequently computationally intractable, asymmetric with respect to a target variable, or unable to account for all factorisations of the joint probability distribution. We present a systematic framework that derives higher-order information-theoretic measures using lattice and operator function pairs, whereby the lattice representing the algebraic relationships among variables, with operator functions that compute the measures over the lattice. We show that many commonly used measures can be derived within this framework, however they are often restricted to sublattices of the partition lattice, which prevents them from capturing all interactions when $d&gt;3$. We also demonstrate that KL divergence, when used as an operator function, leads to unwanted cancellation of interactions for $d&gt;3$. To fully characterise all interactions among $d$ variables, we introduce the Streitberg Information, using generalisations of KL divergence as an operator function, and defined over the full partition lattice. We validate Streitberg Information numerically on synthetic data, and illustrate its application in analysing complex interactions among stocks, decoding neural signals, and performing feature selection in machine learning.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the conjecture posed by Keller and Rosemarin at Eurocrypt 2021 on the nullity of a matrix polynomial of a block matrix with Hadamard type blocks over commutative rings of characteristic 2. Therefore, it confirms the conjectural optimal bound on the dimension of invariant subspace of the Starkad cipher using the HADES design strategy. Moreover, we reveal the algebraic structure formed by Hadamard matrices over commutative rings from the perspectives of group algebra and polynomial algebra. An interesting relation between block-Hadamard matrices and Hadamard-block matrices is obtained as well.</description>

Abstract: Error correcting codes (ECCs) are indispensable for reliable transmission in communication systems. The recent advancements in deep learning have catalyzed the exploration of ECC decoders based on neural networks. Among these, transformer-based neural decoders have achieved state-of-the-art decoding performance. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-attention Message-Passing Transformer (CrossMPT), which shares key operational principles with conventional message-passing decoders. While conventional transformer-based decoders employ self-attention mechanism without distinguishing between the types of input vectors (i.e., magnitude and syndrome vectors), CrossMPT updates the two types of input vectors separately and iteratively using two masked cross-attention blocks. The mask matrices are determined by the code's parity-check matrix, which explicitly captures the irrelevant relationship between two input vectors. Our experimental results show that CrossMPT significantly outperforms existing neural network-based decoders for various code classes. Notably, CrossMPT achieves this decoding performance improvement, while significantly reducing the memory usage, complexity, inference time, and training time.</description>
