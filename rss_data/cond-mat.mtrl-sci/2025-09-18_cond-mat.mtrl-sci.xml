      <title>Proximity Ferroelectricity in Compositionally Graded Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximity ferroelectricity is a novel paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity in a non-ferroelectric polar material such as AlN or ZnO that are typically unswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown field. When placed in direct contact with a thin switchable ferroelectric layer (such as Al1-xScxN or Zn1-xMgxO), they become a practically switchable ferroelectric. Using the thermodynamic Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire theory, in this work we performed the finite element modeling of the polarization switching in the compositionally graded AlN-Al1-xScxN, ZnO-Zn1-xMgxO and MgO-Zn1-xMgxO structures sandwiched in both a parallel-plate capacitor geometry as well as in a sharp probe-planar electrode geometry. We reveal that the compositionally graded structure allows the simultaneous switching of spontaneous polarization in the whole system by a coercive field significantly lower than the electric breakdown field of unswitchable polar materials. The physical mechanism is the depolarization electric field determined by the gradient of chemical composition "x". The field lowers the steepness of the switching barrier in the otherwise unswitchable parts of the compositionally graded AlN-Al1-xScxN and ZnO-Zn1-xMgxO structures, while it induces a shallow double-well free energy potential in the MgO-like regions of compositionally graded MgO-Zn1-xMgxO structure. Proximity ferroelectric switching of the compositionally graded structures placed in the probe-electrode geometry occurs due to nanodomain formation under the tip. We predict that a gradient of chemical composition "x" significantly lowers effective coercive fields of the compositionally graded AlN-Al1-xScxN and ZnO-Zn1-xMgxO structures compared to the coercive fields of the corresponding multilayers with a uniform chemical composition in each layer.</description>

      <title>Persistent Interfacial Topological Hall Effect Demonstrating Electrical Readout of Topological Spin Structures in Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional topological Hall effects (THE) require conducting magnets, leaving insulating systems largely inaccessible. Here we introduce the interfacial topological Hall effect (ITHE), where the noncoplanar spin textures of insulating magnets are imprinted onto an adjacent heavy metal via the magnetic proximity effect (MPE) and detected electrically. In Pt/h-LuFeO3 bilayers, h-LuFeO3 hosts a topological spin structure robust against high magnetic fields, arising from a 120{\deg} triangular spin lattice with small spin canting that yields nontrivial topology but minimal magnetization. This generates a giant Hall response in Pt up to 0.5% of the longitudinal resistivity and a Hall-conductivity/magnetization ratio above 2 V^{-1}, clearly distinguishable from the spin Hall Hanle effect background. Field- and temperature-dependent analysis further reveals that Pt nanoclusters inherit topological textures from h-LuFeO3 via MPE. Unlike the conventional THE narrow peak-and-dip features, ITHE in Pt/h-LuFeO3 persists across a broad magnetic field range up to 14 T, demonstrating the exceptional stability of the underlying topological spin structure. This establishes ITHE as a powerful and sensitive probe for topological magnetism in ultrathin insulating films and paves the way for new spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Field-Angle Dependence of Phonon Thermal Hall Effect in Na2X2TeO6 (X = Co, Zn)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanism behind thermal Hall effects by phonons, which are observed in various materials, is not clarified despite the dominant contribution as heat carriers. Theoretically, mechanisms based on the intrinsic Berry phase and those on extrinsic impurity-induced scatterings have been proposed, which can be distinguished by comparing the field-angle dependence of the thermal Hall effect and that of the magnetic anisotropy. Here, we investigate the field-angle dependence of the thermal Hall effects in the antiferromagnet Na2Co2TeO6 and its non-magnetic isostructural analogue Na2Zn2TeO6 in the ac plane. We find that the field-angle dependence of the thermal Hall conductivity in both materials well follows that of the out-of-plane magnetization, showing a common mechanism by extrinsic impurity-induced scatterings in both the phonon thermal Hall effect and that enhanced by a coupling with the magnetism.</description>

      <title>Li+/H+ exchange in solid-state oxide Li-ion conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the moisture stability of oxide Li-ion conductors is important for their practical applications in solid-state batteries. Unlike sulfide or halide conductors, oxide conductors generally better resist degradation when in contact with water, but can still undergo topotactic ion exchange between Li ions within the structure and protons in the environment. In this work, we combine density functional theory (DFT) calculations with a machine-learning interatomic potential model to investigate the thermodynamic driving force of the Li+/H+ exchange reaction for two representative oxide Li-ion conductor families: garnets and NASICONs. Our results indicate that the high Li chemical potential in Li-stuffed garnets is responsible for the stronger driving force for exchanging Li with protons as compared to the Li-unstuffed structures. In contrast, NASICONs demonstrate a higher resistance against proton exchange, which is attributed to the lower Li chemical potential and the lower O-H bond covalency for polyanion-bonded oxygens. Our findings highlight the trade-off when using Li stuffing as a mechanism to enhance Li-ion conductivity, as it also promotes degradation by moisture. This study underscores the importance of designing Li-ion conductors that not only possess high conductivity, but also exhibit high stability in practical environments.</description>

      <title>From Data to Alloys Predicting and Screening High Entropy Alloys for High Hardness Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing need for structural materials with strength, mechanical stability, and durability in extreme environments is driving the development of high entropy alloys. These are materials with near equiatomic mixing of five or more principal elements, and such compositional complexity often leads to improvements in mechanical properties and high thermal stability, etc. Thus, high-entropy alloys have found their applications in domains like aerospace, biomedical, energy storage, catalysis, electronics, etc. However, the vast compositional design and experimental exploration of high-entropy alloys are both time consuming and expensive and require a large number of resources. Machine learning techniques have thus become essential for accelerating high entropy alloys discovery using data driven predictions of promising alloy combinations and their properties. Hence, this work employs a machine learning framework that predicts high entropy alloy hardness from elemental descriptors such as atomic radius, valence electron count, bond strength, etc. Machine learning regression models, like LightGBM, Gradient Boosting Regressor, and Transformer encoder, were trained on experimental data. Additionally, a language model was also fine tuned to predict hardness from elemental descriptor strings. The results indicate that LightGBM has better accuracy in predicting the hardness of high entropy alloys compared to other models used in this study. Further, a combinatorial technique was used to generate over 9 million virtual high entropy alloy candidates, and the trained machine learning models were used to predict their hardness. This study shows how machine learning-driven high throughput screening and language modelling approaches can accelerate the development of next generation high entropy alloys.</description>

      <title>Tuning Coupled Toroidic and Polar Orders in a Bilayer Antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic toroidal order features a loop-like arrangement of magnetic dipole moments, thus breaking both spatial inversion (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetries while preserving their combined PT sym-metry. This PT symmetry enables a linear magnetoelectric effect, allowing the coupling between magnetic toroidicity and electric polarity. However, the detection and control of two-dimensional (2D) magnetic toroidal order and the investigation of its linear magnetoelectric response remain largely unexplored. Here, using bilayer CrSBr as a platform, which hosts an in-plane layer-antiferromagnetic (AFM) order and simultaneously exhibits a magnetic toroidal order, we show compelling evidence for tuning this 2D magnetic toroidicity and its induced electric polarity through magnetic-field-depend-ent second harmonic generation (SHG). Under an out-of-plane magnetic field, we decompose the SHG signal into a time-reversal-odd component that scales with the magnetic toroidal moment and a time-reversal-even component that is proportional to the electric polarization. When sweeping the magnetic field from positive to negative values, we observe that the magnetic toroidicity retains its sign but diminishes in magnitude at higher fields while the electric polarity flips its sign and increases in strength at increasing fields below a critical threshold. When applying an in-plane electric field along the N\'eel vector direction, together with an out-of-plane field, we find that the magnetic toroidal and electric polar domains are moved in a locked fashion. These findings underscore the promise of 2D magnetic toroidal order in realizing giant linear magnetoelectric effects, opening exciting possi-bilities for next-generation electronic, magnetic, optical, and photonic devices enabled by 2D mag-netoelectrics.</description>

      <title>Valley-Selective Linear Dichroism and Excitonic Effects in Lieb-Lattice Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets have recently been recognized as a distinct class of magnetic materials characterized by alternative spin-split electronic structures without net magnetization. Despite intensive studies on their single-particle spintronic and valleytronic properties, many-electron interactions and optical responses of altermagnets remain less explored. In this work, we employ many-body perturbation theory to investigate excited states and their strain tunability. Using monolayer Mn2WS4 as a representative candidate, we uncover a novel spin valley-dependent excitonic selection rule in two-dimensional altermagnetic Lieb lattices. In addition to strongly bound excitons, we find that linearly polarized light selectively excites valley spin-polarized excitons. Moreover, due to the interplay between altermagnetic spin symmetry and electronic orbital character, we predict that applying uniaxial strain can lift valley degeneracy and enable the selective excitation of spin-polarized excitons, an effect not achievable in previously studied transition-metal dichalcogenides. These spin-valley-locked excitonic states and their strain tunability offer a robust mechanism for four-fold symmetric altermagnets to encode, store, and read valley/spin information.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field Control of Terahertz Response via Spin-Corner-Layer Coupling in Altermagnetic Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric field control of electron charge and spin degrees of freedom is fundamental to modern semiconductor and spintronic devices. Yet controlling electromagnetic waves with an electric field, particularly in the terahertz (THz) band, remains a challenge. Here, we propose a spin-corner-layer coupling (SCLC) mechanism in second-order topological altermagnetic bilayers. By using an electric field to influence electrons between different layers, the SCLC mechanism enables simultaneous control over corner and spin degrees of freedom, thereby allowing electric-field tuning of the absorption, emission intensity, and even polarization of THz waves. Taking bilayer NiZrI$_6$ nanodisks as a prototype, we demonstrate that an ultralow electrostatic field can switch both the spin and the layer polarizations of corner states. This dual switching modulates transition dipole moments and oscillator strengths between different corner states, thereby enabling the manipulation of THz waves. This study establishes a mechanism for the electric-field control of spin and THz waves through SCLC, yielding important implications for the advancement of THz spintronics.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of Ultra-thin Potassium Tungsten Bronze Single Crystals with Optically Contrasting Domains and Resistive Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potassium tungsten bronzes (K$_x$WO$_3$) are nonstoichiometric oxides in which alkali ions, i.e., K+, occupy one-dimensional tunnels of the hexagonal WO6 framework, enabling coupled ionic-lectronic transport. While their bulk and nanostructured forms have been studied extensively, controlled synthesis of single-crystalline mesoscale samples suitable for device fabrication has remained limited. Here, we report a solid-liquid-solid (SLS) growth strategy that yields high-quality K$_x$WO$_3$ nanobelts with thicknesses down to ~36 nm and lateral sizes exceeding 100 um. The crystals display sharp optical domains arising from local variations in potassium occupancy, as confirmed by spatially resolved Raman spectroscopy and electron diffraction. Under applied bias, these domains vanish irreversibly, consistent with lateral redistribution of K+ ions along the tunnels. Two-terminal devices fabricated from individual nanobelts exhibit reproducible bipolar switching with resistance ratios of 10-30, characteristic short-term and long-term plasticity under pulsed excitation, and switching energies of ~25 nJ. These results establish K$_x$WO$_3$ as a model tunnel-structured oxide for studying electric-field-driven alkali-ion migration, while also highlighting its potential for stable, analog resistive switching and iontronic memory applications.</description>

      <title>Thermal Degradation Mechanisms and Stability Enhancement Strategies in Perovskite Solar Cells: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs) have garnered global research interest owing to their superior photovoltaic (PV) performance. The future of photovoltaic technology lies in PSCs since they can produce power with performance on par with the best silicon solar cells while being less expensive. PSCs have enormous potential; in just ten years, their efficiency increased from 3.8% to 25.2%, and research into new developments is still ongoing. Thermal instability is PSCs' main disadvantage, despite their high efficiency, flexibility, and lightweight nature. This paper looks at how temperature affects the ways that hole transport layers (HTLs) like spiro-OMeTAD and perovskite layers, especially MAPbI3, degrade. Elevated temperatures cause MAPbI3 to degrade into PbI2, CH3I, and NH3, with decomposition rates affected by moisture, oxygen, and environmental factors. Mixed cation compositions, such as Cs-MA-FA, have higher thermal stability, whereas MA+ cations break-down faster under heat stress. HTLs deteriorate due to morphological changes and the hydrophilicity of dopant additions like Li-TFSI and t-BP. Alternative dopant-free HTMs, such as P3HT and inorganic materials including CuSCN, NiOx, and Cu2O, have shown improved thermal stability and efficiency. Hybrid HTLs, dopant-free designs, and interface tweaks are all viable solutions for increasing the stability of PSC. Addressing thermal stability issues remains crucial for the development of more reliable and efficient PSC technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structural properties and phase stability of the K$_{x}$Ca$_{1-x}$N alloy using the regular-solution model based on the total energy of the mixing. The pseudopotential approach was used along with PBE functional of Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE). We investigated the bond-lengths distribution as a function of composition $x$. We also predicted the phase separation of the two partially miscible components and calculated the enthalpy $\Delta H$ using the interaction parameter $\Omega$. We observe an asymmetry about $x=0.46$ in the phase diagram due to the $x$-dependant interaction parameter $\Omega=12.69-1.32x$ kcal/mole. The equilibrium solubility limit, known as the miscibility gap is found to be around 3033 K.</description>

      <title>Stochastic ion emission perturbation mechanisms in atom probe tomography: Linking simulations to experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Field evaporation in atom probe tomography (APT) includes known processes related to surface migration of atoms, such as the so-called roll-up mechanism. They lead to trajectory aberrations and artefacts on the detector. These processes are usually neglected in simulations. The inclusion of such processes is crucial for providing reliable models for the development and verification of APT reconstruction algorithms, a key part of the whole methodology. Here we include stochastic lateral velocity perturbations and a roll-up mechanism to simulations performed using the Robin--Rolland model. By comparing with experimental data from Al and Ni systems, we find the stochastic perturbation energy distributions that allow us to very accurately reproduce the detector patterns seen experimentally and thus greatly improve the accuracy of the simulations. We also explore the possible causes of remaining discrepancies between the experimental and simulated detector patterns.</description>

      <title>Thermal Conductivity Limits of MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$: Revisiting High-Order Anharmonic Lattice Dynamics with Machine Learning Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group-VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$, have emerged as prototypical low-dimensional systems with distinctive phononic and electronic properties, making them attractive for applications in nanoelectronics, optoelectronics, and thermoelectrics. Yet, their reported lattice thermal conductivities ($\kappa$) remain highly inconsistent, with experimental values and theoretical predictions differing by more than an order of magnitude. These discrepancies stem from uncertainties in measurement techniques, variations in computational protocols, and ambiguities in the treatment of higher-order anharmonic processes. In this study, we critically review these inconsistencies, first by mapping the spread of experimental and modeling results, and then by identifying the methodological origins of divergence. To this end, we bridge first-principles calculations, molecular dynamics simulations, and state-of-the-art machine learning force fields (MLFFs) including recently developed foundation models. %MACE-OMAT-0, UMA, and NEP89. We train and benchmark GAP, MACE, NEP, and \textsc{HIPHIVE} against density functional theory (DFT) and rigorously evaluate the impact of third- and fourth-order phonon scattering processes on $\kappa$. The computational efficiency of MLFFs enables us to extend convergence tests beyond conventional limits and to validate predictions through homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics as well. Our analysis demonstrates that, contrary to some recent claims, fully converged four-phonon processes contribute negligibly to the intrinsic thermal conductivity of both MoS$_2$ and MoSe$_2$. These findings not only refine the intrinsic transport limits of 2D TMDs but also establish MLFF-based approaches as a robust and scalable framework for predictive modeling of phonon-mediated thermal transport in low-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Contrasting magnetic anisotropy in CrCl3 and CrBr3: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first-principles study of the contrasting easy magnetization axes(EMAs) in the layered chromium trihalides CrCl3 and CrBr3, which exhibit in-plane and out-of-plane EMAs, respectively. Using density-functional theory calculations, we show that the EMA is determined by the interplay between spin-orbit coupling-induced magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (SOC-MAE) and shape magnetic anisotropy energy(shape-MAE) arising from dipole-dipole interactions. While the Cr d orbitals contribute similarly to the SOC-MAE in both compounds, the key difference stems from the halogen p orbitals. In CrCl3, the localized Cl 3p orbitals favor spin-flip SOC interactions, particularly between the (px, py) and (py, pz) channels. These channels contribute with opposite signs-negative and positive, respectively-leading to partial cancellation and a small net SOC-MAE. As a result, the shape-MAE exceeds the SOC-MAE in magnitude, favoring an in-plane EMA. In contrast, CrBr3 features more delocalized Br 4p orbitals, enhanced p-d hybridization, and stronger SOC. This leads to stronger spin-conserving SOC interactions, with dominant contributions from both the (px, py) and (py, pz) channels. In this case, the positive contribution from the (px, py) channel outweighs the smaller negative contribution from the (py, pz) channel, resulting in a sizable net SOC-MAE. The SOC-MAE thus surpasses the shape-MAE and stabilizes an out-of-plane EMA. These findings demonstrate that the contrasting magnetic anisotropies in CrCl3 and CrBr3 originate from differences in the spatial distribution, SOC strength, and hybridization of the halogen p orbitals, highlighting the critical role of orbital anisotropy and spin selection rules in governing magnetic behavior in layered semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Quantum Simulations of Battery Electrolytes with VQE-qEOM and SQD: Active-Space Design, Dissociation, and Excited States of LiPF$_6$, NaPF$_6$, and FSI Salts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of excited states in battery electrolytes is central to understanding photostability, oxidative stability, and degradation. We employ hybrid quantum-classical algorithms -- the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) for ground states combined with the quantum equation of motion (qEOM) for vertical singlet excitations -- to study LiPF$_6$, NaPF$_6$, LiFSI, and NaFSI. Compact active spaces were constructed from frontier orbitals, mapped to qubits, and reduced via symmetry tapering and commuting-group measurements to lower sampling cost. Within $\sim$10-qubit models, VQE-qEOM agrees closely with exact diagonalization of the same Hamiltonians, while sample-based quantum diagonalization (SQD) in larger active spaces recovers near-exact (subspace-FCI) energies. The spectra display clear anion and cation trends: PF$_6$ salts exhibit higher first-excitation energies (e.g., LiPF$_6$ $\approx$13.2 eV) and a compact three-state cluster at 12-13 eV, whereas FSI salts show substantially lower onsets ($\approx$8-9 eV) with a near-degenerate (S$_1$,S$_2$) followed by S$_3$ $\sim$1.3 eV higher. Substituting Li$^+$ with Na$^+$ narrows the gap by $\sim$0.4-0.8 eV within each anion family. Converting S$_1$ to wavelengths places the onsets in the deep-UV (LiPF$_6$ $\sim$94 nm; NaPF$_6$ $\sim$100 nm; LiFSI $\sim$141 nm; NaFSI $\sim$148 nm). All results pertain to isolated species or embedded clusters appropriate to the NISQ regime; solvent shifts can be incorporated a posteriori via classical $\Delta$-solvation or static embedding. These results demonstrate that current quantum algorithms can deliver chemically meaningful excitation and binding trends for realistic electrolyte motifs and provide quantitative baselines to guide electrolyte screening and design.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of nanoscale pinning centers in Ce(Co0.8Cu0.2)5.4 permanent magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permanent magnets containing rare earth elements are essential components for the electrification of society. Ce(Co1-xCux)5 permanent magnets are a model system known for their substantial coercivity, yet the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Here, we investigate Ce(Co0.8Cu0.2)5.4 magnets with a coercivity of ~1 T. Using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT), we identify a nanoscale cellular structure formed by spinodal decomposition. Cu-poor cylindrical cells (~5-10 nm in diameter, ~20 nm long) have a disordered CeCo5-type structure and a composition Ce(Co0.9Cu0.1)5.3. Cu-rich cell boundaries are ~ 5 nm thick and exhibit a modified CeCo5 structure, with Cu ordered on the Co sites and a composition Ce(Co0.7Cu0.3)5.0. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the intrinsic Cu concentration gradients up to 12 at.% Cu/nm lead to a spatial variation in magnetocrystalline anisotropy and domain wall energy, resulting in effective pinning and high coercivity. Compared to Sm2Co17-type magnets, Ce(Co0.8Cu0.2)5.4 displays a finer-scale variation of conventional pinning with lower structural and chemical contrast in its underlying nanostructure. The identification of nanoscale chemical segregation in nearly single-phase Ce(Co0.8Cu0.2)5.4 magnets provides a microstructural basis for the long-standing phenomenon of "giant intrinsic magnetic hardness" in systems such as SmCo5-xMx, highlighting avenues for designing rare-earth-lean permanent magnets via controlled nanoscale segregation.</description>

      <title>Tuning and Suppression of YIG Magnetisation Dynamics via Antiferromagnetic Interface Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetisation dynamics of yttrium iron garnet (Y3Fe5O12, YIG) are key to the operation of spintronic and microwave devices. Here, we report a pathway to manipulate the frequency, damping and absorption of YIG thin films via interface coupling. The growth on YIG of PtMn, a metallic antiferromagnet, leads to a power dependence of the oscillation frequency and an increased linewidth at low fields. In gadolinium iron garnet/YIG film bilayers, the two films couple antiferromagnetically at low temperatures and there is a strong damping of the magnetisation dynamics that is further enhanced at the spin-flop field, suppressing the FMR signal. When combining both GdIG and PtMn interfaces, we can tune the exponent of the power dependence of frequency with field and achieve an almost complete quenching of the magnetisation dynamics over a range of fields/frequencies due to non-collinear magnetic order. These effects offer a means to tune and suppress magnetisation dynamics for frequency filters, magnonics, spin pumping and other applications.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design of Amorphous Materials with Targeted Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered (amorphous) materials, such as glasses, are emerging as promising candidates for applications within energy storage, nonlinear optics, and catalysis. Their lack of long-range order and complex short- and medium-range orderings, which depend on composition as well as thermal and pressure history, offer a vast materials design space. To this end, relying on machine learning methods instead of trial and error is promising, and among these, inverse design has emerged as a tool for discovering novel materials with desired properties. Although inverse design methods based on diffusion models have shown success for crystalline materials and molecules, similar methods targeting amorphous materials remain less developed, mainly because of the limited availability of large-scale datasets and the requirement for larger simulation cells. In this work, we propose and validate an inverse design method for amorphous materials, introducing AMDEN (Amorphous Material DEnoising Network), a diffusion model-based framework that generates structures of amorphous materials. These low-energy configurations are typically obtained through a thermal motion-driven random search-like process that cannot be replicated by standard denoising procedures. We therefore introduce an energy-based AMDEN variant that implements Hamiltonian Monte Carlo refinement for generating these relaxed structures. We further introduce several amorphous material datasets with diverse properties and compositions to evaluate our framework and support future development.</description>

      <title>Comment on `High-resolution Measurements of Thermal Conductivity Matrix and Search for Thermal Hall Effect in La$_2$CuO$_4$'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Jiayi Hu and co-workers reported that they did not resolve any thermal Hall signal in La$_2$CuO$_4$ by `high resolution' measurements, setting an upper bound of $|\kappa_{xy}| &lt;2\times 10^{-3}~$Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at 20 K. Two points have apparently escaped their attention. First, thermal Hall signals with an amplitude well below this resolution bound have been detected in disordered perovskites. Second, the longitudinal thermal conductivity of their sample is significantly lower than the La$_2$CuO$_4$ sample displaying a thermal Hall signal. We find that a moderate reduction of $\kappa_{xx}$ in SrTiO$_3$ is concomitant with a drastic attenuation of $\kappa_{xy}$. A trend emerges across several families of insulators: the amplitude of $\kappa_{xy}$ anti-correlates with disorder.</description>

      <title>From Glaphene to Glaphynes: A Hybridization of 2D Silica Glass and Graphynes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted increasing interest as platforms for tailoring electronic properties through interfacial design. Very recently, a novel hybrid 2D material termed glaphene, which combines monolayers of 2D silica glass and graphene, was experimentally realized. Inspired by glaphenes, we proposed a new class of similar structures named glaphynes, which are formed by stacking SiO$_2$ monolayers onto $\alpha$-, $\beta$-, and $\gamma$-graphynes. Graphynes are 2D carbon allotropes with the presence of acetylenic groups (triple bonds). The glaphynes' structural and electronic properties were investigated using the density functional tight-binding (DFTB) method, as implemented in the DFTB+ package. Our analysis confirms their energetic and structural stability. We have observed that in the case of glaphynes, the electronic proximity effect can indeed open the electronic band gap, but not for all cases, even with the formation of Si-O-C bonds between silica and graphynes.</description>

      <title>Phonon-assisted photoluminescence of bilayer MoS$_2$ from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In indirect band gap materials, phonon-assisted processes are key mechanisms for photoluminescence (PL). Using a first-principles many-body approach, we systematically investigate the phonon-assisted PL in bilayer MoS$_2$ and its dependence on temperature and external tensile strain. The effects of phonons are accounted for using a supercell approach: we identify the phonon momenta that are important to PL, construct supercells that are commensurate with these phonons, and examine the changes in the optical absorption after explicit displacements of atoms along each phonon mode. The PL intensity is then obtained via the van Roosbroeck-Shockley relationship from the optical absorption spectra. This approach enables us to investigate phonon-absorption and phonon-emission processes separately and how each process depends on temperature. Our results reveal that optical phonons associated with out-of-plane vibrations of S atoms and in-plane vibrations of Mo atoms contribute most to the indirect PL for unstrained bilayer MoS$_2$. Additionally, we also discuss how the PL spectra and the phonon contributions evolve with strain. In particular, we show that at high strain, additional phonon channels become available due to the modulation of the electronic band structure.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion-Antiskyrmion Lattice: A Net-Zero Topological Phase in Low-Symmetry Frustrated Chiral Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a thermodynamically stable skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice in two-dimensional heterostructures, a novel state exhibiting a net-zero global topological charge owing to an equal population of skyrmions and antiskyrmions. This surprising coexistence of oppositely charged solitons remarkably circumvents their anticipated annihilation. We demonstrate the formation and evolution of this phase in Fe films on C1v -symmetric (110) surfaces of GaAs and CdTe semiconductors. Specifically, we reveal a series of magnetic field-induced phase transitions: cycloidal spin-spiral to skyrmion-antiskyrmion lattice to conical spin-spiral to ferromagnet. The remarkable stability of the net-zero lattice is attributed to symmetry-enforced anisotropic magnetic interactions. Lowering interfacial symmetry to C1v thus enables frustrated chiral magnets, uniquely manifesting in thermodynamically stable net-zero topological soliton lattices, as revealed by our findings.</description>

      <title>Axial Hall Effect in Altermagnetic Lieb Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We predict a so-called axial Hall effect, a Berry-curvature-driven anomalous Hall response, in Lieb-lattice altermagnets. By constructing a tight-binding model, we identify the axial direction as a hidden topological degree of freedom. Breaking the double degeneracy of axial symmetry generates substantial Berry curvature and induces a pronounced anomalous Hall conductivity. First-principles calculations further confirm the emergence of this effect in strained altermagnets, particularly in ternary transition-metal dichalcogenides. We take Mn2WS4 as an example to reveal that the axial Hall effect originates from the interplay between Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling and the intrinsic piezomagnetic response of Lieb-lattice altermagnets, leading to highly localized and enhanced Berry curvature. Remarkably, the magnitude of the axial Hall effect is significant and remains unchanged when varying the strain, highlighting the topological nature of the axial degree of freedom. Finally, in multilayer systems, the effect manifests as a distinctive thickness-dependent modulation of both anomalous and spin Hall responses. These findings emphasize the critical role of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear spin textures in altermagnets, an area that has received limited attention, and open new pathways for exploring intrinsic Hall phenomena in topological magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Scale Up Analysis of Inductively Heated Metamaterial Reactors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inductively heated metamaterial reactors, which utilize an open cell lattice baffle structure as a heating susceptor for magnetic induction, are promising candidates for scaled electrified thermochemical reactor operation due to their ability to support volumetric heating profiles and enhanced heat transfer properties. In this work, we present a systematic scale up analysis of inductive metamaterial reactors where we utilize a combination of analytic modeling, numerical simulations, and experiments to project the capabilities and performance of scaled reactors. We use reverse water gas shift as a model reaction system and show that for reactor configurations featuring a uniform metamaterial susceptor, the total system efficiency increases with scale. However, the throughput of these scaled reactors is limited by radial temperature gradients. We further show this bottleneck can be overcome by tailoring the radial effective conductivity profile of the susceptor, which can enable scaled reactors with nearly ideal plug flow-like capabilities. These concepts provide a pathway towards scaled electrified thermochemical reactors with optimal chemical conversion capabilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electric double layer (EDL) governs electrocatalysis, energy conversion, and storage, yet its atomic structure, capacitance, and reactivity remain elusive. Here we introduce a machine learning interatomic potential framework that incorporates long-range electrostatics, enabling nanosecond simulations of metal-electrolyte interfaces under applied electric bias with near-quantum-mechanical accuracy. At the benchmark Pt(111)/water and Pt(111)/aqueous KF electrolyte interfaces, we resolve the molecular structure of the EDL, reveal proton-transfer mechanisms underlying anodic water dissociation and the diffusion of ionic water species, and compute differential capacitance. We find that the nominally inert K+ and F- ions, while leaving interfacial water structure largely unchanged, screen bulk fields, slow proton transfer, and generate a prominent capacitance peak near the potential of zero charge. These results show that ion-specific interactions, which are ignored in mean-field models, are central to capacitance and reactivity, providing a molecular basis for interpreting experiments and designing electrolytes.</description>

      <title>Fate of Topological Dirac Magnons in van der Waals Ferromagnets at Finite Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dirac magnons, the bosonic counterparts of Dirac fermions in graphene, provide a unique platform to explore symmetry-protected band crossings and quantum geometry in magnetic insulators, while promising high-velocity, low-dissipation spin transport for next-generation magnonic technologies. However, their stability under realistic, finite-temperature conditions remains an open question. Here, we develop a comprehensive microscopic theory of thermal magnon-magnon interactions in van der Waals honeycomb ferromagnets, focusing on both gapless and gapped Dirac magnons. Using nonlinear spin-wave theory with magnon self-energy corrections and a T-matrix resummation that captures two-magnon bound states, we quantitatively reproduce temperature- and momentum-dependent energy shifts and linewidths observed experimentally in the gapless Dirac magnon material CrBr$_3$, even near the Curie temperature. Our approach resolves discrepancies between prior theoretical predictions and experiment and highlight the significant role of bound states in enhancing magnon damping at low temperatures. For gapped Dirac magnon materials such as CrI$_3$, CrSiTe$_3$, and CrGeTe$_3$, we find a thermally induced reduction of the topological magnon gap but no evidence of thermally driven topological transitions. Classical atomistic spin dynamics simulations corroborate the gap' s robustness up to the Curie temperature. Furthermore, we establish a practical criterion for observing topological gaps by determining the minimum ratio of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction to Heisenberg exchange required to overcome thermal broadening throughout the ordered phase, typically around 5%. Our results clarify the interplay of thermal many-body effects and topology in low-dimensional magnets and provide a reliable framework for interpreting spectroscopic experiments.</description>

Abstract: Control of quantum systems typically relies on the interaction with electromagnetic radiation. In this study, we experimentally show that the electromagnetic near-field of a spatially modulated freespace electron beam can be used to drive spin systems, demonstrating free-electron-bound-electron resonant interaction. By periodically deflecting the electron beam of a scanning electron microscope in close proximity to a spin-active solid-state sample, and sweeping the deflection frequency across the spin resonance, we directly observe phase coherent coupling between the electron beam's nearfield and the two spin states. This method relies only on classically shaping the electron beams transversal correlations and has the potential to enable coherent control of quantum systems with unprecedented, electron microscopic resolution, opening novel possibilities for advanced spectroscopic tools in nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Persistent Fluctuating Superconductivity and Planckian Dissipation in Fe(Te,Se)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Increasingly intricate phase diagrams in new classes of superconductors host fascinating interactions between superconductivity, diverse quantum phases, and quantum critical dynamics. The native superfluids, however, often exhibit much lower density and much greater inhomogeneity than conventional superfluids. This may render the superconductivity susceptible to fluctuations that are ordinarily assumed to be frozen out far below the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$, calling into question the degree to which the superconducting state is fully coherent. In this work, we leverage terahertz spectroscopy to demonstrate strongly fluctuating superconductivity in topological compositions of the multiband iron-based superconductor Fe(Te,Se). These fluctuations are found to persist undiminished far below $T_c$ and converge upon the limit of Planckian dissipation above $T_c$. These results indicate that extended quantum fluctuations dominate the electrodynamics of both the superconducting and Planckian-dissipative precursor states of Fe(Te,Se), and demonstrate that the assumption of phase coherence must be rigorously validated in emerging classes of unconventional superconductors.</description>

      <title>Reaction dynamics of lithium-mediated electrolyte decomposition using machine learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ring-opening decomposition of ethylene carbonate in the presence of a single lithium atom and on the surface of lithium metal. Combining accurate electronic structure theory, enhanced sampling, and machine learning, we fine-tune the MACE-MP0 foundation model and apply the resulting machine learning potentials to obtain statistically converged free energy profiles and reaction rates. We confirm that the level of electronic structure theory is important, and inaccurate density functionals can overestimate the reaction rate by up to nine orders of magnitude. We also find that harmonic transition state theory underestimates reaction rates by about one order of magnitude. For the surface reaction, we find and characterize a new, ultrafast decomposition pathway wherein the carbonyl is deeply inserted into the lithium surface and bent by about 70$^\circ$. This reaction, which occurs in a few tens of picoseconds, generates a ring-opened intermediate that is a precursor for CO or CO$_2$ formation; by contrast, an alternative pathway that yields CO$_3^{2-}$ and ethylene is found to be non-competitive, occurring on a timescale of tens of nanoseconds.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Resistive Switching in Microtubule-Templated Gold Nanowires for Reconfigurable Nanoelectronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scaling limitations of conventional transistors demand alternative device concepts capable of dynamic reconfigurability at the atomic scale. Resistive switching (RS), a key mechanism for neuromorphic computing and non-volatile memory, has been widely demonstrated in oxides, semiconductors, and nanocomposites, but not in pure one-dimensional metallic systems. Here, we report the first electrical characterization of gold nanowires (AuNWs) synthesized within the lumen of functionalized microtubules. Structural analyses confirm continuous metallic wires with local compositional inhomogeneities. Electrical measurements reveal three distinct conduction behaviours and abrupt, reversible resistance transitions under applied bias, consistent with defect-driven electromigration. Voltage pulsing enables active and reproducible modulation of resistance states without loss of metallic conduction, establishing a new RS mechanism intrinsic to pure metallic nanowires. Owing to their high aspect ratio, lateral geometry, and CMOS-compatible processing, microtubule-templated AuNWs provide a versatile platform for reconfigurable interconnects and neuromorphic device architectures.</description>

      <title>Characterization of superconducting germanide and germanosilicide films of Pd, Pt, Rh and Ir formed by solid-phase epitaxy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Facilitated by recent advances in strained Ge/SiGe quantum well (QW) growth technology, superconductor-semiconductor hybrid devices based on group IV materials have been developed, potentially augmenting the functionality of quantum circuits. The formation of highly transparent superconducting platinum germanosilicide (PtSiGe) contacts to Ge/SiGe heterostructures by solid-phase epitaxy between Pt and SiGe has recently been reported, although with a relatively low critical temperature $&lt;1\,\mathrm{K}$. Here, we present a comparative study of the superconducting properties of Pt, Pd, Rh, and Ir germanides, along with an in-depth characterization of Ir(Si)Ge films formed by solid-phase epitaxy. For films fabricated under optimal epitaxy conditions, we report $T_\mathrm{c}=3.4\,\mathrm{K}$ ($2.6\,\mathrm{K}$ for IrGe (IrSiGe). High-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) reveal that Ir reacts with Ge substrates to form a polycrystalline IrGe layer with a sharp IrGe/Ge interface.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic phonon self-energy due to electrons with finite linewidths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12221v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of the non-adiabatic phonon self-energy arising from coupling to electrons with finite linewidths using the spectral representation of Green's functions. Our formalism naturally includes the contribution from the intra-band electronic transitions (as well as the inter-band ones) at all electron wavevectors to the phonon linewidths, which is forbidden for zone-center optical phonons if infinitesimal electron linewidths are used. As a proof of principle, we use the theory to calculate the linewidth of the double-degenerate, zone-center optical $E_{\rm 2g}$ phonons of graphene as a function of the chemical potential. The calculated phonon linewidths obtained with finite electron linewidths differ significantly from those obtained with infinitesimal electron linewidths even at low temperatures. Intra-band electronic transitions play an important role in making this difference. Moreover, only the results accounting for the finite electron linewidths are in quantitative agreement with the available experimental data. The presented formalism is suitable for first-principles calculations.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetism has surfaced as a novel magnetic phase, bridging the properties of ferro- and anti-ferromagnetism. The momentum-dependent spin-splitting observed in these materials reflects their unique symmetry characteristics, which also establish the conditions for chiral magnons to emerge. Here we provide the first direct experimental evidence for a chiral magnon in the altermagnetic candidate MnTe revealed by circular-dichroism resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (CD-RIXS). This mode which we term chiral altermagnon exhibits a distinct momentum dependence of its spin polarization consistent with the proposed altermagnetic $g-$wave symmetry of MnTe. Our polarization-resolved results corroborate the existence of a new class of magnetic excitations, demonstrating how altermagnetic order shapes spin dynamics and paves the way for advances in spintronic and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Carrier Localization and Spontaneous Formation of Two-Dimensional Polarization Domain in Halide Perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20261v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Halide perovskites are known for their rich phase diagram and superior performance in diverse optoelectronics applications. The latter property is often attributed to the long electron-hole recombination time, whose underlying physical mechanism has been a long-standing controversy. In this Letter, we investigate the transport and localization properties of electron and hole carriers in a prototypical halide perovskite (CsPbBr$_3$), through \textit{ab initio} tight-binding nonadiabatic dynamics approach for large-scale (tens of nm size) supercell calculations, to simulate electron and ion dynamics on the same footing. We found distinct structural, lattice polarization, and electron-phonon coupling properties at low (below 100 K) and high temperatures, consistent with experimental observations. In particular, at low temperature we find spontaneous formation of polar grain boundaries in the nonpolar bulk systems, which result in two-dimensional polarization patterns that serve to localize and separate electrons and holes. We reveal phonon-assisted variable-range hopping mostly responsible for low-temperature transport, and their characteristic frequency correlates with temperature-dependent phonon power spectrum and energy oscillation frequency in nonadiabatic dynamics. We answer the critical questions of long electron-hole recombination lifetime at low temperature and offer the correlation among polarization domains, electron-phonon couplings, and photocarrier dynamics.</description>

      <title>Relation of Continuous Chirality Measure to Spin and Orbital Polarization, and Chiroptical Properties in Solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chirality introduces intriguing topological, electronic, and spin-optronic properties to molecules and solids. In this work, we provide a quantitative metric for the degree of chirality in solids, independent of the type of system and the dimensionality, through the continuous chirality measure (CCM). We quantitatively analyze the correlation between CCM and spin and orbital angular momentum (OAM) polarization, as well as circular dichroism (CD) and the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE). By internal spin-orbit field analysis, we demonstrate a distinct character (proportionality among Rashba, Deresselhaus, and Weyl contributions) and chirality dependence among different chiral solids. Furthermore, unlike CD, we found that absorption dissymmetry factor $g_{CD}$ could remain unchanged as a function of chirality and show anisotropic dependence on CCM. In addition, we show that the relation between CCM and CPGE is rather complex. At low excitation energy close to the bandgap transition, the CCM continuously tunes the total SOC, and therefore, the CPGE response. However, at high excitation energy, CPGE includes more than just band edge transitions, which complicates the relation of chirality and CPGE due to changes in the optical dipole strength and electron-hole group velocity difference. Ultimately, this causes CPGE to be only correlated with chirality at excitation energies close to the band edge. At the end, we discussed strategies of manipulating chiral-optical properties through chirality transfer at interfaces or applying strain. The insights developed in this work will inspire the design of materials for future spintronics and orbitronics, as well as spin-optronics applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The theoretical description of materials' properties driven out of equilibrium has important consequences in various fields such as semiconductor spintronics, nonlinear optics, continuous and discrete quantum information science and technology. The coupling of a quantum many-body system to an external bath can dramatically modify its dynamics compared to that of closed systems, new phenomena like relaxation and decoherence appear as a consequence of the non-unitary evolution of the quantum system. In addition, electron-electron correlations must be properly accounted for in order to go beyond a simple one-electron or mean-field description of the electronic system. Here we discuss a first-principles methodology based on the evolution of the electronic density matrix capable of treating electron-environment interactions and electron-electron correlations at the same level of description. The effect of the environment is separated into a coherent contribution, like the coupling to applied external electro-magnetic fields, and an incoherent contribution, like the interaction with lattice vibrations or the thermal background of radiation. Electron-electron interactions are included using the nonequilibrium Green's function plus generalized Kadanoff-Baym ansatz. The obtained non-Markovian coupled set of equations reduces to ordinary Lindblad quantum master equation form in the Markovian limit.</description>

      <title>Coercive Field Reduction in Ultra-thin Al1-XScXN via Interfacial Engineering with a Scandium Electrode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN) ferroelectrics are promising for next-generation non-volatile memory applications due to their high remnant polarization as well as fast switching and scalability to nanometer thicknesses. As device dimensions shrink, the coercive field in ultra-thin ferroelectric films increases, which challenges low-voltage operation. We demonstrate that interfacial engineering through bottom electrode selection and strain management reduces this coercive field increase and improves ferroelectric performance. Robust ferroelectricity is observed in ultra-thin AlScN capacitors deposited on a Sc bottom electrode under both alternating current and direct current conditions. The coercive field is reduced by over 20 percent compared to capacitors with an Al bottom electrode. Furthermore, dynamic switching behavior is analyzed using the KAI model. At low frequencies (less than 16.7 kHz), capacitors with Sc and Al bottom electrodes exhibit comparable KAI exponents (0.036 and 0.028, respectively), indicating similar switching kinetics. However, at higher frequencies, the capacitor with an Al bottom electrode shows a significantly higher exponent (0.093), indicating stronger frequency dependence, whereas the capacitor with a Sc bottom electrode maintains a stable exponent of 0.036. Scanning Electron Nanobeam Diffraction is used to measure strain differences in AlScN thin films grown on templates with different lattice mismatch, revealing a correlation between lattice mismatch, film strain, and switching behavior in ultra-thin films.</description>

      <title>Searching for evidence of strengthening from short-range order in the CrCoNi medium entropy alloy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01147v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling of strength to short-range order (SRO) in the CrCoNi medium entropy alloy remains actively investigated, with conflicting reports supporting and opposing SRO-induced strengthening continuing to emerge. A direct observation of this effect is elusive, due to difficulties in the quantification of SRO. Here, we deliver a structurally agnostic analysis that instead searches for unusual patterns in crystal size effects as evidence of SRO-induced strengthening. For this purpose, we assemble a large dataset of strengthening measurements drawn from a range of thermomechanical processing conditions known to produce SRO. Based on a comparative analysis with pure metal benchmarks, we find no evidence for significant coupling of SRO to strengthening in CrCoNi, and that patterns suggesting a positive finding may be explained by cross-study measurement scatter. Nevertheless, we leverage our analysis to provide an upper bound estimate of SRO-induced strengthening in the unlikely scenario where other sources of scatter are negligible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic materials often exhibit complex energy landscapes with multiple local minima, each corresponding to a self-consistent electronic structure solution. Finding the global minimum is challenging, and heuristic methods are not always guaranteed to succeed. Here, we apply a recently developed automated workflow to systematically explore the energy landscape of 194 magnetic monolayers obtained from the Materials Cloud 2D crystals database and determine their ground-state magnetic order. Our approach enables effective control and sampling of orbital occupation matrices, allowing rapid identification of local minima. We find a diverse set of self-consistent collinear metastable states, further enriched by Hubbard-corrected energy functionals, when the $U$ parameters have been computed from first principles using linear-response theory. We categorise the monolayers by their magnetic ordering and highlight promising candidates. Our results include 109 ferromagnetic, 83 antiferromagnetic, and 2 altermagnetic monolayers, along with 12 novel ferromagnetic half-metals with potential for spintronics technologies.</description>

      <title>Topology-Driven Vibrations in a Chiral Polar Vortex Lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ordering of magnetic or electric dipoles leading to real-space topological structures is at the forefront of materials research as their quantum mechanical nature often lends itself to emergent properties. Atomic lattice vibrations (phonons) are often a key contributor to the formation of long-range dipole textures based on ferroelectrics and impact the properties of the emergent phases. Here, using monochromated, momentum-resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy (qEELS) with nanometer spatial resolution and meV-spectral-precision, we demonstrate that polar vortex lattices in PbTiO$_3$ spatially modulate the material's vibrational spectrum in patterns that directly reflect the overlying symmetry of the topological patterns. Moreover, by combining experiments with molecular dynamics simulations using machine learned potentials we reveal how these structures modify phonon modes across the vibrational spectrum. Beyond simple intensity modulation, we find that the chirality of the vortex topology imparts its unique symmetry onto phonons, producing a distinctive asymmetrical spectral shift across the vortex unit cell. Finally, the high spatial resolution of the technique enables topological defects to be probed directly, demonstrating a return to trivial PbTiO$_3$ modes at vortex dislocation cores. These findings establish a fundamental relationship between ferroelectric-ordering-induced topologies and phonon behavior, opening new avenues for engineering thermal transport, electron-phonon coupling, and other phonon-mediated properties in next-generation nanoscale devices.</description>

Abstract: Boron-doped diamond crystals (BDD, C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$) exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, electronic tunability, and resistance to radiation damage. This makes them promising materials for use in gamma-ray crystal-based light sources. To better understand and quantify the structural distortions introduced by doping, which are critical for maintaining channelling efficiency, we perform atomistic-level molecular dynamics simulations on periodic C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$ systems of various sizes. These simulations allow the influence of boron concentration on the lattice constant and the (110) and (100) inter-planar distances to be evaluated over the concentration range from pure diamond (0%) to 5% boron at room temperature (300 K). Linear relationships between both lattice constant and inter-planar distance with increasing dopant concentration are observed, with a deviation from Vegard's Law. This deviation is larger than that reported by other theoretical and computational studies; however, this may be attributed to an enhanced crystal quality over these studies, a vital aspect when considering gamma-ray crystal light source design. The methodology presented here incorporates several refinements to closely reflect the conditions of microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition (MPCVD) crystal growth. Validation of the methodology is provided through a comprehensive statistical analysis of the structure of our generated crystals. These results enable reliable atomistic modelling of doped diamond crystals and support their use in the design and fabrication of periodically bent structures for next-generation gamma-ray light source technologies.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Hyperpolarizability of Crystals with Quantum Geometry</title>

Abstract: We demonstrate that higher-order electric susceptibilities in crystals can be enhanced and understood through nontrivial topological invariants and quantum geometry, using one-dimensional $\pi$-conjugated chains as representative model systems. First, we show that the crystalline-symmetry-protected topology of these chains imposes a lower bound on their quantum metric and hyperpolarizabilities. Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of nonlinear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced nonlinear optical properties.</description>

      <title>Entropic modulation of divalent cation transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aqueous cations permeate subnanoscale pores by crossing free energy barriers dominated by competing enthalpic contributions from transiently decreased ion-solvent and increased ion-pore electrostatic interactions. This commonly accepted view is rooted in the studies of monovalent cation transport. Divalent cations, however, have significantly higher desolvation costs, requiring considerably larger pores to enable retention of the first hydration shell and subsequently transport. We show that this scenario gives rise to a strong enthalpy-entropy competition. Specifically, the first hydration shell is shown to undergo rotational ordering inside the pore, resulting in a tight transition state. Our results shed light on the basic mechanisms of transport barrier formation for aqueous divalent cations permeating nanoporous 2D membranes.</description>

      <title>Surface tension estimation of bubble nuclei in magma using spinodal pressure and nonclassical nucleation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efforts to estimate the magma decompression rate from the vesicular texture of volcanic products have progressed through the development of theoretical models and laboratory experiments. The theoretical model is based on nucleation theory, with the surface tension between the melt and bubble nucleus being the parameter that most strongly governs nucleation. Since direct measurement of surface tension is difficult, it has been calculated by inverting the bubble number density from experimental samples using classical or nonclassical nucleation theory formulas. However, in the nonclassical case, which accounts for the supersaturation dependence of surface tension, the pressure at the spinodal limit (where surface tension becomes zero) was previously unknown, necessitating complex mathematical operations. In this study, the spinodal pressure determined from the Gibbs energy curve was substituted into the nonclassical formula by approximating the water-saturated silicate melt as a two-component symmetric regular solution composed of silicate and water. This approach allowed for a more straightforward estimation of surface tension using data from past decompression experiments. Nevertheless, the resulting surface tension values were more scattered than those obtained using the classical formula, suggesting that applying the nonclassical formula to magma vesiculation is not valid at present. Resolving this issue will likely require an integrated understanding of the dependence of surface tension on both supersaturation and bubble radius. Such understanding would enable more accurate estimation of surface tension and contribute to reconciling the discrepancy between theoretical and experimental bubble number density values.</description>

      <title>Interface-induced collective phase transition in VO2-based bilayers studied by layer selective spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20448v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigated the origin of collective electronic phase transitions induced at the heterointerface between monoclinic insulating VO2 and rutile metallic electron-doped VO2 layers using in situ soft x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (PES) and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) on nanoscale VO2/V0.99W0.01O2 (001)R bilayers. Thanks to the surface sensitivity of PES and XAS, we determined the changes in the electronic structure and V-V dimerization in each constituent layer separately. The layer selective observation of the electronic and crystal structures in the upper VO2 layer of the bilayer indicates that the monoclinic insulating phase VO2 layer undergoes a transition to the rutile metallic phase by forming the heterointerface. Detailed temperature-dependent measurements reveal that the rutile metallic phase VO2 undergoes a transition to the monoclinic insulating phase with a decrease in temperature, as in the case of a VO2 single-layer film. Furthermore, during the temperature-induced phase transition in the VO2 layer, the spectra are well described by an in-plane phase separation of the rutile metallic and monoclinic insulating phases. These results suggest that the interface-induced transition from the monoclinic insulating to the rutile metallic phase in the VO2 layer of bilayers occurs as a collective phase transition derived from the static energy balance between the interfacial energy and the bulk free energies of the constituent layers.</description>

      <title>Burgers rings as topological signatures of Eshelby-like plastic events in glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eshelby-like quadrupolar structures serve as the fundamental microscopic units for characterizing plastic instabilities in amorphous solids and play a crucial role in explaining their mechanical failure, including the formation of shear bands. However, identifying Eshelby-like plastic events in glasses remains challenging due to their inherent structural and dynamical complexity. In this work, we show that Eshelby-like structures can be precisely identified and localized using a topological invariant known as the continuous Burgers vector. By combining analytical and simulation techniques, we reveal the emergence of a topological Burgers ring around Eshelby plastic events, enabling the precise identification of their center of mass and capturing their orientation as well. This proposed method offers a clear and unambiguous framework to locate and characterize the plastic rearrangements that govern plasticity in glasses.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced manipulation of non-collinear antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in harnessing non-collinear antiferromagnets (NCAFMs) for applications in antiferromagnetic spintronics. A key requirement for their practical use is the ability to control the spin order in a reliable and tunable manner. In this work, we investigate how the spin order in kagome antiferromagnets -- an important class of NCAFMs -- can be manipulated via strain. Starting from a microscopic spin Hamiltonian, we derive an effective action for the kagome antiferromagnet that captures the coupling between the spin order and the system's strain tensor. At the microscopic level, this coupling arises from strain-induced modifications of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya and exchange interactions. Using this effective description, we explore two strain-driven phenomena: (1) strain-induced switching of the antiferromagnetic spin order and (2) the piezomagnetic response. We numerically show that strain facilitates thermally assisted switching between spin configurations of opposite chirality. Specifically, we find that uniform tensile and compressive strain govern both the average switching time and the preferred switching direction between chiral states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that strain induces a net magnetization and provide an experimentally testable prediction of this effect for a typical NCAFM. Our results provide a theoretical framework for modeling strain-induced manipulation of kagome antiferromagnets, underscoring strain as a promising route for functional control of NCAFMs.</description>

      <title>Lost Data in Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this study is to estimate the amount of lost data in electron microscopy and to analyze the extent to which experimentally acquired images are utilized in peer-reviewed scientific publications. Analysis of the number of images taken on electron microscopes at a core user facility and the number of images subsequently included in peer-reviewed scientific journals revealed low efficiency of data utilization. Up to around 90% of electron microscopy data generated during routine instrument operation remain unused. Of the more than 150 000 electron microscopy images evaluated in this study, only approximately 3 500 (just over 2%) were made available in publications. For the analyzed dataset, the amount of lost data in electron microscopy can be estimated as &gt;90% (in terms of data being recorded but not being published in peer-reviewed literature). On the one hand, these results highlight a shortcoming in the optimal use of microscopy images; on the other hand, they indicate the existence of a large pool of electron microscopy data that can facilitate research in data science and the development of AI-based projects. The considerations important to unlock the potential of lost data are discussed in the present article.</description>
