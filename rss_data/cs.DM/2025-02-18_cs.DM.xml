      <title>On a tree-based variant of bandwidth and forbidding simple topological minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain structure theorems for graphs excluding a fan (a path with a universal vertex) or a dipole ($K_{2,k}$) as a topological minor. The corresponding decompositions can be computed in FPT linear time. This is motivated by the study of a graph parameter we call treebandwidth which extends the graph parameter bandwidth by replacing the linear layout by a rooted tree such that neighbours in the graph are in ancestor-descendant relation in the tree.
  We deduce an approximation algorithm for treebandwidth running in FPT linear time from our structure theorems. We complement this result with a precise characterisation of the parameterised complexity of computing the parameter exactly.</description>

      <title>A review of minimum cost box searching games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of zero-sum search games in which a Hider hides one or more target among a set of $n$ boxes. The boxes may require differing amount of time to search, and detection may be imperfect, so that there is a certain probability that a target may not be found when a box is searched, even when it is there. A Searcher must choose how to search the boxes sequentially, and wishes to minimize the expected time to find the target(s), whereas the Hider wishes to maximize this payoff. We review some known solutions to different cases of this game.</description>

      <title>Light Edge Fault Tolerant Graph Spanners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has recently been significant interest in fault tolerant spanners, which are spanners that still maintain their stretch guarantees after some nodes or edges fail. This work has culminated in an almost complete understanding of the three-way tradeoff between stretch, sparsity, and number of faults tolerated. However, despite some progress in metric settings, there have been no results to date on the tradeoff in general graphs between stretch, lightness, and number of faults tolerated.
  We initiate the study of light edge fault tolerant (EFT) graph spanners, obtaining the first such results. First, we observe that lightness can be unbounded if we use the traditional definition (normalizing by the MST). We then argue that a natural definition of fault-tolerant lightness is to instead normalize by a min-weight fault tolerant connectivity preserver; essentially, a fault-tolerant version of the MST. However, even with this, we show that it is still not generally possible to construct $f$-EFT spanners whose weight compares reasonably to the weight of a min-weight $f$-EFT connectivity preserver.
  In light of this lower bound, it is natural to then consider bicriteria notions of lightness, where we compare the weight of an $f$-EFT spanner to a min-weight $(f' &gt; f)$-EFT connectivity preserver. The most interesting question is to determine the minimum value of $f'$ that allows for reasonable lightness upper bounds. Our main result is a precise answer to this question: $f' = 2f$. In particular, we show that the lightness can be untenably large (roughly $n/k$ for a $k$-spanner) if one normalizes by the min-weight $(2f-1)$-EFT connectivity preserver. But if one normalizes by the min-weight $2f$-EFT connectivity preserver, then we show that the lightness is bounded by just $O(f^{1/2})$ times the non-fault tolerant lightness (roughly $n^{1/k}$, for a $(1+\epsilon)(2k-1)$-spanner).</description>

      <title>On rigid regular graphs and a problem of Babai and Pultr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph is \textit{rigid} if it only admits the identity endomorphism. We show that for every $d\ge 3$ there exist infinitely many mutually rigid $d$-regular graphs of arbitrary odd girth $g\geq 7$. Moreover, we determine the minimum order of a rigid $d$-regular graph for every $d\ge 3$. This provides strong positive answers to a question of van der Zypen [https://mathoverflow.net/q/296483, https://mathoverflow.net/q/321108]. Further, we use our construction to show that every finite monoid is isomorphic to the endomorphism monoid of a regular graph. This solves a problem of Babai and Pultr [J. Comb.~Theory, Ser.~B, 1980].</description>

      <title>Parameterised algorithms for temporal reconfiguration problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a static vertex-selection problem (e.g. independent set, dominating set) on a graph, we can define a corresponding temporal reconfiguration problem on a temporal graph which asks for a sequence of solutions to the vertex-selection problem at each time such that we can reconfigure from one solution to the next. We can think of each solution in the sequence as a set of vertices with tokens placed on them; our reconfiguration model allows us to slide tokens along active edges of a temporal graph.
  We show that it is possible to efficiently check whether one solution can be reconfigured to another, and show that approximation results on the static vertex-selection problem can be adapted with a lifetime factor to the reconfiguration version. Our main contributions are fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with respect to: enumeration time of the related static problem; the combination of temporal neighbourhood diversity and lifetime of the input graph; and the combination of lifetime and treewidth of the footprint graph.</description>

      <title>Testing popularity in linear time via maximum matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Popularity is an approach in mechanism design to find fair structures in a graph, based on the votes of the nodes. Popular matchings are the relaxation of stable matchings: given a graph G=(V,E) with strict preferences on the neighbors of the nodes, a matching M is popular if there is no other matching M' such that the number of nodes preferring M' is more than those preferring M. This paper considers the popularity testing problem, when the task is to decide whether a given matching is popular or not. Previous algorithms applied reductions to maximum weight matchings. We give a new algorithm for testing popularity by reducing the problem to maximum matching testing, thus attaining a linear running time O(|E|).
  Linear programming-based characterization of popularity is often applied for proving the popularity of a certain matching. As a consequence of our algorithm we derive a more structured dual witness than previous ones. Based on this result we give a combinatorial characterization of fractional popular matchings, which are a special class of popular matchings.</description>

      <title>Graph traversals associated with iterative methods for solving systems of linear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10790v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To solve many problems on graphs, graph traversals are used, the usual variants of which are the depth-first search and the breadth-first search. Implementing a graph traversal we consequently reach all vertices of the graph that belong to a connected component. The breadth-first search is the usual choice when constructing efficient algorithms for finding connected components of a graph. Methods of simple iteration for solving systems of linear equations with modified graph adjacency matrices and with the properly specified right-hand side can be considered as graph traversal algorithms. These traversal algorithms, generally speaking, turn out to be non-equivalent neither to the depth-first search nor the breadth-first search. The example of such a traversal algorithm is the one associated with the Gauss-Seidel method. For an arbitrary connected graph, to visit all its vertices, the algorithm requires not more iterations than that is required for BFS. For a large number of instances of the problem, fewer iterations will be required.</description>

      <title>Profile and neighbourhood complexity of graphs with excluded minors and tree-structured graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \emph{$r$-neighbourhood complexity} of a graph $G$ is the function counting, for a given integer $k$, the largest possible number, over all vertex-subsets $A$ of size $k$, of subsets of $A$ realized as the intersection between the $r$-neighbourhood of some vertex and $A$. A~refinement of this notion is the \emph{$r$-profile complexity}, that counts the maximum number of distinct distance-vectors from any vertex to the vertices of $A$, ignoring distances larger than~$r$. Typically, in structured graph classes such as graphs of bounded VC-dimension or chordal graphs, these functions are bounded, leading to insights into their structural properties and efficient algorithms.
  We improve existing bounds on the $r$-profile complexity (and thus on the $r$-neighbourhood complexity) for graphs in several structured graph classes. We show that the $r$-profile complexity of graphs excluding $K_h$ as a minor is in $O_h(r^{3h-3}k)$. For graphs of treewidth at most~$t$, we give a bound in $O_t(r^{t+1}k)$, which is tight up to a function of~$t$ as a factor. These bounds improve results of Joret and Rambaud and answer a question of their paper [Combinatorica, 2024]. We also apply our methods to other classes of bounded expansion such as graphs excluding a fixed complete graph as a subdivision.
  For outerplanar graphs, we can improve our treewidth bound by a factor of $r$ and conjecture that a similar improvement holds for graphs with bounded simple treewidth. For graphs of treelength at most~$\ell$, we give the upper bound of $O(k(r^2(\ell+1)^k))$, which we improve to $O\left (k\cdot (r 2^k + r^2k^2) \right)$ in the case of chordal graphs and $O(k^2r)$ for interval graphs.
  Our bounds also imply relations between the order, diameter and metric dimension of graphs in these classes, improving results from [Beaudou et al., SIDMA 2017].</description>

      <title>A triangle process on graphs with given degree sequence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08499v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The triangle switch Markov chain is designed to generate random graphs with given degree sequence, but having more triangles than would appear under the uniform distribution. Transition probabilities of the chain depends on a parameter, called the activity, which is used to assign higher stationary probability to graphs with more triangles. In previous work we proved ergodicity of the triangle switch chain for regular graphs. Here we prove ergodicity for all sequences with minimum degree at least 3, and show rapid mixing of the chain when the activity and the maximum degree are not too large.</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns the avoidability of abelian and additive powers in infinite rich words. In particular, we construct an infinite additive $5$-power-free rich word over $\{0,1\}$ and an infinite additive $4$-power-free rich word over $\{0, 1, 2\}$. The alphabet sizes are as small as possible in both cases, even for abelian powers.</description>

      <title>Normalizations of factorizations over convex cones and their effects on extension complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Factorizations over cones and their duals play central roles for many areas of mathematics and computer science. One of the reasons behind this is the ability to find a representation for various objects using a well-structured family of cones, where the representation is captured by the factorizations over these cones. Several major questions about factorizations over cones remain open even for such well-structured families of cones as non-negative orthants and positive semidefinite cones. Having said that, we possess a far better understanding of factorizations over non-negative orthants and positive semidefinite cones than over other families of cones. One of the key properties that led to this better understanding is the ability to normalize factorizations, i.e., to guarantee that the norms of the vectors involved in the factorizations are bounded in terms of an input and in terms of a constant dependent on the given cone. Our work aims at understanding which cones guarantee that factorizations over them can be normalized, and how this effects extension complexity of polytopes over such cones.</description>

      <title>On the Expressiveness of Rational ReLU Neural Networks With Bounded Depth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To confirm that the expressive power of ReLU neural networks grows with their depth, the function $F_n = \max \{0,x_1,\ldots,x_n\}$ has been considered in the literature. A conjecture by Hertrich, Basu, Di Summa, and Skutella [NeurIPS 2021] states that any ReLU network that exactly represents $F_n$ has at least $\lceil\log_2 (n+1)\rceil$ hidden layers. The conjecture has recently been confirmed for networks with integer weights by Haase, Hertrich, and Loho [ICLR 2023].
  We follow up on this line of research and show that, within ReLU networks whose weights are decimal fractions, $F_n$ can only be represented by networks with at least $\lceil\log_3 (n+1)\rceil$ hidden layers. Moreover, if all weights are $N$-ary fractions, then $F_n$ can only be represented by networks with at least $\Omega( \frac{\ln n}{\ln \ln N})$ layers. These results are a partial confirmation of the above conjecture for rational ReLU networks, and provide the first non-constant lower bound on the depth of practically relevant ReLU networks.</description>
