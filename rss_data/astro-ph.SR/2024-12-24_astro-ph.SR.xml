      <title>A Comprehensive Study of the Dust Declines in R Coronae Borealis Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The R Coronae Borealis (RCB) variables are rare, hydrogen-deficient, carbon-rich supergiants known for large, erratic declines in brightness due to dust formation. Recently, the number of known RCB stars in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds has increased from $\sim$30 to 162. We use all-sky and targeted photometric surveys to create the longest possible light curves for all known RCB stars and systematically study their declines. Our study, the largest of its kind, includes measurements of decline activity levels, morphologies, and periodicities for nearly all RCB stars. We confirm previous predictions that cool RCB stars exhibit more declines than warm RCBs, supporting a relationship between dust formation and condensation temperatures. We also find evidence for two distinct dust production mechanisms. R CrB and SU Tau show decline onsets consistent with a Poisson process, suggesting their dust production is driven by stochastic processes, such as convection. In contrast, RY Sgr's declines correlate with its pulsation period, suggesting that its dust production is driven by pulsationally-induced shocks. Finally, we show that the dust properties of the related class of DY~Per variables differ from those of the RCB stars, suggesting differences in their evolutionary status.</description>

      <title>The Y Dwarf Population with HST: unlocking the secrets of our coolest neighbours -- II. Parallaxes and Proper Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present astrometric results from a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) campaign aimed at determining precise distances for cold Y-type brown dwarfs. Combining observations from a dedicated HST/WFC3 program with archival data, we derive astrometric solutions for 15 nearby Y dwarfs, by linking the high-precision relative astrometry from Hubble to the high-accuracy Gaia DR3 absolute reference system, using stars present in both to anchor the two frames of reference. We reach uncertainties on parallaxes below the 1-mas level for half of the sample, and down to 3 mas for two thirds of the targets, or relative precisions &lt;1% in most cases and 2-5x improvements over previous measurements. For the remaining targets, we achieved slightly lower precisions on parallaxes (5-12 mas, 5-10%), correlated with the lower signal-to-noise of the faintest targets. The precision reached in our derived proper motions is around 0.1-0.4 mas/yr for most targets, and up to 1-2 mas/yr for less precise cases. Our estimated parallaxes and proper motions are generally in good agreement with literature values, and consistent to 1-2 sigma with recent Spitzer-derived parallaxes in most cases. These new astrometric solutions provide important validation of these objects' distances and sky motions, especially given the large disparities seen in previous estimates. Our results demonstrate the power of HST combined with Gaia to measure highly-precise absolute astrometry for faint brown dwarfs, and highlights the limitations reached for the reddest and coldest objects, for which JWST will certainly provide a favourable platform to improve these results.</description>

      <title>3D Radiative MHD Simulations of Starspots II: Large-scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute realistic 3D radiative MHD near-surface models of starspots with substantial penumbrae on cool main-sequence stars using the MURaM simulation code. This work is an improvement on the the previous starspot models in a slab geometry. The umbra, penumbra and the quiet star for all starspots are distinct, not only in intensity and temperature, but also in thermodynamic and velocity structure. These models represent a significant step towards modelling contribution of starspots to stellar lightcurves.</description>

      <title>Photometric Stellar Parameters for 195,478 Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16930v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stellar atmospheric parameters and physical properties of stars in the Kepler Input Catalog (KIC) are of great significance for the study of exoplanets, stellar activity, and asteroseismology. However, despite extensive effort over the past decades, accurate spectroscopic estimates of these parameters are available for only about half of the stars in the full KIC catalog. In our work, by training relationships between photometric colors and spectroscopic stellar parameters from Gaia DR3, the Kepler Issac-Newton Survey, LAMOST DR10, and APOGEE DR17, we have obtained atmospheric-parameter estimates for over 195,000 stars, accounting for 97% of the total sample of KIC stars. We obtain 1{\sigma} uncertainties of 0.1 dex on metallicity [Fe/H], 100 K on effective temperature $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$ , and 0.2 dex on surface gravity log $g$. In addition, based on these atmospheric parameters, we estimated the ages, masses, radii, and surface gravities of these stars using the commonly adopted isochrone-fitting approach. The resulting precisions are 20% for ages, 0.1 $M_{\odot}$ for masses, 0.01 $R_{\odot}$ for radii and 0.1 dex for surface gravities. These accurate parameters are expected to provide valuable insights for future studies on various fields.</description>

      <title>The Unique Helium Nova V445 Puppis Ejected $\gg$0.001 M$_{\odot}$ in the Year 2000 and Will Not Become a Type Ia Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V445 Puppis is the only known example of a helium nova, where a layer of helium-rich gas accretes onto the surface of a white dwarf in a cataclysmic variable, with runaway helium burning making for the nova event. Speculatively, helium nova can provide one path to produce a Type Ia supernova (SNIa), within the larger framework of single-degenerate models. Relatively little has been known about V445 Pup, with this work reporting the discovery of the orbital period near 1.87 days. The companion star is 2.65$\pm$0.35 R$_{\odot}$ in radius as an evolved giant star stripped of its outer hydrogen envelope. The orbital period immediately before the 2000 eruption was $P_{\rm pre}$=1.871843$\pm$0.000014 days, with a steady period change of (-0.17$\pm$0.06)$\times$10$^{-8}$ from 1896--1995. The period immediately after the nova eruption was $P_{\rm post}$=1.873593$\pm$0.000034 days, with a $\dot{P}$ of ($-$4.7$\pm$0.5)$\times$10$^{-8}$. The fractional orbital period change ($\Delta P/P$) is $+$935$\pm$27 ppm. This restricts the mass of the gases ejected in the nova eruption to be $\gg$0.001M$_{\odot}$, and much greater than the mass accreted to trigger the nova. So the white dwarf is losing mass over each eruption cycle, and will not become a SNIa. Further, for V445 Pup and helium novae in general, I collect observations from 136 normal SNIa, for which any giant or sub-giant companion star would have been detected, yet zero companions are found. This is an independent proof that V445 Pup and helium novae are not SNIa progenitors.</description>

      <title>Variation in the intensity ratio at each wavelength point of the Si iv 1394/1403 \AA\ lines. Spectral diagnostics of a bifurcated eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. This study aims to investigate the deviation of the intensity ratio of the \ion{Si}{IV} 1394 \AA\ and 1403 \AA\ emission lines from the expected value of 2 in the optically thin regime, as observed in many recent studies.
  Methods. We analyzed the integrated intensity ratio ($R$) and the wavelength-dependent ratio ($r(\Delta\lambda)$) in a small bifurcated eruption event observed by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS).
  Results. Despite the relatively complex line profiles, most of the intensity ratio $R$ of \ion{Si}{IV} lines remained greater than 2 in the loops. The ratio $r(\Delta\lambda)$ varied in the line core and wings, changing distinctly from 2.0 to 3.3 along the wavelength. At certain positions, the \ion{Si}{IV} 1394 \AA\ and 1403 \AA\ lines exhibited different Doppler velocities.
  Conclusions. When diagnosing the spectra of small active region events, not only the impact of opacity but also the influence of resonance scattering should be considered. We propose that the ratio $r(\Delta\lambda)$ can serve as an indicator of the resonance scattering and opacity effect of the \ion{Si}{IV} line.</description>

      <title>Searching for Galactic Red Supergiants with Gaia RVS Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Red supergiants (RSGs) are essential to understanding the evolution and the contribution to the interstellar medium of massive stars. However, the number of identified RSGs within the Milky Way is still limited mainly due to the difficulty of measuring stellar extinction and distance. The release of approximately one million RVS spectra in Gaia DR3 presents new opportunity for identifying Galactic RSGs, because the equivalent width of the calcium triplet lines (EW(CaT)) in the spectra is an excellent indicator of stellar surface gravity. This work uses the RVS spectra with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 100 to search for the Galactic RSGs. The dwarf stars and red giants are removed and the RSG candidates are selected by the location in the EW(CaT) vs. BP-RP diagram. The early-type RSG candidates (K0-M2) are then identified by BP-RP &gt; 1.584 and EW(CaT) &gt; 1.1 nm. To identify late-type RSG candidates (after M2), the criteria of the average equivalent widths of TiO in the XP spectra (EW(TiO)) &gt; 10 nm, the color index K-W3 &lt; 0.5 and the period-amplitude sequence from Gaia DR3 LPV catalog are further applied to reduce the contamination of late-type red giants and asymptotic giant branch stars. This method yields 30 early-type (K0-M2) and 6196 late-type (after M2) RSG candidates, which is a significant increase to the present Galactic RSG sample. The application of this approach to the spectra with SNR &gt; 50 results in 48 early-type and 11,491 late-type RSG candidates. This preliminary analysis paves the way for more extensive research with Gaia DR4 when larger spectral datasets are expected to significantly enhance our understanding of Galactic RSG populations.</description>

      <title>A Search for Radio Millisecond Pulsar Companions around Extremely Low-mass White Dwarfs with Ellipsoidal Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely low-mass white dwarfs (ELM WDs) are helium-core white dwarfs with masses less than 0.3 $M_{\odot}$. Short-period ELM WD binaries that exhibit ellipsoidal variations may harbor heavier companions, either massive white dwarfs or millisecond pulsars (MSPs). In this study, we selected $\sim$ 12,000 ELM WDs or their candidates, and searched for ellipsoidal-like lightcurves with orbital periods shorter than one day, by using the public data from Zwicky Transient Facility. Finally 23 such systems were found, with 17 being newly discovered. We selected nine high-priority targets likely to evolve from the Roche-lobe overflow channel and estimated their companion masses from the extracted ellipsoidal variation amplitude. Among them, the four targets have companion masses exceeding 1 $M_{\odot}$. We performed a search for radio pulsations from six of these targets by using Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope. However, no convincing radio pulsed signals were found, resulting in upper limits for the radio flux at around 8 $\mu$Jy. Given the non-detection of radio pulsations from a total of 11 similar systems, the fraction of ellipsoidal ELM WDs around MSPs is estimated to be below 15$^{+6}_{-3}$%. We anticipate that multi-wavelength studies of more ellipsoidal-like ELM WDs will further constrain the fraction.</description>

      <title>Superoutbursts and Positive Superhumps are Detected During the Standstill in AT Cnc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The disk instability model suggests that the disk remains in a hot state during standstill. The thermal-tidal instability model posits that superoutbursts require a mass ratio of ( q = M2/M2 &lt; 0.25-0.33). However, this paper presents evidence of superoutbursts and positive superhumps (PSHs) during a standstill of AT Cnc (q &gt; 0.33 ), based on both space- and ground-based photometric data from sky surveys. Notably, the PSHs evolve gradually prior to the onset of a superoutburst, suggesting that an eccentric, prograde-precessing disk forms first, with the superoutburst occurring as the radius of the accretion disk continues to expand. These observations indicate that, during the standstill, the disk radius in AT Cnc not only surpasses the tidal truncation radius and the 3:1 resonance radius, but is still undergoing expansion.Our analysis further reveals that superoutbursts are triggered by oscillations, which appear to be a characteristic feature of special dwarf nova outbursts. Additionally, we observe that special outbursts develop from normal outbursts, implying that certain stages of the disk may not reach a fully hot state during the standstill. Furthermore, the PSH amplitude was found to be correlated with special outbursts, revealing that the localized thermal instability had a significant impact on the evolution of the eccentric disk. These findings provide the first detailed observational evidence of superoutbursts and PSHs occurring during standstill, offering important new insights into the classification of dwarf novae and the underlying mechanisms of outbursts.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics and dissipation in the binary magnetosphere of pre-merger neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate energy release in the interacting magnetospheres of binary neutron stars (BNS) with global 3D force-free electrodynamics simulations. The system's behavior depends on the inclinations $\chi_1$ and $\chi_2$ of the stars' magnetic dipole moments relative to their orbital angular momentum. The simplest aligned configuration ($\chi_1=\chi_2=0^\circ$) has no magnetic field lines connecting the two stars. Remarkably, it still develops separatrix current sheets warping around each star and forms a dissipative region at the interface of the two magnetospheres. Dissipation at the interface is caused by a Kelvin-Helmholtz-type (KH) instability, which generates local Alfv\'enic turbulence and escaping fast magnetosonic waves. Binaries with inclined magnetospheres release energy in two ways: via KH instability at the interface and via magnetic reconnection flares in the twisted flux bundles connecting the two stars. The outgoing compressive waves can develop shocks and source fast radio bursts. We discuss implications for X-ray and radio precursors of BNS mergers.</description>

      <title>Stellar Contamination Correction Using Back-to-Back Transits of TRAPPIST-1 b and c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar surface heterogeneities, such as spots and faculae, often contaminate exoplanet transit spectra, hindering precise atmospheric characterization. We demonstrate a novel, epoch-based, model-independent method to mitigate stellar contamination, applicable to multi-planet systems with at least one airless planet. We apply this method using quasi-simultaneous transits of TRAPPIST-1 b and TRAPPIST-1 c observed on July 9, 2024, with JWST NIRSpec PRISM. These two planets, with nearly identical radii and impact parameters, are likely either bare rocks or possess thin, low-pressure atmospheres, making them ideal candidates for this technique, as variations in their transit spectra would be primarily attributed to stellar activity. Our observations reveal their transit spectra exhibit consistent features, indicating similar levels of stellar contamination. We use TRAPPIST-1 b to correct the transit spectrum of TRAPPIST-1 c, achieving a 2.5x reduction in stellar contamination at shorter wavelengths. At longer wavelengths, lower SNR prevents clear detection of contamination or full assessment of mitigation. Still, out-of-transit analysis reveals variations across the spectrum, suggesting contamination extends into the longer wavelengths. Based on the success of the correction at shorter wavelengths, we argue that contamination is also reduced at longer wavelengths to a similar extent. This shifts the challenge of detecting atmospheric features to a predominantly white noise issue, which can be addressed by stacking observations. This method enables epoch-specific stellar contamination corrections, allowing co-addition of planetary spectra for reliable searches of secondary atmospheres with signals of 60-250 ppm. Additionally, we identify small-scale cold (2000 K) and warm (2600 K) regions almost uniformly distributed on TRAPPIST-1, with overall covering fractions varying by 0.1% per hour.</description>

      <title>Ion-Scale Solitary Structures in the Solar Wind Observed by Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a class of ion-scale magnetic solitary structures in the solar wind, characterized by distinct magnetic field enhancements and bipolar rotations over spatial scales of several proton inertial lengths. Previously tentatively identified as Alfv\'enic solitons, these structures are revisited using high-resolution data from the Solar Orbiter and Parker Solar Probe missions. Using a machine learning-based method, we identified nearly a thousand such structures, providing new insights into their evolution and physical properties. Statistical analysis shows that these structures are more abundant closer to the Sun, with occurrence rates peaking around 30-40 solar radii and declining at greater distances, suggesting that they decay. High-cadence measurements reveal that these structures are predominantly found in low-beta environments, with consistent fluctuations in density, velocity, and magnetic field. Magnetic field enhancements are often accompanied by plasma density drops, which, under near pressure balance, limit field increases. This leads to small fractional field enhancements near the Sun (approximately 0.01 at 20 solar radii), making detection challenging. Magnetic field variance analysis indicates that these structures are primarily oblique to the local magnetic field. Alfv\'enic velocity-magnetic field correlations suggest that most of these structures propagate sunward in the plasma frame, distinguishing them from typical solar wind fluctuations. We compare these findings with previous studies, discussing possible generation mechanisms and their implications for the turbulent cascade in the near-Sun Alfv\'enic solar wind. Further high-resolution observations and simulations are needed to fully understand their origins and impacts.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Evolutionary Fits for Jupiter and Saturn Incorporating Fuzzy Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the recent realization that there likely are stably-stratified regions in the interiors of both Jupiter and Saturn, we construct new non-adiabatic, inhomogeneous evolutionary models with the same microphysics for each that result at the present time in respectable fits for all major bulk observables for both planets. These include the effective temperature, radius, atmospheric heavy-element and helium abundances (including helium rain), and the lower-order gravity moments J2 and J4. The models preserve from birth most of an extended "fuzzy" heavy-element core. Our predicted atmospheric helium mass fraction for Saturn is ~0.2, close to some measured estimates, but in disagreement with some published predictions. To preserve a fuzzy core from birth, the interiors of both planets must start out at lower entropies than would be used for traditional "hot start" adiabatic models, though the initial exterior mantle entropies can range from hot to warm start values. We do not see a helium ocean in Saturn's interior, and both models have inner envelopes with significant Brunt-Vaisala frequencies; this region for Saturn at the current epoch is more extended and in it, the Brunt is larger. The total heavy-element mass fraction in Jupiter and in Saturn is determined to be ~14% and ~26%, respectively, though there is some play in these determinations.</description>

      <title>Magnetic helicity fluxes in dynamos from rotating inhomogeneous turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze direct numerical simulations of large-scale dynamos in inhomogeneous nonhelically-driven rotating turbulence with and without shear. The forcing is modulated so that the turbulent intensity peaks in the middle of the computational box and drops to nearly zero at the two ends above and below the midplane. A large-scale dynamo is driven by an $\alpha$ effect of opposite signs between the two hemispheres. In the presence of shear, the hemispheric magnetic helicity flux from small-scale fields becomes important and can even overcompensate for the magnetic helicity transferred by the $\alpha$ effect between large and small scales. This effect has not previously been observed in non-shearing simulations. Our numerical simulations show that the hemispheric magnetic helicity fluxes are nearly independent of the magnetic Reynolds number, but those between large and small scales, and the consequent dynamo effect, are still found to decrease with increasing Reynolds number -- just like in nonshearing dynamos. However, in contrast to nonshearing dynamos, where the generated mean magnetic field declines with increasing magnetic Reynolds number, it is now found to remain independent of it. This suggests that catastrophic dynamo quenching is alleviated by the shear-induced hemispheric small-scale magnetic helicity fluxes that can even overcompensate the fluxes between large and small scales and thereby cause resistive contributions.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Three: Magnetic Fields along the Orion Integral-Shaped Filament as Revealed by JCMT BISTRO survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of the BISTRO survey, we present JCMT 850 $\mu$m polarimetric observations towards the Orion Integral-Shaped Filament (ISF) that covers three portions known as OMC-1, OMC-2, and OMC-3. The magnetic field threading the ISF seen in the JCMT POL-2 map appears as a tale of three: pinched for OMC-1, twisted for OMC-2, and nearly uniform for OMC-3. A multi-scale analysis shows that the magnetic field structure in OMC-3 is very consistent at all the scales, whereas the field structure in OMC-2 shows no correlation across different scales. In OMC-1, the field retains its mean orientation from large to small scales, but shows some deviations at small scales. Histograms of relative orientations between the magnetic field and filaments reveal a bimodal distribution for OMC-1, a relatively random distribution for OMC-2, and a distribution with a predominant peak at 90$^\circ$ for OMC-3. Furthermore, the magnetic fields in OMC-1 and OMC-3 both appear to be aligned perpendicular to the fibers, which are denser structures within the filament, but the field in OMC-2 is aligned along with the fibers. All these suggest that gravity, turbulence, and magnetic field are each playing a leading role in OMC-1, 2, and 3, respectively. While OMC-2 and 3 have almost the same gas mass, density, and non-thermal velocity dispersion, there are on average younger and fewer young stellar objects in OMC-3, providing evidence that a stronger magnetic field will induce slower and less efficient star formation in molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Numerical viscosity and resistivity in MHD turbulence simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) turbulence simulations require understanding numerical dissipation. We quantify numerical viscosity and resistivity in subsonic (M=0.1) and supersonic (M=10) turbulence regimes. The hydrodynamic (Re) and magnetic Reynolds numbers (Rm) on the turbulence driving scale l_turb in a cubic domain of side length L with N^3 resolution elements are well-described by Re=[2(N/N_Re)(l_turb/L)]^p_Re and Rm=[2(N/N_Rm)(l_turb/L)]^p_Rm. We provide two sets of fit values of (N_Re,p_Re,N_Rm,p_Rm): one with p_Re &amp; p_Rm fixed at their theoretical values, and the other one allowing all 4 parameters to vary. The sets for M=0.1 are (1.57_{-0.12}^{+0.10},4/3,1.55_{-0.14}^{+0.45},4/3) and (0.83_{-0.08}^{+0.09},1.20_{-0.02}^{+0.02},4.19_{-4.05}^{+2.95},1.60_{-0.33}^{+0.18}), respectively. For M=10, they are (3.55_{-0.56}^{+0.78},3/2,1.03_{-0.11}^{+0.12},3/2) and (10.46_{-0.85}^{+0.96},1.90_{-0.04}^{+0.04},0.44_{-0.23}^{+0.61},1.32_{-0.09}^{+0.17}). The resulting magnetic Prandtl numbers (Pm=Rm/Re) are consistent with constant values of 1.0_{-0.2}^{+0.3} for M=0.1, and 6.2_{-4.8}^{+5.6} for M=10. These apply when the magnetic energy (E_mag) is &lt;10% of the kinetic energy (E_kin). When E_mag/E_kin~0.1-1, Rm is reduced by a factor~3 (increase in N_Rm by a factor~2) for M=0.1, while Rm for M=10 and Re (for any M) remain largely unaffected. We compare our Re-N relation with 14 other simulations from the literature, employing various numerical methods (with &amp; without Riemann solvers, different reconstruction schemes &amp; orders, and smoothed particle hydrodynamics), and find agreement within a factor of 3. Additionally, we compare these results to target Re and Rm values from simulations with explicit dissipation. These comparisons and our relations help users determine the Re and Rm achievable at a given N, ensuring physical dissipation dominates over numerical dissipation.</description>

      <title>Searching for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes early inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The early inspiral from stellar-mass binary black holes can emit milli-Hertz gravitational wave signals, making them detectable sources for space-borne gravitational wave missions like TianQin. However, the traditional matched filtering technique poses a significant challenge for analyzing this kind of signals, as it requires an impractically high number of templates ranging from $10^{31}$ to $10^{40}$. We propose a search strategy that involves two main parts: initially, we reduce the dimensionality of the simulated signals using incremental principal component analysis (IPCA). Subsequently we train the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on the compressed TianQin data obtained from IPCA, aiming to develop both a detection model and a point parameter estimation model. The compression efficiency for the trained IPCA model achieves a cumulative variance ratio of 95.6% when applied to $10^6$ simulated signals. To evaluate the performance of CNN we generate the receiver operating characteristic curve for the detection model which is applied to the test data with varying signal-to-noise ratios. At a false alarm probability of 5% the corresponding true alarm probability for signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 is 86.5%. Subsequently, we introduce the point estimation model to evaluate the value of the chirp mass of corresponding sBBH signals with an error. For signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50, the trained point estimation CNN model can estimate the chirp mass of most test events, with a standard deviation error of 2.48 $M_{\odot}$ and a relative error precision of 0.12.</description>

      <title>Local two-dimensional simulations of the ignition of a helium shell detonation on a white dwarf by an impacting stream</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The double detonation model is one of the prevalent explosion mechanisms of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) wherein an outer helium shell detonation triggers a core detonation in the white dwarf (WD). The dynamically driven double degenerate double detonation (D6) is the double detonation of the more massive WD in a binary WD system where the localized impact of the mass transfer stream from the companion sets off the initial helium shell detonation. To have high numerical resolution and control over the stream parameters, we have implemented a study of the local interaction of the stream with the WD surface in 2D. In cases with lower base density of the shell, the stream's impact can cause surface detonation soon after first impact. With higher base densities, after the stream hits the surface, hot material flows around the star and interacts with the incoming stream to produce a denser and narrower impact. Our results therefore show that (1) a directly impacting stream for both a relatively high resolution and for a range of stream parameters can produce a surface detonation, (2) thinner helium shells ignite more promptly via impact, doing so sooner, and (3) there are lower limits on ignition in both shell density and incoming stream speed with lower limits on density being well below those shown by other work to be required for normal appearing SN Ia. This supports stream ignition and therefore the D6 scenario, as a viable mechanism for normal SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>Solar energetic particles injected inside and outside a magnetic cloud: The widespread solar energetic particle event on 2022 January 20</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04564v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. On 2022 January 20, the Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) on board Solar Orbiter measured a solar energetic particle (SEP) event showing unusual first arriving particles from the anti-Sun direction. Near-Earth spacecraft separated 17{\deg} in longitude to the west from Solar Orbiter measured classic antisunward-directed fluxes. STEREO-A and MAVEN, separated 18{\deg} to the east and 143{\deg} to the west from Solar Orbiter respectively, also observed the event, suggesting that particles spread over at least 160{\deg} in the heliosphere.
  Results. Solar Orbiter was embedded in a MC erupting on 16 January from the same active region as that related to the SEP event on 20 January. The SEP event is related to a M5.5 flare and a fast CME-driven shock of 1433 km/s, which injected particles within and outside the MC. Taken together, the hard SEP spectra, the presence of a Type II radio burst, and the co-temporal Type III radio burst being observed from 80 MHz that appears to emanate from the Type II burst, suggest that the shock is likely the main accelerator of the particles.
  Conclusions. Our detailed analysis of the SEP event strongly suggests that the energetic particles are mainly accelerated by a CME-driven shock and are injected into and outside of a previous MC present in the heliosphere at the time of the particle onset. The sunward-propagating SEPs measured by Solar Orbiter are produced by the injection of particles along the longer (western) leg of the MC still connected to the Sun at the time of the release of the particles. The determined electron propagation path length inside the MC is around 30% longer than the estimated length of the loop leg of the MC itself (based on the graduated cylindrical shell model), which is consistent with the low number of field line rotations.</description>

      <title>Planets Around Solar Twins/Analogs (PASTA) I.: High precision stellar chemical abundance for 17 planet-hosting stars and the condensation temperature trend</title>

Abstract: The Sun is depleted in refractory elements compared to nearby solar twins, which may be linked to the formation of giant or terrestrial planets. Here we present high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopic data for 17 solar-like stars hosting planets, obtained with Magellan II/MIKE, to investigate whether this depletion is related to planet formation. We derive stellar parameters, including stellar atmosphere, age, radius, mass, and chemical abundances for 22 elements from carbon to europium through line-by-line differential analysis. Our uncertainties range from 0.01 dex for Fe and Si to 0.08 dex for Sr, Y, and Eu. By comparing the solar abundances to those of the 17 stars, we investigate the differential abundance ([X/Fe]$_{\rm solar}$ - [X/Fe]$_{\rm star}$) versus condensation temperature ($T_c$) trend. In particular, we apply Galactic chemical evolution corrections to five solar twins within the full sample. Our results conform to previous studies that the Sun is relatively depleted in refractory compared to volatile elements. For both five solar twins and the rest of solar-like stars, we find that all stars hosting known gas giant planets exhibit negative $T_c$ trend slopes, suggesting that the Sun is relatively depleted in refractory elements compared to similar giant-planet-host stars. Additionally, we find no correlation between $T_c$ trend slopes and the total mass of detected terrestrial planets in each system, suggesting that terrestrial planet formation may not be the cause of refractory element depletion in the Sun.</description>

      <title>Fast optical variability in Supergiant X-ray binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to investigate the fast photometric variability of the optical counterparts to supergiant X-ray binaries and to compare the general patterns of such variability with the Galactic population of other early-type stars. We analyzed a sample of 14 high-mass X-ray binaries with supergiant companions observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and 4 Be/X-ray binaries with persistent X-ray emission for comparison. All sources exhibit fast aperiodic light variations. The shape of the periodogram is well described by a red noise component at intermediate frequencies ($\sim 1-10$ d$^{-1}$). At lower frequencies the noise level flattens while at higher frequencies the periodogram is dominated by white noise. We find that the patterns of variability of the massive companions in supergiant X-ray binaries agree with that of single early-type evolved stars in terms of the general shape of the periodograms. However, they exhibit higher amplitude at low frequencies and lower characteristic frequencies than Be/X-ray binaries. Unlike Be/X-ray binaries, supergiant X-ray binaries exhibit a total lack of coherent signals at high frequencies. Most sources have been analyzed over multiple TESS sectors, spanning a duration of 4 years. We do not find any significant variation over time in the low-frequency variability characteristics. This study reveals that stochastic low-frequency variability is a very common, if not ubiquitous, feature intrinsic to supergiant optical companions in X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Fast-moving electrostatic solitons in a plasma with turbulence heating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.06681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, it is shown that electrostatic solitons in a plasma with turbulent heating of the electrons through an accelerating electric field can form with very high velocities, reaching up to several order of magnitudes larger than the equilibrium ion-sound speed. The possible parameter regime, where this work may be relevant, can be found in the so-called "dead zones" of a protoplanetary disk. Though these zones are stable to magnetorotational instability, the resultant turbulence can in fact heat the electrons making them follow a highly non- Maxwellian velocity distribution. We show that these fast-moving solitons can reach very high velocities. With electron velocity distribution described by the Davydov distribution function, we argue that these solitons can be an effective mechanism for energy equilibration in such a situation through soliton decay and radiation.</description>

      <title>Cleaning WASP-33 b transits from the host star photometric variability: analysis of TESS data from two sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13422v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on TESS observations of a $\delta$~Scuti variable WASP-33 obtained in 2019 and 2022, we thoroughly investigate the power spectrum of this target photometric flux and construct a statistically exhaustive model for its variability. This model contains $30$ robustly justified harmonics detected in the both TESS sectors simultaneously, $13$ less robust harmonics detected in a single TESS sector, a red noise and a quasiperiodic noise terms. This allowed us to greatly improve the accuracy of the exoplanet WASP-33\,\emph{b} transit timings, reducing the TTV residuals r.m.s. drastically, by a factor of $3.5$, from $63$~s to $18$~s. Finally, our analysis does not confirm existence of a detectable orbital phase variation claimed previously based on WASP-33 TESS photometry of 2019.</description>

      <title>Non-relativistic neutrinos and the question of Dirac vs. Majorana neutrino nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11940v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding out if neutrinos are Dirac or Majorana particles is known to be extremely difficult. This is generally believed to be due to the smallness of the neutrino mass compared to typical neutrino energies, and to the fact that in the limit of vanishing mass all distinctions between Dirac and Majorana neutrinos disappear. This, however, does not necessarily mean that for non-relativistic neutrinos distinguishing between them is an easy task. We consider this problem in detail. The issues discussed include the possibilities of studying neutrino nature with non-relativistic neutrinos produced in $\beta$ decay in direct neutrino mass measurement experiments, with relic neutrinos, as well as with slow neutrinos in pair production processes and in scattering, both elastic and inelastic. We also discuss processes allowed for only one of the two neutrino types as a means of uncovering neutrino nature.</description>

      <title>C3PO III: On the Lithium Signatures Following Planet Engulfment by Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planet engulfment has been identified as one of the mechanisms for enhancing lithium abundance in stars. However, comprehensive investigations into lithium signatures following such events remain limited. Stars born together, sharing a common origin and stellar characteristics, provide a unique opportunity to study these signatures and compare lithium abundances. We demonstrate that the distinctive signature of planet engulfment in lithium abundance is only discernible among highly similar stellar twins. We present lithium abundance measurements for 125 co-moving pairs of stars, representing the largest sample to date with a single, homogeneous assessment of high-precision lithium abundance. While lithium abundance enhancements in pairs showing planet engulfment signatures are within 0.35 dex, we find that even at fixed stellar parameters (temperature and age), the intrinsic scatter in lithium abundance is typically 0.35 dex for G/F dwarfs and can be as large as 0.6 dex for older and cooler stars due to internal stellar evolution processes. Since the planet engulfment signature from lithium can be masked by stellar intrinsic scatter, our findings raise questions about relying solely on lithium as an indicator for planet engulfment or attributing lithium-richness in stars primarily to planet engulfment events.</description>

      <title>Physics-driven Explosions of Stripped High-Mass Stars: Synthetic Light Curves and Spectra of Stripped-Envelope Supernovae with Broad Lightcurves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11000v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) represent a significant fraction of core-collapse supernovae, arising from massive stars that have shed their hydrogen and, in some cases, helium envelopes. The origins and explosion mechanisms of SESNe remain a topic of active investigation. In this work, we employ radiative-transfer simulations to model the light curves and spectra of a set of explosions of single, solar-metallicity, massive Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars with ejecta masses ranging from 4 to 11 Msun, that were computed from a turbulence-aided and neutrino-driven explosion mechanism. We analyze these synthetic observables to explore the impact of varying ejecta mass and helium content on observable features. We find that the light curve shape of these progenitors with high ejecta masses is consistent with observed SESNe with broad light curves but not the peak luminosities. The commonly used analytic formula based on rising bolometric light curves overestimates the ejecta mass of these high-initial-mass progenitor explosions by a factor up to 2.6. In contrast, the calibrated method by Haynie et al., which relies on late-time decay tails, reduces uncertainties to an average of 20% within the calibrated ejecta mass range.Spectroscopically, the He I 1.083 um line remains prominent even in models with as little as 0.02 Msun of helium. However, the strength of the optical He I lines is not directly proportional to the helium mass but instead depends on a complex interplay of factors such as 56Ni distribution, composition, and radiation field. Thus, producing realistic helium features requires detailed radiative transfer simulations for each new hydrodynamic model.</description>

      <title>Small and Close-In Planets are Uncommon Around A-type Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kepler and K2 missions enabled robust calculations of planet occurrence rates around FGKM-type stars. However, these missions observed too few stars with earlier spectral types to tightly constrain the occurrence rates of planets orbiting hotter stars. Using TESS, we calculate the occurrence rate of small ($1 \, R_\oplus &lt; R_{\rm p} &lt; 8 \, R_\oplus$), close-in ($P_{\rm orb} &lt; 10$ days) planets orbiting A-type stars for the first time. We search a sample of 20,257 bright ($6 &lt; T &lt; 10$) A-type stars for transiting planets using a custom pipeline and vet the detected signals, finding no reliable small planets. We characterize the pipeline completeness using injection/recovery tests and determine the $3\sigma$ upper limits of the occurrence rates of close-in sub-Saturns ($4 \, R_\oplus &lt; R_{\rm p} &lt; 8 \, R_\oplus$), sub-Neptunes ($2 \, R_\oplus &lt; R_{\rm p} &lt; 4 \, R_\oplus$), and super-Earths ($1 \, R_\oplus &lt; R_{\rm p} &lt; 2 \, R_\oplus$). We find upper limits of $2.2 \pm 0.4$ sub-Saturns and $9.1 \pm 1.8$ sub-Neptunes per 1000 A-type stars, which may be more than $3\times$ and $6\times$ lower than Kepler-era estimates for Sun-like stars. We calculate an upper limit of $186 \pm 34$ super-Earths per 1000 A-type stars, which may be more than $1.5\times$ lower than that for M dwarfs. Our results hint that small, close-in planets become rarer around early-type stars and that their occurrence rates decrease faster than that of hot Jupiters with increasing host star temperature. We discuss plausible explanations for these trends, including star-disk interactions and enhanced photoevaporation of planet atmospheres.</description>

      <title>PDS 70b Shows Stellar-like Carbon-to-oxygen Ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\sim$5 Myr PDS 70 is the only known system with protoplanets residing in the cavity of the circumstellar disk from which they formed, ideal for studying exoplanet formation and evolution within its natal environment. Here we report the first spin constraint and C/O measurement of PDS 70b from Keck/KPIC high-resolution spectroscopy. We detected CO (3.8 $\sigma$) and H$_2$O (3.5 $\sigma$) molecules in the PDS 70b atmosphere via cross-correlation, with a combined CO and H$_2$O template detection significance of 4.2 $\sigma$. Our forward model fits, using BT-Settl model grids, provide an upper limit for the spin-rate of PDS 70b ($&lt;$29 km s$^{-1}$). The atmospheric retrievals constrain the PDS 70b C/O ratio to ${0.28}^{+0.20}_{-0.12}$ ($&lt;$0.63 under 95$\%$ confidence level) and a metallicity [C/H] of ${-0.2}^{+0.8}_{-0.5}$ dex, consistent with that of its host star. The following scenarios can explain our measured C/O of PDS 70b in contrast with that of the gas-rich outer disk (for which C/O $\gtrsim$ 1). First, the bulk composition of PDS 70b might be dominated by dust+ice aggregates rather than disk gas. Another possible explanation is that the disk became carbon-enriched $\textit{after}$ PDS 70b was formed, as predicted in models of disk chemical evolution and as observed in both very low mass star and older disk systems with $\textit{JWST}$/MIRI. Because PDS 70b continues to accrete and its chemical evolution is not yet complete, more sophisticated modeling of the planet and the disk, and higher quality observations of PDS 70b (and possibly PDS 70c), are necessary to validate these scenarios.</description>

      <title>A possible misaligned orbit for the young planet AU Mic c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The AU Microscopii planetary system is only 24 Myr old, and its geometry may provide clues about the early dynamical history of planetary systems. Here, we present the first measurement of the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for the warm sub-Neptune AU Mic c, using two transits observed simultaneously with the European Southern Observatory's (ESO's) Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Echelle SPectrograph for Rocky Exoplanets and Stable Spectroscopic Observations (ESPRESSO), CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS), and Next-Generation Transit Survey (NGTS). After correcting for flares and for the magnetic activity of the host star, and accounting for transit-timing variations, we find the sky-projected spin-orbit angle of planet c to be in the range $\lambda_c=67.8_{-49.0}^{+31.7}$\,degrees (1-$\sigma$). We examine the possibility that planet c is misaligned with respect to the orbit of the inner planet b ($\lambda_b=-2.96_{-10.30}^{+10.44}$\,degrees), and the equatorial plane of the host star, and discuss scenarios that could explain both this and the planet's high density, including secular interactions with other bodies in the system or a giant impact. We note that a significantly misaligned orbit for planet c is in some degree of tension with the dynamical stability of the system, and with the fact that we see both planets in transit, though these arguments alone do not preclude such an orbit. Further observations would be highly desirable to constrain the spin-orbit angle of planet c more precisely.</description>
