      <title>Openness with respect to levels in triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compactly generated triangulated category $\mathcal{T}$ equipped with an action of a graded-commutative Noetherian ring $R$, generalizing results of Letz, we prove a general result concerning the openness with respect to levels of compact objects in $\mathcal{T}$. Applications are given to derived categories of commutative Noetherian rings, derived categories of commutative Noetherian DG rings and singularity categories.</description>

      <title>Secants, Socles and Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The projective space of symmetric tensors of degree d can be reinterpreted as a projective space of finite, graded Gorenstein rings with socle in degree d. Via a pair of explicit stability conditions (one for even values of d and one for odd values), the space of symmetric tensors is partitioned by Harder-Narasimhan filtration type. This is worked out explicitly for low degree examples in dimension three (the projective plane) and compared with the betti tables of the Gorenstein rings.</description>

      <title>Solenoids in automorphism groups of evolution algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let A be an evolution algebra (possibly infinite-dimensional) equipped with a fixed natural basis B, and let E be the associated graph defined by Elduque and Labra. We describe the group of automorphisms of A that are diagonalizable with respect to B. This group arises as the inverse limit of a functor (a diagram) from the category associated with the graph E to the category of groups. In certain cases, this group can be realized as a dyadic solenoid. Additionally, we investigate the automorphisms that permute (and possibly scale) the elements of B. In particular, for algebras satisfying the 2LI condition, we provide a complete description of their automorphism group.</description>

      <title>On the projective dimension of tensor products of modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider finitely generated modules over commutative Noetherian rings whose tensor products have finite projective dimension. We construct examples of modules of infinite projective dimension (and also of infinite Gorenstein dimension) whose tensor products nonetheless have finite projective dimension. Furthermore, we establish nontrivial conditions under which such examples cannot arise. For example, we prove that if the tensor product of two nonzero modules--at least one of which is totally reflexive--has finite projective dimension, then both modules in question must have finite projective dimension.</description>

      <title>A Uniform Identification of Stable Sheaf Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers generalizations of certain arithmetic complexes appearing in the work of Raicu and VandeBogert in connection with the study of stable sheaf cohomology on flag varieties. Defined over the ring of integer valued polynomials, we prove an isomorphism of these complexes as conjectured by Gao, Raicu, and VandeBogert. In particular, this shows that a previously made identification between the stable sheaf cohomology of hook and two column partition Schur functors applied to the cotangent sheaf of projective space can be made to be uniform with respect to these complexes. These results are extended to the projective space defined over the integers.</description>

      <title>On Betti numbers for symmetric powers of modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a finitely generated module over a local ring $(R,\mathfrak{m})$. By $\mathcal{S}_j(M)$, we denote the $j$th symmetric power of $M$ ($j$th graded component of the symmetric algebra $\mathcal{S}_R(M)$). The purpose of this paper is to investigate the minimal free resolutions $\mathcal{S}_j(M)$ as $R$-module for each $j\geq 2$ and determine the Betti numbers of $\mathcal{S}_j(M)$ in terms of the Betti numbers of $M$. This has some applications, for example for linear type ideals $I$, we obtain formulas of the Betti numbers $I^j$ in terms of the Betti numbers of $I$. In addition, we establish upper and lower bounds of Betti numbers of $\mathcal{S}_j(M)$ in terms of Betti numbers of $M$. In particular, obtain some applications of the famous Buchsbaum-Eisenbud-Horrocks conjecture.</description>

      <title>On Abelian extensions in mixed characteristic and ramification in codimension one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04972v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theorem of Paul Roberts states that the integral closure of a regular local ring in a generically abelian extension is Cohen-Macaulay, provided the characteristic of the residue field does not divide the order of the Galois group. An example of Koh shows the conclusion is false in the modular case. After a modification to the statement concerning ramification over $p$ in codimension one, we give an extension of Roberts's theorem to the modular case for unramified regular local rings in mixed characteristic when the $p$-torsion of the Galois group is annihilated by $p$.</description>

      <title>Bigraded Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and Gr\"obner bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the relation between the bigraded Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of a bihomogeneous ideal $I$ in the coordinate ring of the product of two projective spaces and the bidegrees of a Gr\"obner basis of $I$ with respect to the degree reverse lexicographical monomial order in generic coordinates. For the single-graded case, Bayer and Stillman unraveled all aspects of this relationship forty years ago and these results led to complexity estimates for computations with Gr\"obner bases. We build on this work to introduce a bounding region of the bidegrees of minimal generators of bihomogeneous Gr\"obner bases for $I$. We also use this region to certify the presence of some minimal generators close to its boundary. Finally, we show that, up to a certain shift, this region is related to the bigraded Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of $I$.</description>

      <title>Free modules with isomorphic duals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let M,N be free modules over a Noetherian commutative ring R and let F be a field whose cardinality card(F) does not exceed the continuum. We prove the following :
  1) The assertion that [Any two F-vector spaces with isomorphic duals are isomorphic] is equivallent to the ICF (Injective continuum function) hypothesis and it is a non-decidable statement in ZFC.
  2) If the dual of M is a projective R-module and rank(M) is infinite then the ring R is Artinian.
  3) If R is Artinian and card(R) does not exceed the continuum then the the dual of M is free.
  4) If M,N have isomorphic duals then they are themselves isomorphic, when R is a non-Artinian ring that is either Hilbert or countable.
  5) If R is a non-local domain then R is a half-slender ring.
  6) If R is Artinian ring and its cardinality card(R) does not exceed the continuum then the assertion that [any two free R-modules with isomorphic duals are isomorphic] is non-decidable in ZFC.
  7) If R is a domain and rank(M) is infinite then the Goldie dimension of the dual of M is equal to its cardinality .
  8) If R is a complex affine algebra whose corresponding affine variety has no isolated points then [any two projective R-modules with isomorphic duals are themselves isomorphic].
  9) Let V be an F-vector space of infinite dimension. The dimension of its dual is equal to the cardinality of the powerset of the dimension of V.
  We also prove that if the powersets of two given sets have equal cardinalities then there is a bijection from the one powerset to the other that preserves the symmetric difference of sets.</description>

      <title>Multiplicities of weakly graded families of ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04831v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the notion of multiplicity for weakly graded families of ideals which are bounded below linearly. In particular, we show that the limit $e_W(\mathfrak{I}):=\lim\limits_{n\to\infty}d!\frac{\ell_R(R/I_n)}{n^d}$ exists where $\mathfrak I=\{I_n\}$ is a bounded below linearly weakly graded families of ideals in a Noetherian local ring $(R,\mathfrak m)$ of dimension $d\geq 1$ with $\dim(N(\hat{R}))&lt;d$. Furthermore, we prove that ``volume=multiplicity" formula and Minkowski inequality hold for such families of ideals. We explore some properties of $e_W(\mathfrak J)$ for weakly graded families of ideals of the form $\mathfrak J=\{(I_n:K)\}$ where $\{I_n\}$ is an $\mathfrak m$-primary graded family of ideals. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for the equality in Minkowski inequality for the weakly graded family of ideals of the form $\mathfrak J=\{(I_n:K)\}$ where $\{I_n\}$ is a bounded filtration. Moreover, we generalize a result of Rees characterizing the inclusion of ideals with the same multiplicities for the above families of ideals. Finally, we investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the length function $\ell_R(H_{\mathfrak m}^0(R/(I_n:K)))$ where $\{I_n\}$ is a filtration of ideals (not necessarily $\mathfrak m$-primary).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explicitly construct a minimal free resolution of the cover ideals of clique-whiskered graphs. In particular, Cohen--Macaulay chordal graphs, clique corona graphs, and Cohen--Macaulay Cameron--Walker graphs are examples of clique-whiskered graphs. We also introduce multi-clique-whiskered graphs as a generalization of both clique-whiskered graphs and multi-whisker graphs. We prove that multi-clique-whiskered graphs are vertex decomposable and hence sequentially Cohen--Macaulay. Moreover, we provide formulas for the projective dimension and the Castelnuovo--Mumford regularity of their edge ideals. Finally, we construct minimal free resolutions of the cover ideals of both multi-clique-whiskered graphs and very well-covered graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17537v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize adjoint ideal sheaves via ultraproducts and, utilizing this characterization, study their behavior under pure morphisms. In particular, given a pure morphism $f:Y \to X$ between normal quasi-projective complex varieties, a reduced divisor $D$ and an effective $\mathbb{Q}$-Weil divisor $\Gamma$ on $X$ without common components, we have the following result: if the cycle-theoretic pullback $E:=f^{\natural}D$ is reduced and $(Y, E+f^*\Gamma)$ is of plt type along $E$, then $(X, D+\Gamma)$ is of plt type along $D$. This provides an affirmative answer to a question posed by Z. Zhuang.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05024v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the notion of chain algebra, originally defined in \cite{GN} for finite distributive lattices, to that of finite pure posets. We show this algebra corresponds to the Ehrhart ring of a (0,1)-polytope, termed the chain polytope, and characterize the indecomposability of this polytope. Furthermore, we prove the normality of the chain algebra, describe its canonical module, and extend one of main results from \cite{GN} by computing its Krull dimension. For width-2 pure posets, we determine the algebra's regularity and conditions for it to be Gorenstein or nearly Gorenstein.</description>

Abstract: We prove an unexpected general relation between the Jacobian syzygies of a projective hypersurface $V\subset \mathbb{P}^n$ with only isolated singularities and the nature of its singularities. This allows to establish a new method for the identification of quasi-homogeneous hypersurface isolated singularities. The result gives an insight on how the geometry is reflected in the Jacobian syzygies and extends previous results of the first, second and last author for free and nearly free plane curves [1].</description>
