      <title>Masked Autoencoder with Swin Transformer Network for Mitigating Electrode Shift in HD-EMG-based Gesture Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-channel surface Electromyography (sEMG), also referred to as high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG), plays a crucial role in improving gesture recognition performance for myoelectric control. Pattern recognition models developed based on HD-sEMG, however, are vulnerable to changing recording conditions (e.g., signal variability due to electrode shift). This has resulted in significant degradation in performance across subjects, and sessions. In this context, the paper proposes the Masked Autoencoder with Swin Transformer (MAST) framework, where training is performed on a masked subset of HDsEMG channels. A combination of four masking strategies, i.e., random block masking; temporal masking; sensor-wise random masking, and; multi-scale masking, is used to learn latent representations and increase robustness against electrode shift. The masked data is then passed through MAST's three-path encoder-decoder structure, leveraging a multi-path Swin-Unet architecture that simultaneously captures time-domain, frequency-domain, and magnitude-based features of the underlying HD-sEMG signal. These augmented inputs are then used in a self-supervised pre-training fashion to improve the model's generalization capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MAST framework in comparison to its counterparts.</description>

      <title>Radio Map Prediction from Aerial Images and Application to Coverage Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, several studies have explored deep learning algorithms to predict large-scale signal fading, or path loss, in urban communication networks. The goal is to replace costly measurement campaigns, inaccurate statistical models, or computationally expensive ray-tracing simulations with machine learning models that deliver quick and accurate predictions. We focus on predicting path loss radio maps using convolutional neural networks, leveraging aerial images alone or in combination with supplementary height information. Notably, our approach does not rely on explicit classification of environmental objects, which is often unavailable for most locations worldwide. While the prediction of radio maps using complete 3D environmental data is well-studied, the use of only aerial images remains under-explored. We address this gap by showing that state-of-the-art models developed for existing radio map datasets can be effectively adapted to this task, achieving strong performance. Additionally, we introduce a new model that slightly exceeds the performance of the present state-of-the-art with reduced complexity. The trained models are differentiable, and therefore they can be incorporated in various network optimization algorithms. While an extensive discussion is beyond this paper's scope, we demonstrate this through an example optimizing the directivity of base stations in cellular networks via backpropagation to enhance coverage.</description>

      <title>EEG-DIF: Early Warning of Epileptic Seizures through Generative Diffusion Model-based Multi-channel EEG Signals Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-channel EEG signals are commonly used for the diagnosis and assessment of diseases such as epilepsy. Currently, various EEG diagnostic algorithms based on deep learning have been developed. However, most research efforts focus solely on diagnosing and classifying current signal data but do not consider the prediction of future trends for early warning. Additionally, since multi-channel EEG can be essentially regarded as the spatio-temporal signal data received by detectors at different locations in the brain, how to construct spatio-temporal information representations of EEG signals to facilitate future trend prediction for multi-channel EEG becomes an important problem. This study proposes a multi-signal prediction algorithm based on generative diffusion models (EEG-DIF), which transforms the multi-signal forecasting task into an image completion task, allowing for comprehensive representation and learning of the spatio-temporal correlations and future developmental patterns of multi-channel EEG signals. Here, we employ a publicly available epilepsy EEG dataset to construct and validate the EEG-DIF. The results demonstrate that our method can accurately predict future trends for multi-channel EEG signals simultaneously. Furthermore, the early warning accuracy for epilepsy seizures based on the generated EEG data reaches 0.89. In general, EEG-DIF provides a novel approach for characterizing multi-channel EEG signals and an innovative early warning algorithm for epilepsy seizures, aiding in optimizing and enhancing the clinical diagnosis process. The code is available at https://github.com/JZK00/EEG-DIF.</description>

      <title>Wireless Picosecond Time Synchronization for Distributed Antenna Arrays with Dynamic Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase, time, and frequency coordination are crucial for the coherent operation of distributed antenna arrays. This paper demonstrates a high accuracy decentralized time synchronization method for arrays with dynamic connectivity. To overcome challenges such as alteration in network topology, system scaling, and single- or multiple-node failures, we present a decentralized time synchronization method implementing the average consensus algorithm and two-way time transfer. Our approach supports decentralized time synchronization with picosecond accuracy ($&lt; 13$ ps), unbiased convergence, resilience to node failures, and robustness to other network connection adversities. A time synchronization precision of under 3 ps was achieved for a fully connected frequency syntonized network. The algorithm ensured convergence in time even for a network with only one link connecting two randomly chosen nodes at each iteration; however, the speed of convergence decreased along with the number of connected links. The method is exhibited for a six-node distributed array, by both simulation and experimental implementation using software defined radios.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing MRI Parameters Using a Noncentral Chi Noise Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (qMRI) allows images to be compared across sites and time points, which is particularly important for assessing long-term conditions or for longitudinal studies. The multiparametric mapping (MPM) protocol is used to acquire images with conventional clinical contrasts, namely PD-, T1-, and MT-weighted volumes. Through multi-echo acquisition for each contrast and variations in flip angles between PD- and T1-weighted contrasts, parameter maps, such as proton density (PD), longitudinal relaxation rate (R1), apparent transverse relaxation rate (R2$^*$), and magnetization transfer saturation (MT$_{sat}$), can be estimated. Various algorithms have been employed to estimate these parameters from the acquired volumes. This paper extends an existing maximum a posteriori approach, which uses joint total variation regularization, by transitioning from a Gaussian noise approximation to a more physically plausible model that assumes noncentral chi-distributed noise.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Aided Broadcast Codes with Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning aided codes have been shown to improve code performance in feedback codes in high noise regimes due to the ability to leverage non-linearity in code design. In the additive white Gaussian broadcast channel (AWGN-BC), the addition of feedback may allow the capacity region to extend far beyond the capacity region of the channel without feedback, enabling higher data rates. On the other hand, there are limited deep-learning aided implementations of broadcast codes. In this work, we extend two classes of deep-learning assisted feedback codes to the AWGN-BC channel; the first being an RNN-based architecture and the second being a lightweight MLP-based architecture. Both codes are trained using a global model, and then they are trained using a more realistic vertical federated learning based framework. We first show that in most cases, using an AWGN-BC code outperforms a linear-based concatenated scheme. Second, we show in some regimes, the lightweight architecture far exceeds the RNN-based code, but in especially unreliable conditions, the RNN-based code dominates. The results show the promise of deep-learning aided broadcast codes in unreliable channels, and future research directions are discussed.</description>

      <title>On the Sampling Sparsity of Neuromorphic Analog-to-Spike Conversion based on Leaky Integrate-and-Fire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to the traditional principle of periodic sensing neuromorphic engineering pursues a paradigm shift towards bio-inspired event-based sensing, where events are primarily triggered by a change in the perceived stimulus. We show in a rigorous mathematical way that information encoding by means of Threshold-Based Representation based on either Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) or Send-on-Delta (SOD) is linked to an analog-to-spike conversion that guarantees maximum sparsity while satisfying an approximation condition based on the Alexiewicz norm.</description>

      <title>Urban Outdoor Propagation Measurements and Channel Models at 6.75 GHz FR1(C) and 16.95 GHz FR3 Upper Mid-Band Spectrum for 5G and 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17539v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global allocations in the upper mid-band spectrum (4-24 GHz) necessitate a comprehensive exploration of the propagation behavior to meet the promise of coverage and capacity. This paper presents an extensive Urban Microcell (UMi) outdoor propagation measurement campaign at 6.75 GHz and 16.95 GHz conducted in Downtown Brooklyn, USA, using a 1 GHz bandwidth sliding correlation channel sounder over 40-880 m propagation distance, encompassing 6 Line of Sight (LOS) and 14 Non-Line of Sight (NLOS) locations. Analysis of the path loss (PL) reveals lower directional and omnidirectional PL exponents compared to mmWave and sub-THz frequencies in the UMi environment, using the close-in PL model with a 1 m reference distance. Additionally, a decreasing trend in root mean square (RMS) delay spread (DS) and angular spread (AS) with increasing frequency was observed. The NLOS RMS DS and RMS AS mean values are obtained consistently lower compared to 3GPP model predictions. Point data for all measured statistics at each TX-RX location are provided to supplement the models and results. The spatio-temporal statistics evaluated here offer valuable insights for the design of next-generation wireless systems and networks.</description>

      <title>Performance of orthogonal delay-doppler division multiplexing modulation with imperfect channel estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The orthogonal delay-Doppler division multiplexing (ODDM) modulation is a recently proposed multi-carrier modulation that features a realizable pulse orthogonal with respect to the delay-Doppler (DD) plane's fine resolutions. In this paper, we investigate the performance of ODDM systems with imperfect channel estimation considering three detectors, namely the message passing algorithm (MPA) detector, iterative maximum-ratio combining (MRC) detector, and successive interference cancellation with minimum mean square error (SIC-MMSE) detector. We derive the post-equalization signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for MRC and SIC-MMSE and analyze their bit error rate (BER) performance. Based on this analysis, we propose the MRC with subtractive dither (MRC-SD) and soft SIC-MMSE initialized MRC (SSMI-MRC) detector to improve the BER of iterative MRC. Our results demonstrate that soft SIC-MMSE consistently outperforms the other detectors in BER performance under perfect and imperfect CSI. While MRC exhibits a BER floor above $10^{-5}$, MRC-SD effectively lowers the BER with a negligible increase in detection complexity. SSMI-MRC achieves better BER than hard SIC-MMSE with the same detection complexity order. Additionally, we show that MPA has an error floor and is sensitive to imperfect CSI.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impact of RIS on Cooperative NOMA URLLC Systems: A Theoretical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct a theoretical analysis of how to integrate reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) with cooperative non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), considering URLLC. We consider a downlink two-user cooperative NOMA system employing short-packet communications, where the two users are denoted by the central user (CU) and the cell-edge user (CEU), respectively, and an RIS is deployed to enhance signal quality. Specifically, compared to CEU, CU lies nearer from BS and enjoys the higher channel gains. Closed-form expressions for the CU's average block error rate (BLER) are derived. Furthermore, we evaluate the CEU's BLER performance utilizing selective combining (SC) and derive a tight lower bound under maximum ratio combining (MRC). Simulation results are provided to our analyses and demonstrate that the RIS-assisted system significantly outperforms its counterpart without RIS in terms of BLER. Notably, MRC achieves a squared multiple of the diversity gain of the SC, leading to more reliable performance, especially for the CEU. Furthermore, by dividing the RIS into two zones, each dedicated to a specific user, the average BLER can be further reduced, particularly for the CEU.</description>

      <title>Time-varying Graph Signal Estimation via Dynamic Multi-hop Topologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The assumption of using a static graph to represent multivariate time-varying signals oversimplifies the complexity of modeling their interactions over time. We propose a Dynamic Multi-hop model that captures dynamic interactions among time-varying node signals, while also accounting for time-varying edge signals, by extracting latent edges through topological diffusion and edge pruning. The resulting graphs are time-varying and sparse, capturing key dynamic node interactions and representing signal diffusion to both near and distant neighbors over time. The Dynamic Multi-hop Estimation algorithm is further proposed, accurately representing the interaction dynamics among node signals while enabling adaptive estimation of time-varying multivariate signals spatially and temporally. The Dynamic Multi-hop Estimation is evaluated under two real-world datasets of brain network and stock market for the online estimation of partially observed time-varying signals corrupted by noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes Graph Signal Adaptive Message Passing (GSAMP), a novel message passing method that simultaneously conducts online prediction, missing data imputation, and noise removal on time-varying graph signals. Unlike conventional Graph Signal Processing methods that apply the same filter to the entire graph, the spatiotemporal updates of GSAMP employ a distinct approach that utilizes localized computations at each node. This update is based on an adaptive solution obtained from an optimization problem designed to minimize the discrepancy between observed and estimated values. GSAMP effectively processes real-world, time-varying graph signals under Gaussian and impulsive noise conditions.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Based Meta Learning for Uplink RSMA with Beyond Diagonal RIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has emerged as an innovative and generalized RIS framework that provides greater flexibility in wave manipulation and enhanced coverage. In comparison to conventional RIS, optimization of BD-RIS is more challenging due to the large number of optimization variables associated with it. Typically, optimization of large-scale optimization problems utilizing traditional optimization methods results in high complexity. To tackle this issue, we propose a gradient-based meta learning algorithm which works without pre-training and is able to solve large-scale optimization problems. With the objective to maximize the sum rate of the system, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work considering joint optimization of receiving beamforming vectors at the base station (BS), scattering matrix of BD-RIS and transmission power of users equipment (UEs) in uplink rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) communication. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme can outperform the conventional RIS RSMA framework by 22.5$\%$.</description>

      <title>Ultra-reliable urban air mobility networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, urban air mobility (UAM) has attracted attention as an emerging technology that will bring innovation to urban transportation and aviation systems. Since the UAM systems pursue fully autonomous flight without a pilot, wireless communication is a key function not only for flight control signals, but also for navigation and safety information. The essential information is called a command and control (C2) message, and the UAM networks must be configured so that the UAM can receive the C2 message by securing a continuous link stability without any interruptions. Nevertheless, a lot of prior works have focused only on improving the average performance without solving the low-reliability in the cell edges and coverage holes of urban areas. In this dissertation, we identify the factors that hinder the communication link reliability in considering three-dimensional (3D) urban environments, and propose a antenna configuration, resource utilization, and transmission strategy to enable UAM receiving C2 messages regardless of time and space. First, through stochastic geometry modeling, we analyze the signal blockage effects caused by the urban buildings. The blockage probability is calculated according to the shape, height, and density of the buildings, and the coverage probability of the received signal is derived by reflecting the blockage events. Furthermore, the low-reliability area is identified by analyzing the coverage performance according to the positions of the UAMs. To overcome the low-reliability region, we propose three methods for UAM network operation: i) optimization of antennas elevation tilting, ii) frequency reuse with multi-layered narrow beam, and iii) assistive transmissions by the master UAM.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Spatio-temporal Estimation on the Graph Edges via Line Graph Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00656v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatio-temporal estimation of signals on graph edges is challenging because most conventional Graph Signal Processing techniques are defined on the graph nodes. Leveraging the Line Graph transform, the Line Graph Least Mean Square (LGLMS) algorithm is proposed to conduct adaptive estimation of time-varying edge signals by projecting the edge signals from edge space to node space. LGLMS is an adaptive algorithm analogous to the classical LMS algorithm but applied to graph edges. Unlike edge-specific methods, LGLMS retains all GSP concepts and techniques originally designed for graph nodes, without the need for redefinition on the edges. Experimenting with transportation graphs and meteorological graphs, with the signal observations having noisy and missing values, we confirmed that LGLMS is suitable for the online prediction of time-varying edge signals.</description>

Abstract: The signal processing community is currently witnessing a growing interest in near-field signal processing, driven by the trend towards the use of large aperture arrays with high spatial resolution in the fields of communication, localization, sensing, imaging, etc. From the perspective of localization and sensing, this trend breaks the basic far-field assumptions that have dominated the array signal processing research in the past, presenting new challenges and promising opportunities.</description>

      <title>Receiver Selection and Transmit Beamforming for Multi-static Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks are expected to develop a novel paradigm of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) to enable both the high-accuracy sensing and high-speed communications. However, conventional mono-static ISAC systems, which simultaneously transmit and receive at the same equipment, may suffer from severe self-interference, and thus significantly degrade the system performance.To address this issue, this paper studies a multi-static ISAC system for cooperative target localization and communications, where the transmitter transmits ISAC signal to multiple receivers (REs) deployed at different positions. We derive the closed-form Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) on the joint estimations of both the transmission delay and Doppler shift for cooperative target localization, and the CRB minimization problem is formulated by considering the cooperative cost and communication rate requirements for the REs. To solve this problem, we first decouple it into two subproblems for RE selection and transmit beamforming, respectively. Then, a minimax linkage-based method is proposed to solve the RE selection subproblem, and a successive convex approximation algorithm is adopted to deal with the transmit beamforming subproblem with non-convex constraints. Finally, numerical results validate our analysis and reveal that our proposed multi-static ISAC scheme achieves better ISAC performance than the conventional mono-static ones when the number of cooperative REs is large.</description>

      <title>Multi-frame Detection via Graph Neural Networks: A Link Prediction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-frame detection algorithms can effectively utilize the correlation between consecutive echoes to improve the detection performance of weak targets. Existing efficient multi-frame detection algorithms are typically based on three sequential steps: plot extraction via a relative low primary threshold, track search and track detection. However, these three-stage processing algorithms may result in a notable loss of detection performance and do not fully leverage the available echo information across frames. As to applying graph neural networks in multi-frame detection, the algorithms are primarily based on node classification tasks, which cannot directly output target tracks. In this paper, we reformulate the multi-frame detection problem as a link prediction task in graphs. First, we perform a rough association of multi-frame observations that exceed the low threshold to construct observation association graphs. Subsequently, a multi-feature link prediction network is designed based on graph neural networks, which integrates multi-dimensional information, including echo structure, Doppler information, and spatio-temporal coupling of plots. By leveraging the principle of link prediction, we unifies the processes of track search and track detection into one step to reduce performance loss and directly output target tracks. Experimental results indicate that, compared with traditional single-frame and multi-frame detection algorithms, the proposed algorithm improves the detection performance of weak targets while suppressing false alarms. Additionally, interpretable analysis shows that the designed network effectively integrates the utilized features, allowing for accurate associations between targets and false alarms.</description>

      <title>On the Design and Performance of Machine Learning Based Error Correcting Decoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the design and competitiveness of four neural network (NN) architectures recently proposed as decoders for forward error correction (FEC) codes. We first consider the so-called single-label neural network (SLNN) and the multi-label neural network (MLNN) decoders which have been reported to achieve near maximum likelihood (ML) performance. Here, we show analytically that SLNN and MLNN decoders can always achieve ML performance, regardless of the code dimensions -- although at the cost of computational complexity -- and no training is in fact required. We then turn our attention to two transformer-based decoders: the error correction code transformer (ECCT) and the cross-attention message passing transformer (CrossMPT). We compare their performance against traditional decoders, and show that ordered statistics decoding outperforms these transformer-based decoders. The results in this paper cast serious doubts on the application of NN-based FEC decoders in the short and medium block length regime.</description>

      <title>Approaching Massive MIMO Performance with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: We Do Not Need Many Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.07493v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers an antenna structure where a (non-large) array of radiating elements is placed at short distance in front of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), herein nicknamed reconfigurable intelligent base station (RIBS). We firstly derive a closed-form expression for the channel between the array of radiating elements and the RIS that captures the near-field effects, and give some considerations on the channel hardening and favorable propagation in this scenario. Focusing on both active and passive RIS, we describe channel estimation and downlink signal processing techniques suitable for the RIBS structure. Additionally, we formulate and solve an optimization problem aimed at maximizing the fairness among the users with respect to the downlink power coefficients and RIS configuration both in the cases of active and passive RIBS. Numerical results show that the proposed structure is effective and capable of outperforming conventional non-RIS aided MIMO systems, especially in the case of active RIBS. The proposed antenna structure is thus shown to be able to approach massive MIMO performance levels in a cost-effective way with reduced hardware resources.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Joint Estimation of Temporal Vertex and Edge Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06533v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adaptive estimation of coexisting temporal vertex (node) and edge signals on graphs is a critical task when a change in edge signals influences the temporal dynamics of the vertex signals. However, the current Graph Signal Processing algorithms mostly consider only the signals existing on the graph vertices and have neglected the fact that signals can reside on the edges. We propose an Adaptive Joint Vertex-Edge Estimation (AJVEE) algorithm for jointly estimating time-varying vertex and edge signals through a time-varying regression, incorporating both vertex signal filtering and edge signal filtering. Accompanying AJVEE is a newly proposed Adaptive Least Mean Square procedure based on the Hodge Laplacian (ALMS-Hodge), which is inspired by classical adaptive filters combining simplicial filtering and simplicial regression. AJVEE is able to operate jointly on the vertices and edges by merging two ALMS-Hodge specified on the vertices and edges into a unified formulation. A more generalized case extending AJVEE beyond the vertices and edges is being discussed. Experimenting on real-world traffic networks and population mobility networks, we have confirmed that our proposed AJVEE algorithm could accurately and jointly track time-varying vertex and edge signals on graphs.</description>

      <title>MEDUSA: Scalable Biometric Sensing in the Wild through Distributed MIMO Radars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05507v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radar-based techniques for detecting vital signs have shown promise for continuous contactless vital sign sensing and healthcare applications. However, real-world indoor environments face significant challenges for existing vital sign monitoring systems. These include signal blockage in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) situations, movement of human subjects, and alterations in location and orientation. Additionally, these existing systems failed to address the challenge of tracking multiple targets simultaneously. To overcome these challenges, we present MEDUSA, a novel coherent ultra-wideband (UWB) based distributed multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar system, especially it allows users to customize and disperse the $16 \times 16$ into sub-arrays. MEDUSA takes advantage of the diversity benefits of distributed yet wirelessly synchronized MIMO arrays to enable robust vital sign monitoring in real-world and daily living environments where human targets are moving and surrounded by obstacles. We've developed a scalable, self-supervised contrastive learning model which integrates seamlessly with our hardware platform. Each attention weight within the model corresponds to a specific antenna pair of Tx and Rx. The model proficiently recovers accurate vital sign waveforms by decomposing and correlating the mixed received signals, including comprising human motion, mobility, noise, and vital signs. Through extensive evaluations involving 21 participants and over 200 hours of collected data (3.75 TB in total, with 1.89 TB for static subjects and 1.86 TB for moving subjects), MEDUSA's performance has been validated, showing an average gain of 20% compared to existing systems employing COTS radar sensors. This demonstrates MEDUSA's spatial diversity gain for real-world vital sign monitoring, encompassing target and environmental dynamics in familiar and unfamiliar indoor environments.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Precoder Design for Angle-of-Departure Estimation with Limited-Resolution Phase Shifters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hybrid analog-digital beamforming stands out as a key enabler for future communication systems with a massive number of antennas. In this paper, we investigate the hybrid precoder design problem for angle-of-departure (AoD) estimation, where we take into account the practical constraint on the limited resolution of phase shifters. Our goal is to design a radio-frequency (RF) precoder and a base-band (BB) precoder to estimate AoD of the user with a high accuracy. To this end, we propose a two-step strategy where we first obtain the fully digital precoder that minimizes the angle error bound, and then the resulting digital precoder is decomposed into an RF precoder and a BB precoder, based on the alternating optimization and the alternating direction method of multipliers. Besides, we derive the quantization error upper bound and analyse the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Hybrid Beamforming for Holographic Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that there is inherent radiation pattern distortion for the commercial base station antenna array, which usually needs three antenna sectors to cover the whole space. To eliminate pattern distortion and further enhance beamforming performance, we propose an electromagnetic hybrid beamforming (EHB) scheme based on a three-dimensional (3D) superdirective holographic antenna array. Specifically, EHB consists of antenna excitation current vectors (analog beamforming) and digital precoding matrices, where the implementation of analog beamforming involves the real-time adjustment of the radiation pattern to adapt it to the dynamic wireless environment. Meanwhile, the digital beamforming is optimized based on the channel characteristics of analog beamforming to further improve the achievable rate of communication systems. An electromagnetic channel model incorporating array radiation patterns and the mutual coupling effect is also developed to evaluate the benefits of our proposed scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed EHB scheme with a 3D holographic array achieves a relatively flat superdirective beamforming gain and allows for programmable focusing directions throughout the entire spatial domain. Furthermore, they also verify that the proposed scheme achieves a sum rate gain of over 150% compared to traditional beamforming algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) systems represent a deeply investigated evolution from the conventional multicell co-located massive MIMO (MC-mMIMO) network deployments. Anticipating a gradual integration of CF-mMIMO systems alongside pre-existing MC-mMIMO network elements, this paper considers a scenario where both deployments coexist, in order to serve a large number of users using a shared set of frequencies. The investigation explores the impact of this co-existence on the network's downlink performance, considering various degrees of mutual cooperation, precoder selection, and power control strategies. Moreover, to take into account the effect of the proposed cooperation scenarios on the fronthaul links, this paper also provides a fronthaul-aware heuristic association algorithm between users and network elements, which allows the fulfillment of the front-haul requirement on each link. The research is finally completed by extensive simulations, shedding light on the performance outcomes associated with the various levels of cooperation and several solutions delineated in the paper.</description>

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks have a limitation of solely processing features on graph nodes, neglecting data on high-dimensional structures such as edges and triangles. Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks (SCNN) represent higher-order structures using simplicial complexes to break this limitation albeit still lacking time efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network architecture on simplicial complexes named Binarized Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks (Bi-SCNN) based on the combination of simplicial convolution with a binary-sign forward propagation strategy. The usage of the Hodge Laplacian on a binary-sign forward propagation enables Bi-SCNN to efficiently and effectively represent simplicial features that have higher-order structures than traditional graph node representations. Compared to the previous Simplicial Convolutional Neural Networks, the reduced model complexity of Bi-SCNN shortens the execution time without sacrificing the prediction performance and is less prone to the over-smoothing effect. Experimenting with real-world citation and ocean-drifter data confirmed that our proposed Bi-SCNN is efficient and accurate.</description>

      <title>Gemini: Integrating Full-fledged Sensing upon Millimeter Wave Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04174v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrating millimeter wave (mmWave)technology in both communication and sensing is promising as it enables the reuse of existing spectrum and infrastructure without draining resources. Most existing systems piggyback sensing onto conventional communication modes without fully exploiting the potential of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in mmWave radios (not full-fledged). In this paper, we design and implement a full-fledged mmWave ISAC system Gemini; it delivers raw channel states to serve a broad category of sensing applications. We first propose the mmWave self-interference cancellation approach to extract the weak reflected signals for near-field sensing purposes. Then, we develop a joint optimization scheduling framework that can be utilized in accurate radar sensing while maximizing the communication throughput. Finally, we design a united fusion sensing algorithm to offer a better sensing performance via combining monostatic and bistatic modes. We evaluate our system in extensive experiments to demonstrate Gemini's capability of simultaneously operating sensing and communication, enabling mmWave ISAC to perform better than the commercial off-the-shelf mmWave radar for 5G cellular networks.</description>
