      <title>Modeling the Electrostatic Potential of Disks with Arbitrary Radial Charge Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present an analytical study of the electrostatic potential generated by a charged disk with a surface charge distribution that possesses radial axial symmetry. We express the potential in cylindrical coordinates and apply a Bessel function representation for the Coulomb kernel to simplify its calculation. We consider a broad family of surface charge densities and derive an exact expression for the potential based on a classical integral identity involving Bessel functions. This general formulation includes several important special cases such as the uniformly charged disk and edge-concentrated charge density distributions. We explore how variations in various parameters affect the resulting potential, thereby illustrating the influence of radial charge modulation. It is found that the potential undergoes a qualitative change of behavior when the chosen set of parameters is varied. The results are analytically elegant and computationally efficient as all functions involved are implemented in standard scientific computing libraries.</description>

      <title>Hidden geometric invariance in Laplace-governed magnetization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For over a century, the response of magnetic materials to static fields, formulated as transmission problems of the Laplace equation, has been a standard topic in undergraduate electrodynamics. In the infinite permeability limit, the body becomes nearly equipotential and the internal magnetic field nearly vanishes, giving rise to magnetostatic shielding, a phenomenon in which the magnetic induction is nearly zero throughout the interior free space. While this textbook-level result has long been considered fully understood, here, we identify a previously overlooked geometric invariance that complements the quasi-equipotential picture: in the same limit, the entire external magnetic response of a body is determined solely by its outer surface geometry, regardless of internal structure or deformation, as long as the outer surface remains fixed. This surface-encoded invariance encompasses the external field distribution and all magnetic multipole moments of the body, including the dipole and quadrupole, derived as volume integrals from the internal scalar potential. It provides a theoretical foundation for the lightweight design of certain magnetic devices, such as flux concentrators. Given that analogous Laplace transmission problems arise across physics, including electricity conduction, heat conduction and acoustic scattering, this geometric invariance exhibits cross-disciplinary universality. It merits inclusion in undergraduate electromagnetism curricula, as it and the quasi-equipotential property together form a complete characterization of Laplace transmission problems in the infinite permeability limit.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Reaction on the Straight-Line Motion of a Point Charge accelerated by a constant applied Electric Field in an Electromagnetic Bopp-Land\'e-Thomas-Podolsky vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiation-reaction problem of standard Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges is pathological, standing in contrast to Bopp--Land\'e--Thomas--Podolsky (BLTP) electrodynamics where it is in fact well-defined and calculable, as reported in a previous publication. To demonstrate the viability of BLTP electrodynamics, we consider the BLTP analogue of the radiation reaction of a classical point charge accelerated from rest by a static homogeneous capacitor plate field, and calculate it up to $O(\varkappa^4)$ in a formal expansion about $\varkappa=0$ in powers of $\varkappa$, Bopp's reciprocal length, a new electrodynamics parameter introduced by BLTP theory. In a paper by Carley and Kiessling (arXiv:2303.01720 [physics.class-ph]) the radiation-reaction corrections to test-particle motion were explicitly computed to $O(\varkappa^3)$, the first non-vanishing order. In this article a crucial question regarding this ``small-$\varkappa$'' expansion, raised by Carley and Kiessling, is answered as follows: The motions computed with terms $O(\varkappa^3)$ included are mathematically accurate approximations to {physically reasonable} solutions of the actual BLTP initial value problem for short times $t$, viz. when $\varkappa c t \ll 1$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuo, but their unphysical behavior over {much} longer times does not accurately approximate the actual BLTP solutions even when the dimensionless parameter $\varkappa e^2 / |m_b| c^2 \ll 1$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_b$ the bare rest mass of the electron. This has the important implication that BLTP electrodynamics remains a viable contender for an accurate classical electrodynamics with point charges that does not suffer from the infinite self-interaction problems of textbook Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges.</description>

      <title>Full-scatter vector field analysis of an overmoded and periodically-loaded cylindrical structure for the transportation of THz radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The full-scatter vector field analysis of a highly overmoded and periodically loaded cylindrical wavguiding structure (or "iris line") is presented. This type of structure is promising for the transportation of diffraction-prone short THz radiation pulses over hundreds of meters. The analysis uses vector fields, superseding scalar field descriptions, to account for polarization effects and ohmic loss on practical conductive screens. Its results are quite general, as it only assumes a paraxial incidence with slowly-varying envelope (parabolic wave equation) along the axis of the structure. It removes the traditional assumption of very thin screens, allowing for the study of thicker screens in the high-frequency limit, while hosting hundreds of modes and formulating the problem efficiently by scattering matrices whose coefficients are found analytically. The theory expands previously established methods, including Vainstein's limit and the forward-scatter approximation, and validates them (as they become special cases with respect to it). It also facilitates accurate visualization of the transient regime at the entrance of the structure, and how it evolves to reach steady state.</description>
