      <title>A convenient characterisation of convergent upper transition operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by its connection to the limit behaviour of imprecise Markov chains, we introduce and study the so-called convergence of upper transition operators: the condition that for any function, the orbit resulting from iterated application of this operator converges. In contrast, the existing notion of `ergodicity' requires convergence of the orbit to a constant. We derive a very general (and practically verifiable) sufficient condition for convergence in terms of accessibility and lower reachability, and prove that this sufficient condition is also necessary whenever (i) all transient states are absorbed or (ii) the upper transition operator is finitely generated.</description>

      <title>Global Geometry within an SPDE Well-Posedness Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a closed Riemannian manifold, we construct a family of intrinsic Gaussian noises indexed by a regularity parameter $\alpha\geq0$ to study the well-posedness of the Parabolic Anderson model. We show that with rough initial conditions, the equation is well-posed assuming non-positive curvature with a condition on $\alpha$ similar to that of Riesz kernel-correlated noise in Euclidean space. The argument was made in direct mode, showing that it is possible to bypass Fourier analysis, which was used in all previous work with rough initial conditions. Non-positive curvature was used to overcome a new difficulty introduced by non-uniqueness of geodesics in this setting, which required exploration of global geometry. The well-posedness argument also produces exponentially growing in time upper bounds for the moments. Using the good structure of our noise, we obtain new exponentially growing in time second moment lower bounds for our solutions with bounded initial condition.</description>

      <title>The coalescent structure of multitype continuous-time Galton-Watson trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the genealogy of a sample of $k\geq1$ particles chosen uniformly without replacement from a population alive at large times in a critical continuous-time multitype Galton-Watson process with finite second moment. We will show that subject to a deterministic time-change, the sample genealogy always converges to the same universal genealogical structure; it has the same tree topology as Kingman's coalescent, when the types are discarded, and the coalescent times of the $k-1$ pairwise mergers look like a mixture of independent identically distributed times. We show that such an ancestral lineage in the limit, strongly depends on the multitype offspring distribution, which differs from the single type case Harris, Johnston, and Roberts [Annals of Applied Probability, 2020]. Our approach uses $k$ distinguished 'spine' particles and a suitable change of measure under which (a) the spines form a uniform sample without replacement that depend on the colours but additionally (b) there is $k$-size biasing and discounting according to the population size. Our work substantially extends the spine techniques developed in Harris, Johnston, and Roberts [Annals of Applied Probability, 2020] for genealogies of uniform samples of size $k$ in critical, continuous-time, single-type Galton-Watson processes. We generalize these methods to the multi-type setting and provide a comprehensive analysis of how functionals of the spines are influenced by the types. While the single-type case exhibits a more homogeneous structure with simpler dependency patterns, the multi-type case introduces interactions between different types, leading to a more intricate dependency structure where functionals must account for type-specific behaviours and inter-type relationships.</description>

      <title>An inverse potential problem for the stochastic heat equation with space-time noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an inverse potential problem for the stochastic heat equation driven by space-time Gaussian noise, which is spatially colored and temporally white. The objective is to determine the covariance operator of the random potential. We establish that the covariance operator can be uniquely identified from the correlation of the mild solution to the stochastic heat equation at a final time, where the initial conditions are specified by a complete orthonormal basis. The analysis relies on characterizing a tensor product structure inherent in the problem and utilizing the monotonicity properties of the operators associated with the system.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of the largest eigenvalues of transformed spiked Wigner matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a spiked random matrix model obtained by applying a function entrywise to a signal-plus-noise symmetric data matrix. We prove that the largest eigenvalue of this model, which we call a transformed spiked Wigner matrix, exhibits Baik-Ben Arous-P\'ech\'e (BBP) type phase transition. We show that the law of the fluctuation converges to the Gaussian distribution when the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is above the critical number, and to the GOE Tracy-Widom distribution when the effective SNR is below the critical number. We provide precise formulas for the limiting distributions and also concentration estimates for the largest eigenvalues, both in the supercritical and the subcritical regimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the strong law of large numbers for a function of the local times of a transient random walk on groups, extending the research of Asymont and Korshunov for random walks on the integer lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Under some weaker conditions, we prove that certain function of the local times converges almost surely and in $L^1$ and $L^2$. The proof is mainly based on the subadditive ergodic theorem.</description>

      <title>Optimal Low degree hardness for Broadcasting on Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Broadcasting on trees is a fundamental model from statistical physics that plays an important role in information theory, noisy computation and phylogenetic reconstruction within computational biology and linguistics. While this model permits efficient linear-time algorithms for the inference of the root from the leaves, recent work suggests that non-trivial computational complexity may be required for inference.
  The inference of the root state can be performed using the celebrated Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm, which achieves Bayes-optimal performance. Although BP runs in linear time using real arithmetic operations, recent research indicates that it requires non-trivial computational complexity using more refined complexity measures.
  Moitra, Mossel, and Sandon demonstrated such complexity by constructing a Markov chain for which estimating the root better than random guessing (for typical inputs) is $NC^1$-complete. Kohler and Mossel constructed chains where, for trees with $N$ leaves, achieving better-than-random root recovery requires polynomials of degree $N^{\Omega(1)}$. The papers above raised the question of whether such complexity bounds hold generally below the celebrated Kesten-Stigum bound.
  In a recent work, Huang and Mossel established a general degree lower bound of $\Omega(\log N)$ below the Kesten-Stigum bound. Specifically, they proved that any function expressed as a linear combination of functions of at most $O(log N)$ leaves has vanishing correlation with the root. In this work, we get an exponential improvement of this lower bound by establishing an $N^{\Omega(1)}$ degree lower bound, for any broadcast process in the whole regime below the Kesten-Stigum bound.</description>

      <title>Almost periodic stochastic processes with applications to analytic number theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical fact of the theory of almost periodic functions is the existence of their asymptotic distributions. In probabilistic terms, this means that if $f$ is a Besicovitch almost periodic function and $V$ is a random variable uniformly distributed on $[-1,1]$, then the random variables $f(L\cdot V)$ converge in distribution, as $L\to\infty$, to a proper non-degenerate random variable. We prove a functional extension of this result for the random processes $(f(L\cdot V+t))_{t\in\mathbb{R}}$ in the space of Besicovitch almost periodic functions, and also in the sense of weak convergence of finite-dimensional distributions. We further investigate the properties of the limiting stationary process and demonstrate applications in analytic number theory by extending the one-dimensional results of [Limiting distributions of the classical error terms of prime number theory, Quart. J. Math. 65 (2014), 743--780] and earlier works.</description>

      <title>Stochastic neutral fractions and the effective population size</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a general structured population is modelled using a general stochastic differential equation (SDE) with an infinite divisibility property. This property allows the population to be divided into an arbitrary number of allelic components, also known as stochastic neutral fractions. When demographic noise is small, a fast-slow principle provides a general formula for the effective population size in structured populations. To illustrate this approach, we revisit several examples from the literature, including age-structured models and expansion fronts.</description>

      <title>Optimal multi-time-scale estimates for diluted autocatalytic chemical networks. (1) Introduction and $\sigma^*$-dominant case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autocatalytic chemical networks are dynamical systems whose linearization around zero has a positive Lyapunov exponent; this exponent gives the growth rate of the system in the diluted regime, i.e. for near-zero concentrations. The generator of the dynamics in the kinetic limit is then a Perron-Frobenius matrix, suggesting the use of Markov chain techniques to get long-time asymptotics. This series of works introduces a new, general procedure providing precise quantitative information about such asymptotics, based on estimates for the Lyapunov eigenvalue and eigenvector. The algorithm, inspired from Wilson's renormalization group method in quantum field theory, is based on a downward recursion on kinetic scales, starting from the fastest, and terminating with the slowest rates. Estimates take on the form of simple rational functions of kinetic rates. They are accurate under a separation of scales hypothesis, loosely stating that kinetic rates span many orders of magnitude. We provide here a brief general motivation and introduction to the method, present some simple examples, and derive a number of preliminary results, in particular the estimation of Lyapunov data for a subclass of so-called $\sigma^*$-dominant graphs.</description>

      <title>Noise Sensitivity of Hierarchical Functions and Deep Learning Lower Bounds in General Product Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent works explore deep learning's success by examining functions or data with hierarchical structure. Complementarily, research on gradient descent performance for deep nets has shown that noise sensitivity of functions under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli inputs establishes learning complexity bounds. This paper aims to bridge these research streams by demonstrating that functions constructed through repeated composition of non-linear functions are noise sensitive under general product measures.</description>

      <title>Tractable description of hydrodynamic limits of a class of interacting jump processes on sparse graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider dynamics of the empirical measure of vertex neighborhood states of Markov interacting jump processes on sparse random graphs, in a suitable asymptotic limit as the graph size goes to infinity. Under the assumption of a certain acyclic structure on single-particle transitions, we provide a tractable autonomous description of the evolution of this hydrodynamic limit in terms of a finite coupled system of ordinary differential equations. Key ingredients of the proof include a characterization of the hydrodynamic limit of the neighborhood empirical measure in terms of a certain local-field equation, well-posedness of its Markovian projection, and a Markov random field property of the time-marginals, which may be of independent interest. We also show how our results lead to principled approximations for classes of interacting jump processes and illustrate its efficacy via simulations on several examples, including an idealized model of seizure spread in the brain.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Diffusion Models for Manifold Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the time reversed dynamics of generative diffusion models. If the exact empirical score function is used in a regime of large dimension and exponentially large number of samples, these models are known to undergo transitions between distinct dynamical regimes. We extend this analysis and compute the transitions for an analytically tractable manifold model where the statistical model for the data is a mixture of lower dimensional Gaussians embedded in higher dimensional space. We compute the so-called speciation and collapse transition times, as a function of the ratio of manifold-to-ambient space dimensions, and other characteristics of the data model. An important tool used in our analysis is the exact formula for the mutual information (or free energy) of Generalized Linear Models.</description>

      <title>Iterative Importance Fine-tuning of Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models are an important tool for generative modelling, serving as effective priors in applications such as imaging and protein design. A key challenge in applying diffusion models for downstream tasks is efficiently sampling from resulting posterior distributions, which can be addressed using the $h$-transform. This work introduces a self-supervised algorithm for fine-tuning diffusion models by estimating the $h$-transform, enabling amortised conditional sampling. Our method iteratively refines the $h$-transform using a synthetic dataset resampled with path-based importance weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework on class-conditional sampling and reward fine-tuning for text-to-image diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Advancing Wasserstein Convergence Analysis of Score-Based Models: Insights from Discretization and Second-Order Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models have emerged as powerful tools in generative modeling, yet their theoretical foundations remain underexplored. In this work, we focus on the Wasserstein convergence analysis of score-based diffusion models. Specifically, we investigate the impact of various discretization schemes, including Euler discretization, exponential integrators, and midpoint randomization methods. Our analysis provides a quantitative comparison of these discrete approximations, emphasizing their influence on convergence behavior. Furthermore, we explore scenarios where Hessian information is available and propose an accelerated sampler based on the local linearization method. We demonstrate that this Hessian-based approach achieves faster convergence rates of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$ significantly improving upon the standard rate $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^2}\right)$ of vanilla diffusion models, where $\varepsilon$ denotes the target accuracy.</description>

      <title>$\Phi^4_3$ Theory from many-body quantum Gibbs states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the $\Phi^4_3$ measure on the torus as a rigorous limit of the quantum Gibbs state of an interacting Bose gas, where the limiting classical measure describes the critical behavior of the Bose gas just above the Bose--Einstein phase transition. Since the quantum problem is typically formulated using a nonlocal interaction potential, a key challenge is to approximate the local $\Phi^4_3$ theory by a Hartree measure with a nonlocal interaction. This requires uniform estimates on the Hartree measure, which are achieved using techniques from recent development on stochastic quantization and paracontrolled calculus from \cite{GIP15}. The connection to the quantum problem is then established by applying the variational approach in \cite{LewNamRou-21}, where using a recent correlation inequality from \cite{DeuNamNap-25} we refine the analysis and derive a quantitative convergence of the quantum correlation functions to those of the Hartree classical field.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of (nonlinear) rough continuity equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to fluid dynamics, we study rough differential equations (RDEs) and rough partial differential equations (RPDEs) with non-Lipschitz drifts. We prove well-posedness and existence of a flow for RDEs with Osgood drifts, as well as well-posedness of weak $L^p$-valued solutions to linear rough continuity and transport equations on $\mathbb{R}^d$ under DiPerna--Lions regularity conditions; a combination of the two then yields flow representation formula for linear RPDEs. We apply these results to obtain existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence for $L^1\cap L^\infty$-valued solutions to a general class of nonlinear continuity equations. In particular, our framework covers the $2$D Euler equations in vorticity form with rough transport noise, providing a rough analogue of Yudovich's theorem. As a consequence, we construct an associated continuous random dynamical system, when the driving noise is a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H \in (1/3,1)$. We further prove weak existence of solutions for initial vorticities in $L^1\cap L^p$, for any $p\in [1,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Stochastic internal habit formation and optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growth models with internal habit formation have been studied in various settings under the assumption of deterministic dynamics. The purpose of this paper is to explore a stochastic version of the model in Carroll et al. [1997, 2000], one the most influential on the subject. The goal is twofold: on one hand, to determine how far we can advance in the technical study of the model; on the other, to assess whether at least some of the deterministic outcomes remain valid in the stochastic setting. The resulting optimal control problem proves to be challenging, primarily due to the lack of concavity in the objective function. This feature is present in the model even in the deterministic case (see, e.g., Bambi and Gozzi [2020]). We develop an approach based on Dynamic Programming to establish several useful results, including the regularity of the solution to the corresponding HJB equation and a verification theorem. There results lay the groundwork for studying the model optimal paths and comparing them with the deterministic case.</description>

      <title>A Randomised Approach to Distributed Sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and analyse a new, extremely simple, randomised sorting algorithm:
  - choose a pair of indices $\{i, j\}$ according to some distribution $q$;
  - sort the elements in positions $i$ and $j$ of the array in ascending order.
  Choosing $q_{\{i,j\}} \propto 1/|j - i|$ yields an order-$n (\log n)^2$ sorting time. We call it the harmonic sorter.
  The sorter trivially parallelises in the asynchronous setting, yielding a linear speed-up. We also exhibit a low-communication, synchronous version with a linear speed-up.
  We compare and contrast this algorithm with other sorters, and discuss some of its benefits, particularly its robustness and amenability to parallelisation and distributed computing.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Guarantees for Recovering Low-Rank Tensors from Symmetric Rank-One Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the sample complexity of recovering tensors with low symmetric rank from symmetric rank-one measurements. This setting is particularly motivated by the study of higher-order interactions and the analysis of two-layer neural networks with polynomial activations (polynomial networks). Using a covering numbers argument, we analyze the performance of the symmetric rank minimization program and establish near-optimal sample complexity bounds when the underlying distribution is log-concave. Our measurement model involves random symmetric rank-one tensors, which lead to involved probability calculations. To address these challenges, we employ the Carbery-Wright inequality, a powerful tool for studying anti-concentration properties of random polynomials, and leverage orthogonal polynomials. Additionally, we provide a sample complexity lower bound based on Fano's inequality, and discuss broader implications of our results for two-layer polynomial networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1903.12121v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse a family of two-types Wright-Fisher models with selection in a random environment and skewed offspring distribution. We provide a calculable criterion to quantify the impact of different shapes of selection on the fate of the weakest allele, and thus compare them. The main mathematical tool is duality, which we prove to hold, also in presence of random environment (quenched and in some cases annealed), between the population's allele frequencies and genealogy, both in the case of finite population size and in the scaling limit for large size. Duality also yields new insight on properties of branching-coalescing processes in random environment, such as their long term behaviour.</description>

      <title>Separating Times for One-Dimensional General Diffusions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06042v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The separating time for two probability measures on a filtered space is an extended stopping time which captures the phase transition between equivalence and singularity. More specifically, two probability measures are equivalent before their separating time and singular afterwards. In this paper, we investigate the separating time for two laws of general one-dimensional regular continuous strong Markov processes, so-called general diffusions, which are parameterized via scale functions and speed measures. Our main result is a representation of the corresponding separating time as (loosely speaking) a hitting time of a deterministic set which is characterized via speed and scale. As hitting times are fairly easy to understand, our result gives access to explicit and easy-to-check sufficient and necessary conditions for two laws of general diffusions to be (locally) absolutely continuous and/or singular. Most of the related literature treats the case of stochastic differential equations. In our setting we encounter several novel features, which are due to general speed and scale on the one hand, and to the fact that we do not exclude (instantaneous or sticky) reflection on the other hand. These new features are discussed in a variety of examples. As an application of our main theorem, we investigate the no arbitrage concept no free lunch with vanishing risk (NFLVR) for a single asset financial market whose (discounted) asset is modeled as a general diffusion which is bounded from below (e.g., non-negative). More precisely, we derive deterministic criteria for NFLVR and we identify the (unique) equivalent local martingale measure as the law of a certain general diffusion on natural scale.</description>

Abstract: This paper provides and extends second-order versions of several fundamental theorems on first-order regularly varying functions such as Karamata's theorem/representation and Tauberian's theorem. Our results are used to establish second-order approximations for the mean and variance of Hawkes processes with general kernels. Our approximations provide novel insights into the asymptotic behavior of Hawkes processes. They are also of key importance when establishing functional limit theorems for Hawkes processes.</description>

      <title>Constrained volume-difference site percolation model on the square lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a percolation model with restrictions on the opening of sites on the square lattice. In this model, each site $s \in \mathbb{Z}^{2}$ starts closed and an attempt to open it occurs at time $t=t_s$, where $(t_s)_{s \in \mathbb{Z}^2}$ is a sequence of independent random variables uniformly distributed on the interval $[0,1]$. The site will open if the volume difference between the two largest clusters adjacent to it is greater than or equal to a constant $r$ or if it has at most one adjacent cluster. Through numerical analysis, we determine the critical threshold $t_c(r)$ for various values of $r$, verifying that $t_c(r)$ is non-decreasing in $r$ and that there exists a critical value $r_c=5$ beyond which percolation does not occur. Additionally, we find that the correlation length exponent of this model is equal to that of the ordinary percolation model. For $t = 1$ and $1 \leq r \leq 9$, we estimate the averages of the density of open sites, the number of distinct cluster volumes, and the volume of the largest cluster.</description>

We provide a representation for its stationary distribution as a marginal of the top layer of a two-layer ensemble under Liggett's condition. The representation is valid in the fan region and in the shock region, extending the representation previously obtained in [Bryc-Zatitskii-2024 arXiv:2403.03275] to ASEP.

      <title>Edge spectra of Gaussian random symmetric matrices with correlated entries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the largest eigenvalue of a Gaussian random symmetric matrix $X_n$, with zero-mean, unit variance entries satisfying the condition $\sup_{(i, j) \ne (i', j')}|\mathbb{E}[X_{ij} X_{i'j'}]| = O(n^{-(1 + \varepsilon)})$, where $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. It follows from Catalano et al. (2024) that the empirical spectral distribution of $n^{-1/2} X_n$ converges weakly almost surely to the standard semi-circle law. Using a F\"{u}redi-Koml\'{o}s-type high moment analysis, we show that the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1(n^{-1/2} X_n)$ of $n^{-1/2} X_n$ converges almost surely to $2$. This result is essentially optimal in the sense that one cannot take $\varepsilon = 0$ and still obtain an almost sure limit of $2$. We also derive Gaussian fluctuation results for the largest eigenvalue in the case where the entries have a common non-zero mean. Let $Y_n = X_n + \frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{n}}\mathbf{1} \mathbf{1}^\top$. When $\varepsilon \ge 1$ and $\lambda \gg n^{1/4}$, we show that \[
  n^{1/2}\bigg(\lambda_1(n^{-1/2} Y_n) - \lambda - \frac{1}{\lambda}\bigg) \xrightarrow{d} \sqrt{2} Z, \] where $Z$ is a standard Gaussian. On the other hand, when $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1$, we have $\mathrm{Var}(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i, j}X_{ij}) = O(n^{1 - \varepsilon})$. Assuming that $\mathrm{Var}(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i, j} X_{ij}) = \sigma^2 n^{1 - \varepsilon} (1 + o(1))$, if $\lambda \gg n^{\varepsilon/4}$, then we have \[
  n^{\varepsilon/2}\bigg(\lambda_1(n^{-1/2} Y_n) - \lambda - \frac{1}{\lambda}\bigg) \xrightarrow{d} \sigma Z. \] While the ranges of $\lambda$ in these fluctuation results are certainly not optimal, a striking aspect is that different scalings are required in the two regimes $0 &lt; \varepsilon &lt; 1$ and $\varepsilon \ge 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modularity is a graph parameter measuring how clearly the set of graph vertices may be partitioned into subsets of high edge density. It indicates the presence of community structure in the graph. We study its value for a random preferential attachment model $G_n^h$ introduced by Barab\'asi and Albert in 1999. A graph $G_n^h$ is created from some finite starting graph by adding new vertices one by one. A new vertex always connects to $h\geq1$ already existing vertices and those are chosen with probability proportional to their current degrees. We prove that modularity of $G_n^h$ is with high probability upper bounded by a function tending to $0$ with $h$ tending to infinity. This resolves the conjecture of Prokhorenkova, Pralat and Raigorodskii from 2016. As a byproduct we obtain novel concentration results for the volume and the edge density parameters of subsets of $G_n^h$.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of a general class of random block Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08608v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a natural class of extensions of the Anderson model on $\mathbb Z^d$, called random block Schr\"odinger operators (RBSOs), which feature a random block potential. They are defined on the $d$-dimensional lattice $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$ and take the form $H=V + \lambda \Psi$, where $V$ is a diagonal block matrix with diagonal blocks that are i.i.d. $W^d\times W^d$ GUE, $\Psi$ describes the interactions between neighboring blocks, and $0&lt;\lambda\ll 1$ is a small coupling parameter (making $H$ a perturbation of $V$). We focus on three specific RBSOs: (1) the block Anderson model, where $\Psi$ is the Laplacian operator on $\mathbb Z^d$; (2) the Anderson orbital model, where $\Psi$ is a block Laplacian operator; (3) the Wegner orbital model, where the nearest-neighbor blocks of $\Psi$ are random matrices. Assuming $d\ge 7$ and $W\ge L^\varepsilon$ for a small constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, under certain lower bound on $\lambda$, we prove delocalization and quantum unique ergodicity for the bulk eigenvectors, as well as a quantum diffusion estimate for the Green's function. Together with the localization result established in arXiv:1608.02922, our results rigorously demonstrate the existence of an Anderson localization-delocalization transition for RBSOs as $\lambda$ varies. Our proof is based on the $T$-expansion method and the concept of self-energy renormalization developed for random band matrices in arXiv:2104.12048. Additionally, we explore a conceptually new idea called coupling renormalization. This phenomenon extends the self-energy renormalization and is prevalent in quantum field theory, yet it is identified here for the first time within the context of random Schr\"odinger operators. We anticipate that our techniques can be adapted to real or non-Gaussian block potentials and more general interactions $\Psi$.</description>

      <title>The Integrable Snake Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A pure snake configuration is a bijection $\sigma:\mathbb{Z}^2 \to \mathbb{Z}^2$ containing no two-cycles and such that for each $x \in \mathbb{Z}^2$ we have $\sigma(x) \in \{ x , x+ \mathbf{e}^1, x+\mathbf{e}^2 , x- \mathbf{e}^2 \}.$ The non-trivial cycles of a pure snake configuration may be regarded as a collection of non-intersecting paths in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ that may travel right, up, or down (but not left) from a given vertex. Pure snake configurations are a generalisation of lozenge tilings, which are in natural correspondence with paths that only travel right or up. We introduce a natural partition function on a finite version of this model, and study the probabilistic properties of random pure snake configurations chosen according to their contribution to this partition function. Under a suitable weighting, the model is integrable in the sense that we have access to explicit formulas for its partition and correlation functions. We utilise the integrable structure of this model in various applications, such as to prove a traffic representation of ASEP on the ring, generalising the analogous result for TASEP by the first author.</description>

      <title>Construction of product $*$-probability spaces via free cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.10989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2007.10989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that free independence is equivalent to the vanishing of mixed free cumulants. The purpose of this short note is to build free products of $*$-probability spaces using this as the definition of freeness and relying on free cumulants instead of moments.</description>

      <title>Primal and dual optimal stopping with signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose two signature-based methods to solve the optimal stopping problem - that is, to price American options - in non-Markovian frameworks. Both methods rely on a global approximation result for $L^p-$functionals on rough path-spaces, using linear functionals of robust, rough path signatures. In the primal formulation, we present a non-Markovian generalization of the famous Longstaff-Schwartz algorithm, using linear functionals of the signature as regression basis. For the dual formulation, we parametrize the space of square-integrable martingales using linear functionals of the signature, and apply a sample average approximation. We prove convergence for both methods and present first numerical examples in non-Markovian and non-semimartingale regimes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Ruzsa Divergence to Quantify Magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the behavior of quantum entropy under quantum convolution and its application in quantifying magic. We first establish an entropic, quantum central limit theorem (q-CLT), where the rate of convergence is bounded by the magic gap. We also introduce a new quantum divergence based on quantum convolution, called the quantum Ruzsa divergence, to study the stabilizer structure of quantum states. We conjecture a ``convolutional strong subadditivity'' inequality, which leads to the triangle inequality for the quantum Ruzsa divergence. In addition, we propose two new magic measures, the quantum Ruzsa divergence of magic and quantum-doubling constant, to quantify the amount of magic in quantum states. Finally, by using the quantum convolution, we extend the classical, inverse sumset theory to the quantum case. These results shed new insight into the study of the stabilizer and magic states in quantum information theory.</description>

      <title>A central limit theorem associated with a sequence of positive line bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a central limit theorem for smooth linear statistics associated with zero divisors of standard Gaussian holomorphic sections in a sequence of holomorphic line bundles with Hermitian metrics of class $\mathscr{C}^{3}$ over a compact K\"{a}hler manifold. In the course of our analysis, we derive first-order asymptotics and upper decay estimates for near and off-diagonal Bergman kernels, respectively. These results are essential for determining the statistical properties of the zeros of random holomorphic sections.</description>

      <title>Backbone exponent and annulus crossing probability for planar percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the recent derivation of the backbone exponent for 2D percolation. In contrast to previously known exactly solved percolation exponents, the backbone exponent is a transcendental number, which is a root of an elementary equation. We also report an exact formula for the probability that there are two disjoint paths of the same color crossing an annulus. The backbone exponent captures the leading asymptotic, while the other roots of the elementary equation capture the asymptotic of the remaining terms. This suggests that the backbone exponent is part of a conformal field theory (CFT) whose bulk spectrum contains this set of roots. Our approach is based on the coupling between SLE curves and Liouville quantum gravity (LQG), and the integrability of Liouville CFT that governs the LQG surfaces.</description>

      <title>Private Minimum Hellinger Distance Estimation via Hellinger Distance Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective functions based on Hellinger distance yield robust and efficient estimators of model parameters. Motivated by privacy and regulatory requirements encountered in contemporary applications, we derive in this paper \emph{private minimum Hellinger distance estimators}. The estimators satisfy a new privacy constraint, namely, Hellinger differential privacy, while retaining the robustness and efficiency properties. We demonstrate that Hellinger differential privacy shares several features of standard differential privacy while allowing for sharper inference. Additionally, for computational purposes, we also develop Hellinger differentially private gradient descent and Newton-Raphson algorithms. We illustrate the behavior of our estimators in finite samples using numerical experiments and verify that they retain robustness properties under gross-error contamination.</description>
