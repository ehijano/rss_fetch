      <title>GloBIAS: strengthening the foundations of BioImage Analysis</title>

Abstract: There is a global need for BioImage Analysis (BIA) as advances in life sciences increasingly rely on cutting-edge imaging systems that have dramatically expanded the complexity and dimensionality of biological images. Turning these data into scientific discoveries requires people with effective data management skills and knowledge of state-of-the-art image processing and data analysis, in other words, BioImage Analysts. The Global BioImage Analysts' Society (GloBIAS) aims to enhance the profile of BioImage Analysts as a key role in science and research. Its vision encompasses fostering a global network, democratising access to BIA by providing educational resources tailored to various proficiency levels and disciplines, while also establishing guidelines for BIA courses. By collaboratively shaping the education of BioImage Analysts, GloBIAS aims to unlock the full potential of BIA in advancing life science research and to consolidate BIA as a career path. To better understand the needs and geographical representation of the BIA community, a worldwide survey was conducted and 291 responses were collected across people from all career stages and continents. This work discusses how GloBIAS aims to address community-identified shortcomings in work environment, funding, and scientific activities. The survey underscores a strong interest from the BIA community in activities proposed by GloBIAS and their interest to actively contribute. With 72% of respondents willing to pay for membership, the community's enthusiasm for both online and in-person events is set to drive the growth and sustainability of GloBIAS.</description>
