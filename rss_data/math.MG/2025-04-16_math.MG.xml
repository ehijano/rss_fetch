      <title>The $L_p$ Minkowski problems on affine dual quermassintegrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provided $L_p$ curvature measures of affine dual quermassintegrals for $p\in\mathbb{R}$, and solved the existence part of the $L_p$ Minkowski problems for the non-symmetric measures when $p&gt;1$ and symmetric measures when $p\geq0$. When $p=0$, this is the affine dual Minkowski problems, which is introduced and solved by Cai-Leng-Wu-Xi in [7].</description>

      <title>Computing the tropical Abel--Jacobi Transform and tropical distances for metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metric graphs are important models for capturing the structure of complex data across various domains. While much effort has been devoted to extracting geometric and topological features from graph data, computational aspects of metric graphs as abstract tropical curves remains unexplored. In this paper, we present the first computational and machine learning-driven study of metric graphs from the perspective of tropical algebraic geometry. Specifically, we study the tropical Abel--Jacobi transform, a vectorization of points on a metric graph via the tropical Abel--Jacobi map into its associated flat torus, the tropical Jacobian. We develop algorithms to compute this transform and investigate how the resulting embeddings depend on different combinatorial models of the same metric graph.
  Once embedded, we compute pairwise distances between points in the tropical Jacobian under two natural metrics: the tropical polarization distance and the Foster--Zhang distance. Computing these distances are generally NP-hard as they turn out to be linked to classical lattice problems in computational complexity, however, we identify a class of metric graphs where fast and explicit computations are feasible. For the general case, we propose practical algorithms for both exact and approximate distance matrix computations using lattice basis reduction and mixed-integer programming solvers. Our work lays the groundwork for future applications of tropical geometry and the tropical Abel--Jacobi transform in machine learning and data analysis.</description>

      <title>Generic Global Rigidity in $\ell_p$-Space and the Identifiability of the $p$-Cayley-Menger Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated result of Gortler-Healy-Thurston (independently, Jackson-Jord\'an for $d=2$) shows that the global rigidity of graphs realised in the $d$-dimensional Euclidean space is a generic property. Extending this result to the global rigidity problem in $\ell_p$-spaces remains an open problem. In this paper we affirmatively solve this problem when $d=2$ and $p$ is an even positive integer. A key tool in our proof is a sufficient condition for the $d$-tangential weak non-defectivity of projective varieties due to Bocci, Chiantini, Ottaviani, and Vannieuwenhoven. By specialising the condition to the $p$-Cayley-Menger variety, which is the $\ell_p$-analogue of the Cayley-Menger variety for Euclidean distance, we provide an $\ell_p$-extension of the generic global rigidity theory of Connelly. As a by-product of our proof, we also offer a purely graph-theoretical characterisation of the $2$-identifiability of an orthogonal projection of the $p$-Cayley-Menger variety along a coordinate axis of the ambient affine space.</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles I: self-similarity, aperiodicity and minimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03652v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For every positive integer $n$, we introduce a set $\mathcal{T}_n$ made of $(n+3)^2$ Wang tiles (unit squares with labeled edges). We represent a tiling by translates of these tiles as a configuration $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. A configuration is valid if the common edge of adjacent tiles has the same label. For every $n\geq1$, we show that the Wang shift $\Omega_n$, defined as the set of valid configurations over the tiles $\mathcal{T}_n$, is self-similar, aperiodic and minimal for the shift action. We say that $\{\Omega_n\}_{n\geq1}$ is a family of metallic mean Wang shifts, since the inflation factor of the self-similarity of $\Omega_n$ is the positive root of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$. This root is sometimes called the $n$-th metallic mean, and in particular, the golden mean when $n=1$, and the silver mean when $n=2$. When $n=1$, the set of Wang tiles $\mathcal{T}_1$ is equivalent to the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles.</description>

      <title>Allard's interior $\varepsilon$-Regularity Theorem in Alexandrov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove Allard's Interior $\varepsilon$-Regularity Theorem for $m$-dimensional varifolds with generalized mean curvature in $L^p_{loc}$, for $p \in \mathbb{R}$ such that $p&gt;m$, in Alexandrov spaces of dimension $n$ with double-sided bounded intrinsic sectional curvature. We first give an intrinsic proof of this theorem in the case of varifolds in Riemannian manifolds of dimension $n$ whose metric tensor is at least of class $\mathcal{C}^2$, without using Nash's Isometric Embedding Theorem. This approach provides explicitly computable constants that depend only on $n$, $m$, the injectivity radius and bounds on the sectional curvature, which is essential for proving our main theorem, as we establish it through a density argument in the topological space of Riemannian manifolds with positive lower bounds on the injectivity radius and double-sided bounds on sectional curvature, equipped with the $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}$ topology, for every $\alpha \in ]0,1[$ (in fact, it is enough with the $W^{2,q}$ topology for some suitable $q$ large enough).</description>
