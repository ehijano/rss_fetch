      <title>Two-shot learning of multiple strange attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The brain combines short- and long-term memory to process, store, and recall multiple different pieces of information. Inspired by this and recent results on multifunctional and parameter-aware learning, we extend a new machine learning technique that combines short- and long-term memory units, specifically, a system consisting of a next-generation reservoir computer (NGRC) and extremely randomized trees (ERT), to process, store, and recall multiple different strange attractors. We train the combined NGRC+ERT system using a two-shot learning approach which significantly improves performance by filtering out unnecessary features, thereby avoiding extensive hyperparameter optimization. We first show that an NGRC+ERT system achieves highly accurate reconstruction of the short- and long-term dynamics of both the Lorenz and Halvorsen chaotic attractors when using an exponential filtering scheme. We validate these finding by training the NGRC+ERT system to reconstruct different pairs of attractors and also a greater number of attractors. We focus on the task of training a single NGRC+ERT system to reconstruct 16 different attractors and show that sufficient index-based separation in feature space suppresses unwanted switching dynamics, thus stabilizing long-term memory recall. Finally, we identify that defects in short-term memory processing can provoke failure modes in long-term memory recall resulting in confabulation.</description>

      <title>From Basins to safe sets: a machine learning perspective on chaotic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of chaos has long relied on computationally intensive methods to quantify unpredictability and design control strategies. Recent advances in machine learning, from convolutional neural networks to transformer architectures, provide new ways to analyze complex phase space structures and enable real time action in chaotic dynamics. In this perspective article, we highlight how data driven approaches can accelerate classical tasks such as estimating basin characterization metrics, or partial control of transient chaos, while opening new possibilities for scalable and robust interventions in chaotic systems. In recent studies, convolutional networks have reproduced classical basin metrics with negligible bias and low computational cost, while transformer based surrogates have computed accurate safety functions within seconds, bypassing the recursive procedures required by traditional methods. We discuss current opportunities, remaining challenges, and future directions at the intersection of nonlinear dynamics and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Integrating prior knowledge in equation discovery: Interpretable symmetry-informed neural networks and symbolic regression via characteristic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven equation discovery aims to reconstruct governing equations directly from empirical observations. A fundamental challenge in this domain is the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, where multiple distinct mathematical models may yield similar errors, thus complicating model selection and failing to guarantee a unique representation of the underlying mechanisms. This issue can be addressed by incorporating inductive biases to constrain the search space and discard the undesirable models. The characteristic curves-based (CCs) framework offers a modular approach ideally suited to this aim. This approach is based on the specification of structural families that possess provable identifiability properties. Crucially, this framework enables practitioners to embed domain expertise directly into the learning process and facilitates the integration of diverse post-processing tools. In this work, we build upon the recent neural network implementation of this formalism (NN-CC), which benefits from the universal approximation capabilities of NNs. Specifically, we extend NN-CC by introducing two inductive biases: (i) symmetry constraints and (ii) post-processing with symbolic regression. Using a chaotic Duffing oscillator and a discontinuous stick-slip model under varying Gaussian noise levels, we show how these extensions systematically improve the discovery process. We also analyze the integration of sparse and symbolic regression (using SINDy and PySR) into the CC-based formalism. These extensions (SINDy-CC and SR-CC) consistently show improvements as prior information is incorporated. By enabling the integration of prior or hypothesized knowledge into the learning and post-processing stages, the CC-based formalism emerges as a promising candidate to address identifiability issues in purely data-driven methods, advancing the goal of interpretable and reliable system identification.</description>

      <title>Phase analysis of Ising machines and their implications on optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08533v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines, which are dynamical systems designed to operate in a parallel and iterative manner, have emerged as a new paradigm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Despite computational advantages, the quality of solutions depends heavily on the form of dynamics and tuning of parameters, which are in general set heuristically due to the lack of systematic insights. Here, we focus on optimal Ising machine design by analyzing phase diagrams of spin distributions in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. We find that that the ground state can be achieved in the phase where the spin distribution becomes binary, and optimal solutions are produced where the binary phase and gapless phase coexist. Our analysis shows that such coexistence phase region can be expanded by carefully placing a digitization operation, giving rise to a family of superior Ising machines, as illustrated by the proposed algorithm digCIM.</description>

      <title>Six-loop renormalization group analysis of the $\phi^4 + \phi^6$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $\lambda\ph^4+g\ph^6$ model using the renormalization group method and the $\ep$ expansion. This model is used in a situation where the coefficients $\lambda$, $g$ and the coefficient $\tau$ of the term $\tau \ph^2$ depend on two parameters $T$ and $P$, and there is a point ($T_c,P_c$) at which $\tau$ and $\lambda$ are zero. This point is named the tricritical point. The description of a system depends on a trajectory that leads to the tricritical point on the plane ($T,P$). In the trajectories, when $\lambda$ goes to zero fast enough, the description is defined by the $\ph^6$ interaction and then the $\ph^4$ term can be considered as a composite operator. In this case, the logarithmic dimension is $d=3$, and the $\ep$ expansion is carried out in the dimension $d=3-2\ep$. The main exponents of the \textit{tricritical} model have been calculated in the third order of the $\ep$ expansion. Taking into account the $\ph^4$ interaction, we were able to calculate the value of the parameter that determines the required decrease rate in $\lambda$ to implement the tricritical behavior. The tricritical dimensions of the composite operators $\ph^k$ for $k=1, 2, 4, 6$ have been computed. The resulting values are compared to those known from a conformal field theory and non-perturbative renormalization group.</description>

      <title>Pattern Formation in Excitable Neuronal Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled excitable systems can generate a variety of patterns. In this work, we investigate coupled Chialvo maps in two dimensions under two types of nearest-neighbor couplings. One coupling produces ringlike patterns, while the other produces spirals. The rings expand with increasing coupling, whereas spirals evolve into turbulence and dissipate at stronger coupling. To quantify these patterns, we introduce an analogue of the discriminant of the velocity gradient tensor and examine the persistence of its sign. For ring-type patterns, the persistence decays more slowly than exponentially, often following a power law or stretched exponential. When spiral structures remain intact, persistence saturates asymptotically and can exhibit superposed periodic oscillations, suggesting complex exponents at early times. These behaviors highlight deep connections with the underlying dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exact coherent structures as building blocks of turbulence on large domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact unstable solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations are thought to underpin the dynamics of turbulence, but are usually computed in minimal computational domains. Here, we extend this dynamical systems approach to spatially extended turbulent flows featuring multiple interacting 'substructures', and show how new simple invariant solutions can be constructed by spatial tiling of exact solutions from small-box calculations. Candidate solutions are found via gradient-based optimization of a scalar loss function which targets autorecurrence in spatially-masked regions of the flow. We apply these ideas to a vertically-extended Kolmogorov flow, where we first identify large numbers of relative periodic orbits (RPOs) which are combinations of high-dissipation, small-box solutions with laminar patches. We then show that vertically-stacked combinations of pairs of distinct small-box RPOs can form robust guesses for dynamically-relevant two-tori in the larger domain. Finally, we show how our optimization procedure can identify 'turbulent' trajectories which locally shadow a small-box RPO for multiple periods in a subdomain. These small-box combinations are possible as the flow spends prolonged periods in a regime where it can be effectively considered as a pair of weakly-coupled small-box systems, due to shielding effects associated with higher-dissipation flow structures.</description>

      <title>Leveraging temporal features of the divergence quantifier of recurrence plot to detect chaos in conservative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recurrence-based divergence quantifier ($DIV$), traditionally applied to dissipative systems, is shown here to be an effective finite-time chaos indicator for conservative dynamics. We benchmark its performances against the well-established fast Lyapunov indicator (FLI), focusing on the standard map, a canonical model of Hamiltonian chaos. Through extensive numerical simulations on moderately long orbits, we find strong agreement between $DIV$ and FLI, supporting the reported correlation between the divergence of recurrences and positive Lyapunov exponents. Additionally, our study sheds more light into asymptotic time properties of $DIV$ by revealing distinct power laws on regular and chaotic components, both in the original and reconstructed phase spaces. In particular, on a regular component, the space average of $DIV$ decays with the time $N$ as $1/N$, mirroring the decay rate of the maximal Lyapunov exponent. On chaotic components, the space average of $DIV$ decreases at a much slower rate, close to $1/\sqrt{N}$. This scaling insight opens new avenues for characterizing chaos from time series. Our numerical results thus demonstrate $DIV$ to be a computationally viable and theoretically rich tool for chaos detection in conservative systems.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Discrete Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20896v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a deterministic denoising algorithm for discrete-state diffusion models. The key idea is to derandomize the generative reverse Markov chain by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm, which induces deterministic state transitions driven by weakly chaotic dynamics. It serves as a direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, without requiring retraining or continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation tasks. In addition, the proposed algorithm yields improved solutions for diffusion-based combinatorial optimization. Thus, herding-based denoising is a simple yet promising approach for enhancing the generative process of discrete diffusion models. Furthermore, our results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of small bubbles in turbulence in non-dilute conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Turbulent flows laden with small bubbles are ubiquitous in many natural and industrial environments. From the point of view of numerical modeling, to be able to handle a very large number of small bubbles in direct numerical simulations, one traditionally relies on the one-way coupling paradigm. There, bubbles are passively advected and are non-interacting, implicitly assuming dilute conditions. Here, we study bubbles that are four-way coupled, where both the feedback on the fluid and excluded-volume interactions between bubbles are taken into account. We find that, while the back-reaction from the bubble phase onto the fluid phase remains energetically small under most circumstances, the excluded-volume interactions between bubbles can have a significant influence on the Lagrangian statistics of the bubble dynamics. We show that as the volume fraction of bubbles increases, the preferential concentration of bubbles in filamentary high-vorticity regions decreases as these strong vortical structures get filled up; this happens at a volume fraction of around one percent for $\textrm{Re}_\lambda=O(10^2)$. We furthermore study the influence on the Lagrangian velocity structure function as well as pair dispersion, and find that, while the mean dispersive behavior remains close to that obtained from one-way coupling simulations, some evident signatures of bubble collisions can be retrieved from the structure functions and the distribution of the dispersion, even at very small volume fractions. This work not only teaches us about the circumstances under which four-way coupling becomes important, but also opens up new directions towards probing and ultimately manipulating coherent vortical structures in small-scale turbulence using bubbles.</description>
