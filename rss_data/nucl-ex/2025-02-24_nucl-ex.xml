      <title>Measuring dark currents in multiple cryogenic SiPMs with sub-pA sensitivity using an automated IV multiplexer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the design of an automated current-voltage (IV) multiplexer (MUX) that enables accurate measurement of the dark current in cryogenic silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs), achieving a sensitivity equivalent to detecting less than one avalanche per second. Dynamic pulse-counting measurements were used as a benchmark for reconstructing the dark current in static IV measurements. The IV-MUX features 15 channels on a single board and up to seven boards can be connected in parallel under the control of one Arduino microcontroller. To minimize leakage and enhance performance, the layout includes guard rings and high-isolation relays, enabling resolution of currents as small as 49 fA. The IV-MUX can be integrated into systems designed for IV or pulse-counting measurements, enabling seamless switching between IV and pulse-counting modes. Moreover, the IV-MUX is vacuum-compatible, validated by testing an SiPM array in a cryostat. This feature reduces the need for multiple feedthroughs when testing sensor arrays in vacuum. The design is open source and can be used to facilitate rapid and automated testing of SiPMs or similar low-current devices in one measurement cycle.</description>

      <title>Examination of the multiple-scattering expansion in the four-nucleon system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The elastic neutron-${}^3\mathrm{H}$ scattering at intermediate energies is studied using rigorous integral equations solved in the momentum-space partial-wave basis. The four-particle transition operators are expanded into multiple-scattering series in terms of subsystem transition operators. Various approximations resulting from truncation of the series in different ways are evaluated and their validity is investigated. They fail at lower energies but at higher energies provide a rough reproduction of exact results at small scattering angles. In the large-angle region all approximations fail heavily, indicating that the scattering amplitude results from a delicate interplay of many multiple-scattering terms. The partial-wave analysis reveals that the developed approximations are reliable in higher partial waves, and for practical calculations an efficient ``hybrid'' approach is proposed, combining exact amplitudes in lower partial waves with approximations in higher partial waves. The implications for often used approximation of the first order in two-body transition matrix and development of microscopic optical potentials are discussed.</description>

      <title>Projective imagining of high-energy nuclei through coherent exclusive vector meson production in electron-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the major goals of the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) is to better understand the distributions of quarks and gluons inside nuclei at high-energy. A principal measurement is coherent exclusive vector meson (VM) production in diffractive $eA$ collisions. The gluon spatial distribution inside the nucleus can be obtained through a Fourier transform of the nuclear momentum transfer ($|t|$) distribution for these VMs. However, the $|t|$ distribution is one of the most challenging measurements at the EIC. This research aims to overcome one of the main obstacles in this measurement: limited precision in measuring $|t|$, making it difficult to resolve the diffractive pattern from coherent events. We employ a method for reconstructing $|t|$ by utilizing the electron beam polarization in $eA$ collisions and measuring the projected $|t|$ distribution to overcome this complication. Through the study of diffractive VM production, we carry out an experimental simulation of how the detector effect would change the extracted nuclear geometry and how to use projective techniques to avoid defects. This technique will allow us to measure the diffractive pattern in coherent events more precisely, providing a potential solution for a critical measurement that is difficult for the EIC baseline detector.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Thermal Management Strategies for the Silicon Detectors of CBM at FAIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lightweight thermal management is central to the design of the all-silicon Inner Tracker of the Compressed Baryonic Matter Experiment (CBM) at the Facility for Antiproton and Ion Research (FAIR). This experiment aims to study strongly interacting matter at neutron star core densities through fixed-target Au-Au collisions ($\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 2.9 - 4.9$\,GeV; up to 10$^7$ beam-target interactions per second; polar angular acceptance of $2.5^{\circ} \leq \Theta \leq 25^{\circ}$). Studies with thermal demonstrators for both the pixel-based Micro Vertex Detector and the strip-based Silicon Tracking System have validated their thermal management strategies, preparing them for series production now and global commissioning in 2028.</description>

      <title>One-proton emission of $^{102}$Sb and its sensitivity to proton-neutron interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23418v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-proton emission from the $^{102}$Sb nucleus is discussed, assuming an inert $^{100}$Sn core and the valence proton and neutron. There are experimentally measured bound states in the $^{100}$Sn-neutron system, whereas no particle-bound $^{100}$Sn-proton state has been observed. With time-dependent three-body calculations, the $1^+$ ground state of $^{102}$Sb is suggested as a possible proton emitter. This conclusion is reached by assuming a weakening effect on the proton-neutron ($pn$) interaction with respect to a bare deuteron. An analogous phenomenon is necessary to reproduce the empirical binding energies of $^{42}$Sc and $^{18}$F. Continuous shift from the unbound to bound regions by changing the $pn$-interaction strength is demonstrated. The lower limit of lifetime is evaluated as $\tau \gtrsim 4.4 \times 10^{-18}$ seconds in the no-$pn$-interaction limit. However, the actual lifetime is expected as longer with a finite $pn$ interaction. Observation of a resonant state in $^{102}$Sb and its decay would provide a benchmark of the $pn$-pairing correlation.</description>

      <title>Scintillation and Timing Performance of a 3at% Yttrium-Doped Barium Fluoride Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the scintillation and timing performance of a new developed 200 * 20 mm * 20 mm large size barium fluoride crystal doped with 3at% yttrium (BaF2:Y) to enhance the application for high time resolution. This doping effectively suppresses the slow scintillation component while maintaining most of the fast component, as confirmed by X-ray excited luminescence measurements. The BaF2:Y crystal demonstrated a transmittance of near 90% in the visible spectrum and a light response uniformity parameter of delta = (-2.74 +- 1.15)% when coupled with the tail end. The actual yttrium content varied from 2.1at% near the seed end to 3.7at% at the tail end. The assembled large BaF2:Y detector with silicon photomultipliers exhibited a time resolution of (82.2 +- 2.6) ps using constant fraction discrimination method in a cosmic ray test and (140.1 +- 3.8) ps using a low fixed threshold method in a beam test at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility with an 1.35 GeV electron beam. These results indicate the significant potential of BaF2:Y crystal for various applications, such as detectors for particle physics and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>Puzzling $B(E2;0^+\rightarrow 2^+)$ strength in the proton dripline nucleus $^{36}$Ca</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the $E2$ transition rate from the ground state to the first 2$^+$ excited state of the proton dripline nucleus $^{36}$Ca show an unusual pattern when compared to its isotopic neighbor $^{38}$Ca: despite having a higher $E_x(2_1^+)$ excitation energy, the $B(E2; 0^+_1\rightarrow 2^+_1)$ rate in $^{36}$Ca is larger. The question that naturally arises is to what extent this observation can be attributed to the unbound character of the $2^+_1$ state. To understand the influence of the continuum space on the low-energy properties of $^{36}$Ca, we carried out Gamow shell model calculations that can account for the continuum coupling effects. We found that in the threshold $2^+$ state, $^{36}$Ca is spatially diffused, which accounts for the abnormal $B(E2)$ trend observed.</description>
