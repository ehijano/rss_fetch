      <title>Orbital Modeling of HII 1348B: An Eccentric Young Substellar Companion in the Pleiades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs with known physical properties (e.g., age and mass) are essential for constraining models of the formation and evolution of substellar objects. We present new high-contrast imaging observations of the circumbinary brown dwarf HII 1348B $\mathord{-}$ one of the few known substellar companions in the Pleiades cluster. We observed the system in the infrared (IR) $L^\prime$ band with the Large Binocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) in dual-aperture direct imaging mode (i.e., with the two telescope apertures used separately) on 2019 September 18. The observations attained a high signal-to-noise ratio ($\mathrm{SNR} &gt; 150$) photometric detection and relative astrometry with uncertainties of ${\sim}5 \ \mathrm{mas}$. This work presents the first model of the companion's orbital motion using relative astrometry from five epochs across a total baseline of 23 years. Orbital fits to the compiled data show the companion's semimajor axis to be $a = 140 \substack{+130 \\ -30} \ \mathrm{au}$ with an eccentricity of $e = 0.78 \substack{+0.12 \\ -0.29}$. We infer that HII 1348B has a mass of $60\mathord{-}63 \pm 2 \ \mathrm{M_J}$ from comparison to brown dwarf evolutionary models given the well-constrained distance and age of the Pleiades. No other objects were detected in the HII 1348 system, and through synthetic planet injection and retrievals we establish detection limits at a cluster age of $112 \pm 5$ Myr down to ${\sim}10\mathord{-}30 \ \mathrm{M_J}$ for companions with projected separations of $21.5\mathord{-}280 \ \text{au}$. With this work, HII 1348B becomes the second directly imaged substellar companion in the Pleiades with measured orbital motion after HD 23514B.</description>

      <title>JWST Reveals Varied Origins Between Jupiter's Irregular Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report observations of eight Jovian irregular satellites with JWST's NIRSpec instrument: Himalia, Elara, Pasiphae, Sinope, Lysithea, Carme, Ananke, and Themisto. Irregular satellite families, which are presumed to have formed via collisions, contain various Trojan-like and C-type-asteroid-like surfaces. We sample the three largest members of the Himalia satellite family, detecting the presence of complexed CO$_2$ and a unique absorption band from $\sim2.7-3.6\ \mu m$ whose character correlates with satellite size. The two largest irregular satellites, Himalia family members Himalia and Elara, contain ammoniated phyllosilicates that are not seen in the meteorite inventory. We propose that the Himalia parent body was heterogeneous and formed with materials similar to Ceres-like ammonium-bearing asteroids. Several small ($D\sim 10km$) irregular satellites closely track the colors and absorption bands of ``red'' Jovian Trojans, demonstrating that these compositions are retained amongst the products of collisions that occurred after Jovian capture. We report the first detection of aqueous alteration products in the retrograde satellite swarm, finding Ananke's 3 micron band to closely match phyllosilicates seen in C2 chondrites. Notably, objects with OH absorption features similar to the Trojan asteroid Eurybates are found in both the retrograde Pasiphae family and the prograde Himalia family, confounding a simple link between such materials and a single surface type. The irregular satellites appear consistent with some materials that experienced alteration from liquid water and others that did not. Consequently, Jupiter may have captured bodies that formed from different initial compositions, or bodies that experienced different levels of heating, driving differential alteration processes.</description>

      <title>Searching for GEMS: Discovery and Characterization of Two Brown Dwarfs Around M Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs bridge the gap between stars and planets, providing valuable insight into both planetary and stellar formation mechanisms. Yet the census of transiting brown dwarf companions, in particular around M dwarf stars, remains incomplete. We report the discovery of two transiting brown dwarfs around low-mass hosts using a combination of space- and ground-based photometry along with near-infrared radial velocities. We characterize TOI-5389Ab ($68.0^{+2.2}_{-2.2} \ \mj$) and TOI-5610b ($40.4^{+1.0}_{-1.0} \ \mj$), two moderately massive brown dwarfs orbiting early M dwarf hosts ($\teff = 3569 \pm 59 \ K$ and $3618 \pm 59 \ K$, respectively). For TOI-5389Ab, the best fitting parameters are period $P=10.40046 \pm 0.00002$ days, radius $R_{\rm BD}=0.824^{+0.033}_{-0.031}$~\rj, and low eccentricity $e=0.0962^{+0.0027}_{-0.0046}$. In particular, this constitutes one of the most extreme substellar-stellar companion-to-host mass ratios of $q=0.150$. For TOI-5610b, the best fitting parameters are period $P=7.95346 \pm 0.00002$ days, radius $R_{\rm BD}=0.887^{+0.031}_{-0.031}$ \rj, and moderate eccentricity $e=0.354^{+0.011}_{-0.012}$. Both targets are expected to have shallow but potentially observable secondary transits: $\lesssim 500$ ppm in Johnson K band for both. A statistical analysis of M-dwarf/BD systems reveals for the first time that those at short orbital periods ($P &lt; 13$ days) exhibit a dearth of $13 \mj &lt; M_{\rm BD} &lt; 40 \mj$ companions ($q$ $&lt;$ 0.1) compared to those at slightly wider separations.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of new radio occultation observations among small satellites at Venus by data assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conducted observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) for radio occultation measurements (RO) among small satellites, which are expected to be useful for future Venus missions. The effectiveness of the observations based on realistic orbit calculations was evaluated by reproduction of the "cold collar", a unique thermal structure in the polar atmosphere of Venus. Pseudo-temperature observations for the OSSEs were provided from the Venus atmospheric GCM in which the cold collar was reproduced by the thermal forcing. The vertical temperature distributions between 40 and 90 km altitudes at observation points were assimilated. The result showed that the cold collar was most clearly reproduced in the case where the temperature field in high-latitudes was observed twice a day, suggesting that the proposed observation is quite effective to improve the polar atmospheric structure at least. Although the cold collar was also reproduced in the OSSEs for Longwave Infrared Camera (LIR) observations, the result seemed unrealistic and inefficient compared to that obtained in the RO OSSEs. The present study shows that the OSSEs can be used to evaluate observation plans and instruments in terms of reproducibility of specific atmospheric phenomena, and applied to future missions targeting planetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>Viscous circumbinary protoplanetary discs -- II. Disc effects on the binary orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than half of all stars are part of binaries, and many form in a common circumbinary disc. The interaction with the binary shapes the disc to feature a large eccentric inner cavity and spirals in the inner disc. The shape of the cavities is linked to binary and disc properties like viscosity and scale height, and the disc and cavity shape influences the orbital evolution of the binary stars.
  This is the second part of the study in which we use 2D hydrodynamic long-term simulations for a range of viscous parameters relevant to protoplanetary discs to understand the interaction between young stars and the circumbinary disc. The long-term simulations allow us to study how disc shape and exchange of mass, momentum and energy between binary and disc depend on the precession angle between disc and binary orbit on time scales of thousands of binary orbits.
  We find a considerable, periodic interaction between the precession of the disc and the binary eccentricity that can significantly exceed the precession-averaged change in eccentricity. We further confirm that thin discs ($H/R&lt;0.05$) lead to shrinking binary orbits, also in the regime of low viscosity, $\alpha=10^{-3}$. In general, the disc can excite eccentricity in binaries with initial eccentricities in the range of $e_\mathrm{bin}=0.05-0.4$. In most cases, the terms aiding shrinking or expansion and circularisation or excitation are nearly balanced, and the evolution of the binary semi-major axis and eccentricity will be sensitive to the ratio of mass accretion between the secondary and primary components.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the multi-planetary system of the nearby star HD 20794: Confirmation of a low-mass planet in the habitable zone of a nearby G-dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close-by Earth analogs and super-Earths are of primary importance because they will be preferential targets for the next generation of direct imaging instruments. Bright and close-by G-to-M type stars are preferential targets in radial velocity surveys to find Earth analogs. We present an analysis of the RV data of the star HD 20794, a target whose planetary system has been extensively debated in the literature. The broad time span of the observations makes it possible to find planets with signal semi-amplitudes below 1 m/s in the habitable zone. We monitored the system with ESPRESSO. We joined ESPRESSO data with the HARPS data, including archival data and new measurements from a recent program. We applied the post-processing pipeline YARARA to HARPS data to correct systematics, improve the quality of RV measurements, and mitigate the impact of stellar activity. Results. We confirm the presence of three planets, with periods of 18.3142 +/- 0.0022 d, 89.68 +/- 0.10 d, and 647.6 +/- 2.6 d, along with masses of 2.15 +/- 0.17 MEarth, 2.98 +/- 0.29 MEarth, and 5.82 +/- 0.57 MEarth respectively. For the outer planet, we find an eccentricity of 0.45 +/- 0.10, whereas the inner planets are compatible with circular orbits. The latter is likely to be a rocky planet in the habitable zone of HD 20794. From the analysis of activity indicators, we find evidence of a magnetic cycle with a period around 3000 d, along with evidence pointing to a rotation period around 39 d. We have determined the presence of a system of three planets orbiting the solar-type star HD 20794. This star is bright (V=4.34 mag) and close (d = 6.04 pc), and HD 20794 d resides in the stellar habitable zone, making this system a high-priority target for future atmospheric characterization with direct imaging facilities.</description>

      <title>Reassessing the origin and evolution of Ecliptic Comets in the Planet-9 Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A group of newly observed extreme trans-Neptunian objects exhibit unexpected orbital confinement, characterized by the alignment of orbital angular momentum vectors and apsidal lines. It is proposed that an undiscovered giant planet, named Planet-9, exists in the solar system's outer regions and causes this clustering. Initial studies suggested Planet-9 could have a mass of 15 Earth masses. However, such a massive planet strongly interacts with scattered disk objects (SDOs; 50 &lt; a &lt; 1000 au) and influences the orbits of short-period comets, resulting in orbital inclinations inconsistent with observations. This study models the formation and long-term evolution of trans-Neptunian object populations and the Oort cloud during the solar system's dynamical instability, using revised parameters for Planet-9. Simulations assume Planet-9 has a mass of 7.5 Earth masses, an inclination of ~20 degrees, a semi-major axis of ~600 au, and an eccentricity of ~0.3. Results suggest a less massive Planet-9 aligns with observed trans-Neptunian object inclinations and the number of ecliptic comets (D &gt; 10 km). Distant Kuiper belt objects with 40 &lt; q &lt; 100 au and 200 &lt; a &lt; 500 au, particularly with significant inclinations, are more likely to align apsidally with Planet-9, with an anti-aligned-to-aligned ratio of 0.5-0.7. Lower inclination objects (&lt;20 degrees) exhibit significant apsidal anti-alignment, with an anti-aligned-to-aligned ratio of 2-4. These findings offer a new observational direction to refine the search for Planet-9.</description>

      <title>Keck and Gemini characterization of $Hayabusa2\#$ rendezvous target 1998 KY$_{26}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-earth asteroid (NEA) 1998 KY$_{26}$ is a target of the $Hayabusa2\#$ spacecraft, which it will rendezvous with in July 2031. The asteroid has been noted to rotate rapidly and has a large out-of-plane nongravitational acceleration. We present observations consisting of deep g and R band imaging obtained with the Keck I/Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (LRIS) and visible spectroscopy from Gemini North /Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (Gemini N/GMOS) taken of 1998 KY$_{26}$ on 2024 June 8-9 when the asteroid was $\sim$0.037 au from the Earth. The asteroid lacks the appearance of a dust coma and has a surface brightness profile similar to nearby background stars in the deep images. The spectrum of 1998 KY$_{26}$ from the combined LRIS/GMOS observations most closely resembles Xe-types possessing a spectral slope of 6.71$\pm$0.43 $\%$ 100 nm$^{-1}$, and color indices: g-r = 0.63$\pm$0.03, r-i = 0.15$\pm$0.03, i-z = 0.05$\pm$0.04. From our deep image stacks, we compute a 3$\sigma$ upper limit on the dust production of 1998 KY$_{26}$ of $&lt;$10$^{-5}$ kg s$^{-1}$, $&lt;$10$^{-2}$ kg s$^{-1}$, and $&lt;$10$^{-1}$ kg s$^{-1}$ assuming $\mathrm{\mu}$m, mm, and cm size dust particles. In addition, we compare the orbit of 1998 KY$_{26}$ and other known asteroids with large nongravitational parameters with NEA population models, finding the majority, including 1998 KY$_{26}$, likely originated from the inner Main Belt, while the second most numerous group originates from the outer Main Belt, followed by a third group possibly originating from the Jupiter Family Comet population. Given its inner Main Belt origin, its Xe-type, and rapid rotation, we hypothesize that the nongravitational acceleration of 1998 KY$_{26}$ may be caused by the shedding of large dust grains from its surface due to its rotation rather than H$_2$O vapor outgassing.</description>

      <title>Dangerous dust clouds above lunar surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-limited space missions may miss rare occurrences of very dense clouds of lunar dust. At the same time, the information provided by the Earth-based monitoring of the Moon during at least the last three centuries still remains unused. In the present study, we fill this data analysis gap. The survey of historical reports of the 18-19 centuries about supposed lunar atmosphere manifestations, as well as the available data on too long-lasting stellar occultations by the lunar limb, enable us revealing numerous evidences of the lunar dust phenomena. By modeling of the conditions of such observations, we determine the geometrical parameters of the dust clouds, which scattered the sunlight during the particular events. Using this information, as well as the Mie scattering theory, we estimate the concentration of dust and its damaging effect at different orbits of a possible spacecraft. It was found that the some observed dust clouds of sub-micron grains could crash a space-vehicle at the low (&lt;10 km) altitudes, similar to the incidents with landers Vikram, Beresheet, Hakuto-R M1, Luna-25, etc. The statistics of dust clouds' appearance enabled a reconstruction of a typical shape of a local dust cloud which resembles the shape of an impact plume. This, together with the revealed seasonal periodicity of observational manifestations of the dust phenomena, confirms a hypothesis on the meteoroid impact nature of the majority of the circumlunar dust clouds. At the same time, the discovered additional periodicity of the dust cloud appearance at half of synodic lunar month argue for an additional non-impact source of the circumlunar dust, connected with the lunar outgassing events, controlled by the solar tidal effects, completely unstudied. Moreover, the tendency of dust clouds to be observed during the low-level solar activity raises a question on possible dust pick up by the solar wind flow.</description>

We report flux and linear polarization measurements of the young stellar object HL Tau in the bands A (53 $\mu$m), C (89 $\mu$m), D (155 $\mu$m), and E (216 $\mu$m) with SOFIA/HAWC+. The orientation of the polarization vectors is strongly wavelength-dependent and can be attributed to different wavelength-dependent polarization mechanisms in the disk and its local environment. In bands A, C, and D, the orientation of the polarization is roughly consistent with a value of 114{\deg} at the maximum emission. Hereby, the magnetic field direction is close to that of the spin axis of the disk. In contrast, in band E, the orientation is nearly parallel to the minor axis of the projection of the inclined disk. Based on a viscous accretion disk model combined with a surrounding envelope, we performed polarized three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations. In particular, we considered polarization due to emission and absorption by aligned dust grains, and polarization due to scattering of the thermal reemission (self-scattering). At wavelengths of 53 $\mu$m, 89 $\mu$m, and 155 $\mu$m, we were able to reproduce the observed orientation of the polarization vectors. Here, the origin of polarization is consistent with polarized emission by aligned non-spherical dust grains. In contrast, at a wavelength of 216 $\mu$m, the polarization pattern could not be fully matched, however, applying self-scattering and assuming dust grain radii up to 35 $\mu$m, we were able to reproduce the flip in the orientation of polarization. We conclude that the polarization is caused by dichroic emission of aligned dust grains in the envelope, while at longer wavelengths, the envelope becomes transparent and the polarization is dominated by self-scattering in the disk.</description>

Abstract: Previous studies have shown that there is considerable variation in the dust-to-gas density ratio in the vicinity of low-mass planets undergoing growth. This can lead to a significant change in the planetary momentum exerted by the gas and solid material. However, due to the low dust-to-gas mass ratio of protoplanetary disks, the back-reaction of the solid material, is often neglected. We study the effect of the back-reaction of solid material on the torques felt by low-mass planets. We performed locally isothermal, 2D hydrodynamic simulations of planet-disk interactions. Low-mass planets in the range of 0.1-10MEarth accrete only solid material. Simulations were compared with and without taking into account the back-reaction of the solid material on the gas. The solid component was assumed to have a fixed Stokes number in the range 0.01-10. In general, the inclusion of back-reaction results in a greater number of models with positive torque values compared to models that neglect back-reaction. It is clear, therefore, that the simulation of planetary growth and migration via hydrodynamic modeling requires the inclusion of solid-gas back-reaction. As a result of the back-reaction and accretion, a Mars-sized planetary embryo will experience positive total torques from the disk containing coupled solid components St&lt;=0.01. Earth-mass planets also experience positive total torques from the disk containing boulder-sized solid components 2&lt;=St&lt;=5. The accretion of weakly coupled solid material tends to increase the positive torques and decrease the negative torques. Our results suggest that the combined effect of back-reaction and accretion is beneficial to the formation of planetary systems by reducing the likelihood of a young planet being engulfed by the central star.</description>
