      <title>The Patterns of Digital Deception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current consumer-protection debates focus on the powerful new data-analysis techniques that have disrupted the balance of power between companies and their customers. Online tracking enables sellers to amass troves of historical data, apply machine-learning tools to construct detailed customer profiles, and target those customers with tailored offers that best suit their interests. It is often a win-win. Sellers avoid pumping dud products and consumers see ads for things they actually want to buy. But the same tools are also used for ill -- to target vulnerable members of the population with scams specially tailored to prey on their weaknesses. The result has been a dramatic rise in online fraud that disproportionately impacts those least able to bear the loss.
  The law's response has been technology centric. Lawmakers race to identify those technologies that drive consumer deception and target them for regulatory restrictions. But that approach comes at a major cost. General-purpose data-analysis and communications tools have both desirable and undesirable uses, and uniform restrictions on their use impede the good along with the bad. A superior approach would focus not on the technological tools of deception but on what this Article identifies as the legal patterns of digital deception -- those aspects of digital technology that have outflanked the law's existing mechanisms for redressing consumer harm. This Article reorients the discussion from the power of new technologies to the shortcomings in existing regulatory structures that have allowed for their abuse. Focus on these patterns of deception will allow regulators to reallocate resources to offset those shortcomings and thereby enhance efforts to combat online fraud without impeding technological innovation.</description>

      <title>Pivoting B2B platform business models: From platform experimentation to multi-platform integration to ecosystem envelopment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The landscape of digital servitization in the manufacturing sector is evolving, marked by a strategic shift from traditional product-centric to platform business models (BMs). Manufacturing firms often employ a blend of approaches to develop business-to-business (B2B) platforms, leading to significant reconfigurations in their BMs. However, they frequently encounter failures in their B2B platform development initiatives, leading them to abandon initial efforts and pivot to alternative platform strategies. Therefore, this study, through an in-depth case study of a manufacturer in the energy sector, articulates a three-phase pivoting framework for B2B platform BMs, including platform development and platform strategy. Initially, the manufacturer focused on asset-based product sales supplemented by asset maintenance services and followed an emergent platformization strategy characterized by the rise of multiple, independent B2B platforms catering to diverse functions. Next, focusing on the imposed customer journey strategy, the firm shifted towards a strategic multi-platform integration into an all-encompassing platform supported by artificial intelligence (AI), signaling a maturation of the platform BM to combine a wide range of services into an energy-performance-based contract. Finally, the last step of the firm's platform BM evolution consisted of a deliberate platform strategy open to external stakeholders and enveloping its data-driven offerings within a broader platform ecosystem. This article advances B2B platform BMs and digital servitization literature, highlighting the efficacy of a progressive approach and strategic pivoting.</description>

      <title>The impact of China's economic growth on poverty alleviation: From absolute to relative poverty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the extent to which China's economic growth and development influence poverty levels, focusing on the dichotomy between absolute and relative poverty. Leveraging data from sources like the World Bank, Statista, and Macrotrends, and employing economic frameworks such as the Lewis Model, Poverty Headcount Ratio, and Gini Coefficient, the study examines China's transformation from combating absolute poverty to addressing relative poverty. The findings highlight that robust economic growth from 2011 to 2022, driven by urban development and rural infrastructure investments, successfully eradicated absolute poverty and elevated rural incomes. However, this progress also exacerbated income inequality, as evidenced by a rising Gini Coefficient, complicating efforts to alleviate relative poverty. Through multidimensional analyses encompassing regional disparities, migration patterns, educational access, and societal factors, the paper underscores the dual impact of economic development on poverty alleviation. It concludes by advocating for policies that balance economic growth with equitable resource distribution to tackle persistent relative poverty and foster sustainable development.</description>

      <title>Consumption Periods in Advance Selling Auctions: Evidence from US Timber Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates products sold before consumption and examines how the duration of the consumption periods and the choice of selling mechanism influence sellers' revenue. Using empirical data from timber auctions, we identify buyers' tendency to delay consumption to resolve payoff uncertainty and reveal heterogeneous motivations among buyers. Through structural estimation, we uncover key parameters for each buyer type, including sensitivity to realized payoffs and consumption-related costs. Leveraging these estimates, we perform counterfactual analyses to propose revenue-enhancing consumption periods and selling mechanisms. Our findings suggest that extending the consumption periods is likely to increase revenue, with the magnitude depending on the selling mechanism, the composition of buyer types, and the number of interested buyers.</description>

      <title>Digital transformation: A systematic review and bibliometric analysis from the corporate finance perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital transformation significantly impacts firm investment, financing, and value enhancement. A systematic investigation from the corporate finance perspective has not yet been formed. This paper combines bibliometric and content analysis methods to systematically review the evolutionary trend, status quo, hotspots and overall structure of research in digital transformation from 2011 to 2024. The study reveals an emerging and rapidly growing focus on digital transformation research, particularly in developed countries. We categorize the literature into three areas according to bibliometric clustering: the measurements (qualitative and quantitative), impact factors (internal and external), and the economic consequences (investment, financing, and firm value). These areas are divided into ten sub-branches, with a detailed literature review. We also review the existing theories related to digital transformation, identify the current gaps in these papers, and provide directions for future research on each sub-branches.</description>

      <title>Integrating Natural Language Processing Techniques of Text Mining Into Financial System: Applications and Limitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The financial sector, a pivotal force in economic development, increasingly uses the intelligent technologies such as natural language processing to enhance data processing and insight extraction. This research paper through a review process of the time span of 2018-2023 explores the use of text mining as natural language processing techniques in various components of the financial system including asset pricing, corporate finance, derivatives, risk management, and public finance and highlights the need to address the specific problems in the discussion section. We notice that most of the research materials combined probabilistic with vector-space models, and text-data with numerical ones. The most used technique regarding information processing is the information classification technique and the most used algorithms include the long-short term memory and bidirectional encoder models. The research noticed that new specific algorithms are developed and the focus of the financial system is mainly on asset pricing component. The research also proposes a path from engineering perspective for researchers who need to analyze financial text. The challenges regarding text mining perspective such as data quality, context-adaption and model interpretability need to be solved so to integrate advanced natural language processing models and techniques in enhancing financial analysis and prediction. Keywords: Financial System (FS), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Software and Text Engineering, Probabilistic, Vector-Space, Models, Techniques, TextData, Financial Analysis.</description>

      <title>Cool, But What About Oracles? An Oracle-Based Perspective on Blockchain Integration in the Accounting Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bitcoin Network is a sophisticated accounting system that allows its underlying cryptocurrency to be trusted even in the absence of a reliable financial authority. Given its undeniable success, the technology, generally referred to as blockchain, has also been proposed as a means to improve legacy accounting systems. Accounting for real-world data, however, requires the intervention of a third party known as an Oracle, which, having not the same characteristics as a blockchain, could potentially reduce the expected integration benefit. Through a systematic review of the literature, this study aims to investigate whether the papers concerning blockchain integration in accounting consider and address the limitations posed by oracles. A broad overview of the limitations that emerged in the literature is provided and distinguished according to the specific accounting integration. Results support the view that although research on the subject counts numerous articles, actual studies considering oracle limitations are lacking. Interestingly, despite the scarce production of papers addressing oracles in various accounting sectors, reporting for ESG already shows interesting workarounds for oracle limitations, with permissioned chains envisioned as a valid support for the safe storage of sustainability data.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Estimation of Matching Efficiency and Mismatch in Labor Markets via Public Employment Security Offices in Japan, 1972-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20931v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I examine changes in matching efficiency and elasticities in Japan's labor market via Hello Work for unemployed workers from January 1972 to April 2024 using a nonparametric identification approach by y Lange and Papageorgiou (2020). I find a declining trend in matching efficiency, consistent with decreasing job and worker finding rates. The implied match elasticity with respect to unemployment is 0.5-0.9, whereas the implied match elasticity with respect to vacancies varies between -0.4 and 0.4. Decomposing aggregate data into full-time and part-time ones, I find that the sharp decline of matching efficiency after 2015 shown in the aggregate trend is driven by the decline of both full-time and part-time ones. Second, I extend the mismatch index proposed by Sahin et al (2014) to the nonparametric version and develop the computational methodology. I find that the mismatch across occupations is more severe than across prefectures and the original Cobb-Douglas mismatch index is underestimated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A standard roundabout production framework is considered in a dynastic social welfare maximization problem, incorporating critical-level utilitarianism as the guiding principle for social welfare. While critical-level utilitarianism has been established to studying the optimal population size in a static and equitable manner, we apply the same axiology in a dynamic context with respect to capital accumulation and savings and study the optimal generation size, possibly without discounting future generations. Our study is based on a finite-horizon dynamic programming technique. We apply this technique to obtain optimal consumption schedules under a given planning horizon. The findings suggest that the optimal planning horizon (i.e., the optimal generation size) is not necessarily infinite, even when future generations are treated under conditions of ultimate equity.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Estimation of Matching Efficiency and Elasticity on a Private On-the-Job Search Platform: Evidence from Japan, 2014-2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I use proprietary data from the online job scouting platform BizReach in Japan, spanning from 2014 to 2024, to estimate the matching function for high-skill employed workers on a private on-the-job search platform, employing a novel nonparametric approach developed by Lange and Papageorgiou (2020). This analysis is compared to the public off-the-job search platform, Hello Work. The results indicate that matching efficiency on the private platform is both more volatile and higher than that of the public platform, suggesting the increasing popularity of the private platform. The matching elasticity with respect to users consistently hovers around 0.75, while the elasticity with respect to vacancies reaches approximately 1.0, indicating a higher and more balanced elasticity compared to the Hello Work platform. Additionally, the study reveals evidence of industry-level heterogeneity on the private platform.</description>

      <title>Intergenerational Equitable Climate Change Mitigation: Negative Effects of Stochastic Interest Rates; Positive Effects of Financing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Today's decisions on climate change mitigation affect the damage that future generations will bear. Discounting future benefits and costs of climate change mitigation is one of the most critical components of assessing efficient climate mitigation pathways. We extend the DICE model with stochastic discount rates to reflect the uncertain nature of discount rates. Stochastic rates give rise to a stochastic mitigation strategy, resulting in all model quantities becoming stochastic.
  We show that the optimization procedure of the DICE model induces intergenerational inequality: lacking a mechanism to regulate burden, future generations have to bear higher costs from abatement and damage relative to GDP.
  Further, we show that considering uncertainty of discount rates and their feedback to abatement policies, which can be interpreted as successive re-calculation, increases intergenerational inequality (and adds additional risks). Motivated by this, we consider additional financing risks by investigating two modifications of DICE. We find that allowing financing of abatement costs and considering non-linear financing effects for large damages improves intergenerational effort sharing. To conclude our discussion of options to improve intergenerational equity in an IAM, we propose a modified optimization to keep costs below 3% of GDP, resulting in more equal distribution of efforts between generations.</description>
