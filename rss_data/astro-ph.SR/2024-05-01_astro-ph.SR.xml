      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive Stars at Low Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble Space Telescope has devoted 500 orbits to observing 250 massive stars with low metallicity in the ultraviolet (UV) range within the framework of the ULLYSES program. The X-Shooting ULLYSES (XShootU) project enhances the legacy value of this UV dataset by providing high-quality optical and near-infrared spectra, which are acquired using the wide-wavelength-coverage X-shooter spectrograph at ESO's Very Large Telescope. XShootU emphasises the importance of combining UV with optical spectra for the consistent determination of key stellar parameters such as effective temperature, surface gravity, luminosity, abundances, and wind characteristics including mass-loss rates as a function of metallicity. Since uncertainties in these parameters have implications across various branches of astrophysics, the data and modelling generated by the XShootU project are poised to significantly advance our understanding of massive stars at low metallicity. This is particularly crucial for confidently interpreting JWST data of the earliest stellar generations, making XShootU a unique resource for comprehending individual spectra of low-metallicity stars.</description>

      <title>A population of neutron star candidates in wide orbits from Gaia astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report discovery and spectroscopic follow-up of 21 astrometric binaries containing solar-type stars and dark companions with masses near 1.4 $M_{\odot}$. The simplest interpretation is that the companions are dormant neutron stars (NSs), though ultramassive white dwarfs (WDs) and tight WD+WD binaries cannot be fully excluded. We selected targets from Gaia DR3 astrometric binary solutions in which the luminous star is on the main sequence and the dynamically-implied mass of the unseen companion is (a) more than $1.25\,M_{\odot}$ and (b) too high to be any non-degenerate star or close binary. We obtained multi-epoch radial velocities (RVs) over a period of 650 days, spanning a majority of the orbits' dynamic range in RV. The RVs broadly validate the astrometric solutions and significantly tighten constraints on companion masses. Several systems have companion masses that are unambiguously above the Chandrasekhar limit, while the rest have masses between 1.25 and 1.4 $M_{\odot}$. The orbits are significantly more eccentric at fixed period than those of typical WD + MS binaries, perhaps due to natal kicks. Metal-poor stars are overrepresented in the sample: 3 out of 21 objects (14%) have [Fe/H]$\sim-1.5$ and are on halo orbits, compared to $\sim 0.5\%$ of the parent Gaia binary sample. The metal-poor stars are all strongly enhanced in lithium. The formation history of these objects is puzzling: it is unclear both how the binaries escaped a merger or dramatic orbital shrinkage when the NS progenitors were red supergiants, and how they remained bound when the NSs formed. Gaia has now discovered 3 black holes (BHs) in astrometric binaries with masses above 9 $M_{\odot}$, and 21 NSs with masses near $1.4\,M_{\odot}$. The lack of intermediate-mass objects in this sample is striking, supporting the existence of a BH/NS mass bimodality over 4 orders of magnitude in orbital period.</description>

      <title>The Extremely Metal-Poor SN 2023ufx: A Local Analog to High-Redshift Type II Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present extensive observations of the Type II supernova (SN II) 2023ufx which is likely the most metal-poor SN II observed to-date. It exploded in the outskirts of a low-metallicity ($Z_{\rm host} \sim 0.1~Z_\odot$) dwarf ($M_g = -13.23\pm0.15$~mag; $r_e\sim 1$~kpc) galaxy. The explosion is luminous, peaking at $M_g\approx -18.5~$mag, and shows rapid evolution. The $r$-band (pseudo-bolometric) light curve has a shock-cooling phase lasting 20 (17) days followed by a 19 (23)-day plateau. The entire optically-thick phase lasts only $\approx 55~$days following explosion, indicating that the red supergiant progenitor had a thinned H envelope prior to explosion. The early spectra obtained during the shock-cooling phase show no evidence for narrow emission features and limit the pre-explosion mass-loss rate to $\dot{M} \lesssim 10^{-3}~\rm M_\odot$/yr. The photospheric-phase spectra are devoid of prominent metal absorption features, indicating a progenitor metallicity of $\lesssim 0.1~Z_\odot$. The semi-nebular ($\sim 60-130~$d) spectra reveal weak Fe II, but other metal species typically observed at these phases (Ti II, Sc II, Ba II) are conspicuously absent. The late-phase optical and near-infrared spectra also reveal broad ($\approx 10^4~\rm{km}~\rm s^{-1}$) double-peaked H$\alpha$, P$\beta$, and P$\gamma$ emission profiles suggestive of a fast outflow launched during the explosion. Outflows are typically attributed to rapidly-rotating progenitors which also prefer metal-poor environments. This is only the second SN II with $\lesssim 0.1~Z_\odot$ and both exhibit peculiar evolution, suggesting a sizable fraction of metal-poor SNe II have distinct properties compared to nearby metal-enriched SNe II. These observations lay the groundwork for modeling the metal-poor SNe II expected in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Planetary Nebula NGC 2818: Revealing its complex 3D morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out an advanced morpho-kinematic analysis of the Planetary Nebula (PN) NGC 2818, whose complex morphology is described by a basic bipolar component, filamentary structures and a knotty central region. We performed an upgrated 3D Morpho-kinematic (MK) model by employing the SHAPE software, combining for the first time in PNe optical 2D spatially resolved echelle spectra and Fabry-Perot data cubes. The best-fitting 3D model of NGC 2818 successfully reconstructs the main morphology, considering one bipolar component, radial filamentary structures, and an equatorial component as the geometrical locus of the group of cometary knots. The model shows that the equatorial component has the lower expansion velocity of the system at 70 $\pm$ 20 km/s. The velocity of the bipolar component is 120 $\pm$ 20 km/s, while all the filamentary structures were found to expand at higher velocities of 180 $\pm$ 20 km/s. Moreover, Fabry-Perot data revealed for the first time a north-eastern filament expanding at a mean velocity of 80 $\pm$ 20 km/s, while its equivalent counterpart in the southwestern region was confirmed by a new detected substructure in the echelle data. A new detected knotty structure at velocity -40 $\pm$ 20 km/s is also reported, as expelled material from the fragmented eastern lobe of the nebula. We interpret the overall structure of NGC 2818 as the result of the evolution of a binary system that underwent the common envelope phase, in conjunction with the ejections of a magnetized jet, misaligned with respect to the symmetry axis of the bipolar/elliptical shell.</description>

      <title>Using sunRunner3D to interpret the global structure of the heliosphere from in situ measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the large-scale three-dimensional structure of the inner heliosphere, while important in its own right, is crucial for space weather applications, such as forecasting the time of arrival and propagation of coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This study uses sunRunner3D (3D), a 3-D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, to simulate solar wind (SW) streams and generate background states. SR3D employs the boundary conditions generated by CORona-HELiosphere (CORHEL) and the PLUTO code to compute the plasma properties of the SW with the MHD approximation up to 1.1 AU in the inner heliosphere. We demonstrate that SR3D reproduces global features of Corotating Interaction Regions (CIRs) observed by Earth-based spacecraft (OMNI) and the Solar TErrestial RElations Observatory (STEREO)-A for a set of Carrington rotations (CRs) that cover a period that lays in the late declining phase of solar cycle 24. Additionally, we demonstrate that the model solutions are valid in the corotating and inertial frames of references. Moreover, a comparison between SR3D simulations and in-situ measurements shows reasonable agreement with the observations, and our results are comparable to those achieved by Predictive Science Inc.'s Magnetohydrodynamic Algorithm outside a Sphere (MAS) code. We have also undertaken a comparative analysis with the Space Weather Adaptive Simulation Framework for Solar Wind (SWASTi-SW), a PLUTO physics-based model, to evaluate the precision of various initial boundary conditions. Finally, we discuss the disparities in the solutions derived from inertial and rotating frames.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Ion-Proton Differential Speed between ICMEs and Solar Wind near 1 au</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elemental abundance of ICMEs and solar wind near 1 au is often adopted to represent the abundance in the corresponding coronal sources. However, the absolute abundance of heavy ions (relative to hydrogen) near 1 au might be different from the coronal abundance due to the ion-proton differential speed ($V_{ip}$). To illustrate the $V_{ip}$ characteristics and explore whether it influences the absolute abundance analysis for ICMEs and solar wind, we perform a statistical study on the $V_{ip}$ for He$^{2+}$, C$^{5+}$, O$^{6+}$, and Fe$^{10+}$ in both ICMEs and solar wind based on measurements of Advanced Composition Explorer. The results show that the $V_{ip}$ is negligible within ICMEs and slow solar wind ($&lt;$ 400 km s$^{-1}$), while obvious in the intermediate (400 -- 600 km s$^{-1}$) and fast wind ($&gt;$ 600 km s$^{-1}$). Previous studies showed that the $V_{ip}$ in ICMEs keeps negligible during propagation from 0.3 to 5 au, but in solar wind it increases with the decreasing heliocentric distance. Therefore, it might be questionable to infer the absolute abundance of coronal sources through in-situ abundance near 1 au for solar wind. Fortunately, the ion-oxygen (O$^{6+}$) differential speed ($V_{io}$) is negligible for He$^{2+}$, C$^{5+}$, and Fe$^{10+}$ within both ICMEs and solar wind, and previous studies suggested that the $V_{io}$ does not vary significantly with the heliocentric distance. This indicates that various heavy ions always flow at the same bulk speed and their relative abundance (relative to oxygen) near 1 au can represent the coronal abundance for both ICMEs and solar wind.</description>

      <title>Quasi-stars as a Means of Rapid Black Hole Growth in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST observations demonstrate that supermassive black holes (SMBHs) exist by redshifts $z \gtrsim 10$, providing further evidence for "direct collapse" black hole (BH) formation, whereby massive ($\sim 10^{3-5} M_{\odot}$) SMBH seeds are generated within a few Myr as a byproduct of the rapid inflow of gas into the centers of protogalaxies. Here we analyze the intermediate "quasi-star" phase that accompanies some direct collapse models, during which a natal BH accretes mass from and energetically sustains (through accretion) an overlying gaseous envelope. We argue that previous estimates of the maximum BH mass that can be reached during this stage, $\sim 1\%$ of the total quasi-star mass, are unphysical, and arise from underestimating the efficiency with which energy can be transported outward from regions close to the BH. We construct new quasi-star models that consist of an inner, "saturated-convection" region (which conforms to a convection-dominated accretion flow near the BH) matched to an outer, adiabatic envelope. These solutions exist up to a BH mass of $\sim 60\%$ the total quasi-star mass, at which point the adiabatic envelope contains only 2\% of the mass (with the remaining $\sim 38\%$ in the saturated-convection region), and this upper limit is reached within a time of $20-40$ Myr. We conclude that quasi-stars remain a viable route for producing SMBHs at large redshifts, consistent with recent JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Assessing the accuracy of the star formation rate measurements by direct star count in molecular clouds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star formation estimates based on the counting of YSOs is commonly applied to nearby star-forming regions in the Galaxy. With this method, the SFRs are measured using the counts of YSOs in a particular protostellar Class, a typical protostellar mass, and the lifetime associated with this Class. However, the assumptions underlying the validity of the method such as that of a constant star formation history (SFH) and whether the method is valid for all protostellar Classes has never been fully tested. In this work, we use Monte Carlo models to test the validity of the method. We build synthetic clusters in which stars form at times that are randomly drawn from a specified SFH. The latter is either constant or time-dependent with a burst like behavior. The masses of the protostars are randomly drawn from an IMF which can be either similar to that of the Milky Way field or be variable . For each star in every cluster, the lifetimes associated with the different protostellar classes are also randomly drawn from Gaussian distribution functions centered around their most likely value as suggested by the observations. We find that only the SFR derived using the Class 0 population can reproduce the true SFR at all epochs, and this is true irrespective of the shape of the SFH. For a constant SFH, the SFR derived using the more evolved populations of protostars (Classes I, F, II, and III) reproduce the real SFR only at later epochs which correspond to epochs at which their numbers have reached a steady state. For a time-dependent burst-like SFH, all SFR estimates based on the number counts of the evolved populations fail to reproduce the true SFR. We also show how the offsets between Class I and Class II based SFRs and the true SFR plotted as a function of the number ratios of Class I and Class II versus Class III YSOs can be used in order to constrain the SFH of observed molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Pristine Inner Galaxy Survey (PIGS) IX. The largest detailed chemical analysis of very metal-poor stars in the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The most metal-poor stars provide valuable insights into the early chemical enrichment history of a system, carrying the chemical imprints of the first generations of supernovae. The most metal-poor region of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy remains inadequately observed and characterised. To date, only a handful of stars with [Fe/H]$&lt;-2.0$ have been chemically analysed with high-resolution spectroscopy. In this study, we present the most extensive chemical abundance analysis of 12 low-metallicity stars with metallicities down to [Fe/H]$=-3.26$ and located in the main body of Sagittarius. These targets, selected from the Pristine Inner Galaxy survey, were observed using the MIKE high-resolution spectrograph at the Magellan-Clay telescope, which allows us to measure up to 17 chemical species. The chemical composition of these stars reflects the imprint of a variety of type~II supernovae. A combination of low- to intermediate-mass core-collapse and hypernovae ($\sim10-70 M_{\odot}$) is required to account for the abundance patterns of the lighter elements up to the Fe-peak. The trend of the heavy elements suggests the involvement of compact binary merger events and fast-rotating (up to $\sim300$ km s$^{-1}$) intermediate-mass to massive metal-poor stars ($\sim25-120 M_{\odot}$) that are the sources of rapid- and slow-processes, respectively. Additionally, asymptotic giant branch stars contribute to a wide dispersion of [Ba/Mg] and [Ba/Eu]. The absence of an $\alpha-$knee in our data indicates that type Ia supernovae did not contribute in the very metal-poor region ( [Fe/H]$\leq-2.0$). However, they might have started to pollute the interstellar medium at [Fe/H]$&gt;-2.0$, given the relatively low [Co/Fe] in this metallicity region.</description>

      <title>Gas, not dust: Migration of TESS/Gaia hot Jupiters possibly halted by the magnetospheres of protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Abridged) The presence of short-period (&lt; 10 days) planets around main sequence (MS) stars has been associated either with the dust-destruction region or with the magnetospheric gas-truncation radius in the protoplanetary disks that surround them during the pre-MS phase. However, previous analyses have only considered low-mass FGK stars, making it difficult to disentangle the two scenarios. This exploratory study is aimed at testing whether it is the inner dust or gas disk driving the location of short-period, giant planets. By combining TESS and Gaia DR3 data, we identified a sample of 47 intermediate-mass (1.5-3 M$_{\odot}$) MS stars hosting confirmed and firm candidate hot Jupiters. We compared their orbits with the rough position of the inner dust and gas disks, which are well separated around their Herbig stars precursors. We also made a comparison with the orbits of confirmed hot Jupiters around a similarly extracted TESS/Gaia sample of low-mass sources (0.5-1.5 M$_{\odot}$). Our results suggest that the inner gas (and not the dust) disk limits the innermost orbits of hot Jupiters around intermediate-mass stars. These findings also provide tentative support to previous works that have claimed this is indeed the case for low-mass sources. We propose that hot Jupiters could be explained via a combination of the core-accretion paradigm and migration up to the gas-truncation radius, which may be responsible for halting inward migration regardless of the stellar mass regime. Larger samples of intermediate-mass stars with hot Jupiters are necessary to confirm our hypothesis, which implies that massive Herbig stars without magnetospheres (&gt; 3-4 M$_{\odot}$) may be the most efficient in swallowing their newborn planets.</description>

      <title>At the same age, metallicity, and alpha-enhancement, sodium is a more effective tracer of the young and old sequences of the Milky Way disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trends in the enrichment of elements with stellar ages are a powerful avenue to identify unexplained origins of the elements. We investigate the stellar abundance trends of low to intermediate-mass stars using the GALAH DR3 high-resolution spectroscopic dataset of 6234 solar-type stars. Our study explores the elemental abundance [X/Fe] of sodium (Na) with age. We find a pronounced enrichment in [Na/Fe] at super solar metallicity (i.e., [Fe/H] above 0) in the old sequence of Milky Way disc stars, a trend demanding a deeper understanding of the underlying source(s) responsible for the nucleosynthesis. This progressive [Na/Fe] enrichment at the young end of the old sequence has essential implications for Galactic archaeology. In this work, we propose a novel selection technique for separating the Milky Way's thick and thin disc stellar populations (i.e., old and young sequences) based on the observed [Na/Fe] rise of roughly 0.1 dex for stars around 5 - 8 Gyr old. We also compare our selection method to the conventional [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] selection approach, and we find that our new Na-based selection method better disentangles the overlap between young- and old-sequence disc stars at these intermediate ages. This is especially true at super solar [Fe/H], where [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] or [alpha/Fe] vs [Fe/H] separation approaches exhibit a lot of overlap. This new selection method should help us better understand the Milky Way disc's formation history.</description>

      <title>A study of Galactic Plane Planck Galactic Cold Clumps observed by SCOPE and the JCMT Plane Survey</title>

Abstract: We have investigated the physical properties of Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (PGCCs) located in the Galactic Plane, using the JCMT Plane Survey (JPS) and the SCUBA-2 Continuum Observations of Pre-protostellar Evolution (SCOPE) survey. By utilising a suite of molecular-line surveys, velocities and distances were assigned to the compact sources within the PGCCs, placing them in a Galactic context. The properties of these compact sources show no large-scale variations with Galactic environment. Investigating the star-forming content of the sample, we find that the luminosity-to-mass ratio (L/M) is an order of magnitude lower than in other Galactic studies, indicating that these objects are hosting lower levels of star formation. Finally, by comparing ATLASGAL sources that are associated or are not associated with PGCCs, we find that those associated with PGCCs are typically colder, denser, and have a lower L/M ratio, hinting that PGCCs are a distinct population of Galactic Plane sources.</description>

      <title>The M33 Synoptic Stellar Survey. III. Miras and LPVs in griJHKs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for Miras and long-period variables (LPVs) in M33 using griJHKs archival observations from the Canada-France-Hawai'i Telescope. We use multiband information and machine learning techniques to identify and characterize these variables. We recover ~1,300 previously-discovered Mira candidates and identify ~13,000 new Miras and LPVs. We detect for the first time a clear first-overtone pulsation sequence among Mira candidates in this galaxy. We use O-rich, fundamental-mode Miras in the LMC and M33 to derive a distance modulus for the latter of 24.629 +/- 0.046 mag.</description>

      <title>Chemistry in externally FUV irradiated disks in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most stars are born in stellar clusters and their protoplanetary disks, which are the birthplaces of planets, can therefore be affected by the radiation of nearby massive stars. However, little is known about the chemistry of externally irradiated disks, including whether or not their properties are similar to the so-far better-studied isolated disks. Motivated by this question, we present ALMA Band 6 observations of two irradiated Class II protoplanetary disks in the outskirts of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) to explore the chemical composition of disks exposed to (external) FUV radiation fields: the 216-0939 disk and the binary system 253-1536A/B, which are exposed to radiation fields of $10^2-10^3$ times the average interstellar radiation field. We detect lines from CO isotopologues, HCN, H$_2$CO, and C$_2$H toward both protoplanetary disks. Based on the observed disk-integrated line fluxes and flux ratios, we do not find significant differences between isolated and irradiated disks. The observed differences seem to be more closely related to the different stellar masses than to the external radiation field. This suggests that these disks are far enough away from the massive Trapezium stars, that their chemistry is no longer affected by external FUV radiation. Additional observations towards lower-mass disks and disks closer to the massive Trapezium stars are required to elucidate the level of external radiation required to make an impact on the chemistry of planet formation in different kinds of disks.</description>

      <title>Exploring Detached Eclipsing Binary Systems from TESS Observations: Insights into OBA-type Systems and Orbital Circularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents photometric solutions for a carefully selected sample of 181 detached eclipsing binary systems recently observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) mission. Our findings contribute to discussions about OBA-type systems and the orbital circularization influenced by tidal interactions. The results encompass crucial parameters, including the sum of radii fraction ($r_{\rm a}\,+\,r_{\rm b}$), radii ratio ($k$), orbital inclination ($i$), surface brightness ratio ($J$), and combinations of the longitude of the periastron and orbital eccentricity ($e\,\sin\,\omega$ and $e\,\cos\,\omega$). Geometric light curve fitting is performed using version 43 of the {\sc jktebop} code, serving as the primary tool for determining orbital elements and physical ratios. Careful uncertainty estimates for these findings are derived through bootstrap simulations. This work introduces unprecedented photometric solutions for 172 well-detached eclipsing systems, while the results for the remaining nine systems exhibit excellent agreement with those previously reported in the literature. Additionally, a critical primary radius fraction ($R_{\rm a}/a$) of 0.266 is identified for our sample of radiative envelope stars, consistent with observational and theoretical findings in the literature. Finally, we determine a circularization period of 5.762 days based on a function from the literature, revealing a discrepancy with Zahn's theory for hot stars.</description>

      <title>SN 2024ggi in NGC 3621: Rising Ionization in a Nearby, CSM-Interacting Type II Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present UV/optical/NIR observations and modeling of supernova (SN) 2024ggi, a type II supernova (SN II) located in NGC 3621 at 7.2 Mpc. Early-time ("flash") spectroscopy of SN 2024ggi within +0.8 days of discovery shows emission lines of H I, He I, C III, and N III with a narrow core and broad, symmetric wings (i.e., IIn-like) arising from the photoionized, optically-thick, unshocked circumstellar material (CSM) that surrounded the progenitor star at shock breakout. By the next spectral epoch at +1.5 days, SN 2024ggi showed a rise in ionization as emission lines of He II, C IV, N IV/V and O V became visible. This phenomenon is temporally consistent with a blueward shift in the UV/optical colors, both likely the result of shock breakout in an extended, dense CSM. The IIn-like features in SN 2024ggi persist on a timescale of $t_{\rm IIn} = 3.8 \pm 1.6$ days at which time a reduction in CSM density allows the detection of Doppler broadened features from the fastest SN material. SN 2024ggi has peak UV/optical absolute magnitudes of $M_{\rm w2} = -18.7$ mag and $M_{\rm g} = -18.1$ mag that are consistent with the known population of CSM-interacting SNe II. Comparison of SN 2024ggi with a grid of radiation hydrodynamics and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (nLTE) radiative-transfer simulations suggests a progenitor mass-loss rate of $\dot{M} = 10^{-2}$M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($v_w$ = 50 km/s), confined to a distance of $r &lt; 5\times 10^{14}$ cm. Assuming a wind velocity of $v_w$ = 50 km/s, the progenitor star underwent an enhanced mass-loss episode in the last ~3 years before explosion.</description>
