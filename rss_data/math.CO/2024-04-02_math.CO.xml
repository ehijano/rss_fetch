      <title>KKL theorem for the influence of a set of variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the notion of the influence of a set of variables on a Boolean function, which was recently introduced by Tal. We show that for an arbitrary fixed $d$, every Boolean function $f$ on $n$ variables admits a $d$-set of influence at least $\frac{1}{10} \mathbf{W}^{\geq d}(f) (\frac{\log n}{n})^d$, which is a direct generalisation of the Kahn-Kalai-Linial theorem. We give an example demonstrating essential sharpness of this result. Further, we generalise a related theorem of Oleszkiewicz regarding influences of pairs of variables.</description>

      <title>A coarse Tutte polynomial for hypermaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an analogue of the Tutte polynomial for hypermaps. This polynomial can be defined as either a sum over subhypermaps, or recursively through deletion-contraction reductions where the terminal forms consist of isolated vertices. Our Tutte polynomial extends the classical Tutte polynomial of a graph as well as the Tutte polynomial of an embedded graph (i.e., the ribbon graph polynomial), and it is a specialization of the transition polynomial via a medial map transformation. We give hypermap duality and partial duality identities for our polynomial, as well as some evaluations, and examine relations between our polynomial and other hypermap polynomials.</description>

      <title>Positivity preservers over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve an algebraic version of Schoenberg's celebrated theorem [Duke Math. J.}, 1942] characterizing entrywise matrix transforms that preserve positive definiteness. Compared to the classical real and complex settings, we consider matrices with entries in a finite field and obtain a complete characterization of such preservers for matrices of a fixed dimension. When the dimension of the matrices is at least $3$, we prove that, surprisingly, the positivity preservers are precisely the positive multiples of the field's automorphisms. Our work makes crucial use of the well-known character-sum bound due to Weil, and of a result of Carlitz [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 1960] that provides a characterization of the automorphisms of Paley graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{O}(P)$ and $\mathscr{C}(P)$ denote the order polytope and chain polytope, respectively, associated with a finite poset $P$. We prove the following result: if $P$ is a maximal ranked poset, then the number of triangular $2$-faces of $\mathscr{O}(P)$ is less than or equal to that of $\mathscr{C}(P)$, with equality holding if and only if $P$ does not contain an $X$-poset as a subposet.</description>

      <title>A classification of generalized root systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dimitrov and Fioresi introduced an object that they call a generalized root system. This is a finite set of vectors in a euclidean space satisfying certain compatibilities between angles and sums and differences of elements. They conjecture that every generalized root system is equivalent to one associated to a restriction of a Weyl arrangement. In this note we prove the conjecture and provide a complete classification of generalized root systems up to equivalence.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly consider a combinatoric explanation for block Pfaffians in terms of non-intersecting paths, as a generalization of results obtained by Stembridge. As applications, we demonstrate how are generating functions of non-intersecting paths related to skew orthogonal polynomials and their deformations, including a new concept called multiple partial-skew orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>Sparsity of 3-flow critical graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connected graph G is 3-flow-critical if G does not have a nowhere-zero 3-flow, but every proper contraction of G does. We prove that every n-vertex 3-flow-critical graph other than K_2 and K_4 has at least 5n/3 edges. This bound is tight up to lower-order terms, answering a question of Li et al. (2022). It also generalizes the result of Koester (1991) on the maximum average degree of 4-critical planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Bi-eulerian embeddings of graphs and digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1965 Edmonds showed that every eulerian graph has a bi-eulerian embedding, i.e., an embedding with exactly two faces, each bounded by an euler circuit. We refine this result by giving conditions for a graph to have a bi-eulerian embedding that is specifically orientable or nonorientable. We give connections to the maximum genus problem for directed embeddings of digraphs, in which every face is bounded by a directed circuit. Given an eulerian digraph $D$ with all vertices of degree 2 mod 4 and a directed euler circuit $T$ of $D$, we show that $D$ has an orientable bi-eulerian directed embedding with one of the faces bounded by $T$; this is a maximum genus directed embedding. This result also holds when $D$ has exactly two vertices of degree $0$ mod $4$, provided they are interlaced by $T$. More generally, if $D$ has $\ell$ vertices of degree 0 mod 4, we can find an orientable directed embedding with a face bounded by $T$ and with at most $\ell+1$ other faces. We show that given an eulerian graph $G$ and a circuit decomposition $C$ of $G$, there is an nonorientable embedding of $G$ with the elements of $C$ bounding faces and with one additional face bounded by an euler circuit, unless every block of $G$ is a cycle and $C$ is the collection of cycles of $G$. In particular, every eulerian graph that is not edgeless or a cycle has a nonorientable bi-eulerian embedding with a given euler circuit $T$ bounding one of the faces. Polynomial-time algorithms giving the specified embeddings are implicit in our proofs.</description>

      <title>Constructing segments of quadratic length in $Spec(T_n)$ through segments of linear length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Transposition graph $T_n$ is defined as a Cayley graph over the symmetric group $Sym_n$ generated by all transpositions. It is known that the spectrum of $T_n$ consists of integers, but it is not known exactly how these numbers are distributed. In this paper we prove that integers from the segment $[-n, n]$ lie in the spectrum of $T_n$ for any $n\geqslant 31$. Using this fact we also prove the main result of this paper that a segment of quadratic length with respect to $n$ lies in the spectrum of $T_n$.</description>

      <title>Invariant theory for the face algebra of the braid arrangement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The faces of the braid arrangement form a monoid. The associated monoid algebra -- the face algebra -- is well-studied, especially in relation to card shuffling and other Markov chains. In this paper, we explore the action of the symmetric group on the face algebra from the perspective of invariant theory. Bidigare proved the invariant subalgebra of the face algebra is (anti)isomorphic to Solomon's descent algebra. We answer the more general question: what is the structure of the face algebra as a simultaneous representation of the symmetric group and Solomon's descent algebra? Special cases of our main theorem recover the Cartan invariants of Solomon's descent algebra discovered by Garsia-Reutenauer and work of Uyemura-Reyes on certain shuffling representations. Our proof techniques involve the homology of intervals in the lattice of set partitions.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of amorphic schemes and fusions of pairs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An association scheme is called amorphic if every possible fusion of relations gives rise to a fusion scheme. We call a pair of relations fusing if fusing that pair gives rise to a fusion scheme. We define the fusing-relations graph on the set of relations, where a pair forms an edge if it fuses. We show that if the fusing-relations graph is connected but not a path, then the association scheme is amorphic. As a side result, we show that an association scheme in which at most one relation is not strongly regular of (negative) Latin square type, is amorphic.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Bogolyubov for special linear groups via tensor rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a polynomial Bogolyubov type lemma for the special linear group over finite fields. Specifically, we show that there exists an absolute constant $C&gt;0,$ such that if $A$ is a density $\alpha$ subset of the special linear group, then the set $AA^{-1}AA^{-1}$ contains a subgroup $H$ of density $\alpha^C$. Moreover, this subgroup is isomorphic to a special linear group of a smaller rank. We also show that if $A$ is an approximate subgroups then it can be covered by the union of few cosets of $H$. Our proof makes use of the Gurevich--Howe notion of tensor rank, and of a strengthened Bonami type Lemma for global functions on the bilinear scheme. We also present applications to spectral bounds for global convolution operators, global product free sets, and covering numbers corresponding to global sets.</description>

      <title>Connection Heat Kernel On Connection Lattices And Connection Discrete Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By the connection graph we mean an underlying weighted graph with a connection which associates edge set with an orthogonal group. This paper centers its investigation on the connection heat kernels on connection lattices and connection discrete torus. For one dimensional connection lattice, we derive the connection heat kernel expression by doing the Taylor expansion on the exponential function involving normalized connection Laplacian. We introduce a novel connection called product connection and prove that the connection heat kernel on arbitrary high dimensional lattice with product connection equals the Kronecker sum of one dimensional connection lattices' connection heat kernels. Furthermore, if the connection graph is consistent, we substantiate the interrelation between its connection heat kernel and its underlying graph's heat kernel. We define a connection called quotient connection such that discrete torus with quotient connection can be considered as a quotient graph of connection lattice, whose connection heat kernel is demonstrated to be the sum of connection lattices' connection heat kernels. In addition, we derive an alternative expression of connection heat kernel on discrete torus whenever its quotient connection is a constant connection, yielding an equation as a connection graph's trace formula.</description>

      <title>Metric dimensions of generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs over squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metric dimension is a valuable parameter that helps address problems related to network design, localization, and information retrieval by identifying the minimum number of landmarks required to uniquely determine distances between vertices in a graph. Generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs represent a captivating class of fractal-inspired networks that have gained prominence in various scientific disciplines and practical applications. Their fractal nature has also found relevance in antenna design, image compression, and the study of porous materials. The hypercube is a prevalent interconnection network architecture known for its symmetry, vertex transitivity, regularity, recursive structure, high connectedness, and simple routing. Various variations of hypercubes have emerged in literature to meet the demands of practical applications. Sometimes, they are the spanning subgraphs of it. This study examines the generalized Sierpi\'{n}ski graphs over $C_4$, which are spanning subgraphs of hypercubes and determines the metric dimension and their variants. This is in contrast to hypercubes, where these properties are inherently complicated. Along the way, the role of twin vertices in the theory of metric dimensions is further elaborated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liu, Pach and S\'andor recently characterized all polynomials $p(z)$ such that the equation $x+y=p(z)$ is $2$-Ramsey, that is, any $2$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ contains infinitely many monochromatic solutions for $x+y=p(z)$. In this paper, we find asymptotically tight bounds for the following two quantitative questions.
  $\bullet$ For $n\in \mathbb{N}$, what is the longest interval $[n,f(n)]$ of natural numbers which admits a $2$-coloring with no monochromatic solutions of $x+y=p(z)$?
  $\bullet$ For $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and a $2$-coloring of the first $n$ integers $[n]$, what is the smallest possible number $g(n)$ of monochromatic solutions of $x+y=p(z)$?
  Our theorems determine $f(n)$ up to a multiplicative constant $2+o(1)$, and determine the asymptotics for $g(n)$.</description>

      <title>Ore-type conditions for existence of a jellyfish in a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The famous Dirac's Theorem states that for each $n\geq 3$ every $n$-vertex graph $G$ with minimum degree $\delta(G)\geq n/2$ has a hamiltonian cycle. When $\delta(G)&lt; n/2$, this cannot be guaranteed, but the existence of some other specific subgraphs can be provided. Gargano, Hell, Stacho and Vaccaro proved that every connected $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\geq (n-1)/3$ contains a spanning {\em spider}, i.e., a spanning tree with at most one vertex of degree at least $3$. Later, Chen, Ferrara, Hu, Jacobson and Liu proved the stronger (and exact) result that for $n\geq 56$ every connected $n$-vertex graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\geq (n-2)/3$ contains a spanning {\em broom}, i.e., a spanning spider obtained by joining the center of a star to an endpoint of a path. They also showed that a $2$-connected graph $G$ with $\delta(G)\geq (n-2)/3$ and some additional properties contains a spanning {\em jellyfish} which is a graph obtained by gluing the center of a star to a vertex in a cycle disjoint from that star. Note that every spanning jellyfish contains a spanning broom.
  The goal of this paper is to prove an exact Ore-type bound which guarantees the existence of a spanning jellyfish: We prove that if $G$ is a $2$-connected graph on $n$ vertices such that every non-adjacent pair of vertices $(u,v)$ satisfies $d(u) + d(v) \geq \frac{2n-3}{3}$, then $G$ has a spanning jellyfish. As corollaries, we obtain strengthenings of two results by Chen et al.: a minimum degree condition guaranteeing the existence of a spanning jellyfish, and an Ore-type sufficient condition for the existence of a spanning broom. The corollaries are sharp for infinitely many $n$. One of the main ingredients of our proof is a modification of the Hopping Lemma due to Woodall.</description>

Abstract: This paper focuses on extensions of the classic Erd\H{o}s-Gallai Theorem for the set of weighted function of each edge in a graph. The weighted function of an edge $e$ of an $n$-vertex uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ is defined to a special function with respect to the number of edges of the longest Berge path containing $e$. We prove that the summation of the weighted function of all edges is at most $n$ for an $n$-vertex uniform hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$ and characterize all extremal hypergraphs that attain the value, which strengthens and extends the hypergraph version of the classic Erd\H{o}s-Gallai Theorem.</description>

      <title>Larger Nearly Orthogonal Sets over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a field $\mathbb{F}$ and integers $d$ and $k$, a set ${\cal A} \subseteq \mathbb{F}^d$ is called $k$-nearly orthogonal if its members are non-self-orthogonal and every $k+1$ vectors of ${\cal A}$ include an orthogonal pair. We prove that for every prime $p$ there exists some $\delta = \delta(p)&gt;0$, such that for every field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p$ and for all integers $k \geq 2$ and $d \geq k$, there exists a $k$-nearly orthogonal set of at least $d^{\delta \cdot k/\log k}$ vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$. The size of the set is optimal up to the $\log k$ term in the exponent. We further prove two extensions of this result. In the first, we provide a large set ${\cal A}$ of non-self-orthogonal vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$ such that for every two subsets of ${\cal A}$ of size $k+1$ each, some vector of one of the subsets is orthogonal to some vector of the other. In the second extension, every $k+1$ vectors of the produced set ${\cal A}$ include $\ell+1$ pairwise orthogonal vectors for an arbitrary fixed integer $1 \leq \ell \leq k$. The proofs involve probabilistic and spectral arguments and the hypergraph container method.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of $1$-homogeneous distance-regular graphs with positive intersection number $a_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a graph with diameter at least two. Then $\Gamma$ is said to be $1$-homogeneous (in the sense of Nomura) whenever for every pair of adjacent vertices $x$ and $y$ in $\Gamma$, the distance partition of the vertex set of $\Gamma$ with respect to both $x$ and $y$ is equitable, and the parameters corresponding to equitable partitions are independent of the choice of $x$ and $y$. Assume $\Gamma$ is $1$-homogeneous distance-regular with intersection number $a_1&gt;0$ and $D\geqslant 5$. Define $b=b_1/(\theta_1+1)$, where $b_1$ is the intersection number and $\theta_1$ is the second largest eigenvalue of $\Gamma$. We show that if intersection number $c_2\geqslant 2$, then $b\geqslant 1$ and one of the following (i)--(vi) holds: (i) $\Gamma$ is a regular near $2D$-gon, (ii) $\Gamma$ is a Johnson graph $J(2D,D)$, (iii) $\Gamma$ is a halved $\ell$-cube where $\ell \in \{2D,2D+1\}$, (iv) $\Gamma$ is a folded Johnson graph $\bar{J}(4D,2D)$, (v) $\Gamma$ is a folded halved $(4D)$-cube, (vi) the valency of $\Gamma$ is bounded by a function of $b$. Using this result, we characterize $1$-homogeneous graphs with classical parameters and $a_1&gt;0$, as well as tight distance-regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Growth of regular partitions 1: Improved bounds for small slicewise VC-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is Part 1 in a series of papers about sizes of regular partitions of $3$-uniform hypergraphs. Previous work of the author and Wolf, and independently Chernikov and Towsner, showed that $3$-uniform hypergraphs of small slicewise VC-dimension admit homogeneous partitions. The results of Chernikov and Towsner did not produce explicit bounds, while the work of the author and Wolf relied on a strong version of hypergraph regularity, and consequently produced a Wowzer type bound on the size of the partition. This paper gives a new proof of this result, yielding $\e$-homogeneous partitions of size at most $2^{2^{\epsilon^{-K}}}$, where $K$ is a constant depending on the slicewise VC-dimension. This result is a crucial ingredient in Part 2 of the series, which investigates the growth of weak regular partitions in hereditary properties of $3$-uniform hypergraphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is Part 2 in a series of papers about the growth of regular partitions in hereditary properties $3$-uniform hypergraphs. The focus of this paper is the notion of weak hypergraph regularity, first developed by Chung, Chung-Graham, and Haviland-Thomason. Given a hereditary property of $3$-uniform hypergraphs $\mathcal{H}$, we define a function $M_{\mathcal{H}}:(0,1)\rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ by letting $M_{\mathcal{H}}(\epsilon)$ be the smallest integer $M$ such that all sufficiently large elements of $\mathcal{H}$ admit weak regular partitions of size at most $M$. We show the asymptotic growth rate of such a function falls into one of four categories: constant, polynomial, between single and double exponentials, or tower. These results are a crucial component in Part 3 of the series, which considers vertex partitions associated to a stronger notion of hypergraph regularity.</description>

Abstract: We investigate an application of network centrality measures to portfolio optimization, by generalizing the method in [Pozzi, Di Matteo and Aste, \emph{Spread of risks across financial markets: better to invest in the peripheries}, Scientific Reports 3:1665, 2013], that however had significant limitations with respect to the state of the art in network theory. In this paper, we systematically compare many possible variants of the originally proposed method on S\&amp;P 500 stocks. We use daily data from twenty-seven years as training set and their following year as test set. We thus select the best network-based methods according to different viewpoints including for instance the highest Sharpe Ratio and the highest expected return. We give emphasis in new centrality measures and we also conduct a thorough analysis, which reveals significantly stronger results compared to those with more traditional methods. According to our analysis, this graph-theoretical approach to investment can be used successfully by investors with different investment profiles leading to high risk-adjusted returns.</description>

      <title>Random Reed-Solomon Codes are List Recoverable with Optimal List Size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that Reed-Solomon (RS) codes with random evaluation points are list recoverable up to capacity with optimal output list size, for any input list size.
  Namely, given an input list size $\ell$, a designated rate $R$, and any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we show that a random RS code is list recoverable from $1-R-\varepsilon$ fraction of errors with output list size $L = O(\ell/\varepsilon)$, for field size $q=\exp(\ell,1/\varepsilon) \cdot n^2$. In particular, this shows that random RS codes are list recoverable beyond the ``list recovery Johnson bound''. Such a result was not even known for arbitrary random linear codes. Our technique follows and extends the recent line of work on list decoding of random RS codes, specifically the works of Brakensiek, Gopi, and Makam (STOC 2023), and of Guo and Zhang (FOCS 2023).</description>

      <title>On P=NP Either False or Independent of ZFC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our main result, Theorem 3.3, uses Friedman's Jump Free Theorem, Theorem 2.7, which he has shown to be independent of ZFC, the usual axioms of set theory. We conjecture that Theorem 3.3, a straight forward translation of the statement of Theorem 2.7 into sets and functions, is also independent of ZFC as is its immediate Corollary 3.4. It is easy to show that a proof that P=NP will also prove Corollary 3.4. If Corollary 3.4 is in fact independent of ZFC then a ZFC proof of P=NP is impossible, perhaps because it is false.</description>

      <title>The slope of v-function and Waldschmidt Constant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study asymptotic behaviour of the v-numbers of a Noetherian filtration $\mathcal{I}= \{I_{[k]}\}_{k\geq 0}$ of ideals in a Noetherian graded domain $R$. Recently, it is shown that $\mathrm{v}(I_{[k]})$ is periodically linear in $k$ for $k&gt;&gt;0$. We show that $\displaystyle \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}\frac{\mathrm{v}(I_{[k]})}{k}$ exists and $\displaystyle \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}\frac{\mathrm{v}(I_{[k]})}{k}=\displaystyle \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}\frac{\alpha(I_{[k]})}{k}$. That is, all these linear functions have same slope, which is equal to $\displaystyle \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}\frac{\alpha(I_{[k]})}{k}$. In particular, for Noetherian symbolic filtration, we have $\displaystyle \lim_{k \rightarrow \infty}\frac{\mathrm{v}(I^{(k)})}{k}=\hat{\alpha}(I),$ the Waldschmidt constant of $I$. Also, for several classes of square-free monomial ideals, we show that $\mathrm{v}(I^{(k)})\leq \mathrm{reg}(R/I^{(k)})$ for all $k\geq 1$. As a special case, for any simple graph $G$, we show that $\mathrm{v}(J(G)^{(k)}) \leq \mathrm{reg}(R/J(G)^{(k)})$ for all $k \geq 1$ and $\mathrm{v}(J(G)^{(k)}) = \mathrm{reg}(R/J(G)^{(k)})=\alpha(J(G)^{(k)})-1$ for all $k\geq 1$ if and only if $G$ is a Cohen-Macaulay very-well covered graph, where $J(G)$ denotes the cover ideal of $G$.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we derived some consequences to the symmetrization process developed in \cite{Deng23}. This consists a geometric derivation of part of the properties which uniquely determines the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of type $A_n$ as well as an interpretations of the last property by the decomposition theorem of \cite{BBD}. Finally, the relation of geometry of graded nilpotent classes to Parabolic Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials is discussed for the purpose of later applications to Zelevinsky's derivatives.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantify the effect of weighted loops at the source and target nodes of a graph on the strength of quantum state transfer between these vertices. We give lower bounds on loop weights that guarantee strong transfer fidelity that works for any graph where this protocol is feasible. By considering local spectral symmetry, we show that the required weight size depends only on the maximum degree of the graph and, in some less favorable cases, the distance between vertices. Additionally, we explore the duration for which transfer strength remains above a specified threshold.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds and integrality gaps in simplicial decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{K}$ be a finite pure simplicial $d$-complex, with oriented facets $\{F_i\}$, which is boundaryless in the sense that $\sum\partial F_i=0$. We call such a $\mathcal{K}$ an \textit{admissible $d$-complex}. Given an admissible $d$-complex, one can ask for the smallest collection $\{T_i\}$ of oriented $(d+1)$-simplices on the vertices of $\mathcal{K}$ which decomposes $\mathcal{K}$ in the sense that $\sum \partial T_i = \mathcal{K}$. Let the minimum size of such a collection be $V_\mathbb{Z}(\mathcal{K})$, and let $V_\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal{K})$ be the relaxed analog where fractional $(d+1)$-simplices may be used. We explain how these quantities may be computed via integer and linear programming, and show how lower bounds may be obtained by exploiting LP-duality. We then prove that $V_\mathbb{Q}$ and $V_\mathbb{Z}$ are both additive under disjoint union and connected sum along a $d$-simplex. The remainder of the paper explores integrality gaps between $V_\mathbb{Z}$ and $V_\mathbb{Q}$ in dimension 1, where we share what we believe is the simplest admissible complex with an integrality gap; and in dimension 2, where we collect some results on integrality gaps for triangulations of the 2-sphere for a companion paper with Zili Wang and Peter Doyle.</description>

      <title>On the General Position Number of Mycielskian Graphs</title>

Abstract: The general position problem for graphs was inspired by the no-three-in-line problem from discrete geometry. A set $S$ of vertices of a graph $G$ is a \emph{general position set} if no shortest path in $G$ contains three or more vertices of $S$. The \emph{general position number} of $G$ is the number of vertices in a largest general position set. In this paper we investigate the general position numbers of the Mycielskian of graphs. We give tight upper and lower bounds on the general position number of the Mycielskian of a graph $G$ and investigate the structure of the graphs meeting these bounds. We determine this number exactly for common classes of graphs, including cubic graphs and a wide range of trees.</description>

Abstract: An $n \times m$ array with nonnegative entries is called doubly stochastic if the sum of its entries at each row is $m$ and at each column is $n$. The set of all $n \times m$ doubly stochastic arrays is a convex polytope with finitely many extremal points. The main result of this paper characterizes the possible sizes of the supports of all extremal $n \times m$ doubly stochastic arrays. In particular we prove that the minimal size of the support of an $n \times m$ doubly stochastic array is $n + m - \gcd(n,m)$. Moreover, for $m=kn+1$ we also characterize the structure of the support of the extremal arrays.</description>

      <title>634 vertex-transitive and more than $10^{103}$ non-vertex-transitive 27-vertex triangulations of manifolds like the octonionic projective plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.08507v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1987 Brehm and K\"uhnel showed that any combinatorial $d$-manifold with less than $3d/2+3$ vertices is PL homeomorphic to the sphere and any combinatorial $d$-manifold with exactly $3d/2+3$ vertices is PL homeomorphic to either the sphere or a manifold like a projective plane in the sense of Eells and Kuiper. The latter possibility may occur for $d\in\{2,4,8,16\}$ only. There exist a unique $6$-vertex triangulation of $\mathbb{RP}^2$, a unique $9$-vertex triangulation of $\mathbb{CP}^2$, and at least three $15$-vertex triangulations of $\mathbb{HP}^2$. However, until now, the question of whether there exists a $27$-vertex triangulation of a manifold like the octonionic projective plane has remained open. We solve this problem by constructing a lot of examples of such triangulations. Namely, we construct $634$ vertex-transitive $27$-vertex combinatorial $16$-manifolds like the octonionic projective plane. Four of them have symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_3^3\rtimes \mathrm{C}_{13}$ of order $351$, and the other $630$ have symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_3^3$ of order $27$. Further, we construct more than $10^{103}$ non-vertex-transitive $27$-vertex combinatorial $16$-manifolds like the octonionic projective plane. Most of them have trivial symmetry group, but there are also symmetry groups $\mathrm{C}_3$, $\mathrm{C}_3^2$, and $\mathrm{C}_{13}$. We conjecture that all the triangulations constructed are PL homeomorphic to the octonionic projective plane $\mathbb{OP}^2$. Nevertheless, we have no proof of this fact so far.</description>

      <title>Multicolor Tur\'an numbers II -- a generalization of the Ruzsa-Szemer\'edi theorem and new results on cliques and odd cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we continue the study of a natural generalization of Tur\'an's forbidden subgraph problem and the Ruzsa-Szemer\'edi problem. Let $ex_F(n,G)$ denote the maximum number of edge-disjoint copies of a fixed simple graph $F$ that can be placed on an $n$-vertex ground set without forming a subgraph $G$ whose edges are from different $F$-copies. The case when both $F$ and $G$ are triangles essentially gives back the theorem of Ruzsa and Szemer\'edi. We extend their results to the case when $F$ and $G$ are arbitrary cliques by applying a number theoretic result due to Erd\H{o}s, Frankl and R\"odl. This extension in turn decides the order of magnitude for a large family of graph pairs, which will be subquadratic, but almost quadratic. Since the linear $r$-uniform hypergraph Tur\'an problems to determine $ex_r^{lin}(n,G)$ form a class of the multicolor Tur\'an problem, following the identity $ex_r^{lin}(n,G)=ex_{K_r}(n,G)$, our results determine the linear hypergraph Tur\'an numbers of every graph of girth $3$ and for every $r$ up to a subpolynomial factor. Furthermore, when $G$ is a triangle, we settle the case $F=C_5$ and give bounds for the cases $F=C_{2k+1}$, $k\ge 3$ as well.</description>

Abstract: For a hypergraph ${\cal H}$, let $P({\cal H},k)$ and $P_l({\cal H},k)$ be its chromatic polynomial and list-color function respectively, and let $\tau'({\cal H})$ be the least non-negative integer $q$ such that $P({\cal H},k)=P_l({\cal H},k)$ holds for all integers $k\ge q$. In this article, we show that for any $r$-uniform hypergraph ${\cal H}$ of order $n$ and size $m$ and any $k$-assignment $L$ of ${\cal H}$, where $r\ge 3$, $P({\cal H},L)-P({\cal H},k)\ge \min \{0.02k, k-(m-1)\} k^{n-r-1}\sum_{e\in E({\cal H})} \left ( k-\left |\bigcap_{v\in e}L(v)\right | \right )$ holds for $k\ge m-1\ge 4$. It follows that $\tau'({\cal H})\le m-1$, improving the current best result on $\tau'({\cal H})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.10004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the combinatorial results on counting permutations with fixed pinnacle and vale sets to evaluate the special values of the spectral zeta functions of Sturm-Liouville differential operators. As applications, we get a combinatorial formula for the special values of spectral zeta functions and give a new explicit formula for Bernoulli numbers.</description>

      <title>Hadwiger's Conjecture for some graphs with independence number two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05868v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $h(G)$ denote the largest $t$ such that $G$ contains $K_t$ as a minor and $\chi(G)$ be the chromatic number of $G$ respectively. In 1943, Hadwiger conjectured that $h(G) \geq \chi(G)$ for any graph $G$. In this paper, we prove that Hadwiger's conjecture holds for $H$-free graphs with independence number two, where $H$ is one of some specified graphs.</description>

      <title>Conditions for matchability in groups and field extensions II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present sufficient conditions for the existence of matchings in abelian groups and their linear counterparts. These conditions lead to extensions of existing results in matching theory. Additionally, we classify subsets within abelian groups that cannot be matched. We introduce the concept of Chowla subspaces and formulate and conjecture a linear analogue of a result originally attributed to Y. O. Hamidoune [20] concerning Chowla sets. If proven true, this result would extend matchings in primitive subspaces. Throughout the paper, we emphasize the analogy between matchings in abelian groups and field extensions. We also pose numerous open questions for future research. Our approach relies on classical theorems in group theory, additive number theory and linear algebra. As the title of the paper suggests, this work is the second sequel to a previous paper [5] with a similar theme. This paper is self-contained and can be read independently.</description>

      <title>On possible symmetry groups of 27-vertex triangulations of manifolds like the octonionic projective plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1987 Brehm and K\"uhnel showed that any triangulation of a $d$-manifold (without boundary) that is not homeomorphic to the sphere has at least $3d/2+3$ vertices. Moreover, triangulations with exactly $3d/2+3$ vertices may exist only for `manifolds like projective planes', which can have dimensions $2$, $4$, $8$, and $16$ only. There is a $6$-vertex triangulation of the real projective plane $\mathbb{RP}^2$, a $9$-vertex triangulation of the complex projective plane $\mathbb{CP}^2$, and $15$-vertex triangulations of the quaternionic projective plane $\mathbb{HP}^2$. Recently, the author has constructed first examples of $27$-vertex triangulations of manifolds like the octonionic projective plane $\mathbb{OP}^2$. The four most symmetrical have symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_3^3\rtimes \mathrm{C}_{13}$ of order $351$. These triangulations were constructed using a computer program after the symmetry group was guessed. However, it remained unclear why exactly this group is realized as the symmetry group and whether $27$-vertex triangulations of manifolds like $\mathbb{OP}^2$ exist with other (possibly larger) symmetry groups. In this paper we find strong restrictions on symmetry groups of such $27$-vertex triangulations. Namely, we present a list of $26$ subgroups of $\mathrm{S}_{27}$ containing all possible symmetry groups of $27$-vertex triangulations of manifolds like the octonionic projective plane. (We do not know whether all these subgroups can be realized as symmetry groups.) The group $\mathrm{C}_3^3\rtimes \mathrm{C}_{13}$ is the largest group in this list, and the orders of all other groups do not exceed $52$. A key role in our approach is played by the use of Smith and Bredon's results on the topology of fixed point sets of finite transformation groups.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we define edge zeta functions for spherical buildings associated with finite general linear groups. We derive elegant formulas for these zeta functions and reveal patterns of eigenvalues of these buildings, by introducing and applying insightful tools including digraphs X0 and X2, cyclic n-partite graphs, partite-transitive group actions, and Springer's theorem on Hecke algebras.</description>

      <title>Counting Packings of List-colorings of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a list assignment for a graph, list packing asks for the existence of multiple pairwise disjoint list colorings of the graph. Several papers have recently appeared that study the existence of such a packing of list colorings. Formally, a proper $L$-packing of a graph $G$ of size $k$ is a set of $k$ pairwise disjoint proper $L$-colorings of $G$ where $L$ is a list assignment of colors to the vertices of $G$. In this paper, we initiate the study of counting such packings of list colorings of a graph. We define $P_\ell^\star(G,q,k)$ as the guaranteed number of proper $L$-packings of $G$ of size $k$ over all list assignments $L$ that assign $q$ colors to each vertex of $G$, and we let $P^\star(G,q,k)$ be its classical coloring counterpart. We let $P_\ell^\star(G,q)= P_\ell^\star(G,q,q)$ so that $P_\ell^\star(G,q)$ is the enumerative function for the previously studied list packing number $\chi_\ell^\star(G)$. Note that the chromatic polynomial of $G$, $P(G,q)$, is $P^\star(G,q,1)$, and the list color function of $G$, $P_\ell(G,q)$, is $P_\ell^\star(G,q,1)$.
  Inspired by the well-known behavior of the list color function and the chromatic polynomial, we make progress towards the question of whether $P_{\ell}^\star(G,q,k) = P^\star(G,q,k)$ when $q$ is large enough. Our result generalizes the recent theorem of Dong and Zhang (2023), which improved results going back to Donner (1992), about when the list color function equals the chromatic polynomial. Further, we use a polynomial method to generalize bounds on the list packing number, $\chi_\ell^\star(G)$, of sparse graphs to exponential lower bounds (in the number of vertices of $G$) on the corresponding list packing functions, $P_\ell^\star(G,q)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08120v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We call progressive paths and rushed paths two families of Dyck paths studied by Asinowski and Jel\'inek, which have the same enumerating sequence (OEIS entry A287709). We present a bijection proving this fact. Rushed paths turn out to be in bijection with one-sided trees, introduced by Durhuus and \"Unel, which have an asymptotic enumeration involving a stretched exponential. We show some asymptotic results and present a random sampling procedure for rushed paths. We conclude by presenting several other classes of related lattice paths and directed animals that may have similar asymptotic properties.</description>

Abstract: Erd\H{o}s and Graham proposed to determine the number of subsets $S \subseteq \left\{1,2,\dots,n\right\}$ with $\sum_{s \in S} 1/s = 1$ and asked, among other things, whether that number could be as large as $2^{n - o(n)}$. We show that the number of subsets $S \subseteq \left\{1,2,\dots,n\right\}$ with $\sum_{s \in S} 1/s \leq 1$ is smaller than $2^{0.93n}$.</description>

Abstract: We reimplement here the recent approach of Adam Zsolt Wagner [arXiv:2104.14516], which applies reinforcement learning to construct (counter)examples in graph theory, in order to make it more readable, more stable and much faster. The presented concepts are illustrated by constructing counterexamples for a number of published conjectured bounds for the Laplacian spectral radius of graphs.</description>

      <title>Random meander model for links</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.03451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We suggest a new random model for links based on meander diagrams and graphs. We then prove that trivial links appear with vanishing probability in this model, no link $L$ is obtained with probability 1, and there is a lower bound for the number of non-isotopic knots obtained for a fixed number of crossings. A random meander diagram is obtained through matching pairs of parentheses, a well-studied problem in combinatorics. Hence tools from combinatorics can be used to investigate properties of random links in this model, and, moreover, of the respective 3-manifolds that are link complements in 3-sphere. We use this for exploring geometric properties of a link complement. Specifically, we give expected twist number of a link diagram and use it to bound expected hyperbolic and simplicial volume of random links. The tools from combinatorics that we use include Catalan and Narayana numbers, and Zeilberger's algorithm.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Approach to the Longest Path Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Longest Path Problem is a question of finding the maximum length between pairs of vertices of a graph. In the general case, the problem is NP-hard. However, there is a small collection of graph classes for which there exists an efficient solution. Current approaches involve either approximation or computational enumeration. For Tree-like classes of graphs, there are approximation and enumeration algorithms which solves the problem efficiently. We propose a new method of approaching the longest path problem with algebraic operations and conditions that exactly identify and or approximate the solution in polynomial time. We next introduce a 'booleanize' mapping on the adjacency matrix of a graph which we prove identifies the solution for trees, uniform block graphs, block graphs, and directed acyclic graphs, with approached conditions. Finally, we display the algorithms to find the solution, in addition to algorithms that generate all the longest paths.</description>
