      <title>Monte Carlo Spin Simulations of Magnetic Noise -- The Search for Pivoting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) show great promise as quantum bits (qubits) but continue to be hindered by flux noise. The flux noise power spectra of SQUIDs go as $1/f^\alpha$, where $\alpha$ is the temperature-dependent noise exponent. Experiments find $0.5 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim 1$. Furthermore, experiments find that the noise power spectra versus frequency at different temperatures pivot about or cross at a common point for each SQUID. To try to better understand the results and motivated by experimental evidence that magnetic moments on the surface of SQUIDS produce flux noise, we present the results of our Monte Carlo simulations of various spin systems on 2D lattices. We find that only spin glasses produce $\alpha \sim 1$ at low temperature. We find that aliasing of the noise power spectra at high frequencies can lead to spectral pivoting if it is in proximity to a knee at a slightly lower frequency. We show that the pivot frequency depends on the method of site selection and how often the magnetization is recorded. The spectral pivoting that occurs in our simulations is due to aliasing and does not explain the spectral pivoting of experiments.</description>

      <title>Detecting the N\'{e}el vector of altermagnet by attaching a topological insulator and crystalline valley-edge insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to detect the N\'{e}el vector of an altermagnet, we investigate topological phases in a bilayer system composed of an altermagnet and a two-dimensional topological insulator described by the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model. A topological phase transition occurs from a first-order topological insulator to a trivial insulator at a certain critical altermagnetization if the N\'{e}el vector of altermagnet is along the $x$ axis or the $y$ axis. It is intriguing that valley-protected edge states emerge along the N\'{e}el vector in this trivial insulator, which are as stable as the topological edge states. We name it a crystalline valley-edge insulator. On the other hand, the system turns out to be a second-order topological insulator when the N\'{e}el vector is along the $z$ axis. The tunneling conductance has a strong dependence on the N\'{e}el vector. In addition, the band gap depends on the N\'{e}el vector, which is measurable by optical absorption. Hence, it is possible experimentally to detect the N\'{e}el vector by measuring tunneling conductance and optical absorption.</description>

      <title>Topological Optical Spin Injection Beyond Regular Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photoinduced effects are now reckoned to be important tools to reveal a rich gamut of entrancing physics in topological materials, which are normally inaccessible via conventional probes. Here we investigate one of these intriguing effects, namely, {\it optical spin injection} (OSI) beyond the regular Weyl semimetal (WSM), specifically in multi- and higher-order WSMs. Remarkably, we demonstrate that OSI in multi-WSMs can emerge as a frequency-independent quantized response engendered by band linearity and topological charge associated with the node. Interestingly, the frequency independence can be destroyed by going beyond the first-order topological phase. We show that the OSI response is accompanied by peaks for the first-order Weyl nodes while dips for the second-order Weyl nodes. In addition, we elucidate the behavior of OSI in type-II Weyl phases. The predicted signatures of OSI beyond the regular WSM, i.e., multi- and higher-order WSM, could be experimentally exploited, leading us to effectively access as well as distinguish different-order nontrivial Weyl topology.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of nanometer-scale orbital angular momentum accumulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversion of charge to orbital angular momentum through the orbital Hall effect (OHE) holds transformative potential for the development of orbital-based electronics, however, it is challenging to directly observe the electrically generated orbital accumulation. Here, we detect the OHE by directly quantifying the orbital accumulation along the edges of a titanium thin film using a scanning transmission electron microscope. We measure the Ti L-edge using electron energy-loss spectroscopy with nanometer resolution and find a sizable orbital accumulation at the sample's outer perimeters, consistent with all signatures expected for the OHE, and determine an orbital diffusion length $\ell_o \approx 7.3$ nm. Our data points to a surprising dependence of the orbital diffusion length on the nano-structural morphology.</description>

      <title>Anomalous quantum scattering and transport of electrons with Mexican-hat dispersion induced by electrical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically study the quantum scattering and transport of electrons with Mexican-hat dispersion through both step and rectangular potential barriers by using the transfer matrix method. Owing to the torus-like iso-energy lines of the Mexican-hat dispersion, we observe the presence of double reflections and double transmissions in both two different barrier scenarios, i.e., the normal reflection (NR), retro-reflection (RR), normal transmission (NT), and specular transmission (ST).For the step potential with electrons incident from the large wavevector, the transmission is primarily governed by NT with nearly negligible ST, while the reflection is dominant by RR (NR) within (outside) the critical angle. Additionally, for electrons incident from the small wavevector, the NT can be reduced to zero by adjusting the barrier, resulting in a significant enhancement of ST and RR. For the rectangular barrier, the transmission and reflection spectra resemble those of the step barrier, but there are two kinds of resonant tunneling which can lead to perfect NT or ST. There exists a negative differential conductance (NDC) effect in the conductance spectrum. The conductance and the peak-to-valley ratio of the NDC effect can be effectively controlled by adjusting the height and width of the barrier as well as the incident energy. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the electron states governed by the Mexican-hat dispersion.</description>

      <title>Magnetic distillation of intrinsic electric dipoles in mixed-stacking tetralayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polytypes of tetralayer graphene (TLG: Bernal, rhombohedral and mixed stacking) offer a choice of crystalline structures with different symmetries. Among those, mixed-stacking tetralayers lack inversion symmetry, which allows for intrinsic spontaneous out-of-plane electrical polarisation, inverted in the mirror-image pair, ABCB and ABAC stackings. Here, we compare the intrinsic polarisation with the symmetry-breaking effect of a substrate. We find that a potential induced by the substrate on the bottom layer of the TLG can generate out-of-plane electric dipole moments with different sizes in all four polytypes and, also, different for the ABCB and ABAC pair. This undermines a straightforward interpretation of experimentally measured Kelvin probe microscopy maps of tetralayer flakes in terms of their intrinsic polarisation. To overcome this difficulty, we analyse the influence of an external magnetic field on electrical polarisation of all four TLGs and find that Landau level quantisation highlights the intrinsic asymmetry of mixed stacking polytypes, making the difference between ABCB and ABAC polarisations almost independent of the substrate effect. We also notice a non-monotonic (hump-like) feature in the polarisation in a magnetic field range of 0.5-3 Tesla, caused by the interplay between time inversion symmetry breaking and spatial inversion symmetry breaking specific for those two polytypes.</description>

      <title>Tunnel junctions based on interfacial 2D ferroelectrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have opened new opportunities to develop atomically thin (opto)electronic devices with a wide range of functionalities. The recent focus on manipulating the interlayer twist angle has led to the observation of out-of-plane room temperature ferroelectricity in twisted rhombohedral (R) bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Here we explore the switching behaviour of sliding ferroelectricity using scanning probe microscopy domain mapping and tunnelling transport measurements. We observe well-pronounced ambipolar switching behaviour in ferroelectric tunnelling junctions (FTJ) with composite ferroelectric/non-polar insulator barriers and support our experimental results with complementary theoretical modelling. Furthermore, we show that the switching behaviour is strongly influenced by the underlying domain structure, allowing fabrication of diverse FTJ devices with various functionalities. We show that to observe the polarisation reversal, at least one partial dislocation must be present in the device area. This behaviour is drastically different from that of conventional ferroelectric materials and its understanding is an important milestone for future development of optoelectronic devices based on sliding ferroelectricity.</description>

      <title>Topological responses from gapped Weyl points in 2D altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism combines aspects of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, breaking spin degeneracy while possessing no net magnetization. In this work, we study the symmetry requirements for topologically protected Weyl points in 2D altermagnets, involving bands with the same spin quantum number. We classify all spin-wallpaper groups whose symmetries protect 2D Weyl points and show that their nontrivial topology is charactrized by a quantized $\pi$-Berry phase. Representative electronic tight-binding and magnonic linear spin-wave models are constructed to investigate the unusual transport characteristics of these 2D Weyl points. Different mass terms, induced for example through strain or via coupling to light or a substrate, gap out the Weyl points leading to emerging gapped topological phases. Depending on the mass terms, these phases carry finite Chern and/or spin Chern numbers and exhibit protected edge states as well as anomalous electronic and thermal Hall responses. We calculate these Hall currents for the different topological phases.</description>

      <title>Chiral gauge field in fully-spin polarized Weyl semimetal with magnetic domain walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulation of magnetization in magnetic Weyl semimetals leads to the shift of Weyl points in momentum space, which effectively serves as the chirality-dependent gauge field for the Weyl fermions. Here, we theoretically study such a magnetization-induced chiral gauge field, in a fully spin-polarized Weyl ferromagnet $\rm{Co}_3\rm{Sn}_2\rm{S}_2$. From a tight-binding model of $\rm{Co}_3\rm{Sn}_2\rm{S}_2$ on stacked kagome lattice with magnetism, we calculate the magnetization-dependent evolution of the Weyl points in momentum space, resulting in the chiral gauge field. In the presence of the magnetic domain wall structure, we evaluate the chiral magnetic field arising from the spatial profile of the chiral gauge field. We find that a magnetic domain wall in $\rm{Co}_3\rm{Sn}_2\rm{S}_2$ gives rise to a giant chiral magnetic field for the Weyl fermions, which reaches the order of a few hundred tesla to induce the Landau quantization. Such a giant chiral magnetic field may also influence the novel transport phenomena, such as the charge pumping by the domain wall motion, compatible with the spin-motive force.</description>

      <title>Effects of Structural Variations to X-ray Absorption Spectra of g-C$_3$N$_4$: Insights from DFT and TDDFT Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is widely employed for structure characterization of graphitic carbon nitride (g-C$_3$N$_4$) and its composites. Nevertheless, even for pure g-C$_3$N$_4$, discrepancies in energy and profile exist across different experiments, which can be attributed to variations in structures arising from diverse synthesis conditions and calibration procedures. Here, we conducted a theoretical investigation on XAS of three representative g-C$_3$N$_4$ structures (planar, corrugated, and micro-corrugated) optimized with different strategies, to understand the structure-spectroscopy relation. Different methods were compared, including density functional theory (DFT) with the full (FCH) or equivalent (ECH) core-hole approximation, as well as the time-dependent DFT (TDDFT). FCH was responsible for getting accurate absolute absorption energy; while ECH and TDDFT aided in interpreting the spectra, through ECH-state canonical molecular orbitals (ECH-CMOs) and natural transition orbitals (NTOs), respectively. With each method, the spectra at the three structures show evident differences, which can be correlated to different individual experiments or in between. Our calculations explained the structural reason behind the spectral discrepancies among different experiments. Moreover, profiles predicted by these methods also displayed consistency, so their differences can be used as a reliable indicator of their accuracy. Both ECH-CMOs and NTO particle orbitals led to similar graphics, validating their applicability in interpreting the transitions. This work provides a comprehensive analysis of the structure-XAS relation for g-C$_3$N$_4$, provides concrete explanations for the spectral differences reported in various experiments, and offers insight for future structure dynamical and transient X-ray spectral analyses.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum oscillations near the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit in CaAs3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit sets the lower bound of carrier mean free path for coherent quasiparticle transport. Metallicity beyond this limit is of great interest because it is often closely related to quantum criticality and unconventional superconductivity. Progress along this direction mainly focuses on the strange-metal behaviors originating from the evolution of quasiparticle scattering rate such as linear-in-temperature resistivity, while the quasiparticle coherence phenomena in this regime are much less explored due to the short mean free path at the diffusive bound. Here we report the observation of quantum oscillations from Landau quantization near the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit in CaAs3. Despite the insulator-like temperature dependence of resistivity, CaAs3 presents giant magnetoresistance and prominent Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations from Fermi surfaces, indicating highly coherent band transport. In contrast, the quantum oscillation is absent in the magnetic torque. The quasiparticle effective mass increases systematically with magnetic fields, manifesting a much larger value than the expectation given by magneto-infrared spectroscopy. It suggests a strong many-body renormalization effect near Fermi surface. We find that these unconventional behaviors may be explained by the interplay between the mobility edge and the van Hove singularity, which results in the formation of coherent cyclotron orbits emerging at the diffusive bound. Our results call for further study on the electron correlation effect of the van Hove singularity.</description>

      <title>Comparative Microscopic Study of Entropies and their Production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of eleven microscopic entropy definitions (of Boltzmann-surface, Gibbs-volume, canonical, coarse-grained-observational, entanglement and diagonal type) and three microscopic temperature definitions (based on Boltzmann, Gibbs or canonical entropy). This is done for the archetypal nonequilibrium setup of two systems exchanging energy, modeled here with random matrix theory, based on numerical integration of the Schroedinger equation. We consider three types of pure initial states (local energy eigenstates, decorrelated and entangled microcanonical states) and three classes of systems: (A) two normal systems, (B) a normal and a negative temperature system and (C) a normal and a negative heat capacity system.
  We find: (1) All types of initial states give rise to the same macroscopic dynamics. (2) Entanglement and diagonal entropy sensitively depend on the microstate, in contrast to all other entropies. (3) For class B and C, Gibbs-volume entropies can violate the second law and the associated temperature becomes meaningless. (4) For class C, Boltzmann-surface entropies can violate the second law and the associated temperature becomes meaningless. (5) Canonical entropy has a tendency to remain almost constant. (6) For a Haar random initial state, entanglement or diagonal entropy behave similar or identical to coarse-grained-observational entropy.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Persistent Current Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Persistent currents circulate continuously without requiring external power sources. Here, we extend their theory to include dissipation within the framework of non-Hermitian quantum Hamiltonians. Using Green's function formalism, we introduce a non-Hermitian Fermi-Dirac distribution and derive an analytical expression for the persistent current that relies solely on the complex spectrum. We apply our formula to two dissipative models supporting persistent currents: ($i$) a phase-biased superconducting-normal-superconducting junction; ($ii$) a normal ring threaded by a magnetic flux. We show that the persistent currents in both systems exhibit no anomalies at any emergent exceptional points, whose signatures are only discernible in the current susceptibility. We validate our findings by exact diagonalization and extend them to account for finite temperatures and interaction effects. Our formalism offers a general framework for computing quantum many-body observables of non-Hermitian systems in equilibrium, with potential extensions to non-equilibrium scenarios.</description>

      <title>Parafermions with symmetry-protected non-Abelian statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Abelian anyons have garnered extensive attention for obeying exotic non-Abelian statistics and potential applications to fault-tolerant quantum computation. Although the prior research has predominantly focused on non-Abelian statistics without the necessity of symmetry protection, recent progresses have shown that symmetries can play essential roles and bring about a notion of the symmetry-protected non-Abelian (SPNA) statistics. In this work, we extend the concept of SPNA statistics to strongly-correlated systems which host parafermion zero modes (PZMs). This study involves a few fundamental results proved here. First, we unveil a generic unitary symmetry mechanism that protects PZMs from local couplings. Then, with this symmetry protection, the PZMs can be categorized into two nontrivial sectors, each maintaining its own parity conservation, even though the whole system cannot be dismantled into separate subsystems due to nonlinear interactions. Finally, by leveraging the parity conservation of each sector and the general properties of the effective braiding Hamiltonian, we prove rigorously that the PZMs intrinsically obey SPNA statistics. To further confirm the results, we derive the braiding matrix at a tri-junction. In addition, we propose a physical model that accommodates a pair of PZMs protected by mirror symmetry and satisfying the generic theory. This work shows a broad spectrum of strongly-correlated systems capable of hosting fractional SPNA quasiparticles and enriches our comprehension of fundamental quantum statistics linked to the symmetries that govern the exchange dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Topological phases of matter are classified based on symmetries, with nonsymmorphic symmetries like glide reflections and screw rotations being of particular importance in the classification. In contrast to extensively studied glide reflections in real space, introducing space-dependent gauge transformations can lead to momentum-space glide reflection symmetries, which may even change the fundamental domain for topological classifications, e.g., from a torus to a Klein bottle. Here we discover a new class of three-dimensional (3D) higher-order topological insulators, protected by a pair of momentum-space glide reflections. It supports gapless hinge modes, as dictated by the quadrupole moment and Wannier Hamiltonians defined on a Klein bottle manifold, and we introduce two topological invariants to characterize this phase. Our predicted topological hinge modes are experimentally verified in a 3D-printed acoustic crystal, providing direct evidence for 3D higher-order Klein bottle topological insulators. Our results not only showcase the remarkable role of momentum-space glide reflections in topological classifications, but also pave the way for experimentally exploring physical effects arising from momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries.</description>

      <title>Topological diffusive metal in amorphous transition metal monosilicides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In chiral crystals crystalline symmetries can protect multifold fermions, pseudo-relativistic masless quasiparticles that have no high-energy counterparts. Their realization in transition metal monosilicides has exemplified their intriguing physical properties, such as long Fermi arc surface states and unusual optical responses. Recent experimental studies on amorphous transition metal monosilicides suggest that topological properties may survive beyond crystals, even though theoretical evidence is lacking. Motivated by these findings, we theoretically study a tight-binding model of amorphous transition metal monosilicides. We find that topological properties of multifold fermions survive in the presence of structural disorder that converts the semimetal into a diffusive metal. We characterize this topological diffusive metal phase with the spectral localizer, a real-space topological indicator that we show can signal multifold fermions. Our findings showcase how topological properties can survive in disordered metals, and how they can be uncovered using the spectral localizer.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from spin fluctuations and long-range interactions in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) has been extensively explored both theoretically and experimentally as a suitable platform for a rich and tunable phase diagram that includes ferromagnetism, charge order, broken symmetries, and unconventional superconductivity. In this work, we investigate the intricate interplay between long-range electron-electron interactions, spin fluctuations, and superconductivity in MATBG. By employing a low-energy model for MATBG that captures the correct shape of the flat bands, we explore the effects of short- and long-range interactions on spin fluctuations and their impact on the superconducting (SC) pairing vertex in the Random Phase Approximation (RPA). We find that the SC state is notably influenced by the strength of long-range Coulomb interactions. Interestingly, our RPA calculations indicate that there is a regime where the system can traverse from a magnetic phase to the SC phase by \emph{increasing} the relative strength of long-range interactions compared to the on-site ones. These findings underscore the relevance of electron-electron interactions in shaping the intriguing properties of MATBG and offer a pathway for designing and controlling its SC phase.</description>

      <title>Designing Moir\'e Patterns by Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments conducted on two-dimensional twisted materials have revealed a plethora of moir\'e patterns with different forms and shapes. The formation of these patterns is usually attributed to the presence of small strains in the samples, which typically arise during their fabrication. In this work we find that the superlattice structure of such systems actually depends crucially on the interplay between twist and strain. For systems composed of honeycomb lattices, we show that this can lead to the formation of practically any moir\'e geometry, even if each lattice is only slightly distorted. As a result, we show that under strain the moir\'e Brillouin zone is not a stretched irregular hexagon, but rather a primitive cell that changes according to the geometry of the strained moir\'e vectors. We identify the conditions for the formation of hexagonal moir\'e patterns arising solely due to shear or biaxial strain, thus opening the possibility of engineering moir\'e patterns solely by strain. Moreover, we study the electronic properties in such moir\'e patterns and find that the strain tends to suppress the formation of the flat moir\'e bands, even in the strain-induced hexagonal patterns analogous to those obtained by the twist only. Our work explains the plethora of moir\'e patterns observed in experiments, and provides a solid theoretical foundation from which one can design moir\'e patterns by strain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hofstadter model successfully describes the behavior of non-interacting quantum particles hopping on a lattice coupled to a gauge field, and hence is ubiquitous in many fields of research, including condensed matter, optical, and atomic physics. Motivated by this, we introduce HofstadterTools (https://hofstadter.tools), a Python package that can be used to analyze the energy spectrum of a generalized Hofstadter model, with any combination of hoppings on any regular Euclidean lattice. The package can be applied to compute key properties of the band structure, such as quantum geometry and topology, as well as plot Hofstadter butterflies and Wannier diagrams that are colored according to their Chern numbers.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Rydberg exciton-polaritons in Cu$_2$O microcavities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rydberg excitons (analogues of Rydberg atoms in condensed matter systems) are highly excited bound electron-hole states with large Bohr radii. The interaction between them as well as exciton coupling to light may lead to strong optical nonlinearity, with applications in sensing and quantum information processing. Here, we achieve strong effective photon-photon interactions (Kerr-like optical nonlinearity) via the Rydberg blockade phenomenon and the hybridisation of excitons and photons forming polaritons in a Cu$_2$O-filled microresonators. Under pulsed resonant excitation polariton resonance frequencies are renormalised due to the reduction of the photon-exciton coupling with increasing exciton density. Theoretical analysis shows that the Rydberg blockade plays a major role in the experimentally observed scaling of the polariton nonlinearity coefficient as $\propto n^{4.4 \pm 1.8}$ for principal quantum numbers up to n = 7. Such high principal quantum numbers studied in a polariton system for the first time are essential for realisation of high Rydberg optical nonlinearities, which paves the way towards quantum optical applications and fundamental studies of strongly-correlated photonic (polaritonic) states in a solid state system.</description>

      <title>Luminescence properties of closely packed organic color centers grafted on a carbon nanotube</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the photo-luminescence of pairs of organic color centers in single-wall carbon nanotubes grafted with 3,5 dichlorobenzene. Using various techniques such as intensity correlations, super-localization microscopy or luminescence excitation spectroscopy, we distinguish two pairs of color centers grafted on the same nanotube; the distance between the pairs is on the order of several hundreds of nanometers. In contrast, by studying the strong temporal correlations in the spectral diffusion in the framework of photo-induced Stark effect, we can estimate the distance within each pair to be of the order of a few nanometers. Finally, the electronic population dynamics is investigated using time-resolved luminescence and saturation measurements, showing a biexponential decay with a fast overall recombination (compatible with a fast population transfer between the color centers within a pair) and a weak delayed repopulation of the traps possibly due to the diffusion of excitons along the tube axis.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Geometry of Nonequilibrium Fluctuations in Cyclically Driven Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium thermal machines under cyclic driving generally outperform steady-state counterparts. However, there is still lack of coherent understanding of versatile transport and fluctuation features under time modulations. Here, we formulate a theoretical framework of thermodynamic geometry in terms of full counting statistics of nonequilibrium driven transports. We find that, besides the conventional dynamic and adiabatic geometric curvature contributions, the generating function is divided into an additional nonadiabatic contribution, manifested as the metric term of full counting statistics. This nonadiabatic metric generalizes recent results of thermodynamic geometry in near-equilibrium entropy production to far-from-equilibrium fluctuations of general currents. Furthermore, the framework proves geometric thermodynamic uncertainty relations of near-adiabatic thermal devices, constraining fluctuations in terms of statistical metric quantities. We exemplify the theory in experimentally accessible driving-induced quantum chiral transport and Brownian heat pump.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework based on classical electromagnetism, to describe optical properties of Fabry-P\'erot cavities, filled with multilayered and linear chiral materials. We find a formal link between transfer-matrix, scattering-matrix and Green-function approaches to compute the polarization-dependent optical transmission, and cavity-modified circular dichroism signals. We show how general symmetries like Lorentz reciprocity and time-reversal symmetry constrain the modelling of such cavities. We apply this approach to investigate numerically and analytically the properties of various Fabry-P\'erot cavities, made of either metallic or helicity-preserving dielectric photonic crystal mirrors. In the latter case, we analyze the onset of chiral cavity-polaritons in terms of partial helicity-preservation of electromagnetic waves reflected at the mirrors interfaces. Our approach is relevant for designing innovative Fabry-P\'erot cavities for chiral-sensing, and for probing cavity-modified stereochemistry.</description>

      <title>Evolution from quantum anomalous Hall insulator to heavy-fermion semimetal in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14064v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ground states of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at chiral and flat-band limit with integer fillings are known from exact solutions, while their dynamical and thermodynamical properties are revealed by unbiased quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. However, to elucidate experimental observations of correlated metallic, insulating and superconducting states and their transitions, investigations on realistic, or non-chiral cases are vital. Here we employ momentum-space QMC method to investigate the evolution of correlated states in magic-angle TBG away from chiral limit at charge neutrality with polarized spin/valley, which approximates to an experimental case with filling factor $\nu=-3$. We find that the ground state evolves from quantum anomalous Hall insulator into an intriguing correlated semimetallic state possessing heavy-fermion features as AA hopping strength reaches experimental values. Such a state resembles the recently proposed heavy-fermion representations with localized electrons residing at AA stacking regions and delocalized electrons itinerating via AB/BA stacking regions. The spectral signatures of the localized and itinerant electrons in the heavy-fermion semimetal phase are revealed, with the connection to experimental results being discussed.</description>

Abstract: Control of topological edge modes is desirable for encoding quantum information resiliently against external noise. Their implementation on quantum hardware, however, remains a long-standing problem due to current limitations of circuit depth and noise, which grows with the number of time steps. By utilizing recently developed constant-depth quantum circuits in which the circuit depth is independent of time, we demonstrate successful long-time dynamics simulation of bulk and surface modes in topological insulators on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors, which exhibits robust signatures of localized topological modes. We further identify a class of one-dimensional topological Hamiltonians that can be readily simulated with NISQ hardware. Our results provide a pathway towards stable long-time implementation of interacting many-body systems on present day quantum processors.</description>
