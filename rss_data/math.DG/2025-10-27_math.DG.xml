      <title>A singular Serre-Swan theorem via tepui fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical Serre-Swan theorem asserts that any finitely generated projective module over the algebra $C^\infty(M)$ of smooth functions of a manifold $M$ can be realized as the sections of a vector bundle over $M$. In this article, we extend this theorem beyond the projective case, by introducing a notion of singular vector bundle whose sections can realize all finitely generated $C^\infty(M)$-modules, up to invisible elements. We introduce tepui fibrations as the underlying geometric objects of these singular vector bundles, and show how these tepui fibrations can model singular foliations, their holonomy groupoids, and singular subalgebroids.</description>

      <title>The topology of 3-dimensional Hessian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the global topology of three-dimensional Hessian manifolds. We prove that every compact, orientable Hessian 3-manifold is either the Hantzsche Wendt manifold or admits the structure of a Kahler mapping torus. This result highlights a deep and intrinsic relationship between Hessian and Kahler geometries. Furthermore, we provide a classification of compact, orientable, three-dimensional Hessian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Iso-Riemannian Optimization on Learned Data Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional data that exhibit an intrinsic low-dimensional structure are ubiquitous in machine learning and data science. While various approaches allow for learning the corresponding data manifold from finite samples, performing downstream tasks such as optimization directly on these learned manifolds presents a significant challenge. This work introduces a principled framework for optimization on learned data manifolds using iso-Riemannian geometry. Our approach addresses key limitations of classical Riemannian optimization in this setting, specifically, that the Levi-Civita connection fails to yield constant-speed geodesics, and that geodesic convexity assumptions break down under the learned pullback constructions commonly used in practice. To overcome these challenges, we propose new notions of monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity tailored to the iso-Riemannian setting and propose iso-Riemannian descent algorithms for which we provide a detailed convergence analysis. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of those algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets, including MNIST under a learned pullback structure. Our approach yields interpretable barycentres, improved clustering, and provably efficient solutions to inverse problems, even in high-dimensional settings. These results establish that optimization under iso-Riemannian geometry can overcome distortions inherent to learned manifold mappings.</description>

      <title>On the uniqueness of even $L^p$ Minkowski problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that there is a unique $p_0\in [0,1)$, which can be characterized by the eigenvalue of Hilbert operator related to a convex body, that the even $L^p$ Minkowski problem has a unique solution for $p\geq p_0$, and the uniqueness fails for infinitely many convex bodies if $p&lt;p_0$. The previous results by many experts in the field assert that the uniqueness holds for $p&gt;p_0$.</description>

      <title>Conformal characterization of the Fefferman-Graham ambient metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the asymptotic structure of the Fefferman-Graham ambient metric. We prove that every straight ambient metric admits a conformal completion with a well-defined null infinity, and that the asymptotic expansion of the metric at infinity can be related to that at the homothetic horizon. Furthermore, in even dimensions, we show that the Fefferman-Graham obstruction tensor naturally arises in the geometry at infinity. By identifying the fundamental properties that this particular conformal extension exhibits, and analyzing their sufficiency, we arrive at the main result of the paper, namely the identification of a set of conformally covariant conditions that completely characterize the ambient metric from a conformal perspective. In particular, our result relaxes the requirement of the homothety one-form being exact.</description>

      <title>Non-Archimedean Calabi-Yau Potentials on Certain Affine Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We solve a non-Archimedean Monge-Amp\`ere equation on the Berkovich analytification of a complex log Calabi-Yau pair whose dual complex is a standard simplex, answering a question of Collins-Li and offering a non-Archimedean analog of Ricci-flat metric potentials on complex affine varieties. This work builds on the solution to a complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation obtained by Collins-Li and Collins-Tong-Yau. We also show the suitably rescaled limits of the complex potentials coincide with their non-Archimedean counterparts in some situations, strengthening their connections.</description>

      <title>The Dirichlet-to-Neumann Map for Poincar\'e-Einstein Fillings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the non-linear Dirichlet-to-Neumann map for the Poincar\'e-Einstein filling problem. For even dimensional manifolds the range of this non-local map is described in terms of a rank two "Dirichlet-to Neumann tensor" along the boundary determined by the Poincar\'e-Einstein metric. This tensor is proportional to the variation of renormalized volume along a path of Poincar\'e-Einstein metrics. We construct natural "Dirichlet-to-Neumann hypersurface invariants" that are conformally invariant and recover all Dirichlet-to-Neumann tensors. We give an explicit formula for these hypersurface invariants and use a new vanishing result for odd order $T$-curvatures to show that they are the unique, natural conformal hypersurface invariant of transverse order equaling the boundary dimension. We also construct such conformally invariant Dirichlet-to-Neumann hypersurface invariants for Poincar\'e-Einstein fillings for odd dimensional manifolds with conformally flat boundary.</description>

      <title>Connected Components on Lie Groups and Applications to Multi-Orientation Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and analyze a new algorithm to find the connected components of a compact set $I$ from a Lie group $G$ endowed with a left-invariant Riemannian distance. For a given $\delta&gt;0$, the algorithm finds the largest cover of $I$ such that all sets in the cover are separated by at least distance $\delta$. We call the sets in the cover the $\delta$-connected components of I (closely related to $\check{\text{C}}$ech complexes of radius $\delta/2$). The grouping relies on an iterative procedure involving morphological dilations with Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman kernels on $G$ and notions of $\delta$-thickened sets. We prove that the algorithm converges in finitely many iteration steps. We find the optimal value for $\delta$ using persistence diagrams. We also propose specific affinity matrices that allow for grouping of $\delta$-connected components based on their local proximity and alignment.
  Among the many different applications of the algorithm, in this article, we focus on illustrating that the method can efficiently identify (possibly overlapping) branches in complex vascular trees on retinal images. This is done by applying an orientation score transform to the images that allows us to view them as functions from $\mathbb{L}_2(G)$ where $G=SE(2)$, the Lie group of roto-translations. By applying our algorithm in this Lie group, we illustrate that we obtain $\delta$-connected components that differentiate between crossing structures and that group well-aligned, nearby structures. This contrasts standard connected component algorithms in $\mathbb{R}^2$.</description>

      <title>On the Rosenberg-Stolz Conjecture for $ X \times \mathbb{R}^{2} $ and Its Application in Complex Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $ X $ be an oriented, closed manifold with $ \dim X \geqslant 2 $. In this article, we give both Riemannian geoemtry and complex geometry results on (sub)manifolds of the type $ X \times \mathbb{C}^{k} $ or $ X \times \mathbb{R}^{k} $. For Riemannian geometry side, we show that if $ X \times \mathbb{C} = X \times \mathbb{R}^{2} $ admits a Riemannian metric $ g $ with uniformly positive scalar curvature and bounded curvature, such that some novel conformally invariant $ g $-angle condition is satisfied, then there exists a complete metric $ \tilde{g} $ conformal to $ g $ such that $ \tilde{g} |_{X} $ has positive scalar curvature. This Riemannian path implies a complex geometry result: we show that if the complex manifold $ X \times \mathbb{C} $ admits a Hermitian metric $ \omega $ whose associated Riemannian metric $ g $ has uniformly positive scalar curvature and is of bounded curvature, then $ X \times \mathbb{C} $ admits a Hermitian metric $ \tilde{\omega} $ with positive Chern scalar curvature, provided that some $ g $-angle condition is satisfied. The Riemannian geometry result partially answers a 1994 Rosenberg-Stolz conjecture in all dimensions. The complex geometry result extends a result of XiaoKui Yang from compact Hermitian manifolds to noncompact Hermitian manifolds of type $ X \times \mathbb{C} $. We further generalize both the Riemannian and complex geometry results to $ X \times \mathbb{R}^{k} $ or $ X \times \mathbb{C}^{k} $ for any $ k \geqslant 1 $ by imposing a generalized conformally invariant angle condition.</description>

      <title>Regularity and structure of non-planar $p$-elasticae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove regularity and structure results for $p$-elasticae in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with arbitrary $p\in (1,\infty)$ and $n\geq2$. Planar $p$-elasticae are already classified and known to lose regularity. In this paper, we show that every non-planar $p$-elastica is analytic and three-dimensional, with the only exception of flat-core solutions of arbitrary dimensions. Subsequently, we classify pinned $p$-elasticae in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and, as an application, establish a Li-Yau type inequality for the $p$-bending energy of closed curves in $\mathbb{R}^n$. This extends previous works for $p=2$ and $n\geq2$ as well as for $p\in (1,\infty)$ and $n=2$.</description>

      <title>Total Generalized Variation of the Normal Vector Field and Applications to Mesh Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel formulation for the second-order total generalized variation (TGV) of the normal vector on an oriented, triangular mesh embedded in $\R^3$. The normal vector is considered as a manifold-valued function, taking values on the unit sphere. Our formulation extends previous discrete TGV models for piecewise constant scalar data that utilize a Raviart-Thomas function space. To extend this formulation to the manifold setting, a tailor-made tangential Raviart-Thomas type finite element space is constructed in this work. The new regularizer is compared to existing methods in mesh denoising experiments.</description>
