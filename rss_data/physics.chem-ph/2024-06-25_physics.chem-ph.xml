      <title>Catalysis in Extreme Field Environments: The Case of Strongly Ionized $SiO_{2}$ Nanoparticle Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High electric fields can significantly alter catalytic environments and the resultant chemical processes. Such fields arise naturally in biological systems but can also be artificially induced through localized excitations at nanoscale. Recently, strong field excitation of dielectric nanoparticles has emerged as an avenue for studying catalysis in highly ionized environments producing extreme electric fields. While the dynamics of surface ion emission driven by ultrafast laser ionization has been heavily explored, understanding the molecular dynamics leading to fragmentation has remained elusive. To address this, we employed a multiscale approach utilizing non-adiabatic quantum molecular dynamics (NAQMD) simulations on hydrogenated silica surfaces in both bare and wetted environments under field conditions mimicking those of an ionized nanoparticle. Our findings indicate that hole localization drives fragmentation dynamics, leading to surface silanol dissociation within 50 fs and charge transfer-induced water splitting in wetted environments within 150 fs. Further insight into such ultrafast mechanisms is critical for advancement of catalysis on the surface of charged nanosystems.</description>

      <title>Correlation Functions From Tensor Network Influence Functionals: The Case of the Spin-Boson Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the application of matrix product state (MPS) representations of the influence functionals (IF) for the calculation of real-time equilibrium correlation functions in open quantum systems. Focusing specifically on the unbiased spin-boson model, we explore the use of IF-MPSs for complex time propagation, as well as IF-MPSs for constructing correlation functions in the steady state. We examine three different IF approaches: one based on the Kadanoff-Baym contour targeting correlation functions at all times, one based on a complex contour targeting the correlation function at a single time, and a steady state formulation which avoids imaginary or complex times, while providing access to correlation functions at all times. We show that within the IF language, the steady state formulation provides a powerful approach to evaluate equilibrium correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Completely Multipolar Model as a General Framework for Many-Body Interactions as Illustrated for Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for many-body force field models, the Completely Multipolar Model (CMM), that utilizes multipolar electrical moments modulated by exponential decay of electron density as a common functional form for all piecewise terms of an energy decomposition analysis of intermolecular interactions. With this common functional form the CMM model establishes well-formulated damped tensors that reach the correct asymptotes at both long- and short-range while formally ensuring no short-range catastrophes. The CMM describes the separable EDA terms of dispersion, exchange polarization, and Pauli repulsion with short-ranged anisotropy, polarization as intramolecular charge fluctuations and induced dipoles, while charge transfer describes explicit movement of charge between molecules, and naturally describes many-body charge transfer by coupling into the polarization equations. We also utilize a new one-body potential that accounts for intramolecular polarization by including an electric field-dependent correction to the Morse potential to ensure that the CMM reproduces all physically relevant monomer properties including the dipole moment, molecular polarizability, and dipole and polarizability derivatives. The quality of the CMM is illustrated through agreement of individual terms of the EDA and excellent extrapolation to energies and geometries of an extensive validation set of water cluster data.</description>

      <title>Determining the Dielectric Constant of Solid/Liquid Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dielectric constant ({\epsilon}') of interfacial water is an important parameter, but its measurement has posed challenges, and no consensus has been reached on a generalized expression. We derived a formula for {\epsilon}' of a buried interface using the slab model for a half-solvated sphere:\varepsilon^{\prime}=\varepsilon_1 \varepsilon_2\left(\varepsilon_2-\varepsilon_1+6\right) / 2\left(2 \varepsilon_2+\varepsilon_1\right) \text {, where } \varepsilon_1 \text { and } \varepsilon_2 are the dielectric constants of the solid and liquid phases, respectively. We experimentally validated this expression using vibrational sum frequency generation and Fresnel factor calculations for interfaces of alumina with water (H2O and D2O) and acetonitrile. This fills an important knowledge gap in the description of the dielectric constant of interfaces.</description>

      <title>Improved Modularity and New Features in ipie: Towards Even Larger AFQMC Calculations on CPUs and GPUs at Zero and Finite Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ipie is a Python-based auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) package that has undergone substantial improvements since its initial release [J. Chem. Theory Comput., 2022, 19(1): 109-121]. This paper outlines the improved modularity and new capabilities implemented in ipie. We highlight the ease of incorporating different trial and walker types and the seamless integration of ipie with external libraries. We enable distributed Hamiltonian simulations, allowing for multi-GPU simulations of large systems. This development enabled us to compute the interaction energy of a benzene dimer with 84 electrons and 1512 orbitals, which otherwise would not have fit on a single GPU. We also support GPU-accelerated multi-slater determinant trial wavefunctions [arXiv:2406.08314] to enable efficient and highly accurate simulations of large-scale systems. This allows for near-exact ground state energies of multi-reference clusters, [Cu$_2$O$_2$]$^{2+}$ and [Fe$_2$S$_2$(SCH$_3$)]$^{2-}$. We also describe implementations of free projection AFQMC, finite temperature AFQMC, AFQMC for electron-phonon systems, and automatic differentiation in AFQMC for calculating physical properties. These advancements position ipie as a leading platform for AFQMC research in quantum chemistry, facilitating more complex and ambitious computational method development and their applications.</description>

      <title>Impact of Loss Mechanisms on Linear Spectra of Excitonic and Polaritonic Aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of loss mechanisms governed by empirical time-scales affect the dynamics and spectra of systems in profound ways. However, incorporation of these effects and their interaction with the thermal dissipative environments interacting with the system prove to be challenging. We have recently developed the path integral Lindblad dynamics (PILD) method to combine numerically rigorous path integral simulations with Lindblad dynamics to account for such empirical loss mechanisms. In this work, we utilize the PILD method to study the absorption and circular dichroism spectra of chiral molecular aggregates and excitonic polaritons. We demonstrate that the effect of loss on particular states in both systems can differ not just on the basis of the symmetries of the state but also on the basis of complicated "interactions" of the system and the loss mechanism with the dissipative environments. We present probably the first numerical exploration of the CD spectrum of chiral molecular aggregates confined in a cavity. While the CD spectrum of just the excitonic aggregates itself is not amenable to simplistic understanding like the exciton chirality (EC) rule, the CD spectrum of polaritonic molecules is even more complex. Additionally, the impact of empirical loss on the polaritonic CD spectrum seems to be highly site-dependent. The impact of a lossy cavity is qualitatively different from the impact of a molecule that leaks the excitation. We explore some of those effects in depth leveraging the framework of path integral Lindblad dynamics.</description>

      <title>Deriving the Redfield equation for electronically open molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a formalism to describe fractional charging of a molecule due to interactions with its environment. The interactions which induce fractional charging are contained in the Hamiltonian of the full system (molecule and environment). Such interactions can be singled out by expressing the Hamiltonian in a local spin orbital basis, and they are the main focus of this work. A reduced density operator for the molecule is derived starting from the Liouville-von Neumann equation for the full system by employing an explicitly constructed projection superoperator. By treating the molecule as an electronically open quantum system, we obtain a Redfield equation where the environment is included approximately. Phenomenological broadening of energy levels is included to mimic finite lifetimes of electronic states. The populations of the reduced density operator determine the mixture of different redox states and, hence, the fractional charging of the molecule. To illustrate the formalism, we use benzene physisorbed on a graphene sheet as a toy model. The work presented in this paper constitutes an initial step toward understanding molecules as electronically open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>A versatile and transportable endstation for controlled molecule experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a new versatile transportable endstation for controlled molecule (eCOMO) experiments providing a combination of molecular beam purification by electrostatic deflection and simultaneous ion and electron detection using velocity-map imaging (VMI). The $b$-type electrostatic deflector provides spatial dispersion of species based on their effective-dipole-moment-to-mass ratio. This enables selective investigation of molecular rotational quantum states, conformers, and molecular clusters. Furthermore, the double-sided VMI spectrometer equipped with two high-temporal-resolution event-driven Timepix3 cameras provides detection of all generated ions independently of their mass-over-charge ratio and electrons. To demonstrate the potential of this novel apparatus, we present experimental results from our investigation of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) after ionization. Specifically, we provide the characterization of the molecular beam, electrostatic deflector, and electron- and ion-VMI spectrometer. The eCOMO endstation delivers a platform for ultrafast dynamics studies using a wide range of light sources from table-top lasers to free-electron-laser and synchrotron-radiation facilities. This makes it suitable for research activities spanning from atomic, molecular, and cluster physics, over energy science and chemistry, to structural biology.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Molecular Dynamics calculations on NO oxidation over oxygen functionalized Highly Oriented Pyrolytic Graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oxidation of NO molecules on epoxy-functionalized highly oriented pyrolytic graphite, thermalized at 300 K, was studied by means of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations. Four collision energies and two different orientations were analyzed where the reaction, adsorption, and scattering probabilities were computed. Our results reveal that NO$_2$ formation can occur even at the lowest collision energy investigated (0.025 eV), approximately equivalent to room temperature (300 K), which agrees qualitatively with the experimental results. This underscores the influence of dynamics on the NO oxidation process, since this oxidation barrier was previously theoretically estimated to be about 0.1 eV at 0 K, which is four times higher than our lowest collision energy. Additionally, we obtained angular and energy distributions of the products under selected simulation conditions. Scattered NO molecules show low specular reflection, lose half of their initial translational energy, and remain vibrationally cold with minimal rotational excitation. Furthermore, a statistical analysis of all reactive trajectories, focusing on configurations at specific reaction moments, elucidated the structural requirements for the reaction to occur under dynamic conditions. Finally, this study demonstrates the potential of oxygen-doped carbon surfaces for the conversion of NO to NO$_2$.</description>

      <title>NeuralSCF: Neural network self-consistent fields for density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kohn-Sham density functional theory (KS-DFT) has found widespread application in accurate electronic structure calculations. However, it can be computationally demanding especially for large-scale simulations, motivating recent efforts toward its machine-learning (ML) acceleration. We propose a neural network self-consistent fields (NeuralSCF) framework that establishes the Kohn-Sham density map as a deep learning objective, which encodes the mechanics of the Kohn-Sham equations. Modeling this map with an SE(3)-equivariant graph transformer, NeuralSCF emulates the Kohn-Sham self-consistent iterations to obtain electron densities, from which other properties can be derived. NeuralSCF achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in electron density prediction and derived properties, featuring exceptional zero-shot generalization to a remarkable range of out-of-distribution systems. NeuralSCF reveals that learning from KS-DFT's intrinsic mechanics significantly enhances the model's accuracy and transferability, offering a promising stepping stone for accelerating electronic structure calculations through mechanics learning.</description>

      <title>Is it possible to overheat ice? The activated melting of TIP4P/Ice at solid-vapor coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A widely accepted phenomenological rule states that solids with free surfaces cannot be overheated. In this work we discuss this statement critically under the light of the statistical thermodynamics of interfacial roughening transitions. Our results show that the basal face of ice as described by the TIP4P/Ice model can remain mechanically stable for more than one hundred nanoseconds when overheated by 1~K, and for several hundreds of nanoseconds at smaller overheating despite the presence of a significant quasi-liquid layer at the surface. Such time scales, which are often of little experimental significance, can become a concern for the determination of melting points by computer simulations using the direct coexistence method. In the light of this observation, we reinterpret computer simulations of ice premelting and show that current results for the TIP4P/Ice model all imply a scenario of incomplete surface melting. Using a thermodynamic integration path, we reassess our own estimates for the Laplace pressure difference between water and vapor. These calculations are used to measure the disjoining pressure of premelting liquid films and allow us to confirm a minimum of the interfacial free energy at finite premelting thickness of about one nanometer.</description>

      <title>General Binding Affinity Guidance for Diffusion Models in Structure-Based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structure-Based Drug Design (SBDD) focuses on generating valid ligands that strongly and specifically bind to a designated protein pocket. Several methods use machine learning for SBDD to generate these ligands in 3D space, conditioned on the structure of a desired protein pocket. Recently, diffusion models have shown success here by modeling the underlying distributions of atomic positions and types. While these methods are effective in considering the structural details of the protein pocket, they often fail to explicitly consider the binding affinity. Binding affinity characterizes how tightly the ligand binds to the protein pocket, and is measured by the change in free energy associated with the binding process. It is one of the most crucial metrics for benchmarking the effectiveness of the interaction between a ligand and protein pocket. To address this, we propose BADGER: Binding Affinity Diffusion Guidance with Enhanced Refinement. BADGER is a general guidance method to steer the diffusion sampling process towards improved protein-ligand binding, allowing us to adjust the distribution of the binding affinity between ligands and proteins. Our method is enabled by using a neural network (NN) to model the energy function, which is commonly approximated by AutoDock Vina (ADV). ADV's energy function is non-differentiable, and estimates the affinity based on the interactions between a ligand and target protein receptor. By using a NN as a differentiable energy function proxy, we utilize the gradient of our learned energy function as a guidance method on top of any trained diffusion model. We show that our method improves the binding affinity of generated ligands to their protein receptors by up to 60\%, significantly surpassing previous machine learning methods. We also show that our guidance method is flexible and can be easily applied to other diffusion-based SBDD frameworks.</description>

      <title>Quantum rates in dissipative systems with spatially varying friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate whether making the friction spatially dependent on the reaction coordinate introduces quantum effects into the thermal reaction rates for dissipative reactions. Quantum rates are calculated using the numerically exact multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method, as well as the approximate ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), ring-polymer instanton (RPI) methods, and classical mechanics. By conducting simulations across a wide range of temperatures and friction strengths, we can identify the various regimes that govern the reactive dynamics. At high temperatures, in addition to the spatial-diffusion and energy-diffusion regimes predicted by Kramer's rate theory, a (coherent) tunnelling-dominated regime is identified at low friction. At low temperatures, incoherent tunnelling dominates most of Kramer's curve, except at very low friction when coherent tunnelling becomes dominant. Unlike in classical mechanics, the bath's influence changes the equilibrium time-independent properties of the system, leading to a complex interplay between spatially dependent friction and nuclear quantum effects even at high temperatures. More specifically, a realistic friction profile can lead to an increase (decrease) of the quantum (classical) rates with friction within the spatial-diffusion regime, showing that classical and quantum rates display qualitatively different behaviours. Except at very low frictions, we find that RPMD captures most of the quantum effects in the thermal reaction rates.</description>

      <title>Scalable Ab Initio Electronic Structure Methods with Near Chemical Accuracy for Main Group Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study evaluates the precision of widely recognized quantum chemical methodologies, CCSD(T), DLPNO-CCSD(T) and localized ph-AFQMC, for determining the thermochemistry of main group elements. DLPNO-CCSD(T) and localized ph-AFQMC, which offer greater scalability compared to canonical CCSD(T), have emerged over the last decade as pivotal in producing precise benchmark chemical data. Our investigation includes closed-shell, neutral molecules, focusing on their heat of formation and atomization energy sourced from four specific small molecule datasets. Firstly, we selected molecules from the G2 and G3 datasets, noted for their reliable experimental heat of formation data. Additionally, we incorporate molecules from the W4-11 and W4-17 sets, which provide high-level theoretical reference values for atomization energy at 0 K. Our findings reveal that both DLPNO-CCSD(T) and ph-AFQMC methods are capable of achieving a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of less than 1 kcal/mol across the combined dataset, aligning with the threshold for chemical accuracy. Moreover, we make efforts to confine the maximum deviations within 2 kcal/mol, a degree of precision that significantly broadens the applicability of these methods in fields such as biology and materials science.</description>

      <title>Validation of ML-UQ calibration statistics using simulated reference values: a sensitivity analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some popular Machine Learning Uncertainty Quantification (ML-UQ) calibration statistics do not have predefined reference values and are mostly used in comparative studies. In consequence, calibration is almost never validated and the diagnostic is left to the appreciation of the reader. Simulated reference values, based on synthetic calibrated datasets derived from actual uncertainties, have been proposed to palliate this problem. As the generative probability distribution for the simulation of synthetic errors is often not constrained, the sensitivity of simulated reference values to the choice of generative distribution might be problematic, shedding a doubt on the calibration diagnostic. This study explores various facets of this problem, and shows that some statistics are excessively sensitive to the choice of generative distribution to be used for validation when the generative distribution is unknown. This is the case, for instance, of the correlation coefficient between absolute errors and uncertainties (CC) and of the expected normalized calibration error (ENCE). A robust validation workflow to deal with simulated reference values is proposed.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum thermodynamics described as a system-bath model: The dimensionless minimum work principle</title>

Abstract: We formulate a thermodynamic theory applicable to both classical and quantum systems. These systems are depicted as thermodynamic system-bath models capable of handling isothermal, isentropic, thermostatic, and entropic processes. Our approach is based on the use of a dimensionless thermodynamic potential expressed as a function of the intensive and extensive thermodynamic variables. Using the principles of dimensionless minimum work and dimensionless maximum entropy derived from quasi-static changes of external perturbations and temperature, we obtain the Massieu-Planck potentials as entropic potentials and the Helmholtz-Gibbs potentials as free energy. These potentials can be interconverted through time-dependent Legendre transformations. Our results are verified numerically for an anharmonic Brownian system described in phase space using the low-temperature quantum Fokker-Planck equations in the quantum case and the Kramers equation in the classical case, both developed for the thermodynamic system-bath model. Thus, we clarify the conditions for thermodynamics to be valid even for small systems described by Hamiltonians and establish a basis for extending thermodynamics to non-equilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Observation of full contrast icosahedral Bose-Einstein statistics in laser desorbed, buffer gas cooled C$_{60}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum mechanical nature of spherical top molecules is particularly evident at low angular momentum quantum number J. Using infrared spectroscopy on the 8.4$\mu$m rovibrational band of buffer gas cooled $^{12}$C$_{60}$, we observe the hitherto unseen R(J = 0 - 29) rotational progression, including the complete disappearance of certain transitions due to the molecule's perfect icosahedral symmetry and identical bosonic nuclei. The observation of extremely weak C$_{60}$ absorption is facilitated by a laser desorption C$_{60}$ vapor source, which transfers 1000-fold less heat to the cryogenic buffer gas cell than a traditional oven source. This technique paves the way to cooling C$_{60}$ and other large gas phase molecules to much lower temperatures, providing continued advances for spectral resolution and sensitivity.</description>
