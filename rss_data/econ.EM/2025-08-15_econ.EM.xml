      <title>Two-Way Mean Group Estimators for Heterogeneous Panel Models with Fixed T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a correlated random coefficient panel data model with two-way fixed effects and interactive fixed effects in a fixed T framework. We propose a two-way mean group (TW-MG) estimator for the expected value of the slope coefficient and propose a leave-one-out jackknife method for valid inference. We also consider a pooled estimator and provide a Hausman-type test for poolability. Simulations demonstrate the excellent performance of our estimators and inference methods in finite samples. We apply our new methods to two datasets to examine the relationship between health-care expenditure and income, and estimate a production function.</description>

      <title>On the implications of proportional hazards assumptions for competing risks modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The assumption of hazard rates being proportional in covariates is widely made in empirical research and extensive research has been done to develop tests of its validity. This paper does not contribute on this end. Instead, it gives new insights on the implications of proportional hazards (PH) modelling in competing risks models. It is shown that the use of a PH model for the cause-specific hazards or subdistribution hazards can strongly restrict the class of copulas and marginal hazards for being compatible with a competing risks model. The empirical researcher should be aware that working with these models can be so restrictive that only degenerate or independent risks models are compatible. Numerical results confirm that estimates of cause-specific hazards models are not informative about patterns in the data generating process.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Gini indices: An axiomatic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Via an axiomatic approach, we characterize the family of n-th order Gini deviation, defined as the expected range over n independent draws from a distribution, to quantify joint dispersion across multiple observations. This extends the classical Gini deviation, which relies solely on pairwise comparisons. Our generalization grows increasingly sensitive to tail inequality as n increases, offering a more nuanced view of distributional extremes. We show that these higher-order Gini deviations admit a Choquet integral representation, inheriting the desirable properties of coherent deviation measures. Furthermore, we prove that both the n-th order Gini deviation and its normalized version, the n-th order Gini coefficient, are n-observation elicitable, facilitating rigorous backtesting. Empirical analysis using World Inequality Database data reveals that higher-order Gini coefficients detect disparities obscured by the classical Gini coefficient, particularly in cases of extreme income or wealth concentration. Our results establish higher-order Gini indices as valuable complementary tools for robust inequality assessment.</description>

      <title>A General Design-Based Framework and Estimator for Randomized Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a design-based framework for drawing causal inference in general randomized experiments. Causal effects are defined as linear functionals evaluated at unit-level potential outcome functions. Assumptions about the potential outcome functions are encoded as function spaces. This makes the framework expressive, allowing experimenters to formulate and investigate a wide range of causal questions, including about interference, that previously could not be investigated with design-based methods. We describe a class of estimators for estimands defined using the framework and investigate their properties. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for unbiasedness and consistency. We also describe a class of conservative variance estimators, which facilitate the construction of confidence intervals. Finally, we provide several examples of empirical settings that previously could not be examined with design-based methods to illustrate the use of our approach in practice.</description>

      <title>Online Distributional Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale streaming data are common in modern machine learning applications and have led to the development of online learning algorithms. Many fields, such as supply chain management, weather and meteorology, energy markets, and finance, have pivoted towards using probabilistic forecasts. This results in the need not only for accurate learning of the expected value but also for learning the conditional heteroskedasticity and conditional moments. Against this backdrop, we present a methodology for online estimation of regularized, linear distributional models. The proposed algorithm is based on a combination of recent developments for the online estimation of LASSO models and the well-known GAMLSS framework. We provide a case study on day-ahead electricity price forecasting, in which we show the competitive performance of the incremental estimation combined with strongly reduced computational effort. Our algorithms are implemented in a computationally efficient Python package ondil.</description>

      <title>Partial identification via conditional linear programs: estimation and policy learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many important quantities of interest are only partially identified from observable data: the data can limit them to a set of plausible values, but not uniquely determine them. This paper develops a unified framework for covariate-assisted estimation, inference, and decision making in partial identification problems where the parameter of interest satisfies a series of linear constraints, conditional on covariates. In such settings, bounds on the parameter can be written as expectations of solutions to conditional linear programs that optimize a linear function subject to linear constraints, where both the objective function and the constraints may depend on covariates and need to be estimated from data. Examples include estimands involving the joint distributions of potential outcomes, policy learning with inequality-aware value functions, and instrumental variable settings. We propose two de-biased estimators for bounds defined by conditional linear programs. The first directly solves the conditional linear programs with plugin estimates and uses output from standard LP solvers to de-bias the plugin estimate, avoiding the need for computationally demanding vertex enumeration of all possible solutions for symbolic bounds. The second uses entropic regularization to create smooth approximations to the conditional linear programs, trading a small amount of approximation error for improved estimation and computational efficiency. We establish conditions for asymptotic normality of both estimators, show that both estimators are robust to first-order errors in estimating the conditional constraints and objectives, and construct Wald-type confidence intervals for the partially identified parameters. These results also extend to policy learning problems where the value of a decision policy is only partially identified. We apply our methods to a study on the effects of Medicaid enrollment.</description>
