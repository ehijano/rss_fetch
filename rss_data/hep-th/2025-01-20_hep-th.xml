      <title>A relativistic continuous matrix product state study of field theories with defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to compute expectation values in 1+1-dimensional massive Quantum Field Theories (QFTs) with line defects using Relativistic Continuous Matrix Product State (RCMPS). Exploiting Euclidean invariance, we use a quantization scheme where (imaginary) time runs perpendicularly to the defect. With this choice, correlation functions of local operators in the presence of the defect can be computed as expectation values of extended operators in the no-defect vacuum, which can be approximated by a homogeneous RCMPS. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this machinery by computing correlation functions of local bulk and defect operators in $\phi^4$ theory with a magnetic line defect, in perturbative, strong coupling, critical, and symmetry-broken regimes.</description>

      <title>More varieties of 4-d gauge theories: product representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, we used methods of arithmetic geometry to study the anomaly-free irreducible representations of an arbitrary gauge Lie algebra. Here we generalize to the case of products of irreducible representations, where it is again possible to give a complete description. A key result is that the projective variety corresponding to $m$-fold product representations of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{su}_n$ is a rational variety for every $m$ and $n$. We study the simplest case of $\mathfrak{su}_3$ (corresponding to the strong interaction) in detail. We also describe the implications of a number-theoretic conjecture of Manin (and related theorems) for the number of chiral representations of bounded size $B$ (measured roughly by the Dynkin labels) compared to non-chiral ones, giving a precise meaning to the sense in which the former, which are those most relevant for phenomenology, are rare compared to the latter. As examples, we show that, for both irreducible representations of $\mathfrak{su}_5$ and once-reducible product representations of $\mathfrak{su}_3$ that are non-anomalous, the number of chiral representations is asymptotically between $B (\log B)^5$ and $B^\frac{4}{3}$, while the number of non-chiral representations is asymptotically $B^2$.</description>

      <title>Holographic Bound of Casimir Effect in General Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been proposed that holography imposes a universal lower bound on the Casimir effect for 3d BCFTs. This paper generalizes the discussions to higher dimensions. We find Einstein gravity, DGP gravity, and Gauss-Bonnet gravity sets a universal lower bound of the strip Casimir effect in general dimensions. We verify the holographic bound by free theories and $O(N)$ models in the $\epsilon$ expansions. We also derive the holographic bound of the Casimir effect for a wedge and confirm free theories obey it. It implies holography sets a lower bound of the Casimir effect for general boundary shapes, not limited to the strip. Finally, we briefly comment on the impact of mass and various generalizations and applications of our results.</description>

      <title>Quantum field theory on curved manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a manifold of a system with internal degrees of freedom, such as Lorentz symmetry or gauge symmetry, the ``curvature'' is defined for the manifold. If one defines the local vacuum in the tangent space of the manifold, one can define a local mapping in the vicinity of the contact point, which is nothing but the Bogoliubov transformation. The curvature of the electromagnetic field gives the Schwinger effect, and the curvature of the base space introduces the local Unruh effect, which realizes Hawking radiation if applied on the Black hole horizon. To show how the Bogoliubov transformation appears on the manifold and why the local calculation is crucial there, we consider the Schwinger effect with a slowly varying electric field. Then, we show what happens in the Unruh effect if the acceleration is not a constant parameter.</description>

      <title>Fully viable DHOST bounce with extra scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a class of Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor (DHOST) theories with an extra scalar field, which admits viable solutions of bouncing universe satisfying the following requirements: (i) absence of Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) instability, ghost and gradient instability, (ii) absence of superluminality, (iii) generation of nearly scale-invariant curvature perturbations and very small tensor-to-scalar ratio, and (iv) conventional asymptotics in the distant past and future, where gravity sector is described by General Relativity and the DHOST scalar has a canonical form of Lagrangian. We also expect our models to have sufficiently small non-Gaussianities of primordial curvature perturbations to be compatible with observations. As such, this work exemplifies for the first time the fully viable two-field DHOST bouncing cosmology, which is free of instability and superluminality problems as well as compatible with observations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational solitons and non-relativistic string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the non-relativistic string theory (NRST) limit of type II string theory and its action on gravitational solitons. As a start, we exhibit in detail that the NRST limit is T-dual to a discrete lightcone limit and can be viewed as a near-BPS limit. This also clarifies the nature of multi-string states of NRST and its connection to matrix string theory. We consider the NRST limit of the fundamental string soliton, confirming the recent finding that it corresponds to a relativistic near-horizon background, which we argue is the manifestation of a strong coupling phase of the NRST worldvolume theory. Furthermore, we consider the NRST limit of a class of D-branes as well as the NS5-brane. This reveals that they become gravitational solitons in NRST, as they are sourced torsional string Newton-Cartan (TSNC) geometries. Finally, for the NRST D-brane solitons we show that a further decoupling limit leads to new holographic correspondences between multicritical matrix theories and NRST in curved TSNC backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a rigorous definition of sine dilaton gravity in terms of the worldsheet theory of the complex Liouville string arXiv:2409.17246. The latter has a known exact solution that we leverage to explore the gravitational path integral of sine dilaton gravity - a quantum deformation of dS JT gravity that admits both AdS$_2$ and dS$_2$ vacua. We uncover that the gravitational path integral receives contributions from new saddles describing transitions between vacua in a third-quantized picture. We also discuss the sphere and disk partition function in this context and contrast our findings with other recent work on this theory.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic safety meets tensor field theory: towards a new class of gravity-matter systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining asymptotically safe quantum gravity with a tensor field theory, we exhibit the first example of a theory with gravity and scalar fields in four dimensions which may realize asymptotic safety at a non-vanishing value of the scalar quartic coupling.
  We first present (further) evidence that in the asymptotic-safety paradigm, quantum fluctuations of gravity generically screen the quartic couplings in (multi-)scalar models. For a tensor field theory in which the scalar field transforms under an internal $O(N)^3$ symmetry, this has the effect of replacing asymptotic freedom, recently discovered at large $N$ on a fixed flat background, by an interacting fixed point in the presence of quantum gravity. The fixed point originates from the competition between the effects of the matter self-interactions which, contrary to the usual scalar models, are antiscreening, and the screening gravitational effects.</description>

Abstract: We generalise the Kugo and Ojima formalism henceforth called KO) for the structure of state space in gauge theories, in four respects:- (i) We allow for a more general class of gauge-fixing including non-covariant cases. (ii) We display the two possible Hamiltonians allowed by the KO action. (iii) We give manifestly Lorentz invariant forms of KO, showing that they are not unique. (iv) We analyse the structure of Fock space, proving that the allowed states span exactly half of it (leaving aside pure transverse states).</description>

Abstract: We present the interior solution for a static, spherically symmetric perfect fluid star backreacted by QFT in four dimensions invoking no arbitrary parameters. It corresponds to a constant energy density star and is fully non-perturbative. The space of solutions includes ultra-compact configurations that have neither singularities nor light rings inside the star and can exist arbitrarily close to the Schwarzschild limit, showing that the classical paradigm of astrophysics does not hold once QFT in curved space is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Optical gravitational waves as signals of Gravitationally-Decaying Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-lived heavy particles present during the big bang could have a decay channel opened by gravitons. Such decays can produce gravitational waves with large enough abundance to be detectable, and a peculiar narrow spectrum peaked today around optical frequencies. We identify which particles can decay in one or two gravitons. The maximal gravitational wave abundance arises from theories with extra hidden strong gauge dynamics, such as a confining pure-glue group. An interesting abundance also arises in theories with perturbative couplings. Future observation might shed light on early cosmology and allow some spectroscopy of sub-Planckian gravitationally-decaying particles, plausibly present in a variety of theories such as gauge unification, supersymmetry, extra dimensions, strings.</description>

      <title>Environmental effects in extreme mass ratio inspirals: perturbations to the environment in Kerr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future gravitational wave observatories open a unique avenue to study the environments surrounding black holes. Intermediate or extreme mass ratio inspirals will spend thousands to millions of cycles in the sensitivity range of detectors, allowing subtle environmental effects to accumulate in the gravitational waveform. Working in Lorenz gauge and considering equatorial circular orbits, we present the first self-consistent, fully relativistic calculation of a perturbation to a black hole environment due to an inspiraling secondary in the Kerr geometry. As an example case, we consider the environment to be that of a superradiantly grown scalar cloud, though our framework is generalizable to other scenarios. We demonstrate that the scalar field develops a rich wake structure induced by the secondary and compute scalar fluxes emitted to infinity and through the horizon. Relative differences in the fluxes compared to Schwarzschild are tens of percent on large intervals of parameter space, underscoring the importance of modeling in Kerr.</description>

      <title>Experimental signatures of Kalb-Ramond-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse phenomenological signatures of Kalb-Ramond-like particles, described by an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor, when coupled to fermionic matter. The latter is modelled by a tensor current coupled directly to the Kalb-Ramond field or by a pseudovector current coupled to the rank-1 dual of the field-strength tensor. We obtain limits on the coupling constants to fermions and mass of the Kalb-Ramond-like particles by investigating their impact on the spectroscopy of simple atomic systems, the tree-level unitarity of the $S$ matrix for $e^- + e^+ \rightarrow \ell^- + \ell^+$ scattering with $\ell \neq e$ and the differential cross section for Bhabha scattering. Assuming that the couplings to fermions are independent of the fermion species, the strongest $95\%$-CL bounds we find are from LEP data at $\sqrt{s} = 136.23$~GeV, namely $g_{\rm PV}/\Lambda \lesssim 6.3 \times 10^{-13} \, {\rm eV}^{-1}$ and $g_{\rm T} \lesssim 1.3 \times 10^{-12} \left( m/{\rm eV} \right)$, both for $m \ll \sqrt{s}$ (here $\Lambda$ is a characteristic energy scale). These limits can be improved in upcoming lepton colliders due to enhanced precision, as well as higher energies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the average trajectories of relativistic quantum particles in Schwarzschild spacetime, obtained via quantum mechanical weak measurements of momentum and energy, are equivalent to the predicted flow lines of probability current in curved spacetime quantum theory. We subsequently demonstrate that these trajectories correspond exactly to classical null geodesics in a hybrid Schwarzschild-Alcubierre spacetime. This threefold equivalence demonstrates how quantum theory in curved spacetime can be formulated via operationally-defined measurements, and that such a theory may be interpreted deterministically, in the spirit of hidden-variable models such as Bohmian mechanics, through the novel connection to an underlying "guiding metric."</description>

      <title>Black hole with global monopole charge in self-interacting Kalb-Ramond field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution in the context of a self-interacting Kalb-Ramond field coupled with a global monopole. By incorporating the effects of Lorentz-violating term $\ell$ and the monopole charge $\eta$ in the KR field, we derive the modified gravitational field equations and analyze the resulting black hole spacetime. The obtained solution exhibits deviations from the Schwarzschild metric with topological defect, as it is influenced by the monopole charge and self-interaction potential. We investigate the thermodynamic properties of the black hole, including its Hawking temperature, entropy, and specific heat, revealing novel stability conditions. Additionally, we perform solar system tests such as perihelion precession, gravitational redshift, light deflection, and time delay of signals to impose constraints on the Lorentz-violating parameter and monopole charge. Our findings suggest that these parameters have to be significantly small, although there are different constraints imposed by individual tests, ranging from $10^{-9}\leq|\ell|\leq 10^{-4}$ and $10^{-9}\leq\eta\leq 10^{-6}\, \mathrm{m}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Collapsing domain walls with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating coupling to thermalized fermions and their impact on gravitational wave detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of domain walls formed through the spontaneous breaking of an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a scalar field, focusing on their collapse under the influence of quantum and thermal corrections induced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating Yukawa coupling to Dirac fermions in the thermal bath. The thermal effects render the potential bias between the true and false vacua temperature-dependent and may lead to notable variations in the annihilation temperature of domain walls, in addition to the shift caused by temperature-independent quantum corrections. These modifications could substantially alter the gravitational wave spectrum produced by collapsing domain walls, potentially providing observable signatures for future gravitational wave detection experiments.</description>

      <title>A state sum for four-dimensional Lorentzian quantum geometry in terms of edge vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the construction of a new state sum model for $4d$ Lorentzian quantum gravity based on the description of quantum simplicial geometry in terms of edge vectors. Quantum states and amplitudes for simplicial geometry are built from irreducible representations of the translation group, then related to the representations of the Lorentz group via expansors, leading to interesting (and intricate) non-commutative structures. We also show how the new model connects to the Lorentzian Barrett-Crane spin foam model, formulated in terms of quantized triangle bivectors.</description>

      <title>Gluon skewed generalized parton distributions of proton from a light-front Hamiltonian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate all leading-twist gluon generalized parton distributions (GPDs) inside the proton at nonzero skewness using the basis light-front quantization framework. The proton's light-front wave functions are derived from a light-front quantized Hamiltonian incorporating Quantum Chromodynamics inputs. Our results show that the qualitative behaviors of the GPDs are consistent with those from other theoretical calculations. Additionally, we analyze the GPDs in the boost-invariant longitudinal coordinate, $\sigma=\frac{1}{2} b^- P^+$, which serves as the Fourier conjugate of the skewness. The GPDs in $\sigma$-space exhibit diffraction patterns, reminiscent of optical wave diffraction.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Formed during Magneto-Hydrodynamic Turbulence in Early Universe as Dominant Part of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) offer a compelling candidate for dark matter. Within the framework of the Standard Model, the production of PBHs through well-tested physical processes is highly worthy of investigations. This work highlights the role of turbulences in the very early universe in sustaining intense and persistent fluctuations of energy or mass density, which could provide a natural mechanism for PBH formations in the primordial universe. We analyze the abundance and mass range of PBHs produced by the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence induced by the first-order electroweak phase transition, and, remarkably, without invoking any new physics beyond the Standard Model, we find that the mass range of the produced PBHs falls within the only allowed ``asteroid mass'' window from current joint observations, and their abundance constitutes approximately 20\% of the total mass and energy of the universe. These findings strongly suggest that PBHs produced by the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the early universe could comprise the dominant part of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Invariant Theory and Magic State Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the performance of a linear self-orthogonal $GF(4)$ code for magic state distillation of Bravyi and Kitaev's $|T\rangle$-state is characterized by its simple weight enumerator. We compute weight enumerators of all such codes with less than 20 qubits and find none whose threshold exceeds that of the 5-qubit code. Using constraints on weight enumerators from invariant theory and linear programming, we obtain bounds on the exponent characterizing noise suppression of a $|T\rangle$-state distillation protocol. We also obtain new non-negativity constraints on such weight enumerators by demanding consistency of the associated magic state distillation routine. These ``quantum constraints'' lead to new bounds on the distance of classical self-dual and maximal self-orthogonal linear $GF(4)$ codes, in particular, implying the nonexistence of a self-dual $[12m, 6m, 2m+4]_{GF(4)}$ linear code.</description>

      <title>Rotating spacetimes with a free scalar field in four and five dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct explicit rotating solutions in Einstein's theory of relativity with a minimally coupled free scalar field rederiving and finding solutions in four or five spacetime dimensions. These spacetimes describe, in particular, the back-reaction of a free scalar field evolving in a Kerr spacetime. Adapting the general integrability result obtained many years ago from Eri\c{s}-G\"{u}rses to simpler spherical coordinates, we present a method for rederiving the four-dimensional Bogush-Gal'tsov solution. Furthermore, we find the five-dimensional spacetime featuring a free scalar with two distinct angular momenta. In the static limit, these five-dimensional geometries provide higher-dimensional extensions of the Zipoy-Voorhees spacetime. Last but not least, we obtain the four-dimensional version of a Kerr-Newman-NUT spacetime endowed with a free scalar, where the scalar field's radial profile is extended to incorporate dependence on the polar angular coordinate. Our results offer a comprehensive analysis of several recently proposed four-dimensional static solutions with scalar multipolar hair, representing a unified study of spacetimes with a free scalar field in both four and five dimensions under the general integrability result of Eri\c{s}-G\"{u}rses.</description>

      <title>Near-Boundary Asymptotics and Unique Continuation for the AdS--Einstein--Maxwell System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we extend the results of both Shao and Holzegel-Shao to the AdS-Einstein-Maxwell system $({M}, g, F)$. We study the asymptotics of the metric $g$ and the Maxwell field $F$ near the conformal boundary ${I}$ for the fully nonlinear coupled system. Furthermore, we characterise the holographic (boundary) data used in the second part of this work.
  We also prove the local unique continuation property for solutions of the coupled Einstein equations from the conformal boundary. Specifically, the prescription of the coefficients $(\mathfrak{g}^{(0)}, \mathfrak{g}^{(n)})$ in the near-boundary expansion of $g$, along with the boundary data for the Maxwell fields $(\mathfrak{f}^{0}, \mathfrak{f}^{1})$, on a domain ${D} \subset {I}$ uniquely determines $(g, F)$ near ${D}$. The geometric conditions required for unique continuation are identical to those in the vacuum case, regardless of the presence of the Maxwell fields.

Abstract: In this letter we show that the dispersion relation for the dynamical modes of dislocations ("dislons") in solids is sensitive to the lattice symmetries. In particular, we show that in the IR, the dislon dispersion relation develops a logarithmic dependence on momenta for approximately isotropic lattices whereas for non-isotropic lattices, the linear term dominates. The renormalization group flows for dislocation tension are shown to be distinct for isotropic and anisotropic lattices.</description>

Abstract: Conformal boundary conditions in two-dimensional conformal field theories are still mostly an uncharted territory. Even less is known about the relevant boundary deformations that connect them. A natural approach to the problem is via conformal perturbation theory, which however becomes quickly intractable. Using the formalism of open string field theory, we construct the corresponding classical solution, from which we can easily extract the boundary theory data. As a simple illustration we calculate the boundary degeneracy $g$ to next-to-leading order for a generic theory.</description>

      <title>Integrating the full four-loop negative geometries and all-loop ladder-type negative geometries in ABJM theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decomposition of the four-point ABJM amplituhedron into negative geometries produces compact integrands of logarithmic of amplitudes such that the infrared divergence only comes from the last loop integration, from which we can compute the cusp anomalous dimension of the ABJM theory. In this note, we integrate $L-1$ loop momenta of the $L$-loop negative geometries for all four-loop negative geometries and a special class of all-loop ladder-type negative geometries by a method based on Mellin transformation, and from these finite quantities we extract the corresponding contribution to the cusp anomalous dimension. We find that the infrared divergence of a box-type negative geometry at $L=4$ is weaker than other negative geometries, then only tree-type negative geometries contribute to the cusp anomalous dimension at $L=4$. For the all-loop ladder-type negative geometries, we prove and conjecture some recursive structures as integral equations in Mellin space and find that they cannot contribute zeta values like $\zeta_3,\zeta_5$ to the cusp anomalous dimension.</description>

Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of two coupled SYK models, conjectured to be holographically dual to an eternal traversable wormhole in AdS$_2$. We consider different periodic drivings of the parameters of the system. We analyze the energy flows in the wormhole and black hole phases of the model as a function of the driving frequency. Our numerical results show a series of resonant frequencies in which the energy absorption and heating are enhanced significantly and the transmission coefficients drop, signalling a closure of the wormhole. These frequencies correspond to part of the conformal tower of states and to the boundary graviton of the dual gravitational theory. Furthermore, we provide evidence supporting the existence of a hot wormhole phase between the black hole and wormhole phases. When driving the strength of the separate SYK terms we find that the transmission can be enhanced by suitably tuning the driving.</description>

Abstract: We study supersymmetric Janus solutions from matter-coupled $F(4)$ gauged supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets and $SO(4)\sim SO(3)\times SO(3)$ gauge group. There are two supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacua preserving all supersymmetries with $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ and $SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ symmetries dual to $N=2$ SCFTs in five dimensions. We consider a truncation to $SO(2)_{\textrm{diag}}\subset SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ singlet scalars and find a number of new supersymmetric Janus solutions preserving eight supercharges. These solutions holographically describe conformal interfaces within $N=2$ five-dimensional SCFTs involving deformations by source terms and vacuum expectation values of relevant and irrelevant operators. Apart from the Janus solutions interpolating between $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ $AdS_6$ vacua, some of the solutions have $SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ $AdS_6$ vacua generated by holographic RG flows from the $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ phases on both sides. We also give an evidence for solutions describing RG-flow interfaces with $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ $AdS_6$ vacuum on one side and $SO(3)_{\textrm{diag}}$ $AdS_6$ vacuum on the other side. The solutions provide first examples of Janus solutions involving more than one $AdS_6$ vacuum in six-dimensional gauged supergravity.</description>

Abstract: We study supersymmetric solutions of matter-coupled $F(4)$ gauged supergravity in the forms of $AdS_2\times S^3$- and $AdS_3\times S^2$-sliced domain walls with a non-vanishing two-form field from the supergravity multiplet. These two types of solutions holographically describe conformal line and surface defects within five-dimensional $N=2$ SCFTs, respectively. In the case of $SO(3)\times SO(3)$ gauge group obtained by coupling $F(4)$ supergravity to three vector multiplets, we find charged domain wall solutions describing holographic RG flows between two supersymmetric $AdS_6$ vacua with a running two-form field supporting the line and surface defects. For a particular case of one vector multiplet with $SO(3)\times U(1)$ gauge group, we find solutions describing RG flows from an $AdS_6$ vacuum to physically acceptable singular geometries in the presence of defects. This class of solutions can be uplifted to type IIB theory using a consistent truncation obtained from $SO(5,5)$ exceptional field theory with half-maximal structures.</description>

Abstract: The $\mathcal{A}$-theory takes U-duality symmetry as a guiding principle, with the SL(5) U-duality symmetry being described as the world-volume theory of a 5-brane. Furthermore, by unifying the 6-dimensional world-volume Lorentz symmetry with the SL(5) spacetime symmetry, it extends to SL(6) U-duality symmetry. The SL(5) spacetime vielbein fields and the 5-brane world-volume vielbein fields are mixed under the SL(6) U-duality transformation. We demonstrate that consistent sectionings of the SL(6) $\mathcal{A}$5-brane world-volume Lagrangian yield Lagrangians of the ${\cal T}$-string with O(D,D) T-duality symmetry, the conventional string, the $\mathcal{M}$5-brane with GL(4) duality symmetry, and the non-perturbative M2-brane in supergravity theory. The GL(4) covariant Lagrangian of the $\mathcal{M}$5-brane derived in this manner is a new, perturbatively quantizable theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamical edge modes in Maxwell theory from a BRST perspective, with an application to the Casimir energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, dynamical edge modes (DEM) in Maxwell theory have been constructed using a specific local boundary condition on the horizon. We discuss how to enforce this boundary condition on an infinite parallel plate in the QED vacuum by introducing Lagrange multiplier fields into the action. We carefully introduce appropriate boundary ghosts to maintain BRST invariance. Explicit correspondence of this BRST extended theory with the original DEM formulation is discussed, both directly, and through the correspondence between edge modes and Wilson lines attached to the boundary surface. We then use functional methods to calculate the Casimir energy for the first time with DEM boundary conditions imposed on two infinite parallel plates, both in generalized Coulomb and linear covariant gauge. Depending on the gauge, different fields are contributing, but, after correctly implementing the BRST symmetry, we retrieve the exact same Casimir energy as for two perfectly conducting parallel plates.</description>

      <title>Vertex operators for the superstring with manifest $d=6$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After extending the six-dimensional hybrid formalism for the superstring by adding $d=6$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ superspace variables and unconstrained bosonic ghosts, a manifestly spacetime supersymmetric vertex operator $U$ is constructed. BRST invariance of $U$ is proven to imply the SYM equations of motion in $d=6$ $N=1$ superspace. It is then shown that spacetime supersymmetric scattering amplitudes can be computed in a similar manner as in the non-minimal pure spinor formalism.</description>

      <title>Something Anomalies can tell about SM and Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07470v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This ia a review/research paper on anomalies applied to a bottom-up approach to standard model and gravity. It is divided in two parts. The first consists in a review proper of anomalies in quantum field theories. Anomalies are analyzed according to three different methods: a perturbative one based on Feynman diagram, a non-perturbative one relying on the Schwinger-DeWitt approach and, third, the one hinging on the Atiyah-Singer family's index theorem. The three methods are applied both to chiral gauge anomalies and trace anomalies. The fundamental distinction that our presentation leads to is between obstructive (O) and non-obstructive (NO) anomalies. The former are tied to the non-existence of fermion propagators, which fatally maim the corresponding theory. In the second part we apply this analysis to the SM and various of its extensions immersed in a gravitational background, and find that they all are plagued by a residual chiral trace anomaly. To completely eliminate all kind of dangerous anomalies in SM-like theories we propose a somewhat unconventional scheme, and exemplify it by means of an explicit model. The latter is a left-right symmetric model. We embed it in a Weyl geometry to render it conformal invariant. We then deal with some of its quantum aspects, in particular its even (NO) trace anomalies and the means to preserve its confomal invariance at the quantum level. We briefly review renormalization and unitarity in the framework of similar models discussed in the existing literature. Finally we present a possible (conjectural) application of the model to describe the junction between cosmology and quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss how to compute maximal-helicity-violating (MHV) form factors for the chiral part of the stress-tensor supermultiplet from periodic light-like polygon Wilson loops in planar $\mathcal N=4$ super Yang-Mills theory beyond the one-loop level. We show that the periodicity imposes path ordering on points on different edges, which explains the appearance of square roots coming from non-planar Feynman diagrams. Taking such diagrams into account, we provide the integrand of the two-loop $n$-particle MHV form factor, compute all diagrams, prove the cancellation of divergences and finally compute the two-loop 5-particle and 6-particle form factors as examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent arguments based on the quantum extremal surface formula or the gravitational path integral have given fairly compelling evidence that the Hilbert space of quantum gravity in a closed universe is one-dimensional and real. How can this be consistent with the complexity of our own experiences? In this paper we propose that the experiences of any observer $Ob$ in a closed universe can be approximately described by a quantum mechanical theory with a Hilbert space whose dimension is roughly $e^{S_{Ob}}$, where $S_{Ob}$ is the number of degrees of freedom of $Ob$. Moreover we argue that the errors in this description are exponentially small in $S_{Ob}$. We give evidence for this proposal using the gravitational path integral and the coding interpretation of holography, and we explain how similar effects arise in black hole physics in appropriate circumstances.</description>

      <title>Non-local modular flows across deformed null-cuts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modular flows probe important aspects of the entanglement structures, especially those of QFTs, in a dynamical framework. Despite the expected non-local nature in the general cases, the majority of explicitly understood examples feature local space-time trajectories under modular flows. In this work, we study a particular class of non-local modular flows. They are associated with the relativistic vacuum state and sub-regions whose boundaries lie on a planar null-surface. They satisfy a remarkable algebraic property known as the half-sided modular inclusion, and as a result the modular Hamiltonians are exactly known in terms of the stress tensor operators. To be explicit, we focus on the simplest QFT of a massive or massless free scalar in $2+1$ dimensions. We obtain explicit expressions for the generators. They can be separated into a sum of local and non-local terms showing certain universal pattern. The preservation of von-Neumann algebra under modular flow works in a subtle way for the non-local terms. We derive a differential-integral equation for the finite modular flow, which can be analyzed in perturbation theory of small distance deviating from the entanglement boundary, and re-summation can be performed in appropriate limits. Comparison with the general expectation of modular flows in such limits are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of chaos across the phase transition in a 2-coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, with a focus on the unstable "hot wormhole" phase. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we employ two non-equilibrium protocols that allow access to this phase, which is inaccessible through equilibrium simulations: one involves cooling the system via a coupling to a thermal bath, while in the other we periodically drive the coupling parameter between the two sides. We numerically compute the Lyapunov exponents of the hot wormhole for the two cases. Our results uncover a rich structure within this phase, including both thermal and non-thermal solutions. These behaviors are analyzed in detail, with partial insights provided by the Schwarzian approximation, which captures certain but not all aspects of the observed dynamics.</description>

Abstract: We consider two complex SYK models entangled in a thermofield double (TFD) state and investigate the effect of one-sided projective measurements. As measurement operator we choose single site charge operators. Performing a measurement results in a non-zero $U(1)$ charge. The entropy curve differs from the previously studied SYK model due to a thermodynamic phase transition that takes place after a certain charge is reached. We also match our results to a dual bulk description. Finally, a teleportation protocol is provided to support the notion of a traversable wormhole being formed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining toric geometry techniques and $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity formalisms, we study 5D black branes in the M-theory compactification on a four parameter Calabi-Yau threefold. First, we investigate 5D BPS and non-BPS black holes that are derived by wrapping M2-branes on non-holomorphic 2-cycles in such a toric Calabi-Yau manifold. Concretely, we provide the allowed electric charge regions of BPS and non-BPS black hole states that are obtained by surrounding M2-branes over appropriate 2-cycles. Then, we approach the black hole thermodynamic behavior by computing the entropy and the temperature. By evaluating the recombination factor, we examine the stability of such non-BPS black holes. Precisely, we find stable and unstable solutions depending on the allowed electric charge regions. After that, we study 5D black strings by wrapping M5-branes on non-holomorphic dual 4-cycles in the proposed toric Calabi-Yau manifold by focusing on the stability behaviors. In the allowed regions of the moduli space of the non-BPS stringy solutions, we find stable and unstable states depending on the magnetic charge values.</description>

      <title>Relativity and decoherence of spacetime superpositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.03259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is univocally anticipated that in a theory of quantum gravity, there exist quantum superpositions of semiclassical states of spacetime geometry. Such states could arise for example, from a source mass in a superposition of spatial configurations. In this paper we introduce a framework for describing such "quantum superpositions of spacetime states." We introduce the notion of the relativity of spacetime superpositions, demonstrating that for states in which the superposed amplitudes differ by a coordinate transformation, it is always possible to re-express the scenario in terms of dynamics on a single, fixed background. Our result unveils an inherent ambiguity in labelling such superpositions as genuinely quantum-gravitational, which has been done extensively in the literature, most notably with reference to recent proposals to test gravitationally-induced entanglement. We apply our framework to the above mentioned scenarios looking at gravitationally-induced entanglement, the problem of decoherence of gravitational sources, and clarify commonly overlooked assumptions. In the context of decoherence of gravitational sources, our result implies that the resulting decoherence is not fundamental, but depends on the existence of external systems that define a relative set of coordinates through which the notion of spatial superposition obtains physical meaning.</description>

      <title>Entanglement transitions induced by quantum-data collection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03061v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an entanglement transition in an array of qubits, induced by the transfer of quantum information from a system to a quantum computer. This quantum-data collection is an essential protocol in quantum machine learning algorithms that promise exponential advantage over their classical counterparts. In this and an accompanying work [Phys. Rev. A 111, 012425 (2025)], we identify sufficient conditions for an entanglement transition to occur in the late time state of the system and quantum computer. In this letter, we present an example entanglement transition occurring in a system comprised of a 1D chain of qubits evolving under a random brickwork circuit. After each layer, a fraction $p$ of sites undergo noisy quantum transduction in which quantum information is transferred to a quantum computer but at the cost of introducing noise from an environment. For an entanglement transition to occur, we argue that the environment must obtain the same amount of information as gained by the computer. Under this condition, the circuit shows a transition from volume law to area law entanglement as the rate $p$ is increased above a critical threshold. Our work delineates the prerequisites for quantum-data collection to induce entanglement transitions, thereby establishing a foundational framework for emergent entanglement phenomena in protocols relevant to quantum machine learning.</description>

      <title>Generalizing measurement-induced phase transitions to information exchange symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the conditions for quantum back action to result in a phase transition in the information dynamics of a monitored system. We introduce a framework that captures a wide range of experiments encompassing probes comprised of projective measurements and probes which more generally transfer quantum information from the system to a quantum computer. Our framework explicitly uses a model of unitary evolution which couples system, apparatus and environment. Information dynamics is investigated using the R\'enyi and von-Neumann entropies of the evolving state, and we construct a replica theory for them. We identify the possible replica symmetries an experiment can possess and discuss their spontaneous symmetry breaking. In particular, we identify a minimum subgroup whose spontaneous symmetry breaking results in an entanglement transition. This symmetry is only possible when the information in the apparatus is as informative about the dynamics of the system as the information transferred to the environment. We call this requirement the information exchange symmetry and quantify it by a relationship between the entropies. We then show how the entanglement transition can be understood as the spontaneously breaking of the information exchange symmetry and without referring to the replica theory. Information exchange symmetry breaking is then shown to generalize the phenomenology of the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). We apply this theory to the brickwork quantum-enhanced experiment introduced in an accompanying Letter [Phys. Rev. A 111, L010402 (2025) ] in the case where the unitaries are chosen from the Haar measure, and identify a distinct universality from the MIPT. This notion of information exchange symmetry breaking generalizes the MIPT, and provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of quantum information in quantum-enhanced experiments.</description>

      <title>Gauging modulated symmetries: Kramers-Wannier dualities and non-invertible reflections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries that act in a non-uniform, spatially modulated way and are generalizations of, for example, dipole symmetries. In this paper, we systematically study the gauging of finite Abelian modulated symmetries in ${1+1}$ dimensions. Working with local Hamiltonians of spin chains, we explore the dual symmetries after gauging and their potential new spatial modulations. We establish sufficient conditions for the existence of an isomorphism between the modulated symmetries and their dual, naturally implemented by lattice reflections. For instance, in systems of prime qudits, translation invariance guarantees this isomorphism. For non-prime qudits, we show using techniques from ring theory that this isomorphism can also exist, although it is not guaranteed by lattice translation symmetry alone. From this isomorphism, we identify new Kramers-Wannier dualities and construct related non-invertible reflection symmetry operators using sequential quantum circuits. Notably, this non-invertible reflection symmetry exists even when the system lacks ordinary reflection symmetry. Throughout the paper, we illustrate these results using various simple toy models.</description>

      <title>Generalized Entropy Implies Varying-G: Horizon Area Dependent Field Equations and Black Hole-Cosmology Coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is modified, ambiguity often arises concerning whether the Hawking temperature or the thermodynamic mass should be modified. The common practice, however, is to keep the black hole solution the same as that in general relativity. On the other hand, if Jacobson's method of deriving Einstein equations from thermodynamic is valid in the general settings, then given a generalized entropy one should first derive the corresponding modified gravity, and then look for the compatible black hole solution before investigating its thermodynamics. We comment on some properties and subtleties in this approach. In particular, we point out that generically generalized entropy would lead to a varying effective gravitational "constant" theory, where $G_\text{eff}$ depends on the horizon area. We discuss in what ways such theories are discernible from general relativity despite its seemingly jarring differences, and how to make sense of area-dependent field equations. As a consequence we show that in the Jacobson's approach, the standard quantum gravitational logarithmic correction to Bekenstein-Hawking entropy is equivalent to a running gravitational "constant". A horizon area dependent $G_\text{eff}$ could also lead to a coupling between black hole masses and cosmological expansion, a scenario that has been studied recently in the literature, but so far lacks strong theoretical motivation. In the Tsallis case, we show that the thermodynamic mass for a Schwarzschild black hole is just a constant multiple of its ADM mass, which is considerably simpler than the approach not utilizing the Jacobson's method.</description>

Abstract: The Hawking temperature of a Schwarzschild black hole can be heuristically derived by identifying the temperature with the inverse radius of the horizon up to a multiplicative constant. This does not work for more general black holes such as the Kerr and Reissner-Nordstr\"om solutions. Expounding on the details of how it fails to work nevertheless uncovers interesting connections with the "spring constant" of black holes and with black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of a time-dependent, spherically symmetric background in beyond Horndeski theory and the speed of gravity waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address a dynamical, spherically symmetric background in beyond Horndeski theory and formulate a set of linear stability conditions for high energy perturbation modes above an arbitrary solution. In this general setting we derive speeds of propagation in both radial and angular directions for gravity waves and compare them with the speed of light in the case of minimally coupled photon. In particular, we find that the class of beyond Horndeski theories, which satisfy the equality of gravity waves' speed to the speed of light over a cosmological background, feature gravity waves propagating at luminal speeds above a time-dependent inhomogeneous background as well.</description>

      <title>Gravitino Thermal Production, Dark Matter, and Reheating of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16043v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a full one-loop calculation of the gravitino thermal production rate, beyond the so-called hard thermal loop approximation, using the corresponding thermal spectral functions in numerical form on both sides of the light cone. This framework requires a full numerical evaluation. We interpret our results within the framework of a general supergravity-based model, remaining agnostic about the specifics of supersymmetry breaking. In this context, assuming that gravitinos constitute the entirety of the dark matter in the Universe imposes strict constraints on the reheating temperature. For example, with a gluino mass at the current LHC limit, a maximum reheating temperature of $T_\mathrm{reh} \simeq 10^9$ GeV is compatible with a gravitino mass of $m_{3/2} \simeq 1$ TeV. Additionally, with a reheating temperature an order of magnitude lower at $T_\mathrm{reh} \simeq 10^8$ GeV, the common gaugino mass $M_{1/2}$ can range from $2$ to $4 $ TeV within the same gravitino mass range. For much higher values of $M_{1/2}$, which are favored by current accelerator and cosmological data in the context of supersymmetric models, such as $M_{1/2} = 10$ TeV, and for $m_{3/2} \simeq 1$ TeV the reheating temperature compatible with the gravitino dark matter scenario is $ 10^7$ GeV. If other dark matter particles are considered, the reheating temperature could be much lower.</description>

      <title>Non-singular cosmological scenarios in scalar-tensor theories and their stability: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article gives a concise overview of the development and current status of studies on healthy models of the early Universe without an initial singularity, namely the cosmological bounce and Genesis scenarios, constructed within a broad class of scalar-tensor theories, specifically Horndeski theories and their generalizations. The review focuses on the topics related to linear stability at the perturbation level over the non-singular background solutions: 1) the no-go theorem, valid for non-singular cosmologies within Horndeski theory, 2) the updates on possible approaches to evade the no-go theorem, 3) the role of disformal transformations relating the Horndeski subclasses with the generalized theories like DHOST, 4) the effects on stability caused by additional matter coupling and potential emergence of superluminal perturbation modes in the multi-component setting.</description>

      <title>Geometric distances between closed universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The large-scale structure of the Universe is well approximated by the Friedmann equations, parametrized by several energy densities which can be observationally inferred. A natural question to ask is: How different would the Universe be if these densities took on other values? While there are many ways this can be approached depending on interpretation and mathematical rigor, we attempt an answer by building a "history space" of different cosmologies. A metric is introduced after overcoming technical hurdles related to Lorentzian signature and infinite volume, at least for topologically closed cases. Geodesics connecting two points on the superspace are computed to express how distant--in a purely geometric sense--two universes are. Age can be treated as a free parameter in such an approach, leading to a more general mathematical construct relative to geometrodynamical configuration space. Connections to bubble inflation and phase transitions are explored.</description>

      <title>Complete function space for planar two-loop six-particle scattering amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the full system of canonical differential equations for all planar two-loop massless six-particle master integrals, and determine analytically the boundary conditions. This fully specifies the solutions, which may be written as Chen iterated integrals. We argue that this is sufficient information for evaluating any scattering amplitude in four dimensions up to the finite part. We support this claim by reducing, for the most complicated integral topologies, integrals with typical Yang-Mills numerators. We use the analytic solutions to the differential equations, together with dihedral symmetry, to provide the full solution space relevant for two-loop six-particle computations. This includes the relevant function alphabet, as well as the independent set of iterated integrals up to weight four. We also provide the answer for all master integrals in terms of iterated integrals that can be readily evaluated numerically. As a proof of concept, we provide a numerical implementation that evaluates the integrals in part of the Euclidean region, and validate this against numerical evaluation of the Feynman integrals. Our result removes the bottleneck of Feynman integral evaluation, paving the way to future analytic evaluations of six-particle scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Generic framework for non-perturbative QCD in light hadrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to serve as an introductory resource for disseminating the concept to individuals with interests in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) for hadrons. We discuss several topological aspects of the QCD vacuum and briefly review recent progress on this intuitive unifying framework for the lowlying hadron physics rooted in QCD by introducing the vacuum as a liquid of instantons and anti-instantons. We develop systematic density expansion on the dilute vacuum with diagrammatical Feynman rules to calculate the vacuum expectation values and generalize the calculations to hadronic matrix element (charges), and hadronic form factors using the instanton liquid model (ILM). The ILM prediction are well-consistent with those of recent lattice QCD calculations.</description>
