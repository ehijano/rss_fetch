      <title>Boreal Afforestation's Underestimated Cloud Influence on Earth's Energy Imbalance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth's Energy Imbalance (EEI) is accelerating, partly due to declining planetary albedo from reduced cloud cover. Boreal afforestation can either mitigate or exacerbate this trend through competing biophysical feedbacks. While snow masking reduces surface albedo (+0.5 to +2.5 $W/m^2$ warming), forests can enhance low-level cloud cover (0.1-0.5%) and increase cloud reflectivity via biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), producing potential cooling (-1.8 to -6.7 $W/m^2$). This BVOC-aerosol-cloud pathway remains poorly constrained but may dominate under warmer conditions, challenging carbon-centric mitigation paradigms. Large-scale initiatives (e.g., Canada's 2 Billion Tree Commitment) risk unintended warming if not climate-smartly sited. We present a tiered decision-support framework that integrates biogeochemical and biophysical processes, explicitly incorporating cloud-aerosol feedbacks. Urgent inclusion of these feedbacks in policy is essential to ensure boreal afforestation contributes to EEI stabilization.</description>

      <title>Bridging Clarity and Accuracy: A Simple Spectral Longwave Radiation Scheme for Idealized Climate Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parameterizing radiative transfer in means navigating trade-offs between physical accuracy and conceptual clarity. However, currently available schemes sit at the extremes of this spectrum: correlated-k schemes are fast and accurate but rely on lookup tables which obscure the underlying physics and make such schemes difficult to modify, while gray radiation schemes are conceptually straightforward but introduce significant biases in atmospheric circulation. Here we introduce a Simple Spectral Model (SSM) for clear-sky longwave radiative transfer which bridges this `clarity-accuracy' gap. The SSM accomplishes this by representing the spectral structure of H$_{2}$O and CO$_{2}$ absorption using analytic fits at reference conditions, then uses simple functional forms to extend these fits to different atmospheric conditions. This, coupled to a simple, two-stream solver, yields a system of six equations and ten physically-meaningful parameters which can solve for clear-sky longwave fluxes given atmospheric profiles of temperature and humidity. When implemented in an idealized aquaplanet GCM, the SSM produces zonal-mean climate states which accurately mimic the results using a benchmark correlated-k code. The SSM also alleviates the significant zonal-mean climate biases associated with using gray radiation, including an improved representation of radiative cooling profiles, tropopause structure, jet dynamics, and Hadley Cell characteristics both in control climates and in response to uniform warming. This work demonstrates that even a simple spectral representation of atmospheric absorption suffices to capture the essential physics of longwave radiative transfer, and the SSM promises to be a valuable tool both for idealized climate modeling, and for teaching radiative transfer in the classroom.</description>

      <title>Weather Jiu-Jitsu: Climate Adaptation for the 21st Century</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme climate events, e.g., droughts, floods, heat waves, and freezes, are becoming more frequent and intense with severe global socio-economic impacts. Growing populations and economic activity leads to increased exposure to these events. Scaling existing physical, financial, and social infrastructure to provide resilience against these extreme events is daunting, especially as one ponders projected climate changes. Climate extremes pose a challenge even if decarbonization and geoengineering are able to regulate Earth's radiation balance.
  We argue that there is an urgent need to explore a novel adaptive strategy that we call "Weather Jiu-Jitsu," which leverages the intrinsic chaotic dynamics of weather systems to subtly redirect or dissipate their destructive trajectories through precisely timed, small-energy interventions. By leveraging insights from adaptive chaos control, combined with improved observations, prediction and low-energy weather system interventions, humanity could develop a novel nature assisted global infrastructure to limit the impact of climate extremes in the 21st century.</description>

      <title>Similarities in the Initiation of Upward Positive and Downward Negative Lightning Flashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the relationship between upward negative stepped leader pulses in upward positive lightning and preliminary breakdown pulses (PBPs) in downward negative lightning discharges. Through analysis of simultaneous channel-base current and electric field data from the S\"{a}ntis tower in Switzerland, we found notable similarities between Category A and B upward positive lightning pulses and the "Classical" and "Narrow" PBPs observed in downward negative flashes. Statistical comparisons reveal correlations between electric field and current parameters for Category A pulses, supporting the field-current relationship for preliminary breakdown proposed in previous studies. These results suggest common physical mechanisms underlying both upward and downward lightning initiation processes, providing valuable insights into lightning initiation that could not be obtained from conventional field measurements alone. Furthermore, high-speed camera footage revealed that Category B pulses can be produced by a downward-propagating recoil leader. As a whole, these findings demonstrate that detailed observations of upward lightning can offer valuable insight into the complex processes underlying lightning initiation and propagation.</description>

      <title>Relative Wavefront Errors in Continuous-Variable Quantum Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When undertaking continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) across atmospheric channels, strong classical local oscillators (LOs) are often polarization-multiplexed with the weak quantum signals for coherent measurement at the receiver. Although the wavefronts of the quantum signal and LO are often assumed to experience the same distortion across channels, previous theoretical work has shown that they can experience differential distortions, resulting in relative wavefront errors (WFEs). Such errors have previously been shown to limit CV-QKD performance, in some cases leading to zero secure key rates. In this work, for the first time, we provide strong experimental evidence that relative WFEs are present in some circumstances and that standard assumptions in CV-QKD deployments may need to be revisited. In addition, we demonstrate how turbulence can affect the detailed form of the relative WFEs, thereby indicating that long-range links like terrestrial-satellite channels are likely impacted more than short-range terrestrial-only channels.</description>

      <title>Inversion of Arctic dual-channel sound speed profile based on random airgun signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the unique dual-channel sound speed profiles of the Canadian Basin and the Chukchi Plateau in the Arctic, based on the propagation characteristics of refracted normal modes under dual-channel sound speed profiles, an inversion method using refracted normal modes for dual-channel sound speed profiles is proposed. This method proposes a dual-parameter representation method for dual-channel sound speed profiles, tailored to the characteristics of dual-channel sound speed profiles. A dispersion structure extraction method is proposed for the dispersion structure characteristics of refracted normal modes under dual-channel sound speed profiles. Combining the parameter representation method of sound speed profiles and the dispersion structure extraction method, an inversion method for dual-channel sound speed profiles is proposed. For the common horizontal variation of sound speed profiles in long-distance acoustic propagation, a method for inverting horizontally varying dual-channel sound speed profiles is proposed. Finally, this article verifies the effectiveness of the dual-channel sound speed profile inversion method using the Arctic low-frequency long-range acoustic propagation experiment. Compared with previous sound speed profile inversion methods, the method proposed in this article has the advantages of fewer inversion parameters and faster inversion speed. It can be implemented using only a single hydrophone passively receiving random air gun signals, and it also solves the inversion problem of horizontal variation of sound speed profiles. It has significant advantages such as low cost, easy deployment, and fast computation speed.</description>

      <title>Acoustic source depth estimation method based on a single hydrophone in Arctic underwater</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07157v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the normal mode and ray theory, this article discusses the characteristics of surface sound source and reception at the surface layer, and explores depth estimation methods based on normal modes and rays, and proposes a depth estimation method based on the upper limit of modal frequency. Data verification is conducted to discuss the applicability and limitations of different methods. For the surface refracted normal mode waveguide, modes can be separated through warping transformation. Based on the characteristics of normal mode amplitude variation with frequency and number, the sound source depth can be estimated by matching amplitude information. Based on the spatial variation characteristics of eigenfunctions with frequency, a sound source depth estimation method matching the cutoff frequency of normal modes is proposed. For the deep Arctic sea, the sound ray arrival structure at the receiving end is obtained through the analysis of deep inversion sound ray trajectories, and the sound source depth can be estimated by matching the time difference of ray arrivals. Experimental data is used to verify the sound field patterns and the effectiveness of the sound source depth estimation method.</description>
