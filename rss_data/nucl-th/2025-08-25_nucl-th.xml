      <title>Causality and Stability in Relativistic Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The causality and stability of a relativistic hydrodynamic theory is shown to require a consensus between, either (i) newer degrees of freedom apart from the fundamental fluid fields, or (ii) a general hydrodynamic frame other than the Landau or Eckart compromising the field's first principle definition, unless the non-equilibrium derivative correction goes to infinity. Any finitely truncated derivative correction (no matter how high it is) is shown to lead to an acausal theory, unless the corrections are infinitely summed up to include all orders. From an underlying microscopic theory, an exact form of relativistic hydrodynamics has been derived which establishes that the resummation of all order temporal derivatives is essential for causality, which finally 'integrated in' as newer degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Transport coefficients of hot and dense matter in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transport coefficients are known as the measure of system interactions, as well as the dynamical input of the hydrodynamic evolution equations of an expanding system created in the relativistic heavy ion collisions. In the current analysis, they have been evaluated for strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma system as well as hot hadronic media. The medium effects for an interacting QCD system have been introduced through a quasiparticle model. The same for a hadronic system has been captured via the in-medium self-energy correction using thermal field theory. The resulting behavior of the transport coefficients shows significant modification with respect to the estimations made in vacuum or using ideal equation of state.</description>

      <title>Accurate spontaneous fission half-lives from a microscopic large-scale nuclear structure model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the ability of the BSkG3 model to predict large-scale fission properties. In particular, we focus on the description of spontaneous fission half-lives, which are crucial for modeling the r-process. To assess the model accuracy, we compare predicted and experimental values for all nuclei with available data. The combination of BSkG3 predictive power for ground state and fission properties, the inclusion of triaxial and octupole degrees of freedom, the use of microscopic collective inertias, and the minimization of the action make our approach sophisticated yet practical when it comes to large-scale astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Transversity Generalized Parton Distributions of $\Delta$ with the Diquark Spectator Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show quark transversity generalized parton pistributions (GPDs) of $\Delta^+$ isobar by using the diquark spectator model for the first time. First, this model is tested by electric charge, magnetic-dipole and axial charge form factors, and it is used for calculating the transversity GPDs $H^{qT}_{1,3,5,7}$ of $\Delta^+$. The quark transversity distribution $h_1$ is then obtained from the transversity GPDs in the forward limit. Then, helicity-flip amplitudes are shown numerically by using relations between the helicity amplitudes and the GPDs. Finally, by taking first moments of the GPDs, tensor form factors are obtained and we predict the tensor charge. Experimentally, $N$-$\Delta$ transition GPDs are investigated in deeply virtual Compton scattering and virtual meson-production processes, and generalized distribution amplitudes, which correspond to the $s$-channel GPDs, could be investigated by the two-photon processes $\gamma^* \gamma \to \Delta \bar\Delta$ at the electron-positron colliders. Therefore, the spin-3/2 $\Delta$ GPDs could become interesting quantities experimentally in future.</description>

      <title>$f$-mode Oscillations for Hyperons and H-dibaryons in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fundamental ($f$-mode) oscillations of neutron stars are studied within the quark meson coupling model, a relativistic Hartree-Fock theory of dense nuclear matter, which takes into account the self-consistent modification of the valence quark structure of the bound baryons in the associated strong Lorentz scalar mean fields. For the first time, hyperons and H-dibaryons are included, along with the effects of potential additional short-range repulsion within this scheme, and their influence on $f$-modes is investigated. Universal relations are studied within the relativistic Cowling approximation and compared against those in the existing literature for potential applications in gravitational wave asteroseismology.</description>

      <title>Role of symmetry energy at subnuclear densities in protoneutron star crusts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of matter properties at subnuclear densities on the evolution of protoneutron stars is investigated. Several models of nuclear equation of state (EOS) are constructed with varying saturation parameters, particularly the symmetry energy $S_0$ and its density slope $L$. Using the Thomas--Fermi approximation, the mass and proton numbers of heavy nuclei at subnuclear densities are systematically evaluated, along with their dependence on the EOS. Cooling simulations of protoneutron stars reveal that EOSs with smaller $L$ values lead to a longer cooling timescale and higher average neutrino energies. This behavior is attributed to the enhanced neutrino scattering caused by larger mass numbers, which increases the thermal insulation. Furthermore, the crystallization temperature, marking the onset of crust formation, is found to be higher for EOSs with smaller values of $L$. This is due to the enhanced Coulomb energy associated with larger proton numbers. As a result, despite slower cooling, crust formation occurs earlier for smaller-$L$ EOSs. These findings indicate that the timing of crust formation is sensitive to the EOS and highlight the importance of late-time neutrino observations as probes of the matter properties at subnuclear densities.</description>

      <title>Investigating effects of the electrical conductivity of QCD matter on charge-dependent directed flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charge dependent directed flow is an important observable of electromagnetic fields in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We demonstrate how the difference in charge dependent directed flows between protons and antiprotons is sensitive to the resistivity, inverse of quark-gluon plasma's electric conductivity, over different collision centralities. Our model numerically solves the 3+1D relativistic resistive magneto-hydrodynamic (RRMHD) equations, assuming the electric conductivity to be a scalar. For this work, we focus on symmetric Au + Au collisions at the top RHIC energy of $\sqrt{s}=200$ GeV. We illustrate the time evolution of the electromagnetic fields in our model and connect that to the charge dependent directed flow results. Our results highlight the importance of modeling quark-gluon plasma's electric conductivity for charge dependent observables in relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>From Hyperons to Hypernuclei: A New Route to Unravel Proton Spin Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12193v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions create the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) known as the hottest, least viscous, and most vortical fluid ever produced in terrestrial laboratories. Its vortical structure has been uncovered through the spin polarization of Lambda ($\Lambda$) hyperons, attributed to the spin-orbit coupling that transfers the system's orbital angular momentum to the quark spin, which is then inherited by hadrons via quark recombination or coalescence. However, $\Lambda$ polarization reflects primarily the strange-quark component, leaving the spin dynamics of the up and down quarks largely unexplored. Although the proton is an ideal probe, its stability makes direct measurements experimentally challenging. Here, we propose to unravel proton spin polarization via hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda \text{H}$) measurements, exploiting the fact that spin information is preserved when polarized nucleons and $\Lambda$ coalesce to form hypertriton. We show that, over a broad range of collision energies, the polarizations of proton, $\Lambda$, and hypertriton are related by a simple linear scaling law. Since both $\Lambda$ and hypertriton polarizations can be measured via their self-analyzing weak decays, this linear relation provides a practical experimental avenue for accessing spin polarizations of protons and neutrons-the dominant baryonic degrees of freedom in nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Block Lanczos algorithm for lattice QCD spectroscopy and matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work introduced a new framework for analyzing correlation functions with improved convergence and signal-to-noise properties, as well as rigorous quantification of excited-state effects, based on the Lanczos algorithm and spurious eigenvalue filtering with the Cullum-Willoughby test. Here, we extend this framework to the analysis of correlation-function matrices built from multiple interpolating operators in lattice quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by constructing an oblique generalization of the block Lanczos algorithm, as well as a new physically motivated reformulation of the Cullum-Willoughby test that generalizes to block Lanczos straightforwardly. The resulting block Lanczos method directly extends generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) methods, which can be viewed as applying a single iteration of block Lanczos. Block Lanczos provides qualitative and quantitative advantages over GEVP methods analogous to the benefits of Lanczos over the standard effective mass, including faster convergence to ground- and excited-state energies, explicitly computable two-sided error bounds, straightforward extraction of matrix elements of external currents, and asymptotically constant signal-to-noise. No fits or statistical inference are required. Proof-of-principle calculations are performed for noiseless mock-data examples as well as two-by-two proton correlation-function matrices in lattice QCD.</description>

      <title>Interface modes in inspiralling neutron stars: A gravitational-wave probe of first-order phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the extreme densities in neutron stars, a phase transition to deconfined quark matter is anticipated. Yet masses, radii and tidal deformabilities offer only indirect measures of a first-order phase transition, requiring many detections to resolve or being ineffective observables if the discontinuity exists at lower densities. We report on a smoking-gun gravitational-wave signature of a first-order transition: the resonant tidal excitation of an interface mode. Using relativistic perturbation theory with an equation-of-state family informed by chiral effective field theory, we show that such a resonance may be detectable with next-generation interferometers and possibly already with LIGO A+ for sufficiently loud events.</description>

      <title>Early time hydrodynamic attractor in a nearly-unitary Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamic attractors paradigm aims to explain the applicability of hydrodynamics after a very short timescale in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions at RHIC and LHC in terms of the emergence of universal behavior across different initial states. The attractors observed in theoretical models are first driven by a rapid expansion of matter, which later gives way to the decay of exponentially damped transient excitations into the viscous fluid regime. Recently, a theoretical proposal was made how to realize hydrodynamic attractors in cold atomic gases focusing on the decay of transients and opening prospects for a future experimental realization in table top experiments. Motivated by this, in the present paper we show how the far-from-equilibrium, expansion-driven part of the hydrodynamic attractor emerges in a model of a nearly-unitary Fermi gas.</description>

      <title>The Renormalized Yukawa Hamiltonian: Spectrum, Parton Distribution Functions, and Resource Estimates for Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the Renormalization Group Procedure for Effective Particles (RGPEP) to the front form Yukawa Hamiltonian, yielding a renormalized (effective) Hamiltonian, accurate up to second order in the coupling strength. Subsequently, we examine the spectrum and parton distribution functions produced by the renormalized Hamiltonian, and show that the addition of counterterms leads to finite results. Resource estimates for quantum simulation are calculated for a single `Ladder Operator Block Encoding' (LOBE), and show that the cost to block encode the renormalized Hamiltonian is comparable to block encoding the bare Hamiltonian.</description>
