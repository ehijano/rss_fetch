      <title>Probing leukemia cells behavior under starvation</title>

Abstract: The ability of a cancer cell population to achieve heterogeneity in their phenotype distributions offers advantages in tumor invasiveness and drug resistance. Studying the mechanisms behind such observed heterogeneity in mammalian cells presents challenges due for instance to the prolonged proliferation times compared to widely studied unicellular organisms like bacteria and yeast. Here, we studied the response of leukemia cell populations to serum starvation via a protocol, we recently developed, that makes use of live cell fluorescence and flow cytometry in combination with a quantitative analytical model to follow the population proliferation while monitoring the dynamics of its phenotype distributions. We found that upon switching between a serum-rich to a serum-poor media, leukemia cells (i) maintain a memory of the previous environment up to one generation even in the presence of severe medium-depletion, before (ii) adapting their growth and division rates to the novel environment while preserving a sizer-like division strategy. Finally, looking at the mitochondria content of the proliferating vs non-proliferating cells, we found that the latter is characterized by a higher number of older mitochondria, suggesting a possible functional role of the observed asymmetric partitioning of (aged) mitochondria in leukemia cells.</description>
