      <title>Knowledge-Guided Biomarker Identification for Label-Free Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data: A Reinforcement Learning Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene panel selection aims to identify the most informative genomic biomarkers in label-free genomic datasets. Traditional approaches, which rely on domain expertise, embedded machine learning models, or heuristic-based iterative optimization, often introduce biases and inefficiencies, potentially obscuring critical biological signals. To address these challenges, we present an iterative gene panel selection strategy that harnesses ensemble knowledge from existing gene selection algorithms to establish preliminary boundaries or prior knowledge, which guide the initial search space. Subsequently, we incorporate reinforcement learning through a reward function shaped by expert behavior, enabling dynamic refinement and targeted selection of gene panels. This integration mitigates biases stemming from initial boundaries while capitalizing on RL's stochastic adaptability. Comprehensive comparative experiments, case studies, and downstream analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its improved precision and efficiency for label-free biomarker discovery. Our results underscore the potential of this approach to advance single-cell genomics data analysis.</description>

      <title>Curated loci prime editing (cliPE) for accessible multiplexed assays of variant effect (MAVEs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiplexed assays of variant effect (MAVEs) perform simultaneous characterization of many variants. Prime editing has been recently adopted for introducing many variants in their native genomic contexts. However, robust protocols and standards are limited, preventing widespread uptake. Herein, we describe curated loci prime editing (cliPE) which is an accessible, low-cost experimental pipeline to perform MAVEs using prime editing of a target gene, as well as a companion Shiny app (pegRNA Designer) to rapidly and easily design user-specific MAVE libraries.</description>

      <title>Transcriptome signature for the identification of bevacizumab responders in ovarian cancer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard of care for ovarian cancer comprises cytoreductive surgery, followed by adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy plus taxane therapy and maintenance therapy with the antiangiogenic compound bevacizumab and/or a PARP inhibitor. Nevertheless, there is currently no clear clinical indication for the use of bevacizumab, highlighting the urgent need for biomarkers to assess the response to bevacizumab. In the present study, based on a novel RNA-seq dataset (n=181) and a previously published microarray-based dataset (n=377), we have identified an expression signature potentially associated with benefit from bevacizumab addition and assumed to reflect cancer stemness acquisition driven by activation of CTCFL. Patients with this signature demonstrated improved overall survival when bevacizumab was added to standard chemotherapy in both novel (HR=0.41(0.23-0.74), adj.p-value=7.70e-03) and previously published cohorts (HR=0.51(0.34-0.75), adj.p-value=3.25e-03), while no significant differences in survival explained by treatment were observed in patients negative for this signature. In addition to the CTCFL signature, we found several other reproducible expression signatures which may also represent biomarker candidates not related to established molecular subtypes of ovarian cancer and require further validation studies based on additional RNA-seq data.</description>
