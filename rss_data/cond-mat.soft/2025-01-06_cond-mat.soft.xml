      <title>Dynamic wetting of concentrated granular suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many materials, such as paints and inks used in applications like painting and 3D printing, are concentrated granular suspensions. In such systems, the contact line dynamics and the internal structure of the suspension interact through shear-rate dependent viscosity and internal structural rearrangements. The shear rate increases sharply near moving contact lines, profoundly influencing the non-Newtonian rheology of dense suspensions. Frictional contacts become significant as particles approach each other, forming force-carrying networks of contacts. While hydrodynamic solutions can describe dilute suspensions, their applicability near advancing contact lines in dense suspensions remains unclear. This study explores such applicability by systematically varying inter-particle interactions. We use silica suspensions in two refractive-index matched media: (i) aqueous 2,$2^{\prime}$-thiodiethanol (weak interactions) and (ii) aqueous sodium thiocyanate solution (strong interactions). The two samples vary substantially in their rheological response. Using astigmatism particle tracking velocimetry (APTV), we precisely track the 3D motion of tracer particles within the suspension. To observe the drop over a long travel distance, we use a configuration consisting of a pinned droplet on a moving substrate. We observe distinct behaviours depending on particle interactions and the resulting suspension rheology. The more the particle interactions play a role, i.e., the more pronounced the non-Newtonian effects, the stronger the measured flow profiles differ from the Newtonian solution to the hydrodynamic equations. In case of the viscous suspension, a notable deviation from Newtonian behaviour is observed. Conversely, the yield-stress suspension exhibits plug flow over the substrate, with Newtonian-like behaviour restricted to the yielded region near the substrate.</description>

      <title>Dense array of elastic hairs obstructing a fluidic channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense arrays of soft hair-like structures protruding from surfaces in contact with fluids are ubiquitous in living systems. Fluid flows can easily deform these soft hairs which in turn impacts the flow properties. At the microscale, flows are often confined which exacerbates this feedback loop since the hair deformation has a strong impact on the flow geometry. Here, I investigate experimentally and theoretically pressure driven flows in laminar channels obstructed by a dense array of elastic hairs. I show that the system displays a nonlinear hydraulic resistance that I model by treating the hair bed as a deformable porous media. The porous media height and thus degree of confinement results from the deflection of individual hairs. The resulting fluid-structure interaction model is leveraged to identify the dimensionless drag force $\hat{f}_0$ controlling the elasto-viscous coupling and used to design passive flow control elements for microfluidic networks.</description>

      <title>Architected Dual-Network Solvent-free Adhesives for Stretchable Fabrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural systems, such as tendons and spider silk, demonstrate how the combination of strength and stretchability can be effectively achieved by integrating stiff and flexible network structures. Inspired by these systems, we developed a novel, solvent-free dual-network adhesive based on a self-assembling ABA triblock copolymer, poly(methyl methacrylate)-poly(n-butyl acrylate)-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA-b-PnBA-b-PMMA), designed for applications requiring both high strength and stretchability. The triblock copolymer forms a physically crosslinked network through microdomains of PMMA end-blocks that provide structural integrity, while the PnBA mid-block forms a soft, stretchable matrix. To further enhance mechanical performance, a second poly(n-butyl acrylate) (PnBA) network is polymerized in situ, locking the PMMA microdomains in place and creating a load-bearing system. By varying the crosslinking density of the secondary network, we tailor the adhesive's mechanical properties (Young's modulus: 0.17 - 1.18 MPa) to suit different substrates, creating a mechanically transparent seam. The resulting dual-network system combines different strategies to achieve high strength and stretchability, with adhesive performance comparable to industrial methods such as sewing, particularly in bonding neoprene fabric composites and sealing the joints. Our solvent-free approach also eliminates the need for lengthy solvent evaporation steps, offering an eco-friendly and more efficient alternative for flexible adhesive applications in fields such as soft robotics, flexible electronics, and sports apparel.</description>

      <title>Biased ensembles of pulsating active matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discover unexpected connections between packing configurations and rare fluctuations in dense systems of active particles subject to pulsation of size. Using large deviation theory, we examine biased ensembles which select atypical realizations of the dynamics exhibiting high synchronization in particle size. We show that the order emerging at high bias can manifest as distinct dynamical states featuring high to vanishing pulsation current. Remarkably, transitions between these states arise from changing the system geometry at fixed bias and constant density. We rationalize such transitions as arising from the change in packing configurations which, depending on box geometry, may induce highly ordered or geometrically frustrated structures. Furthermore, we reveal that a master curve in the unbiased dynamics, correlating polydispersity and current, helps predict the dynamical state emerging in the biased dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate that deformation waves can propagate under suitable geometries when biasing with local order.</description>

      <title>Experimental identification of topological defects in 2D colloidal glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological defects are singularities within a field that cannot be removed by continuous transformations. The definition of these irregularities requires an ordered reference configuration, calling into question whether they exist in disordered materials, such as glasses. However, recent work suggests that well-defined topological defects emerge in the dynamics of glasses, even if they are not evident in the static configuration. In this study, we reveal the presence of topological defects in the vibrational eigenspace of a two-dimensional experimental colloidal glass. These defects strongly correlate with the vibrational features and spatially correlate with each other and structural "soft spots", more prone to plastic flow. This work experimentally confirms the existence of topological defects in disordered systems revealing the complex interplay between topology, disorder, and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Entropy stabilized form chirality in curved rod nematics: structure and symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monte Carlo molecular simulations of curve-shaped rods show the propensity of such shapes to polymorphism revealing both smectic and polar nematic phases. The nematic exhibits a nanoscale modulated local structure characterized by a unique, polar, $\rm{C}_2$-symmetry axis that tightly spirals generating a mirror-symmetry-breaking orgnization of the achiral rods=form chirality. A comprehensive characterization of the polarity and its symmetries in the nematic phase confirms that the nanoscale modulation is distinct from the elastic deformations of a uniaxial nematic director in the twist-bend nematic phase. Instead it is shown that, analogous to the isotropic-to-nematic transition, entropy stabilizes the roto-translating polar director in the polar-twisted nematic phase. The conflation of macroscale form chirality in ferroelectric nematics with that in the twist-bend nematic stems from the misattribution of the nanoscale modulation in the lower temperature nematic ''$\rm{N_X}$ phase'' found in CB7CB dimers.</description>

      <title>Mixing soft and rigid particles in a hopper: soft particles induce flow intermittency and avalanches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instabilities and avalanches in granular flows represent hallmarks of failure: they can both disrupt industrial process flows and signal dangerous conditions, like those in grain silos and snowy mountaintops. We investigate intermittency and avalanches in the gravity-driven flow of granular materials through a quasi-2D hopper. Mixtures of rigid polypropylene and soft polyacrylamide particles flow through a hopper constriction. A combination of high-speed imaging, particle identification and tracking analyses enable us to measure quantities including particle velocities, outflow rates, the time intervals between consecutive particle exits, and the geometric properties of any temporary arches that form during a flow test. As the fraction of rigid particles increases in the mixture, the velocity of exiting particles increases. So too, however, does the probability of complete clogging. While soft particles exhibit slower velocities at the hopper exit, they also facilitate greater overall discharge rates. Simultaneously, the presence of soft particles induces both intermittency and avalanches in the flow. In this case, arches that could permanently block the flow are more likely to be temporary in nature. Interestingly, the identity of the particle that falls first from a temporary arch correlates linearly with the mixing fraction in the overall sample. That is, soft particles, despite their correlation with flow instabilities, are not significantly more likely to fall first from a temporary arch. Investigating the arch geometries suggests that the particle forming the largest bond angle with its neighbors is the one that causes an arch to fail, regardless of being soft or rigid.</description>

      <title>Langevin equations and a geometric integration scheme for the overdamped limit of homogeneous rotational Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The translational motion of anisotropic or self-propelled colloidal particles is closely linked with the particle's orientation and its rotational Brownian motion. In the overdamped limit, the stochastic evolution of the orientation vector follows a diffusion process on the unit sphere and is characterised by an orientation-dependent ("multiplicative") noise. As a consequence, the corresponding Langevin equation attains different forms depending on whether Ito's or Stratonovich's stochastic calculus is used. We clarify that both forms are equivalent and derive them from a geometric construction of Brownian motion on the unit sphere, based on infinitesimal random rotations. Our approach suggests further a geometric integration scheme for rotational Brownian motion, which preserves the normalisation constraint of the orientation vector exactly. We show that a simple implementation of the scheme, based on Gaussian random rotations, converges weakly at order 1 of the integration time step, and we outline an advanced variant of the scheme that is weakly exact for an arbitrarily large time step. Due to a favourable prefactor of the discretisation error, already the Gaussian scheme allows for integration time steps that are one order of magnitude larger compared to a commonly used, ad hoc algorithm for rotational Brownian dynamics simulations. The discussion is restricted to time-homogeneous rotational Brownian motion (i.e., a single rotational diffusion constant), which is relevant for axisymmetric particles and also chemically anisotropic spheres such as self-propelled Janus particles.</description>
