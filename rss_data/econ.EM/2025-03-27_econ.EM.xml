      <title>EASI Drugs in the Streets of Colombia: Modeling Heterogeneous and Endogenous Drug Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The response of illicit drug consumers to large-scale policy changes, such as legalization, is heavily mediated by their demand behavior. Since individual drug use is driven by many unobservable factors, accounting for unobserved heterogeneity is crucial for modeling demand and designing targeted public policies. This paper introduces a finite Gaussian mixture of Exact Affine Stone Index (EASI) demand systems to estimate the joint demand for marijuana, cocaine, and basuco (cocaine residual or "crack") in Colombia, accounting for corner solutions and endogenous price variation. Our results highlight the importance of unobserved heterogeneity in identifying reliable price elasticities. The method reveals two regular consumer subpopulations: "safe" (recreational) and "addict" users, with the majority falling into the first group. For the "safe" group, whose estimates are precise and nationally representative, all three drugs exhibit unitary price elasticities, with cocaine being complementary to marijuana and basuco an inferior substitute to cocaine. Given the low production cost of marijuana in Colombia, legalization is likely to drive prices down significantly. Our counterfactual analysis suggests that a 50% price decrease would result in a \$363 USD gain in utility-equivalent expenditure per representative consumer, \$120 million USD in government tax revenue, and a \$127 million USD revenue loss for drug dealers. Legalization, therefore, has the potential to reduce the incentive for drug-related criminal activity, the current largest source of violent crime in Colombia.</description>

      <title>Treatment Effects Inference with High-Dimensional Instruments and Control Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obtaining valid treatment effect inferences remains a challenging problem when dealing with numerous instruments and non-sparse control variables. In this paper, we propose a novel ridge regularization-based instrumental variables method for estimation and inference in the presence of both high-dimensional instrumental variables and high-dimensional control variables. These methods are applicable both with and without sparsity assumptions. To address the bias caused by high-dimensional instruments, we introduce a two-step procedure incorporating a data-splitting strategy. We establish statistical properties of the estimator, including consistency and asymptotic normality. Furthermore, we develop statistical inference procedures by providing a consistent estimator for the asymptotic variance of the estimator. The finite sample performance of the proposed method is evaluated through numerical simulations. Results indicate that the new estimator consistently outperforms existing sparsity-based approaches across various settings, offering valuable insights for more complex scenarios. Finally, we provide an empirical application estimating the causal effect of schooling on earnings by addressing potential endogeneity through the use of high-dimensional instrumental variables and high-dimensional covariates.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Bayesian Local Projections: Simultaneous Inference and Extension to the Instrumental Variable Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While local projections (LPs) are widely used for impulse response analysis, existing Bayesian approaches face fundamental challenges because a set of LPs does not constitute a likelihood function. Prior studies address this issue by constructing a pseudo-likelihood, either by treating LPs as a system of seemingly unrelated regressions with a multivariate normal error structure or by applying a quasi-Bayesian approach with a sandwich estimator. However, these methods lead to posterior distributions that are not "well calibrated," preventing proper Bayesian belief updates and complicating the interpretation of posterior distributions. To resolve these issues, we propose a novel quasi-Bayesian approach for inferring LPs using the Laplace-type estimator. Specifically, we construct a quasi-likelihood based on a generalized method of moments criterion, which avoids restrictive distributional assumptions and provides well-calibrated inferences. The proposed framework enables the estimation of simultaneous credible bands and naturally extends to LPs with an instrumental variable, offering the first Bayesian treatment of this method. Furthermore, we introduce two posterior simulators capable of handling the high-dimensional parameter space of LPs with the Laplace-type estimator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application to U.S. monetary policy.</description>

      <title>Large Structural VARs with Multiple Sign and Ranking Restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large VARs are increasingly used in structural analysis as a unified framework to study the impacts of multiple structural shocks simultaneously. However, the concurrent identification of multiple shocks using sign and ranking restrictions poses significant practical challenges to the point where existing algorithms cannot be used with such large VARs. To address this, we introduce a new numerically efficient algorithm that facilitates the estimation of impulse responses and related measures in large structural VARs identified with a large number of structural restrictions on impulse responses. The methodology is illustrated using a 35-variable VAR with over 100 sign and ranking restrictions to identify 8 structural shocks.</description>

      <title>Inferring Treatment Effects in Large Panels by Uncovering Latent Similarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of unobserved confounders is one of the main challenges in identifying treatment effects. In this paper, we propose a new approach to causal inference using panel data with large large $N$ and $T$. Our approach imputes the untreated potential outcomes for treated units using the outcomes for untreated individuals with similar values of the latent confounders. In order to find units with similar latent characteristics, we utilize long pre-treatment histories of the outcomes. Our analysis is based on a nonparametric, nonlinear, and nonseparable factor model for untreated potential outcomes and treatments. The model satisfies minimal smoothness requirements. We impute both missing counterfactual outcomes and propensity scores using kernel smoothing based on the constructed measure of latent similarity between units, and demonstrate that our estimates can achieve the optimal nonparametric rate of convergence up to log terms. Using these estimates, we construct a doubly robust estimator of the period-specifc average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), and provide conditions, under which this estimator is $\sqrt{N}$-consistent, and asymptotically normal and unbiased. Our simulation study demonstrates that our method provides accurate inference for a wide range of data generating processes.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Regression Discontinuity: An Event-Study Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14203v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I propose a novel argument to identify economically interpretable intertemporal treatment effects in dynamic regression discontinuity designs (RDDs). Specifically, I develop a dynamic potential outcomes model and reformulate two assumptions from the difference-in-differences literature, no anticipation and common trends, to attain point identification of cutoff-specific impulse responses. The estimand of each target parameter can be expressed as the sum of two static RDD contrasts, thereby allowing for nonparametric estimation and inference with standard local polynomial methods. I also propose a nonparametric approach to aggregate treatment effects across calendar time and treatment paths, leveraging a limited path independence restriction to reduce the dimensionality of the parameter space. I apply this method to estimate the dynamic effects of school district expenditure authorizations on housing prices in Wisconsin.</description>

      <title>Sharp Testable Implications of Encouragement Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09808v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a potential outcome model with a continuous or discrete outcome, a discrete multi-valued treatment, and a discrete multi-valued instrument. We derive sharp, closed-form testable implications for a class of restrictions on potential treatments where each value of the instrument encourages towards at most one unique treatment choice; such restrictions serve as the key identifying assumption in several prominent recent empirical papers. Borrowing the terminology used in randomized experiments, we call such a setting an encouragement design. The testable implications are inequalities in terms of the conditional distributions of choices and the outcome given the instrument. Through a novel constructive argument, we show these inequalities are sharp in the sense that any distribution of the observed data that satisfies these inequalities is compatible with this class of restrictions on potential treatments. Based on these inequalities, we propose tests of the restrictions. In an empirical application, we show some of these restrictions are violated and pinpoint the substitution pattern that leads to the violation.</description>

      <title>Treatment Effect Heterogeneity in Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Empirical studies using Regression Discontinuity (RD) designs often explore heterogeneous treatment effects based on pretreatment covariates. However, the lack of formal statistical methods has led to the widespread use of ad hoc approaches in applications. Motivated by common empirical practice, we develop a unified, theoretically grounded framework for RD heterogeneity analysis. We show that a fully interacted local linear (in functional parameters) model effectively captures heterogeneity while still being tractable and interpretable in applications. The model structure holds without loss of generality for discrete covariates, while for continuous covariates our proposed (local functional linear-in-parameters) model can be potentially restrictive, but it nonetheless naturally matches standard empirical practice and offers a causal interpretation for RD applications. We establish principled bandwidth selection and robust bias-corrected inference methods to analyze heterogeneous treatment effects and test group differences. We provide companion software to facilitate implementation of our results. An empirical application illustrates the practical relevance of our methods.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the Distribution of a Sum of Two Random Variables: Revisiting a problem of Kolmogorov with application to Individual Treatment Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the following problem, proposed by Kolmogorov: given prescribed marginal distributions $F$ and $G$ for random variables $X,Y$ respectively, characterize the set of compatible distribution functions for the sum $Z=X+Y$. Bounds on the distribution function for $Z$ were first given by Markarov (1982) and R\"uschendorf (1982) independently. Frank et al. (1987) provided a solution to the same problem using copula theory. However, though these authors obtain the same bounds, they make different assertions concerning their sharpness. In addition, their solutions leave some open problems in the case when the given marginal distribution functions are discontinuous. These issues have led to some confusion and erroneous statements in subsequent literature, which we correct.
  Kolmogorov's problem is closely related to inferring possible distributions for individual treatment effects $Y_1 - Y_0$ given the marginal distributions of $Y_1$ and $Y_0$; the latter being identified from a randomized experiment. We use our new insights to sharpen and correct the results due to Fan and Park (2010) concerning individual treatment effects, and to fill some other logical gaps.</description>
