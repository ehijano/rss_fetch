      <title>Lattice gradient flows (de-)stabilizing topological sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of topological charge under gradient flow taking the admissibility condition into account. For the $SU(2)$ Wilson gauge theory with $\beta=2.45$ and $L^4=12^4$, we numerically show that the gradient flows with the Iwasaki and DBW2 gauge actions stabilize the topological sectors significantly, and they have qualitatively different behaviors compared with the Wilson and tree-level Symanzik flows. By considering the classical continuum limit of the flow actions, we discuss that the coefficient of dimension-$6$ operators has to be positive for stabilizing the one-instanton configuration, and the Iwasaki and DBW2 actions satisfy this criterion while the Wilson and Symanzik actions do not. Moreover, we observe that the DBW2 flow stabilizes the topological sectors at the very early stage of the flow ($\hat{t}\approx 0.5$--$1$), which suggests that the use of the DBW2 action for the gradient flow is computationally efficient to determine the gauge topology.</description>

      <title>Chiral Lagrangian for Karsten-Wilczek Minimally Doubled Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lattice chiral perturbation theory is developed for Karsten-Wilczek fermions, a variant of minimally doubled fermions. As a first step, we consider the n\"aive fermionic field on lattice without its doubler. Once the symmetries of the action, the Symanzik effective theory and the spurion structure are established for the single fermion, we extend our study to include the doubler. Symanzik effective actions are considered up to five-dimensional operators in both cases. The two fermionic tastes are realized by point-splitting the quark wavefunction in the coordinate space. Spurion analysis is used to construct the chiral lagrangians for Karsten-Wilczek fermions from the Symanzik actions. In this work, we have not included a pion that is massive in the continuum limit.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of Prony and Lanczos methods for Euclidean correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the oblique Lanczos method recently put forward in arXiv:2406.20009 for analysing Euclidean correlators in lattice field theories and show that it is analytically equivalent to the well known Prony Generalised Eigenvalue Method (PGEVM). Moreover, we discuss that the signal-to-noise problem is not aleviated by either of these two methods. Still, both methods show clear advantages when compared to the standard effective mass approach.</description>

      <title>Towards quantum simulation of lower-dimensional supersymmetric lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetric models are grounded in the intriguing concept of a hypothetical symmetry that relates bosonic and fermionic particles. This symmetry has profound implications, offering valuable extensions to the Standard Model of particle physics and fostering connections to theories of quantum gravity. However, lattice studies exploring the non-perturbative features of these models, such as spontaneous supersymmetry breaking and real-time evolution encounter significant challenges, particularly due to the infamous sign problem.
  The sign problem obstructs simulations on classical computers, especially when dealing with high-dimensional lattice systems. While one potential solution is to adopt the Hamiltonian formalism, this approach necessitates an exponential increase in classical resources with the number of lattice sites and degrees of freedom, rendering it impractical for large systems. In contrast, quantum hardware offers a promising alternative, as it requires in principle a polynomial amount of resources, making the study of these models more accessible.
  In this context, we explore the encoding of lower-dimensional supersymmetric quantum mechanics onto qubits. We also highlight our ongoing efforts to implement and check the model supersymmetry breaking on an IBM gate-based quantum simulator with and without shot noise, addressing the technical challenges we face and the potential implications of our findings for advancing our understanding of supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>On the origin of mixed inhomogeneous phase in vortical gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, lattice simulations of SU(3) Yang-Mills theory revealed that rotating hot gluon matter in thermal equilibrium possesses a novel inhomogeneous phase consisting of the deconfinement phase located in the center region, which is spatially separated from the confinement phase in the periphery. This inhomogeneous two-phase structure is also expected to be produced by vorticity in quark-gluon plasma formed in non-central relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We show that its vortical properties are determined by two types of couplings of the angular velocity to the gluon fields: a linear coupling to the mechanical angular momentum of gluons and a quadratic ``magnetovortical'' coupling to a chromomagnetic component. We demonstrate numerically that the distinctive inhomogeneous structure of the vortical (quark-)gluon plasma is determined by the latter, while the former plays only a subleading role. We argue that the anisotropy of the gluonic action in the curved co-rotating background can quantitatively explain the remarkable property that the spatial structure of this inhomogeneous phase disobeys the picture based on a straightforward implementation of the Tolman-Ehrenfest law. We also support our findings with Monte Carlo simulations of Yang-Mills plasma at the real-valued angular frequency, which take into account only the magnetic part of the action.</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of the deformed nuclear structure at small-$x$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantify the effect of high-energy JIMWLK evolution on the deformed structure or heavy (Uranium) and intermediate (Ruthenium) nuclei. The soft gluon emissions in the high-energy evolution are found to drive the initially deformed nuclei towards a more spherical shape, although the evolution is slow ,especially for the longest distance-scale quadrupole deformation. We confirm a linear relationship between the squared eccentricity $\varepsilon_n^2$ and the deformation parameter $\beta_n^2$ in central collisions across the energy range covered by the RHIC and LHC measurements. The applied JIMWLK evolution is found to leave visible signatures in the eccentricity evolution that can be observed if the same nuclei can be collided at RHIC and at the LHC, or in rapidity-dependent flow measurements. Our results demonstrate the importance of including the Bjorken-$x$ dependent nuclear geometry when comparing simulations of the Quark Gluon Plasma evolution with precise flow measurements at high collision energies.</description>

      <title>Modified Abelian and SU(2) Wilson theories on a lattice from a non-compact regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiflavor gauge theories of matter systems on a three-dimensional lattice have recently been widely investigated especially in connection with a possible symmetry enlargement at a continuous phase transition. Abelian models were studied both with compact gauge fields and in a mixed formulation in which the coupling with matter fields is in compact form while the gauge fields Lagrangian is written in terms of noncompact gauge fields, getting quite different results. Such a mixed formulation is not permissible for non-Abelian theories, for which however there exists an entirely noncompact formulation (in which exact gauge invariance is enforced by help of auxiliary fields), which for SU(2) was shown to yield in the scaling window a larger physical volume than Wilson's one. The corresponding U(1) noncompact regularization is derived in the present work. In both Abelian and SU(2) cases there is only one auxiliary field that for a large mass has a linear coupling with the other fields and it can be integrated out yielding a negative definite correction. The coupling with the auxiliary field might make the inversion of the fermion matrix easier.</description>

      <title>Investigation of pion-nucleon contributions to nucleon matrix elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate contributions of excited states to nucleon matrix elements computed in lattice QCD by employing, in addition to the standard nucleon interpolating operator, pion-nucleon ($\pi$-$N$) operators. We solve a generalized eigenvalue problem (GEVP) to obtain an optimal interpolating operator that minimizes overlap with the $\pi$-$N$ states. We derive a variant of the standard application of the GEVP method, which allows for constructing 3-point correlation functions using the optimized interpolating operator without requiring the computationally demanding combination that includes $\pi$-$N$ operators in both sink and source. We extract nucleon matrix elements using two twisted mass fermion ensembles, one ensemble generated using pion mass of 346 MeV and one ensemble tuned to reproduce the physical value of the pion mass. Especially, we determine the isoscalar and isovector scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial, and tensor matrix elements. We include results obtained using a range of kinematic setups, including momentum in the sink. Our results using this variational approach are compared with previous results obtained using the same ensembles and multi-state fits without GEVP improvement. We find that for the physical mass point ensemble, the improvement, in terms of suppression of excited states using this method, is most significant for the case of the matrix elements of the isovector axial and pseudoscalar currents.</description>

      <title>One Born$-$Oppenheimer Effective Theory to rule them all: hybrids, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, doubly heavy baryons and quarkonium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The discovery of XYZ exotic states in the hadronic sector with two heavy quarks, represents a significant challenge in particle theory. Understanding and predicting their nature remains an open problem. In this work, we demonstrate how the Born$-$Oppenheimer (BO) effective field theory (BOEFT), derived from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) on the basis of scale separation and symmetries, can address XYZ exotics of any composition. We derive the Schr\"odinger coupled equations that describe hybrids, tetraquarks, pentaquarks, doubly heavy baryons, and quarkonia at leading order, incorporating nonadiabatic terms, and present the predicted multiples. We define the static potentials in terms of the QCD static energies for all relevant cases. We provide the precise form of the nonperturbative low-energy gauge-invariant correlators required for the BOEFT: static energies, generalized Wilson loops, gluelumps, and adjoint mesons. These are to be calculated on the lattice and we calculate here their short-distance behavior. Furthermore, we outline how spin-dependent corrections and mixing terms can be incorporated using matching computations. Lastly, we discuss how static energies with the same BO quantum numbers mix at large distances leading to the phenomenon of avoided level crossing. This effect is crucial to understand the emergence of exotics with molecular characteristics, such as the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$. With BOEFT both the tetraquark and the molecular picture appear as part of the same description.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of a generalized Stephanov model for finite-density QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We solve a random matrix model for QCD at finite chemical potential, obtained by generalizing the Stephanov model by modifying the random-matrix integration measure with a one-parameter trace deformation. This allows one to check how important the integration measure is for the qualitative features of random matrix models, as well as to test the robustness and universality of the qualitative picture of the original model. While for a small trace deformation the phase diagram is identical to that of the Stephanov model, for a large deformation an exotic phase with spontaneous charge-conjugation breaking appears.</description>

      <title>From data to the analytic S-matrix: A Bootstrap fit of the pion scattering amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel strategy to fit experimental data using a UV complete amplitude ansatz satisfying the constraints of Analyticity, Crossing, and Unitarity. We focus on $\pi\pi$ scattering combining both experimental and lattice data. The fit strategy requires using S-matrix Bootstrap methods and non-convex Particle Swarm Optimization techniques. Using this procedure, we numerically construct a full-fledged scattering amplitude that fits the data and contains the known QCD spectrum that couples to $\pi \pi$ states below $1.4$ GeV. The amplitude constructed agrees below the two-particle threshold with the two-loop $\chi$PT prediction. Moreover, we correctly predict the $D_2$ phase shift, the appearance of a spin three state, and the behavior of the high-energy total cross-section. Finally, we find a genuine tetraquark resonance around 2 GeV, which we argue might be detected by looking into the decays of B mesons.</description>
