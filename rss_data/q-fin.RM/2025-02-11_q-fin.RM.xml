      <title>Dynamic reinsurance design with heterogeneous beliefs under the mean-variance framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05474v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamic reinsurance design problem under the mean-variance criterion, incorporating heterogeneous beliefs between the insurer and the reinsurer, and introducing an incentive compatibility constraint to address moral hazard. The insurer's surplus process is modeled using the classical Cram\'er-Lundberg risk model, with the option to invest in a risk-free asset. To solve the extended Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) system, we apply the partitioned domain optimization technique, transforming the infinite-dimensional optimization problem into a finite-dimensional one determined by several key parameters. The resulting optimal reinsurance contracts are more complex than the standard proportional and excess-of-loss contracts commonly studied in the mean-variance literature with homogeneous beliefs. By further assuming specific forms of belief heterogeneity, we derive the parametric solutions and obtain a clear optimal equilibrium solution. Finally, we compare our results with models where the insurer and reinsurer share identical beliefs or where the incentive compatibility constraint is relaxed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the impact of belief heterogeneity on optimal reinsurance strategies.</description>

      <title>De Finetti's problem with fixed transaction costs and regime switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a modified version of de Finetti's optimal dividend problem, incorporating fixed transaction costs and altering the surplus process by introducing two-valued drift and two-valued volatility coefficients. This modification aims to capture the transitions or adjustments in the company's financial status. We identify the optimal dividend strategy, which maximizes the expected total net dividend payments (after accounting for transaction costs) until ruin, as a two-barrier impulsive dividend strategy. Notably, the optimal strategy can be explicitly determined for almost all scenarios involving different drifts and volatility coefficients. Our primary focus is on exploring how changes in drift and volatility coefficients influence the optimal dividend strategy.</description>

      <title>Perpetual Demand Lending Pools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized perpetuals protocols have collectively reached billions of dollars of daily trading volume, yet are still not serious competitors on the basis of trading volume with centralized venues such as Binance. One of the main reasons for this is the high cost of capital for market makers and sophisticated traders in decentralized settings. Recently, numerous decentralized finance protocols have been used to improve borrowing costs for perpetual futures traders. We formalize this class of mechanisms utilized by protocols such as Jupiter, Hyperliquid, and GMX, which we term~\emph{Perpetual Demand Lending Pools} (PDLPs). We then formalize a general target weight mechanism that generalizes what GMX and Jupiter are using in practice. We explicitly describe pool arbitrage and expected payoffs for arbitrageurs and liquidity providers within these mechanisms. Using this framework, we show that under general conditions, PDLPs are easy to delta hedge, partially explaining the proliferation of live hedged PDLP strategies. Our results suggest directions to improve capital efficiency in PDLPs via dynamic parametrization.</description>
