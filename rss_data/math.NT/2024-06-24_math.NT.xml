      <title>Some new infinite families of non-$p$-rational real quadratic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix a finite collection of primes $\{ p_j \}$, not containing $2$ or $3$. Using some observations which arose from attempts to solve the SIC-POVMs problem in quantum information, we give a simple methodology for constructing an infinite family of simultaneously non-$p_j$-rational real quadratic fields, unramified above any of the $p_j$. Alternatively these may be described as infinite sequences of instances of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$, for varying $D$, where every $p_j$ is a $k$-Wall-Sun-Sun prime, or equivalently a generalised Fibonacci-Wieferich prime.
  One feature of these techniques is that they may be used to yield fields $K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{D})$ for which a $p$-power cyclic component of the torsion group of the Galois groups of the maximal abelian pro-$p$-extension of $K$ unramified outside primes above $p$, is of size $p^a$ for $a\geq1$ arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>On the minimal period of integer tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If a finite set $A$ tiles the integers by translations, it also admits a tiling whose period $M$ has the same prime factors as $|A|$. We prove that the minimal period of such a tiling is bounded by $\exp(c(\log D)^2/\log\log D)$, where $D$ is the diameter of $A$. In the converse direction, given $\epsilon&gt;0$, we construct tilings whose minimal period has the same prime factors as $|A|$ and is bounded from below by $D^{3/2-\epsilon}$. We also discuss the relationship between minimal tiling period estimates and the Coven-Meyerowitz conjecture.</description>

      <title>On Galois Extensions of Local Fields with a Single Wild Ramification Jump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given unramified extension $K/K_1$ of finite extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_p$, we effectively determine the number of finite Galois extensions $L/K_1$ with maximal unramified subextension $K/K_1$ and a single wild ramification jump at $3$. In fact, we determine explicit formulas in the cases when $K_1/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is totally ramified and when it is unramified. This builds upon the tamely ramified case, which is a classical consequence of Serre's Mass Formula, exhibiting a more restrictive behavior than in the tamely ramified case because the degrees of such extensions are bounded. As a consequence of the calculation, it is also found that the count depends only on the extension $k/k_1$ of residue fields.</description>

      <title>On $p$-adic Transference Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dual lattice is an important concept of Euclidean lattices. In 2024, Deng gave the definition to the concept of the dual lattice of a $p$-adic lattice from the duality theory of locally compact abelian groups. He also proved some important properties of the dual lattice of $p$-adic lattices, which can be viewed as $p$-adic analogues of the famous Minkowski's first, second theorems and transference theorems for Euclidean lattices. However, he only proved the lower bound of the transference theorems for $p$-adic lattices. The upper bound is left as an open question. In this paper, we prove the upper bound of the transference theorems for $p$-adic lattices. We then prove that the dual basis of an orthogonal basis is also an orthogonal basis with respect to the maximum norm.</description>

      <title>Density theorems for Riemann's auxiliary function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a density theorem for the auxiliar function $\mathop{\mathcal R}(s)$ found by Siegel in Riemann papers. Let $\alpha$ be a real number with $\frac12&lt; \alpha\le 1$, and let $N(\alpha,T)$ be the number of zeros $\rho=\beta+i\gamma$ of $\mathop{\mathcal R}(s)$ with $1\ge \beta\ge\alpha$ and $0&lt;\gamma\le T$. Then we prove \[N(\alpha,T)\ll T^{\frac32-\alpha}(\log T)^3.\]
  Therefore, most of the zeros of $\mathop{\mathcal R}(s)$ are near the critical line or to the left of that line. The imaginary line for $\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma(s/2)\mathop{\mathcal R}(s)$ passing through a zero of $\mathop{\mathcal R}(s)$ near the critical line frequently will cut the critical line, producing two zeros of $\zeta(s)$ in the critical line.</description>

      <title>Permutation Polynomials of Finite Fields of Even Characteristic From Character Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate permutation polynomials over a finite field $\mathbb F_{q^n}$ with $q=2^m$, focusing on those in the form $\mathrm{Tr}(Ax^{q+1})+L(x)$, where $A\in\mathbb F_{q^n}^*$ and $L$ is a $2$-linear polynomial over $\mathbb F_{q^n}$. By calculating certain character sums, we characterize these permutation polynomials and provide additional constructions.</description>

      <title>An Elementary Approach to the Group Law on Elliptic Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the group structure on elliptic curves and give a simple and elementary proof of the associativity of the addition. We do this by providing an explicit formula for the sum of three points, only using the explicit definition of the group structure. In the process we find a nice geometric interpretation of the sum of three points on the elliptic curve.</description>

      <title>Enumerating hyperelliptic curves over finite fields in quasilinear time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15255v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an algorithm that, for every fixed genus $g$, will enumerate all hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ over a finite field $k$ of odd characteristic in quasilinear time; that is, the time required for the algorithm is $\widetilde{O}(q^{2g-1})$, where $q=\#k$. Such an algorithm already exists in the case $g=2$, thanks to work of Mestre and Cardona and Quer, and in the case $g=3$, thanks to work of Lercier and Ritzenthaler. Experimentally, it appears that our new algorithm is about two orders of magnitude faster in practice than ones based on their work.</description>

      <title>On the cohomology of p-adic analytic spaces, II: The $C_{\rm st}$-conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.12785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long ago, Fontaine formulated conjectures (now theorems) relating \'etale and de Rham cohomologies of algebraic varieties over $p$-adic fields. In an earlier work we have shown that pro-\'etale and de Rham cohomologies of analytic varieties in the two extreme cases: proper and Stein, are also related. In the proper case, the comparison theorems are similar to those for algebraic varieties, but for Stein varieties they are quite different.
  In this paper, we state analogs of Fontaine's conjectures for general smooth dagger varieties, that interpolate between these two extreme cases, and we prove them for many ``small'' varieties (cases we deal with include products of overconvergent affinoids and proper varieties, analytifications of algebraic varieties, or "almost proper" dagger varieties). The proofs use a ``geometrization'' of all involved cohomologies in terms of quasi-Banach-Colmez spaces (qBC's for short, quasi- because we relax the finiteness conditions). The heart of the proof relies on delicate properties of BC's and qBC's. These properties should be of independent interest and we have devoted a large part of the paper to them.</description>

      <title>G-torsors and universal torsors over nonsplit del Pezzo surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.08137v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let S be a smooth del Pezzo surface that is defined over a field K and splits over a Galois extension L. Let G be either the split reductive group given by the root system of $S_L$ in Pic $S_L$, or a form of it containing the N\'eron-Severi torus. Let $\mathcal{G}$ be the G-torsor over $S_L$ obtained by extension of structure group from a universal torsor $\mathcal{T}$ over $S_L$. We prove that $\mathcal{G}$ does not descend to S unless $\mathcal{T}$ does. This is in contrast to a result of Friedman and Morgan that such $\mathcal{G}$ always descend to singular del Pezzo surfaces over $\mathbb{C}$ from their desingularizations.</description>
