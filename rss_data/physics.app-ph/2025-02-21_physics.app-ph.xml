      <title>Characterization of ion track etched conical nanopores in thermal and PECVD SiO$_{2}$ using small angle X-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conical nanopores in amorphous SiO$_{2}$ thin films fabricated using the ion track etching technique show promising potential for filtration, sensing and nanofluidic applications. The characterization of the pore morphology and size distribution, along with its dependence on the material properties and fabrication parameters, is crucial to designing nanopore systems for specific applications. Here, we present a comprehensive study of track-etched nanopores in thermal and plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposited (PECVD) SiO$_{2}$ using synchrotron-based small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). We present a new approach for analyzing the complex highly anisotropic 2-dimensional SAXS patterns of the pores by reducing the analysis to two orthogonal 1-dimensional slices of the data. The simultaneous fit of the data enables an accurate determination of the pore geometry and size distribution. The analysis reveals substantial differences between the nanopores in thermal and PECVD SiO$_{2}$. The track-to-bulk etching rate ratio is significantly different for the two materials, producing nanopores with cone angles that differ by almost a factor of 2. Furthermore, thermal SiO$_2$ exhibits an exceptionally narrow size distribution of only ~2-4%, while PECVD SiO$_2$ shows a higher variation ranging from ~8-18%. The impact of ion energy between 89 MeV and 1.6 GeV on the size of the nanopores was also investigated for pores in PECVD SiO$_{2}$ and shows only negligible influence. These findings provide crucial insights for the controlled fabrication of conical nanopores in different materials, which is essential for optimizing membrane performance in applications that require precise pore geometry.</description>

      <title>Experimental demonstrations of Josephson threshold detectors for broadband microwave photons detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-biased Josephson junctions (CBJJs) have been demonstrated as sensitive Josephson threshold detectors (JTDs) in the infrared range. In this letter, we show this kind of detector could also be used to detect broadband microwave photons. Based on the numerical simulations of the noise-driving phase dynamics of an underdamped Josephson junction, driven by the low-frequency triangular wave current, we argue that the microwave photons flowing across the JJ can be detected by probing the voltage switched signals of the JJ. Experimentally, we designed and fabricated the relevant Al/AlOx/Al Josephson device and measured its response to microwave photons at 50~mK temperature. Experimental results indicate that the weak microwave signals could be threatened as the additional noises modify the phase dynamics of the CBJJ, which could thus be detected by the generated JTD. The detection sensitivity is characterized by using the Kumar-Caroll index to differentiate the junction switched duration distributions, with and without microwave signal input. Although the demonstrated detection sensitivity is just $-92$~dBm (corresponding to approximately 30~photon/ns) for the microwave photons at $\sim 5$GHz (which is manifestly deviated from the plasma frequency of the fabricated JJ), we argued, based on the relevant numerical simulations, that the generated JTD could be used to achieve the sensitive detection of the microwave photons at the plasma frequency of the JJ.</description>

      <title>Wave-propagation Based Analysis of the Magnetostatic Waves in Ferrite Films Excited by Metallic Transducers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is conventional wisdom that the spectra of the impedances of magnetostatic waves (MSWs) determine the transmissions of MSW devices. In this work, we show that the characteristics of propagating MSWs have critical impacts on the characteristics of transmissions. A wave-propagation based analysis considering the inhomogeneous distributions of magnetic fields is presented for investigating the propagations of MSWs. Based on the analysis, it is demonstrated that the metallic nature of transducers causes the high insertion losses in high-frequency bands, while the dips and severe in-band ripples in low-frequency bands are resulted from the complicated interference between the multiple width modes. Simulations in HFSS verify the analysis with good agreements. Our work advances the understanding of MSWs propagating in ferrite films with metallic structures and paves the way to designing MSW devices aimed at implantation in microwave systems.</description>

      <title>Machine learning assisted tracking of magnetic objects using quantum diamond magnetometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote magnetic sensing can be used to monitor the position of objects in real-time, enabling ground transport monitoring, underground infrastructure mapping and hazardous detection. However, magnetic signals are typically weak and complex, requiring sophisticated physical models to analyze them and a detailed knowledge of the system under study, factors that are frequently unavailable. In this work, we provide a solution to these limitations by demonstrating a Machine Learning (ML) method that can be trained exclusively on experimental data, without the need of any physical model, to predict the position of a magnetic target in real-time. The target can be any object with a magnetic signal above the floor noise, and in this case we use a quantum diamond magnetometer to track variations of few hundreds of nanoteslas produced by an elevator moving along a single axis. The one-dimensional movement is a simple yet challenging scenario, resembling realistic environments such as high buildings, tunnels or train circuits, and is the first step towards building broader applications. Our ML algorithm can be trained in approximately 40 min, achieving over 80% accuracy in predicting the target's position at a rate of 10 Hz, for a positional error tolerance of 30 cm, which is a precise distance compared to the 4-meter spacing between parking levels. Our results open up the possibility to apply this ML method more generally for real-time monitoring of magnetic objects, which will broaden the scope of magnetic detection applications.</description>

      <title>Advancing Measurement Capabilities in Lithium-Ion Batteries: Exploring the Potential of Fiber Optic Sensors for Thermal Monitoring of Battery Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates the potential of fiber optic sensors for measuring thermal effects in lithium-ion batteries, using a fiber optic measurement method of Optical Frequency Domain Reflectometry (OFDR). The innovative application of fiber sensors allows for spatially resolved temperature measurement, particularly emphasizing the importance of monitoring not just the exterior but also the internal conditions within battery cells. Utilizing inert glass fibers as sensors, which exhibit minimal sensitivity to electric fields, opens up new pathways for their implementation in a wide range of applications, such as battery monitoring. The sensors used in this work provide real-time information along the entire length of the fiber, unlike commonly used Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensors. It is shown that using the herein presented novel sensors in a temperature range of 0 to 80 degree celsius reveals a linear thermal dependency with high sensitivity and a local resolution of a few centimeters. Furthermore, this study presents preliminary findings on the potential application of fiber optic sensors in lithium-ion battery (LIB) cells, demonstrating that the steps required for battery integration do not impose any restrictive effects on thermal measurements.</description>

      <title>Multiplexed dual-comb spectroscopy of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multiplexed dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS) approach for high-resolution, broadband spectral measurements is presented, demonstrating its effectiveness in studying complex atomic systems. By implementing a photodetector array, we enhance DCS capabilities, addressing the fundamental trade-off between signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral coverage. To resolve ambiguities in frequency conversion, we introduced a relative offset in the radio frequency (RF) comb teeth, ensuring accurate spectral reconstruction. As a proof of concept, the absorption spectrum of samarium (Sm) vapor is investigated over a 52nm range, and several previously unreported absorption lines are detected. This is a step toward "Spectroscopy 2.0", enabling massively parallel spectroscopic measurements (including those at &gt;100 T magnetic fields) crucial for atomic physics and fundamental interactions research.</description>

      <title>Ultrathin Ga$_2$O$_3$ Tunneling Contact for 2D Transition-metal Dichalcogenides Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) based transistors has been constrained by high contact resistance and inadequate current delivery, primarily stemming from metal-induced gap states and Fermi level pinning. Research into addressing these challenges is essential for the advancing 2D transistors from laboratory experiments to industrial-grade production. In this work, we present amorphous Ga$_2$O$_3$ as a novel tunneling contact layer for multilayer WS2-based field-effect transistors (FETs) to enhance electrical performance. The addition of this innovative tunneling layer avoid Schottky barrier forming while finally change into a tunneling barrier with the barrier height to just 3.7 meV, near-ideal ohmic contacts. This approach effectively reduces contact resistance to only 2.38 k$\Omega\,\mu$m and specific contact resistivity as low as $3 \times 10^{-5}$ $\Omega$cm$^2$. A record-high electron mobility of 296 cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$ and ON-OFF ratio over 106 are realized for WS$_2$ transistor at room temperature. Compared to other tunneling materials, ultrathin Ga$_2$O$_3$ layer offers scalability, cost-efficient production and broad substrate compatibility, making it well-suited for seamless integration with industrial wafer-scale electronics. A robust device performance remains highly consistent in a large-scale transistor array fabricated on $1.5\times 1.5$ cm$^2$ chips, with the average mobility closing to 200 cm$^2$ V$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$. These findings establish a new benchmark for contact performance in 2D transistors and prove the potential of tunneling contact engineering in advancing high-performance, scalable 29 pelectronics with promising applications in quantum computing and communication.</description>

      <title>Perspective of high-speed Mach-Zehnder modulators based on nonlinear optics and complex band structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical modulators are essential building blocks for high-capacity optical communication and massively parallel computing. Among all types of optical modulators, travelling-wave Mach-Zehnder modulators (TW-MZMs) featuring high speed and efficiency are widely used, and have been developed on a variety of integrated material platforms. Existing methods to design and simulate TW-MZMs so far strongly rely on the peculiar material properties, and thus inevitably involve complicated electrical-circuit models. As a result, these methods diverge significantly. In addition, they become increasingly inefficient and inaccurate for TW-MZMs with extending length and levitating modulation speed, posing formidable challenges for millimeter-wave and terahertz operation. Here, we present an innovative perspective to understand and analyze high-speed TW-MZMs. Our perspective leverages nonlinear optics and complex band structures of RF photonic crystals, and is thus entirely electromagnetic-wave-based. Under this perspective, we showcase the design, optoelectronic simulation and experimental validation of high-speed TW-MZMs based on Si and LiNbO$_3$, and further demonstrate unambiguous advantages in simplicity, accuracy and efficiency over conventional methods. Our approach can essentially be applied to nearly any integrated material platform, including those based on semiconductors and electro-absorption materials. With high-frequency electrode designs and optoelectronic co-simulation, our approach facilitates the synergy and convergence of electronics and photonics, and offers a viable route to constructing future high-speed millimeter-wave and terahertz photonics and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Low-phase-noise surface-acoustic-wave oscillator using an edge mode of a phononic band gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-phase-noise microwave-frequency integrated oscillators provide compact solutions for various applications in signal processing, communications, and sensing. Surface acoustic waves (SAW), featuring orders-of-magnitude shorter wavelength than electromagnetic waves at the same frequency, enable integrated microwave-frequency systems with much smaller footprint on chip. SAW devices also allow higher quality (Q) factors than electronic components at room temperature. Here, we demonstrate a low-phase-noise gigahertz-frequency SAW oscillator on 128{\deg}Y-cut lithium niobate, where the SAW resonator occupies a footprint of 0.05 mm$^2$. Leveraging phononic crystal bandgap-edge modes to balance between Q factors and insertion losses, our 1-GHz SAW oscillator features a low phase noise of -132.5 dBc/Hz at a 10 kHz offset frequency and an overlapping Hadamard deviation of $6.5\times10^{-10}$ at an analysis time of 64 ms. The SAW resonator-based oscillator holds high potential in developing low-noise sensors and acousto-optic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>A Quantitative Study of Energy Localization Characteristics in Defect-embedded Phononic Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phononic crystals (PnCs) are periodic engineered media that can customize the spatio-temporal characteristics of mechanical energy propagation. PnCs that additionally leverage precisely embedded defects can achieve robust energy localization with desirable spatio-temporal characteristics, opening avenues for critical engineering applications, e.g., energy harvesting, waveguiding, and fluid flow control. Numerous studies have qualitatively explored the localized dynamics via simulations and experiments, investigating the defect resonance frequency as the primary feature. However, the frequency represents only a subset of the relevant characteristics and a systematic approach to quantify the full scope of the defect dynamics remains elusive. This article establishes the frequency, mode shape, and localized velocity (or displacement) amplitude envelope as three significant factors governing the defect resonance dynamics, and quantitatively examines these characteristics using a modified version of the perturbed tridiagonal n-Toeplitz method. The proposed method accurately estimates the resonance characteristics in 1D and 2D defect-embedded PnC lattices with single and multiple defects and elucidates the effects of damping. The method is used to highlight how the key characteristics of defect modes depend on system parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of defect modes through two defect-based PnCs that can accommodate -- (i) a virtual ground, and (ii) achieve customized acoustic interaction and absorption, and use the proposed method to analyze these scenarios. The proposed strategy can be readily extended to more elaborate PnCs and augments the design space for defect-based PnCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many claims of computational advantages have been made for quantum computing over classical, but they have not been demonstrated for practical problems. Here, we present algorithms for solving time-dependent PDEs, with particular reference to fluid equations. We build on an idea based on linear combination of unitaries to simulate non-unitary, non-Hermitian quantum systems, and generate hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that efficiently perform iterative matrix-vector multiplication and matrix inversion operations. These algorithms are end-to-end, with relatively low-depth quantum circuits that demonstrate quantum advantage, with the best-case asymptotic complexities, which we show are near-optimal. We demonstrate the performance of the algorithms by conducting: (a) fully gate level, state-vector simulations using an in-house, high performance, quantum simulator called QFlowS; (b) experiments on a real quantum device; and (c) noisy simulations using Qiskit Aer. We also provide device specifications such as error-rates (noise) and state sampling (measurement) to accurately perform convergent flow simulations on noisy devices. The results offer evidence that the proposed algorithm is amenable for use on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Embracing Nonlinearity and Geometry: A dimensional analysis guided design of shock absorbing materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protective applications require energy-absorbing materials that are soft and compressible enough to absorb kinetic energy from impacts, yet stiff enough to bear crushing loads. Achieving this balance requires careful consideration of both mechanical properties of the material and geometry of the shock-absorbing pads. Conventional shock-absorbing pads are typically made from very thick foams that exhibit a plateau of constant stress in their stress-strain response, while foams with a non-linearly stiffening stress-strain response are often considered ineffective. Contrary to this belief, we demonstrate that foams with a nonlinear stress-strain response can be effective for achieving protective pads that are both thin and lightweight, particularly for pad geometries requiring a large cross-sectional area. We introduce a new framework for the thickness or volume-constrained design of compact and lightweight protective foams while ensuring the desired structural integrity and mechanical performance. Our streamlined dimensional analysis provides geometric constraints on the dimensionless thickness and cross-sectional area of a protective foam with a given stress-strain response to limit the acceleration and compressive strain within desired critical limits. We also identify optimal mechanical properties that will result in the most compact and lightest protective foam pad for absorbing the given kinetic energy of impact. Guided by this design framework, we achieve optimal protective properties in hierarchically architected vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) foams, enabling next generation protective applications in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Normal and lateral Casimir-Lifshitz forces between a nanoparticle and a graphene grating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the normal and lateral components of the Casimir-Lifshitz (CL) force between a nanoparticle and 1D graphene grating deposited on a fused silica slab. For this purpose, the scattering matrix approach together with the Fourier modal method augmented with local basis functions are used. We find that, by covering a fused silica slab by a graphene grating, the spectrum of the normal CL force at small frequencies is increased by about 100% for a grating filling fraction of 0.5, and even more when the slab is completely covered. The typically employed additive approximation (the weighted average of the force with and without the graphene coating) cannot provide any information on the lateral CL force, and, as we show, cannot provide accurate estimation for the normal CL force. When the nanoparticle is laterally shifted ($x_A$), the normal CL force is modulated and remains attractive. On the contrary, the lateral CL force changes sign twice in each period, showing a series of alternating stable and unstable lateral equilibrium positions, occurring in the graphene strips and of the grating slits regions, respectively. Finally, we show that the lateral shift effect is sensitive to the geometric factor $d/D$ ($d$ is the separation distance, and $D$ is the grating period). We identify two clear regions: a region ($d/D&lt;1.0$) where the lateral shift significantly affects the CL energy, and a region ($d/D \geq 1.0$) where this effect is negligible, with a crossover at $d\approx D$. Our predictions can have relevant implications to experiments and applications of the CL normal and lateral forces acting on nanoparticles interacting with structured objects at the nano/micro scale, and are also directly valid for atoms close to these nanostructures.</description>

      <title>Centimetre-Scale Micro-Transfer Printing to enable Heterogeneous Integration of Thin Film Lithium Niobate with Silicon Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15157</link>

Abstract: The integrated photonics CMOS-compatible silicon nitride (SiN) platform is praised for its low propagation loss, but is limited by its lack of active functionalities such as a strong Pockels coefficient and intrinsic \c{hi}(2) nonlinearity. In this paper, we demonstrate the integration of centimetre-long thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) devices on a SiN platform using the micro-transfer printing (uTP) method. At a wavelength of 1550 nm, propagation losses of approximately 0.9 dB/cm and transition losses of 1.8 dB per facet were measured. Furthermore, the TFLN was integrated into an imbalanced push-pull Mach-Zehnder modulator, achieving a V{\pi} of 3.2 V. The electro-optics nature of the observed modulation is confirmed by measuring the device up to 35 GHz, showing that the printing does not affect the high-speed LN properties.</description>

      <title>Temperature-insensitive fused-tapered fiber couplers based on negative thermal expansion material coating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new method based on negative thermal expansion material coating is proposed to realize temperature insensitive fiber coupler. By coating a layer of modified epoxy resin with a negative thermal expansion coefficient onto the coupling region of fiber coupler, a stable splitting ratio over a wide temperature range can be achieved. A finite-element model for simulating the influence of thermal fluctuations on fused-tapered fiber coupler's splitting ratio is built and verified via experimental test. Furthermore, using this model, the influence of the thickness, length, and thermal expansion coefficient of the coating material on the splitting ratio is studied. Through adjusting the parameters of the coating, the temperature stability of the fiber coupler splitting ratio can be improved by more than one order of magnitude and improved to 1.2*10-5/K. The temperature-insensitive fused-tapered fiber coupler can find important application in optical precision measurement under extreme temperature environment, such as inter-satellite laser interferometry and high-precision fiber gyroscopes.</description>

      <title>Microscopic mechanism of electric field-induced superconductivity suppression in metallic thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supercurrent field-effect transistors made from thin metallic films are a promising option for next-generation high-performance computation platforms. Despite extensive research, there is still no complete quantitative microscopic explanation for how an external DC electric field suppresses superconductivity in thin films. This study aims to provide a quantitative description of superconductivity as a function of film thickness based on Eliashberg's theory. The calculation considers the electrostatics of the electric field, its realistic penetration depth in the film, and its effect on the Cooper pair, which is described as a standard s-wave bound state according to BCS theory. The estimation suggests that an external electric field of approximately $10^8$ V/m is required to suppress superconductivity in 10-30-nm-thick films, which aligns with experimental observations. Ultimately, the study offers "materials by design" guidelines for suppressing supercurrent when an external electric field is applied to the film surface. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be easily extended to investigate the same effects for ultrathin films.</description>
