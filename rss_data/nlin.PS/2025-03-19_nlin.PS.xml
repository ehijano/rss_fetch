      <title>Hierarchical Clustering in Mean-Field Coupled Stuart-Landau Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Clustered solutions in oscillator networks provide an important insight into how a system might diversify from a synchronous solution into spatiotemporal complex solutions. They can therefore form a link between fully synchronized and incoherent states. Despite their fundamental role in coupled oscillator dynamics, our understanding of how these clusters form and differentiate is still quite limited. Here, we study an ensemble of globally coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators and focus on the question of how 3-cluster solutions emerge from 2-cluster solutions and how the different 3-cluster solutions are organized in parameter space. We show that the arrangement of the clusters is dictated by a co-dimension 2 point, which we coin Type-II cluster singularity. Furthermore, our study points to a hierarchical structure of higher cluster solutions.</description>

      <title>Rayleigh-Taylor, Kelvin-Helmholtz and immiscible to miscible quenching instabilities in binary Bose-Einstein condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate three kinds of instabilities in binary immiscible homogeneous Bose-Einstein condensate, considering rubidium isotopes $^{85}$Rb and $^{87}$Rb confined in two-dimensional circular box. Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) and Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) instability types are studied under strong perturbations. Without external perturbation, instabilities are also probed by immiscible to miscible quenching transition (IMQT), under two different initial configurations. Our numerical simulations show that all such instability dynamics are dominated by large vortex productions and sound-wave (phonon) propagations. For long-term propagation, vortex dynamics become dominant over sound waves in the KH instability, while sound wave excitations predominate in the other cases. For all the dynamical simulations, the emergence of possible scaling laws are investigated for the compressible and incompressible parts of the kinetic energy spectra, in terms of the wave number $k$. The corresponding results are compared with the classical Kolmogorov scalings, $k^{-5/3}$ and $k^{-3}$, for turbulence, which are observed in the kinetic energy spectra at some specific time intervals. Deviating from the classical scaling, a kind of ``Bottleneck effect" is noticed in the IMQT spectra.</description>

      <title>Localized Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localized patterns are coherent structures embedded in a quiescent state and occur in both discrete and continuous media across a wide range of applications. While it is well-understood how domain covering patterns (for example stripes and hexagons) emerge from a pattern-forming/Turing instability, analyzing the emergence of their localized counterparts remains a significant challenge. There has been considerable progress in studying localized patterns over the past few decades, often by employing innovative mathematical tools and techniques. In particular, the study of localized pattern formation has benefited greatly from numerical techniques; the continuing advancement in computational power has helped to both identify new types patterns and further our understanding of their behavior. We review recent advances regarding the complex behavior of localized patterns and the mathematical tools that have been developed to understand them, covering various topics from spatial dynamics, exponential asymptotics, and numerical methods. We observe that the mathematical understanding of localized patterns decreases as the spatial dimension increases, thus providing significant open problems that will form the basis for future investigations.</description>

      <title>The diffusive dynamics and electrochemical regulation of weak polyelectrolytes across liquid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to study the spatio-temporal evolution of liquid-liquid phase separation of weak polyelectrolytes in ionic solutions. Unlike strong polyelectrolytes, which carry a fixed charge, the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes is modulated by the electrochemical environment through protonation and deprotonation processes. Leveraging numerical simulations and analysis, our work reveals how solution acidity (pH) influences the formation, interactions, and structural properties of phase-separated coacervates. We find that pH gradients can be maintained across coacervate interfaces resulting in a clear distinction in the electro-chemical properties within and outside the coacervate. By regulating the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes, pH gradients interact and modulate the electric double layer forming at coacervate interfaces eventually determining how they interact. Further linear and nonlinear analyses of stationary localised solutions reveal a rich spectrum of behaviours that significantly distinguish weak from strong polyelectrolytes. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of charge regulation on phase-separating solutions of charge-bearing molecules and the possibility of harnessing charge-regulated mechanisms to control coacervates and shape their stability and spatial organisation.</description>
