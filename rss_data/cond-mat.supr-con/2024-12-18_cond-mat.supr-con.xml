      <title>Field-Resilient Supercurrent Diode in a Multiferroic Josephson Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The research on supercurrent diodes has surged rapidly due to their potential applications in electronic circuits at cryogenic temperatures. To unlock this functionality, it is essential to find supercurrent diodes that can work consistently at zero magnetic field and under ubiquitous stray fields generated in electronic circuits. However, a supercurrent diode with robust field tolerance is currently lacking. Here, we demonstrate a field-resilient supercurrent diode by incorporating a multiferroic material into a Josephson junction. We first observed a pronounced supercurrent diode effect at zero magnetic field. More importantly, the supercurrent rectification persists over a wide and bipolar magnetic field range beyond industrial standards for field tolerance. By theoretically modeling a multiferroic Josephson junction, we unveil that the interplay between spin-orbit coupling and multiferroicity underlies the unusual field resilience of the observed diode effect. This work introduces multiferroic Josephson junctions as a new field-resilient superconducting device for cryogenic electronics.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Cable Modelling into Electro-Magnetic Transient Simulation Tool</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The European project SCARLET aims to study and realize a demonstrator of a MVDC (Medium Voltage Direct Current) high-power superconducting cable. This device might be employed to connect offshore wind farms with land, expecting to significantly simplify the offshore platform by eliminating the need for its conversion function. For this purpose, windmill conversion chain must be modified to directly produce the MVDC export voltage. In this scenario, this paper presents the case of a 1GW offshore windmill superconducting link and outlines the design consideration for a 1 GW onshore converter. For this cable, a protection strategy that combines DC circuit breakers with a Resistive Superconducting Fault Current Limiter is proposed. Moreover, this works demonstrates how a superconducting cable can be modelled as an electrical circuit to be integrated into a network simulation tool, enabling the investigation of various fault scenarios and protection strategies. Finally, a specific result is discussed to exemplify how the proposed approach can benefit the design of both the electrical network and the superconducting cable itself.</description>

      <title>Detecting the topological winding of superconducting nodes via Local Density of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many systems are topologically trivial in the bulk, but still have non-trivial wavefunctions locally in the Brillouin zone. For example, in a small-gap Dirac material the Berry curvature is strongly peaked, but cancels over the full Brillouin zone, while in semimetals and in nodal superconductors there may be a lower-dimensional winding topology associated to the nodes. Experimentally, it is difficult to directly observe such topology. We consider general bulk Hamiltonians with nodes and chiral symmetry, extending to them the method developed in Dutreix et al. [Nature, 574(7777):219-222 (2019)], which in particular detected the winding around Dirac cones in graphene using charge modulations around an impurity. We apply our method to nodal superconductors in 2d, in presence of a (non)magnetic impurity, measured by standard or spin-polarized STM tip. We derive general conditions on the impurity scattering and on the STM tip, expressed in terms of their preference among the two chiralities, for when the measurement near the impurity captures the winding difference between any chosen pair of (Bogoliubon) Dirac cones. We emphasize the robustness of observing vortices in momentum space, in contrast to dislocations in real space, in STM data. Testing the conditions on the topological nodal superconductor proposed for monolayer NbSe2 under an in-plane magnetic field, we find that spin-polarized STM on a magnetic impurity can detect the winding of each of the 12 nodes. We conclude that a judicious choice of impurity can be a powerful tool to determine topological quantities in 2d superconducting systems as well as any nodal chiral system.</description>

      <title>Universal Scaling Behavior of Transport Properties in Non-Magnetic RuO$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a prototypical altermagnet, RuO$_{2}$ has been subject to many controversial reports regarding its magnetic ground state and the existence of crystal Hall effects. We obtained high-quality RuO$_{2}$ single crystal with a residual resistivity ratio (RRR = 152), and carefully measured its magnetization, longitudinal resistivity ($\rho_{xx}$) and Hall resistivity ($\rho_{yx}$) up to 35 T magnetic field. We also calculated its electronic band, Fermi surface, and conducted numerical simulations for its transport properties. It was found that no magnetic transition occurs below 400 K, and that all the transport properties are consistent with the numerical simulations results, indicating that the magnetotransport properties originate from the intrinsic electronic structures and are dominated by the Lorentz force. Particularly, no crystal Hall effects were observed in our RuO$_{2}$ samples and both magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity follow scaling behavior. These results demonstrate that RuO$_{2}$ is a typical semimetal, rather than an altermagnet.</description>

      <title>Scaling Behavior of Magnetoresistance and Hall Resistivity in Altermagnet CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of altermagnet (AM) marks a significant advancement in magnetic materials, combining characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. In this Letter, we focus on CrSb, which has been verified to be an AM and to exhibit substantial spin splitting near the Fermi level. After successfully growing high-quality CrSb single crystals, we performed comprehensive magnetization, magnetoresistance (MR), and Hall resistivity measurements, along with the electronic structure, and Fermi surface (FS) calculations, as well as the magneto-transport property numerical simulations. An antiferromagnetic transition occurring at $T_{N}$ = 712 K was reconfirmed. It was found that both experimental MR and Hall resistivity are consistent with the numerical simulation results, and exhibit obvious scaling behavior. The nonlinear Hall resistivity is due to its multi-band structure, rather than an anomalous Hall effect (AHE). Especially, the scaling behavior in Hall resistivity is first observed within an AM material. These findings demonstrate that the magneto-transport properties in CrSb originate from the intrinsic electronic structure and are dominated by the Lorentz force.</description>

      <title>Coherent information as a mixed-state topological order parameter of fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction protects quantum information against decoherence provided the noise strength remains below a critical threshold. This threshold marks the critical point for the decoding phase transition. Here we connect this transition in the toric code to a topological phase transition in disordered Majorana fermions at high temperatures. A quantum memory in the error correctable phase is captured by the presence of a Majorana zero mode, trapped in vortex defects associated with twisted boundary conditions. These results are established by expressing the coherent information, which measures the amount of recoverable quantum information in a given noisy code, in terms of a mixed-state topological order parameter of fermions. Our work hints at a broader connection of the robustness of quantum information in stabilizer codes and mixed-state topological phase transitions in symmetry protected fermion matter.</description>

Abstract: The magnetic properties of EuAlSi, a compound comprising a honeycomb lattice of Al and Si atoms and a triangular lattice of Eu atoms, are presented. Moreover, we have prepared the Eu1-xSrxAlSi solid solution, to study the evolution of the collective quantum properties from the ferromagnetic EuAlSi towards the superconducting SrAlSi. A possible quantum critical point is suggested to exist in the vicinity of to x of 0.96, at which the suppression of ferromagnetic order is concomitant with the emergence of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Efficiently measuring $d$-wave pairing and beyond in quantum gas microscopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity is among the most important problems in physics, for which quantum simulation can provide new insights. However, it remains challenging to characterize superconductivity in existing cold-atom quantum simulation platforms. Here, we introduce a protocol for measuring a broad class of observables in fermionic quantum gas microscopes, including long-range superconducting pairing correlations (after a repulsive-to-attractive mapping). The protocol only requires global controls followed by site-resolved particle number measurements -- capabilities that have been already demonstrated in multiple experiments -- and is designed by analyzing the Hilbert-space structure of dimers of two sites. The protocol is sample efficient and we further optimize our pulses for robustness to experimental imperfections such as lattice inhomogeneity. Our work introduces a general tool for manipulating quantum states on optical lattices, enhancing their ability to tackle problems such as that of high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Valley polarization, magnetization, and superconductivity in bilayer graphene near the van Hove singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of Mott insulators and superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene has ignited intensive research into strong correlation effects in other stacking geometries. Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene (BBG), when subjected to a perpendicular electric field, exhibits phase transitions to a variety of broken-symmetry states. Notably, superconductivity emerges when BBG is in proximity to a heavy transition-metal dichalcogenide, highlighting the role of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here we investigate the origin of Ising SOC and its role in the competition between superconductivity and spin- and valley-polarized states in BBG. Starting from strong electron-electron interactions on the BBG lattice, we derive a low-energy effective model near the valleys that incorporates both density-density and spin-spin interactions. Using self-consistent mean-field theory, we map out the BBG phase diagram. Our findings reveal that near the van Hove filling, a mixed spin- and valley-polarized phase dominates over superconductivity. Away from the van Hove filling, a spin-polarized, spin-triplet superconducting state arises, characterized by an in-plane orientation of the magnetic moment and an out-of-plane orientation of the d-vector. Contrary to previous proposals, we find that Ising SOC favours spin-valley order while suppressing superconductivity near the van Hove singularity. We discuss other potential proximity effects and suggest directions for future studies.</description>

Abstract: Research on nickel-based superconductors has progressed from infinite-layer LaNiO$_2$ to finite-layer La$_{6}$Ni$_{5}$O$_{12}$, and most recently to the Ruddlesden-Popper-phase La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ discovered under pressure $\sim$16\,GPa, the system exhibits the onset of superconductivity at approximately $\sim$80\,K. Unlike the $d$-wave superconductivity driven by the nearly half-filled $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in finite- and infinite-layers nickelates, the Ni-$d_{z^2}$ and O-2$p$ orbitals contribute significantly to the low energy states and potentially to the superconducting electron pairing mechanism. Employing density functional calculations and multi-orbital multi-atom Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster exact diagonalization including local exchange and coulomb interactions, we delve into the pressure dependent electronic structure of the Ni$_2$O$_9$ cluster. We find that several possible charge and spin ordering states are nearly degenerate at ambient pressure but become strongly mixed leading to a more homogeneous phase at high pressure. The various possible spin states and the exchange and superexchange mechanisms are quantified via the involvement of the Ni-$3d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals, the apical bridging O $2p_z$ orbitals, and the orbitals involved in the formation of local Zhang-Rice singlet like states. We note that the energy difference between the charge (CDW)/spin (SDW) density wave states and the uniform high pressure phase is about 10 meV in concordance with phase transition temperatures found experimentally at ambient pressure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a coupling element based on a symmetric superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) and show that it mediates a two-photon interaction. This and other inductive interactions due to the SQUID can be switched off in situ. We derive the system Hamiltonian for coupled resonator and rf SQUID. The rf SQUID dwells in the vicinity of its metastable well holding a number of energy states and acts as an artificial atom. We discuss how the Josephson symmetry breaks owing to magnetic fields in the superconducting loops. We assess that the two-photon coupling strength reaches 18 MHz which can exceed the single-photon capacitive interaction in the coupler.</description>

      <title>Bypassing the lattice BCS-BEC crossover in strongly correlated superconductors: resilient coherence from multiorbital physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.09063v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity emerges from the spatial coherence of a macroscopic condensate of Cooper pairs. Increasingly strong binding and localization of electrons into these pairs compromises the condensate's phase stiffness, thereby limiting critical temperatures -- a phenomenon known as the BCS-BEC crossover in lattice systems. In this study, we demonstrate enhanced superconductivity in a multiorbital model of alkali-doped fullerides (A$_3$C$_{60}$) that goes beyond the limits of the lattice BCS-BEC crossover. We identify that the interplay of strong correlations and multiorbital effects results in a localized superconducting state characterized by a short coherence length but robust stiffness and a domeless rise in critical temperature with increasing pairing interaction. To derive these insights, we introduce a new theoretical framework allowing us to calculate the fundamental length scales of superconductors, namely the coherence length ($\xi_0$) and the London penetration depth ($\lambda_{\mathrm{L}}$), even in presence of strong electron correlations.</description>

      <title>Facile synthesis of palladium hydride via ionic gate-driven protonation using a deep eutectic solvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Developing novel protocols for hydrogen (H) loading is crucial for furthering the investigation of hydrides as potential high-temperature superconductors at lower pressures compared to recent discoveries. Ionic gating-induced protonation (IGP) has emerged as a promising technique for H loading due to its inherent simplicity, but it can be limited in the maximum density of injected H when ionic liquids are used as a gating medium. Additionally, most ionic liquids are limited by high production costs, complex synthesis, and potential toxicity. Here, we demonstrate that large H concentrations can be successfully injected in both palladium (Pd) bulk foils and thin films (up to a stoichiometry PdH$_{0.89}$) by using a deep eutectic solvent (DES) choline chloride-glycerol 1:3 as gate electrolyte and applying gate voltages in excess of the cathodic stability limit. The attained H concentrations are large enough to induce superconductivity in Pd, albeit with an incomplete resistive transition which suggests a strongly inhomogeneous H incorporation in the Pd matrix. This DES-based IGP protocol can be used as a guideline for maximizing H loading in different materials, although specific details of the applied voltage profile might require adjustments based on the material under investigation.</description>
